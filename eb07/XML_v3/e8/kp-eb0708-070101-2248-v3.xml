                    the British empire, we shall divide the subject into three Parts; the first
                    comprehending the History of England, the second the Statistics of that country,
                    and the third some account of its Government and Laws.</p>
                <p>PART I.</p>
                <p>HISTORY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> history of England, till the period of the Saxon
                    Conquest, has been fully treated of in the first chapter of the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Britain.</hi> After that event the country relapsed into a
                    state of obscure barbarism, nearly as great as that from which it had been
                    rescued by the Romans. The provincial Britons had profited by their intercourse
                    with that great people. From the latter they had learned many of the arts of
                    civilized life, and during the period of their subjugation they had erected a
                    considerable number of cities, towns, and villages; but these were subsequently
                    levelled with the ground by barbarian invaders, and the natives were frequently
                    involved in the same ruin with their habitations. We are informed by one
                    historian that a mighty conflagration began on the western coast, and gradually
                    extended itself over the whole island. To escape from the exterminating swords
                    of the Saxons, the Britons sought refuge in their native fastnesses; and thus
                    the spark of civilization which had been struck out amongst them, and which, in
                    more auspicious circumstances, might have kindled into a generous flame, was
                    totally extinguished.</p>
                <p>About the year 700, the island of Great Britain was divided into no fewer than
                    fifteen sovereignties. Of these, eight were Saxon; but the union of the two
                    Northumbrian principalities reduced the number to seven; and from this
                    circumstance, as well as from some vague alliance amongst these petty states,
                    historians have designated the whole by the name of the Heptarchy. They ruled
                    over a considerable portion of England, and whilst they waged a fierce and
                    endless war with every other kingdom in the island, they also maintained amongst
                    themselves a continual struggle for the superiority. It would appear that one
                    state usually exercised an undefined power over all the others; and the prince
                    who possessed this equivocal ascendency had the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bretwalda,</hi> or wielder of the Britons, bestowed upon him. The history of
                    this period is not characterized by any event which would lead us to take an
                    interest in the fluctuating fortunes of the various states. Our information
                    relating to the earliest portion of the Saxon rule is also scanty; but what we
                    do possess is not of such a nature as to awaken any feelings of regret that more
                    minute particulars have not been transmitted to us. Details of the shedding of
                    kindred blood, and acts of oppression, treachery, and cruelty, exercised towards
                    the natives by the fierce invaders of their soil, are not calculated to interest
                    human feelings. The re-introduction of Christianity, however, in some degree
                    alleviated the darkness of the picture. The exact date of its first appearance
                    in Britain is uncertain, but it had made some progress before the close of the
                    second century. It disappeared however, with the other traces of civilization,
                    when the Saxons commenced their devastations. It was in the year 596 that
                    Gregory the Great sent over St Augustin, with forty other missionaries, to
                    convert the Saxons; and their arrival in Kent marks a new era in its history,
                    and probably in that of the country. At this period Kent was governed by
                    Ethe-bert, an able and powerful monarch, and the third who bore the title of
                    Bretwalda. He received kindly the deputies of Rome, and became a convert to
                    their doctrine; an example which his subjects were not slow in following. From
                    this period the spread of the Christian faith over the island appears to have
                    been rapid; for we find that in about a century after the arrival of St Augustin
                    it was professed and believed throughout Anglo-Saxon Britain. That it conferred
                    many temporal benefits upon the community, cannot be doubted. But, however its
                    divine precepts may have influenced the conduct and ameliorated the lot of
                    individuals, crimes upon a great scale continued to be perpetrated as formerly.
                    It may have mitigated the horrors of war, but battle followed on battle with as
                    uniform a succession, and native blood flowed as freely, as heretofore. The
                    continual struggle amongst the Anglo-Saxon principalities for the supremacy was
                    however fast coming to a crisis. It is evident that such a state of affairs
                    could not continue for any length of time, and that it must, necessarily end in
                    the establishment of a regular hereditary magistracy in the island. This took
                    place partially at the beginning of the eighth century, in the person of Egbert,
                    king of Wessex, who was a lineal descendant, and the only surviving prince, of
                    the house of Cerdic, the founder of that kingdom. The great talents which he
                    early exhibited had given offence to Brihtric, king of Wessex, who, jealous of
                    his popularity, projected his destruction. Egbert, however, eluded his
                    vengeance, and fled for protection to Offa, king of Mercia, a monarch
                    illustrious for the talents he displayed and the prosperity he enjoyed, but
                    whose name is stained with perfidy and blood. Thither the vindictive Brihtric
                    pursued the youthful fugitive, who was finally compelled to cross the channel
                    and to seek shelter beneath the broad shield of the victorious Charlemagne.
                    France, governed by that renowned sovereign, excelled all the states of the West
                    in civilization and the arts of government, as well as those of war. Trained in
                    such a school, therefore, and early disciplined by adversity, he was undergoing
                    an admirable probation for wielding with judgment and moderation the perilous
                    sceptre which was destined to be transferred into his hands. The death of
                    Brihtric, who perished by the machinations of his queen, recalled the fugitive
                    from his exile. In Wessex the claim of Egbert was at once acknowledged, while
                    his accession to the throne of his celebrated ancestor, an event highly popular
                    in itself, was ennobled by a victory, the omen of many a future triumph.</p>
                <p>At this period the island, though nominally under a hexarchy, was rapidly verging
                    to a triarchy, from several of the smaller states becoming gradually blended and
                    identified with their more powerful neighbours. Wessex had been enlarged by the
                    incorporation of Sussex; and various favourable circumstances conspired to
                    concentrate in the hands of Egbert a well-organized power, which he was prepared
                    to wield when summoned by any great emergency. For several years, however, after
                    his accession to the throne, his sword remained in its sheath; and this
                    propitious<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332261" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2261-0702"/>
                    period of tranquillity afforded him an opportunity of turning his undivided
                    attention to the affairs of government. His administration was as mild as it
                    appears to have been politic; circumstances which completed the attachment of
                    liis subjects, and consolidated his growing strength. It was upon the
                    unfortunate Britons of the west that he first made trial of his military
                    prowess. About the year 809 the struggle between him and the natives commenced.
                    The latter made a strenuous but unavailing resistance; and Egbert carried the
                    havoc of war and the flames of destruction from the east to the west. In a few
                    years the greater part of modern Wales, as well as the people who occupied the
                    northern shore of the estuary of the Severn, acknowledged his authority. The
                    king of Mercia, whose strength had been augmented by the appropriation of the
                    petty sovereignties of Kent, Essex, and East Anglia, was now the only rival for
                    the supreme authority whom Egbert had to fear or to contend withal. Their power
                    was nearly equally balanced, for what Wessex wanted in numerical force was
                    compensated by discipline and skill. War had now become inevitable; neither
                    would brook a superior, and only one Bretwalda could be acknowledged. The
                    conflict began, therefore, and was speedily brought to a termination. In an
                    obstinate and bloody battle the king of Mercia was totally defeated, and Egbert
                    became lord of the ascendant. State after state was annexed to Wessex; Mercia
                    was invaded and subdued; and in nineteen years after he had first drawn the
                    sword, Egbert was acknowledged over the greater part of the island as the eighth
                    Bretwalda.</p>
                <p>The authority of Egbert, however, still continued doubtful; and the Anglo-Saxon
                    power was as yet very far from being consolidated. The fortunes and immunities
                    of those composing the several states were not dependent upon one common
                    legislature; and in regard to the details of government, the whole
                    principalities remained as distinct from each other as before. Wales still
                    continued to annoy him; and it was not until he had marched an army to Snowden
                    that North Wales quietly submitted to that of the Saxon Bretwalda. But new and
                    more formidable enemies than any he had yet encountered had begun to threaten
                    England, and trouble the tranquillity which it in some measure enjoyed. These
                    were Scandinavians, recognised in France by the name of Normans, and in England
                    by that of Danes. Familiarized, from their maritime situation, to the dangers of
                    the ocean, this people, like the Saxons of old, spent the greater portion of
                    their time upon its waves. A pernicious law of succession, which consigned the
                    whole patrimony to the eldest son, drove the younger branches of families to
                    seek their fortunes by means of their ships and their swords. It was only in
                    this manner that they could acquire riches and renown; and such pursuits were
                    peculiarly agreeable to a people who unhappily preferred the acquisitions of
                    rapine to the fruits of laborious industry. It was the custom of these pirates
                    to set sail for some distant province in squadrons, under the command of
                    chieftains called <hi rend="italic">Vihingr,</hi> or Sea-Kings. After pillaging
                    the coast where they landed, they collected the spoil and returned to their own
                    country, where they disencumbered themselves of their booty and prepared for
                    fresh expeditions. Three descents upon England are recorded as having taken
                    place in the eighth century, but these attempts produced no permanent alarm.
                    Towards the termination of Egbert’s reign, however, the numbers of the pirates
                    greatly increased, whilst their visits were annually renewed; and for two
                    centuries to come the country was destined to be a prey to these fierce and
                    fearless invaders.</p>
                <p>After making several successful inroads into various parts of England, in 835
                    they landed on the coast of Cornwall, where they succeeded in seducing the
                    Britons from their allegiance. The king of Wessex met the united forces of the
                    enemy at Hengstone Hill, and gained <hi rend="italic">a</hi> bloody but decisive
                    victory, which restored the glory of his arms. This was the last exploit of
                    Egbert, who died the year following, after a reign as prosperous as it was long,
                    and which, allowing something for the condition of society at the period, may
                    also be termed glorious.</p>
                <p>Ethelwolf succeeded his father on the throne of Wessex; but an unfortunate
                    arrangement, by which the former king bequeathed all his dominions except Wessex
                    to a younger son, greatly weakened the power of his successor, and lessened the
                    influence of the Bretwalda. Ethelwolf had been a monk, and appears to have been
                    better adapted for the cloister which he had left than the throne which he now
                    ascended. The history of his reign presents little of interest or variety. It is
                    merely an account of the atrocities of the Danes, who made repeated descents
                    upon England, laying waste the country, plundering towns, and despoiling the
                    rich monasteries, where treasure was supposed to have been accumulated. No
                    defeat, however signal and decisive for the time, vγas capable of permanently
                    expelling them from the island; and although routed and compelled to flee for
                    shelter to their ships one year, they returned the next with persevering
                    audacity. In the meanwhile Ethelwolf found leisure to perform a pilgrimage to
                    Rome; and in passing through France on his journey homewards, he espoused Judith
                    the daughter of Charles the Bald, king of the Franks. But he was not permitted
                    to enjoy undisturbed domestic tranquillity. On his return to England he found
                    his son Ethelbald at the head of a formidable conspiracy, which threatened him
                    with deposition and exile. The two parties, however, came without bloodshed to
                    terms of accommodation. It was agreed that Ethelwolf should possess the eastern
                    states appertaining to Wessex, whilst the kingdom of Wessex proper, which
                    belonged of right to the head of the family, should be enjoyed by Ethelbald,
                    but, it would appear, with a nominal subjection to his father. Ethelwolf
                    survived these arrangements only a few years, having died in 858.</p>
                <p>After his demise Ethelbald continued to occupy the throne of Wessex; whilst
                    Ethelbert, a younger brother, succeeded to the government which had been left
                    vacant by the death of his father; but both these princes died in a few years,
                    and left their thrones to their brother Ethelred, who assumed the sceptre at a
                    most unpropitious period. Not only was the kingdom divided against itself, but
                    the Danes, acting now in a well-organized confederacy, and terrible from their
                    numbers as well as from the frequency of their inroads, threatened the total
                    annihilation of the Saxon dynasty and the subjugation of the island. In the
                    reign of Ethelred ancient chroniclers present us with little else than accounts
                    of battles fought and towns sacked, prolonged by all the sickening minutiae of
                    rapine and bloodshed. The conflicts were numerous and sanguinary; and in one of
                    these, which took place at Merton in the year 870, the king received a wound of
                    which he soon afterwards died.</p>
                <p>By the death of Ethelred the throne of Wessex devolved upon Alfred, the fifth and
                    favourite son of Ethelwolf. As an account of this extraordinary individual has
                    already been given under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Alfred,</hi> it is
                    unnecessary to recapitulate the events of his life. He was succeeded by his son
                    Edward, who ascended what may now almost be termed the throne of England, in the
                    year 901. Alfred had been called to the crown in preference to the children of
                    his elder brother, who were considered at the time as too young to be entrusted
                    with the government. Their pretensions being also set aside at his death,
                    Ethelwold, one of the rejected princes, attempted by violence to seize hold of
                    the royal authority. He formed an alliance with <pb break="no"

                    of Edward; but in a battle with the men of Kent he met his fate, and the island
                    was once more rescued from a destructive competition for the crown.</p>
                <p>Previously to this event the Danes had contrived, by a union with some of the
                    disaffected provinces, to obtain a kind of permanent footing in the country.
                    They possessed the north of England from the Humber to the Tweed, and the
                    eastern districts from the Ouse to the sea. Emboldened by their strength, they
                    invaded Mercia, but were met by Edward, who obtained over them a decisive
                    victory, which effectually restored his supremacy. The most remarkable
                    individual after Edward was his sister Ethel-fleda, upon whom the mantle of
                    Alfred seems to have descended. She governed Mercia, and vigorously seconded her
                    brother in fortifying the country against the common enemy. Upon her death in
                    920 the Anglo-Saxon monarchy received additional security from the final
                    incorporation of Mercia with Wessex. After various successes over his northern
                    and other enemies, Edward the elder expired at Farrington in Berkshire, in the
                    year 924. This monarch would appear to greater advantage were he not viewed in
                    such close proximity to Alfred the Great, the brilliancy of whose reign was
                    calculated to eclipse that of his successor, had the latter been even a greater
                    man than he actually was. Edward, however, was a great man, and every way worthy
                    to wield the sceptre of his father, which he did with uncommon judgment and
                    success.</p>
                <p>He was succeeded by his son Athelstane, whom historians, on the faith of an old
                    song, are in the habit of styling illegitimate; but a contemporary poetess has
                    recognised his mother as the partner of Edward’s throne, a circumstance which
                    fairly balances the former authority. There is one argument in favour of his
                    legitimacy, which, as far as we are aware, has been overlooked; it is the
                    exceeding partiality evinced towards him by his grandfather Alfred. It seems
                    improbable that an individual, whose moral rectitude and ardent piety were so
                    conspicuous as those of Alfred, should have singled out as his especial
                    favourite one whose birth was a public scandal; that he should also have
                    invested him with the insignia of knighthood whilst yet a child, and looked upon
                    him as the future hope of Britain, more especially as, supposing the youth to
                    have been a natural son, the legitimate children of his father had a preferable
                    right to the throne. Viewing the matter in this light, the truth of the
                    hypothesis that Athelstane was the fruit of a union sanctioned by law and
                    religion appears highly probable, even allowing that the distinction of natural
                    from legitimate children was at that period somewhat faint. It does not appear
                    to have been so in the mind of Alfred the Great.</p>
                <p>Athelstane was thirty years of age when his father expired; and Mercia
                    immediately, and Wessex shortly afterwards, recognised him as king. Opposition
                    was, however, experienced in other quarters; but he ultimately succeeded in
                    seating himself firmly upon the throne, and fully justified the early popularity
                    he enjoyed with his grandfather. In the person of Athelstane the Anglo-Saxon
                    sovereign became a character of dignity and consequence in Europe. His
                    connections with the most respectable potentates on the Continent gave to his
                    reign a political importance, and he is moreover entitled to be considered as
                    the first monarch of England.</p>
                <p>The sovereignty of the whole island appears to have been the object of
                    Athelstane’s ambition. In his military enterprises he was completely successful,
                    and compelled the princes of the Scots, Cambrians, and Britons, to swear fealty
                    to him, in the same manner as the Saxon vassal was accustomed to swear to his
                    lord. But his prosperity was interrupted by a powerful confederacy formed
                    against him, which threatened not only to emancipate Northumbria from his
                    authority, but even to overwhelm his hereditary government. The confederates
                    were Constantine king of the Scots, and Anlaff the son of Sigtryg or Sihtric,
                    who was king of Northumbria at the time of Athelstane’s accession. Anlaff had
                    received the hand of Athelstane’s sister; but he drove her from his court, for
                    which barbarous conduct the Anglo-Saxon monarch stripped him of his kingdom and
                    ejected him from the island. Anlaff had fled to Ireland, whence he returned with
                    a large fleet, in order to retaliate the insult of his expulsion. The remaining
                    malcontents were the Welsh princes who had been humbled into submission, the
                    Danes who inhabited the eastern coast from Tweed to Thames, the petty states of
                    Cambria, and a constantly increasing host of lawless pirates and freebooters
                    from Scandinavia.</p>
                <p>Athelstane prepared with firmness and energy to meet the storm which threatened
                    him with destruction. The armies met at Brunanburgh in Northumbria, and a battle
                    was∙fought, celebrated in Saxon and Scandinavian poetry. The confederates were
                    routed with great slaughter, and Anlaft" and Constantine effected their escape
                    with great difficulty. So complete was the overthrow, and so decisive the
                    victory, that the remainder of Athelstane’s reign was undisturbed by the
                    rebellion of his subjects or the invasion of a foreign enemy. The throne of his
                    ancestors was now effectually secured to him; and the Britons were so completely
                    humbled, that to him belongs the glory of having been the founder of the English
                    monarchy. The fame of his accomplishments, his talents, and his successes, was
                    not confined to the insulated kingdom which he governed; it extended throughout
                    all Christendom. With several foreign courts he maintained a friendly
                    correspondence; and three princes, who afterwards became eminent in Europe, were
                    fostered under his care, and restored by his aid or influence. These were Haco
                    of Norway, Alan of Bretagne, and the son of his sister, Louis d’Ou-tremer, so
                    called from his residence in England. A concern in the death of a brother named
                    Edwin is generally ascribed to him, but the story is somewhat doubtful; and if
                    the other events of Athelstane’s life, his public services and private virtues,
                    be allowed to have any influence upon our judgment, it must be pronounced as
                    improbable. Athelstane died in the year 940, regretted by his subjects, amongst
                    whom he was revered as a prince alike distinguished for wisdom, justice, and
                    benevolence.</p>
                <p>Having left no issue, he was succeeded by his brother Edmund, who perished by the
                    dagger of an assassin six years afterwards. The life of this king is not
                    characterized by any events of importance. He was succeeded by his brother
                    Edred, whose reign was short, and distinguished by no remarkable circumstance,
                    except the complete incorporation of Northumbria with the rest of the
                    Anglo-Saxon kingdom.</p>
                <p>Edred died in 955, and left the throne to Edwin, who is usually styled Edwy, the
                    eldest son of Edmund the Elder. The name of this monarch is intimately connected
                    with that of the celebrated Dunstan, abbot of Glastonbury. The life of that
                    individual having been already given under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Dunstan,</hi> we shall only mention here a few circumstances which are
                    indispensably necessary to the complete chain of historical events. The reign of
                    his uncle Edred had been looked upon by Edwy as a usurpation, and when he
                    himself ascended the throne, the counsellors of the former monarch became the
                    objects of his antipathy. He discarded them altogether, and surrounded himself
                    with a host of young courtiers, more ready to emulate the vices of their master
                    than to suggest prudent measures of government. At their instigation Edwy
                    imposed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332287" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2287-0704"/>unjust
                    taxes upon his subjects, despoiled the clergy, and committed other unseemly
                    acts. Dunstan, having been one of the leading advisers of Edred, was most
                    probably obnoxious to the young king; and at his coronation a circumstance
                    occurred which brought the hostile parties immediately into collision. On that
                    day Edwin, after the ceremonjs withdrew from the festive board at which the
                    nobles and clergy were regaling themselves, and retired to his own apartments.
                    This indecorous act appears to have displeased the assembly; and Odo, archbishop
                    of Canterbury, deputed Dunstan and another individual to bring back the king to
                    join in their carousals. Dunstan penetrated into the private apartments of his
                    sovereign, whom he found in company with Ethelgiva or Elgiva, his wife or
                    mistress; the mother of the latter was also present. The two deputies forcibly
                    tore the king from the company of the ladies, and brought him back to that of
                    the nobles. This daring and insolent conduct of the monk towards the
                    newly-consecrated monarch drew down upon him the royal vengeance. At the
                    instigation of Elgiva, Dunstan was deprived of his honours, and condemned to
                    exile. During his absence, Odo contrived to take Elgiva from her husband’s
                    residence, and send her a prisoner to Ireland, where her face was branded with
                    red-hot irons, for the purpose of obliterating her charms; but in vain. They
                    revived with the healing of the wounds; but on her return to England she was
                    pursued by the opposite party, who falling in with her at Gloucester, actually
                    hamstrung the unfortunate fair one. In a few days death released her from the
                    vengeance of her enemies and from her own sufferings.<note anchored="true"

                    sanction of the Archbishop of Canterbury; and it is impossible to implicate
                    Dunstan in the guilt, for he was in Flanders at the time. The deed, however, was
                    done by the adherents, and praised by the encomiasts, of the
                    archbishop.</p></note> In the meanwhile a conspiracy was formed against the now
                    unpopular Edwy; and at the head of it was his brother Edgar, who, supported by
                    the Northumbrians and Mercians, drove the unfortunate monarch beyond the Thames.
                    His sufferings and humiliation, however, were of short duration, for he died in
                    959, ere he had attained the full age of manhood. By some historians he is said
                    to have been assassinated; others state that he pined to death for the loss of
                    his throne, and his Elgiva, whom he tenderly loved; but all agree that his
                    demise was as miserable as it was premature. His youth was the source of all his
                    calamities, for it seems certain that he was only sixteen or seventeen years of
                    age when he assumed the sceptre. He had also the misfortune to live at a very
                    critical period. It was the commencement of that struggle between seculars and
                    regulars which was to be maintained for many centuries thereafter. The intrusion
                    of Dunstan into the king’s private chamber was the earnest of many a bold step
                    upon the part of the clergy. It is thus memorable as being one of the earliest
                    instances in our history, of the putting forth of that overwhelming strength
                    with which the church of Rome was armed, and which was destined ere long to
                    exercise so preponderating an influence over the political affairs of every
                    court in Christendom, whose haughtiest monarchs were soon taught to tremble at
                    the thunder of the Vatican.</p>
                <p>The death of Edwin put his brother and rival Edgar in peaceable possession of the
                    whole Anglo-Saxon territory. His reign was tranquil, neither foreign enemy nor
                    domestic broils having interrupted its quiet, so that posterity has styled him
                    “the peaceful.” The only event of a warlike character ascribed to him is an
                    invasion of Wales. In his personal character he was distinguished alike for his
                    religious zeal and for his licentiousness. A few facts relating to each of these
                    may be stated here. He espoused the cause of the monks, and, during the sixteen
                    years of his reign, erected a vast number of Benedictine monasteries. He
                    recalled Dunstan from exile, placed the bold saint at his right hand as chief
                    counsellor, and conferred upon him the see of Canterbury. In this situation that
                    celebrated ecclesiastic prosecuted his ambitious schemes connected with the
                    order to which he belonged with redoubled vigour. He expelled the clergy from
                    the monasteries, and supplied their places with Benedictines, making the rule of
                    their founder everywhere predominant throughout the nation.</p>
                <p>We now find the church so intimately mixed up with political affairs, that some
                    account of it is necessary for the elucidation of history. Although religious
                    individuals had been collected in monasteries from the period of Augustin’s
                    landing in Kent, yet the order of Benedictines seems to be the most ancient
                    example of monastic rule. Each congregation of recluses lived according to its
                    own internal regulations, nor were the several monasteries consolidated into one
                    community before the time of Dunstan. The Scottish or Irish, the Pictish and
                    British churches, though in communion with Rome, were still independent of the
                    papal see; and it was the object of the popes to suppress this independence of
                    the different national churches; a cause which was warmly espoused by Dunstan.
                    His policy was to enforce clerical celibacy; to expel at least all the married
                    clergy from canonries and prebends in cathedrals, in order to make way for
                    Benedictines; and to reduce all monasteries to the rule of the founder of that
                    order. The opposition he encountered was formidable, and the cause of the clergy
                    was espoused by the laity. Amongst the latter the secular priests found many
                    powerful partizans, and the schisms of the church at last degenerated into
                    factions amongst the people. But Dunstan was impetuous, and determined to carry
                    through the reformation which he had begun, for he looked upon himself in the
                    light of a reformer; and although the extension of his own power and that of his
                    order may have been so blended with his zeal for the service of God as to
                    deceive even himself, yet there seems no reason to doubt his sincerity. That
                    there were many clerical abuses to be corrected, is consistent with the history
                    of religion in all ages. The Danish invasions, and other national calamities,
                    dispersed the clergy amongst the laity, with whose vices they doubtless became
                    contaminated. The necessities of his situation compelled the prelate to be a
                    statesman and an intriguer. He made some progress during the reign of Edred; in
                    that of Edwy we have seen him checked; but in the present one, invested with the
                    highest ecclesiastical dignities, and backed by the power of his sovereign, he
                    appears before us under auspices which enabled him to carry his loftiest
                    projects into execution. And he was not slow in seizing the opportunity. Not
                    content with the ordinary engines of intrigue and supple policy, he drew upon
                    the superstitious feelings of the time, and arrogated to himself divine
                    intuition and the power of working miracles. He succeeded in deceiving that
                    unenlightened age, and perhaps also himself.</p>
                <p>The foregoing remarks may afford a key to some of the more prominent events of
                    Edgar’s reign. A national synod was held, at which the king publicly expressed
                    his sentiments in favour of the Benedictine cause. It followed as a consequence
                    of this, that the unfortunate seculars were ejected if they refused to comply
                    with the enactments made by Dunstan and his party, under the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332300" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2300-0705"/>sanction of the sovereign;
                    whilst monks were everywhere received with honour, and the erection of
                    monasteries was for a time a royal mania. During the sixteen years of his reign
                    Edgar built no less than forty-eight of these establishments.</p>
                <p>In the midst of all this holy zeal, however, he found leisure for the indulgence
                    of his licentious appetites. On one occasion he violently carried off a young
                    lady educated in a convent, and made her his concubine. For this offence he was
                    reproved by Dunstan, and compelled to do penance during seven years; but the
                    mortifications imposed were not of a very severe character. His second marriage
                    was connected with circumstances of a very tragical nature. The beauty of a
                    young and noble lady having been praised to him, he commissioned Ethelwold, a
                    favourite minister, to visit her residence, and report upon her charms. The
                    deputy was himself captivated with the lady. He represented her in an
                    unfavourable light to his sovereign, and married her himself; but Edgar, not
                    being satisfied with the report, paid a personal visit to Elfrida, and,

                    type="authorial"><p>Dr Lingard, in his History of England, vol. i. p. 333,
                    states that he is disposed to doubt this tale as improbable. “Malmesbury,” says
                    the learned and able historian, “on the faith of an ancient ballad, has
                    transmitted to us a story probably invented by his (the king’s) enemies.” The
                    story may possibly have been invented by his enemies, but where is the evidence,
                    direct or indirect, that this was the case? Dr Lingard goes on to say, “it is
                    improbable in itself, and supported by questionable evidence.” Now, where lies
                    the improbability? The tragical character of the transaction is in perfect
                    keeping with that of the times in which it was committed; and as for the
                    perpetrator himself, does not the abuse of the nun prove that, in order to
                    gratify his unhallowed desires, even the religion, for the propagation of which
                    he displayed such unbounded zeal, offered no impediment. Was the law of nature
                    with regard to moral evil stronger in his mind than that which religion had
                    imposed? This is much to be doubted. Nay, it may be surmised that the erection
                    of so many monasteries was a voluntary penance which his conscience dictated him
                    to perform, in extenuation of such crimes as those that are laid to his charge.
                    'The evidence is also said to be questionable; but if historians, and the
                    learned Doctor along with the rest, unhesitatingly embody as historical facts
                    the events and transactions related in similar compositions, we see no reason
                    for making an exception with respect to the legend before us, because it happens
                    to stand in the way of a favourite hypothesis. If we take one we must take all,
                    exceptions being made where there is direct contradiction by more authentic
                    evidence, which is not the case in the present instance. Sir James Mackintosh
                    observes, “William of Malmesbury, who might have known the counsellors of Edward
                    the Confessor, relates the incident on the authority (not to be despised) of a
                    Saxon song. The same story is told by a later chronicler called Brompton {Dec.
                    Scrip. 865), at great length, and with particulars characteristic of barbaric
                    manners.”</p></note></p>
                <p>In extenuation of these delinquencies, he has been allowed the honourable
                    distinction of having warmly patronized trade with foreigners. His commuting the
                    tribute from Wales into three hundred wolves’ heads, and his reformation of the
                    coinage, also redound to his credit. By his orders a numerous fleet constantly
                    guarded the kingdom from invasion, and he regularly visited his provinces in
                    order to countenance the execution of the laws. His reign was glorious, and he
                    seems to have converted his prosperity into ostentatious pomp. It is stated that
                    eight kings, amongst whom were Kenneth of Scotland, and his son Malcolm of
                    Cimbria, did him homage by rowing his barge down the river Dee.</p>
                <p>Edgar died in 975, in the thirty-second year of his age, and was succeeded by
                    Edward, surnamed the Martyr, his eldest son. A younger brother, Ethelred, by
                    Elfrida, disputed the crown with Edward; but the latter was finally established
                    upon the throne through the influence of Dunstan. His reign was chiefly occupied
                    with disputes between the two clerical systems before mentioned, Elfrida having,
                    on account of her son Ethelred, espoused the cause of the seculars, in
                    opposition to Dunstan, who headed the regulars, and who was also the means of
                    supplanting her son. The monks gained a complete victory over the seculars, who
                    were now totally expelled from their convents. During this reign occurred that
                    tragical circumstance which has afforded modern historians an opportunity of
                    accusing the primate of murder. A council of nobles had been summoned to meet at
                    Caine. During the proceedings, and just as the wily Dunstan had pronounced these
                    words, “I confess I am unwilling to be overcome; I commit the cause of the
                    church to the decision of God,” the floor fell instantly down, and numbers of
                    his opponents were killed and wounded. The primate, and probably his partizans,
                    escaped unhurt, a circumstance which can only be accounted for by supposing that
                    their seat remained unmoved. Some historians charge Dunstan with having secretly
                    loosened the floor from the walls, and affirm that during the debate the
                    temporary props which supported it were withdrawn according to his directions.
                    This is very improbable; but there can be little doubt that he interpreted the
                    occurrence as a divine judgment upon his enemies, and thus wrought upon the
                    prejudices of that superstitious age. Several heinous crimes are laid to the
                    charge of the queen dowager, but the last was the darkest and most atrocious of
                    all. Edward, in one of his hunting excursions, visited Corfe Castle, in
                    Dorsetshire, where Elfrida resided with her son Ethelred. He was received with
                    the utmost cordiality, and invited to enter the castle, but declined, requesting
                    at the same time to see his brother, and also the favour of some refreshment.
                    Whilst in the act of raising a cup of wine to his lips, he was mortally stabbed
                    in the back by the orders of his stepmother. On account of his violent death he
                    has been surnamed the Martyr.</p>
                <p>Edward was succeeded in 978 by Ethelred, the unconscious cause of his untimely
                    fate. When the latter attained the crown he was only in his boyhood, and
                    throughout a long life he never rose above it. This is one of those reigns which
                    it is painful to narrate. It was the saddest which the descendants of Alfred yet
                    had seen, and presents a strong contrast to that of his father. Edward compelled
                    kings to be his watermen. His son by Elfrida became the sport of traitors; and
                    having five times purchased his crown from the roving Danes, he was forced at
                    last to make an ignominious surrender of it to a foreign invader.</p>
                <p>For more than a century the Northmen had formed the chief part of the population
                    of Northumberland and East Anglia, and they now stretched their power to the
                    utmost in order to place one of their chiefs upon the Saxon throne. In 980, and
                    for ten years thereafter, England was insulted by a series of inroads, which,
                    although unimportant of themselves, were calculated to excite some alarm amongst
                    the people, when the latter contemplated on the one hand the power and audacity
                    of the Danes, and on the other a pusillanimous monarch and an unguarded country.
                    But these petty aggressions were followed, in 991, by the appearance of a
                    formidable armament upon the English coast. The invaders advanced without
                    opposition as far as Malden, where they gained a victory, and their retreat was
                    disgracefully purchased by a bribe often thousand pounds. Repeatedly afterwards
                    did the Northmen play the same game, and Ethelred make the same debasing
                    submission, by purchasing a momentary respite from their ravages. But the very
                    means which were employed to rid the kingdom of these invaders one year, insured
                    their return the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332313"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2313-0706"/>next. Treason, famine, and disease, also
                    aggravated the calamities which overwhelmed the nation. Amongst the instances of
                    defection, that of Alfric, earl of Mercia, demands particular attention. On
                    account of his misconduct he had been deprived of his government, but had
                    recovered it again through the influence of his friends. In 992, a meeting of
                    the witenagemote took place at London, where it was resolved to put the kingdom
                    in a posture of defence, by constructing a powerful fleet, and manning it with
                    picked men. This was accordingly done, and the command of it conferred upon
                    Alfric, with another nobleman and two prelates. Their commission was to surprise
                    the Danes at some part where they could be surrounded; but this judicious scheme
                    was foiled by the treachery of the commander, who not only gave the Danes notice
                    of the intentions of the English, but consummated his perfidy by secretly
                    joining them. He urged an immediate flight; but in the pursuit his vessel was
                    taken, though the traitor himself escaped. The king revenged himself upon
                    Alfric, by ordering his son Algar to be deprived of his eyes; an act as
                    barbarous as it was useless.</p>
                <p>This bold exertion on the part of the invaded compelled the Danes to transfer
                    their arms from the south to the north of England, wdιere they extended their
                    ravages; but in 994 appeared two new and more powerful chieftains, Sweyn, king
                    of Denmark, and Olave, king of Norway. With ninety-four ships they sailed up the
                    Thames, and, although repulsed at London, they succeeded in ravaging several
                    counties. But another humiliating subsidy redeemed England from their grasp;
                    and, what is more astonishing still, Olave was honourably received at the court
                    of Ethelred, where he pledged his word never to molest England more. This
                    promise is only remarkable inasmuch as it was faithfully kept. The army of his
                    companion Sweyn, however, continued to occupy the country, to which in course of
                    time it became almost naturalized. That it should remain inactive was not to be
                    expected; but that with impunity it should have been allowed to despoil
                    provinces, displays a want of firmness, courage, and national spirit, which
                    seems unnatural to the island, and can only be accounted for by supposing the
                    existence of a weakness almost amounting to imbecility in the sovereign or his
                    counsellors.</p>
                <p>In 1002, Ethelred having lost his first wife, who bore him ten children, married
                    a Norman princess, who assumed the name of Elgiva. The same year became
                    memorable in the history of England for the perpetration of a crime of as black
                    a dye as ever darkened the annals of any people. This wicked act, which rose out
                    of a mischievous policy, is known by the name of the Massacre of the Danes. On
                    the 13th of November, the festival of St Bride, the unsuspecting Northmen, with
                    their wives, children, and all belonging to them, were cruelly put to death by a
                    royal warrant. The details of this fearful transaction are too horrible to be
                    related. Suffice it to say, that no place, however sacred, saved the victims
                    from their pursuers; and that when they fled to the churches for shelter, they
                    were slaughtered in crowds around the altars. One painful episode is interwoven
                    with this tale of blood. Gunhilda, the sister of Sweyn, king of Denmark, who was
                    wedded to an English earl, saw her husband and children massacred before her
                    eyes, and was herself afterwards beheaded. It is related by all historians, that
                    in the agonies of death she foretold the vengeance which would descend upon the
                    English nation for the barbarous act which it had committed; and the prediction
                    was realized, as we shall hereafter see.</p>
                <p>The calamities of England seemed now to thicken as the atrocities of its ruler
                    grew darker. Common pity for the failings of humanity would lead us to pardon
                    Ethelred’s pusillanimity; but this dark deed has affixed a blot to his scutcheon
                    too deep for time ever to wash away. Sweyn was not slow in revenging the fate of
                    his countrymen; and, through negligence and perfidy on the part of England, he
                    succeeded in ravaging the island, for several years, almost with impunity. In
                    1007, thirty-six thousand pounds of silver abated his thirst of revenge. Two
                    years afterwards the most powerful armament which had yet obeyed the flag of
                    England was collected at Sandwich; but treason again paralyzed its operations.
                    The captains abandoned their vessels, which were steered up the Thames by the
                    mariners. “Thus,” say the annalists, “perished all the hopes of England.” The
                    surrender of sixteen counties, and forty-eight thousand pounds, stayed for a
                    short period the rapacity of the Northmen. The picture which the now fallen and
                    devoted England presents, it is painful to contemplate. Accumulated treasons and
                    defeats had unnerved the courage of the natives; whilst the numerous victories
                    of the Danes had swelled their pride, and inspired them with a preposterous idea
                    of their warlike powers. Many fortified cities withstood all their assaults; but
                    the open country was abandoned to their rapacity. Systematic destruction and
                    spoliation was their principle; and the fields, deserted by the husbandmen,
                    ceased to yield the necessary supplies of food, so that the Danes themselves
                    were compelled to quit the island in search of provisions. Taxation, direct and
                    annual, which must be traced to this period, weighed also upon the energies of
                    the people, and materially increased the now almost universal discontent. In the
                    midst of this ignominious submission and disaffection, it is pleasing to record
                    instances of magnanimity, and painful to reflect that these were so few in
                    number. The Archbishop of Canterbury having been made a prisoner by the Danes,
                    was offered his liberty for a moderate ransom, on condition that he would advise
                    Ethelred to pay them heavy sums of money as a largess. “1 have no money,” he
                    replied, “and I wil, not advise the king to dishonour himself.” Still they
                    persisted; but the dauntless prelate remained unshaken. The barbarians condemned
                    him to death; and he was immediately assailed with bones, horns, and other
                    remains of a feast in which they had been indulging. “Gold, bishop; give us
                    gold,” they exclaimed, as they dragged him forth; but he remained unmoved, and
                    having been felled to the earth with the rude missiles which were showered upon
                    him, he received a mortal stab from the hand of a man whom he had himself
                    baptized.</p>
                <p>Sweyn made his last incursion into the country in 1013. Terrified at the
                    universal disaffection, Ethelred fled at last to Normandy, whence he returned on
                    hearing of Sweyn’s death, which occurred shortly afterwards. The latter was
                    succeeded by his son Canute; for the Danes would now appear to have put in a
                    claim for the sovereignty of the whole country. Etbelred was recalled by the
                    English chiefs, who exacted a promise from him that he would govern with less
                    tyranny than formerly; and pledges were also interchanged between the Danes and
                    English. But a contest soon ensued between the two parties; and although
                    Ethelred succeeded in repeating upon a small scale that system of treacherous
                    massacre for which he had so severely suffered, yet Canute maintained his
                    superiority in open warfare, and took a barbarous revenge upon the hostages in
                    his hands, for the murder of his friends. Treason again added a fearful
                    contribution to the accumulated evils which surrounded the unfortunate Ethelred.
                    His son Edmund, surnamed, from his hardihood, Ironside, vainly attempted to make
                    head against the Danes; for Canute penetrated to York, where he was joined by
                    the Earl of Northumbria and a number of the people. The country was now a prey
                    to two contending armies; but just at this crisis it was relieved<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332326" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2326-0707"/> from its greatest enemy,
                    Ethelred, who died towards the end of 1016, worn out by care and disease.</p>
                <p>Edmund Ironside was immediately chosen king by the English; and if the exertions
                    of one man could have saved the country, this achievement would have been
                    performed by the new king. During his short reign, for it extended to only a few
                    months, he gave proofs of bravery and ability equal to any exigency, and worthy
                    of a happier fortune. The first struggle between him and Canute was for the
                    possession of London, which was held by the English. During the siege Edmund
                    fought two battles in the provinces, one of which took place at Seearston, and
                    is celebrated by our annalists. Twice the darkness of night came to the relief
                    of the exhausted armies, which had both suffered severely; but the dawn of the
                    third morning showed the result to be in favour of the English. Canute, however,
                    had taken advantage of the night, and marched upon London. Not long afterwards
                    another battle was fought, in which Edrie, a traitor thrice steeped in infamy by
                    his defection, played the game of victory into the hands of Canute. After this
                    calamitous event the greatness of Edmund’s soul became more conspicuous.
                    Although a numerous army had again rallied around his standard, he shuddered to
                    lavish more of his country’s blood in this murderous warfare, and challenged
                    Canute to decide their quarrel by single combat. Whether this proposal was
                    accepted or not, is matter of uncertainty; but at all events a pacification was
                    shortly afterwards agreed upon, and England was divided between the rivals; the
                    north being given up to Canute, whilst Edmund retained possession of the south.
                    The latter, however, died shortly afterwards; and there is reason to believe
                    that he perished through the machinations of the perfidious Edrie.</p>
                <p>Edmund left two sons, infants; but by the unanimous voice of the nation Canute
                    obtained the sovereignty of England. This remarkable prince was only twenty
                    years of age when he assumed the reins of government. His qualities as a monarch
                    were of a very high order, not unalloyed, however, with the feroeity natural to
                    the Northmen of the period. The first object of his poliey was the removal of
                    the children of the two preceding kings. Some of the sons of Ethelred were
                    slain, and the rest consigned to banishment; whilst those of Edmund were sent
                    over to Sweden, for the purpose of being dispatched. But their fate was averted
                    by the prince to whom they were conveyed. He sent them both to the king of
                    Hungary, by whom they were educated in a manner befitting their station. One
                    died in his youth, the other married the daughter of Henry, the emperor of
                    Germany; and their issue was Edgar Atheling, who will be mentioned
                    hereafter.</p>
                <p>Canute divided the kingdom into four governments. He retained Wessex to himself.
                    East Anglia was conferred on a chief named Thurchil, who had formerly
                    distinguished himself; and Eric and Edric were continued in Northumberland and
                    Mereia. But the latter shortly afterwards received the full reward of his crimes
                    and perfidy. At a Christmas festival celebrated in London, he had the audacity
                    to boast of his services, when Canute ordered him to be cut down, and his body
                    thrown into the Thames. The Danish king had embraced Christianity, and also
                    taken to wife Emma, widow of Ethelred. The profession of the former removed the
                    main barrier between his English and Danish subjects; and his espousal of a
                    royal female was no doubt intended to conciliate the affections of the Saxons;
                    and it seems to have had a considerable effect in this respect. The other events
                    of this reign will be found related under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Canute.</hi> He died at Shaftesbury in 1035, and was interred at Winchester. By
                    his wife Emma he had a son and daughter; the former called Hardicanute, or
                    Canute the Hardy. But previously to his marriage he had by another lady two
                    sons, named Sweyn and Harold. The former was installed in the sovereignty of
                    Norway, and the latter ascended the throne of England.</p>
                <p>Harold was not entitled to the crown; for it had been provided in the marriage
                    settlement of Emma, that the issue of Canute by her alone should reign; yet he
                    being on the spot, succeeded in obtaining the seeptre as well as the treasures
                    of his father. Edward the son of Ethelred, certainly the legitimate sovereign of
                    the kingdom, made an attempt to obtain it, but proved unsuccessful. His brother
                    Alfred renewed the enterprise, which proved fatal to him and to most of his
                    followers. This prince received a letter, which purported to be from his mother,
                    inviting him to come over and take possession of his father’s dominions. The
                    proposition was flattering, and in an unlucky moment he yielded to it. Having
                    landed with six hundred followers, he was treacherously made prisoner, along
                    with his companions. Every tenth man was set at liberty, a few more were
                    reserved as slaves, and the remainder were massacred and mutilated with the most
                    capricious cruelty. Prince Alfred himself was deprived of his eyes; and this
                    shocking barbarity soon afterwards terminated in his death. The unfortunate
                    sufferer was the dupe of a forgery; and the whole villanous transaction seems to
                    have been planned by Harold, and executed by his minions, particularly Earl
                    Godwin. This remarkable individual, according to the only account of him which
                    we possess, was the son of a Saxon herdsman. In his youth he had assisted Ulfr,
                    a Danish chieftain, to make his escape to the ships of Canute. The Northman took
                    him under his charge, and by successive steps he rose to the dignity of a Jarl,
                    and to the possession of power little less than sovereign during three reigns.
                    The atroeious deed of blood above related is the only event of importance
                    associated with the name of Harold the First. He died in 1040, and was succeeded
                    by Hardicanute, his brother by the half blood.</p>
                <p>This sovereign reigned about two years; and the little that is recorded of him is
                    of a very mixed character. He came over from Denmark, breathing revenge against
                    the murderers of Alfred, and even went so far as brutally to insult the lifeless
                    remains of Harold. Godwin stood prominently forward as an object of punishment,
                    but a splendid present turned aside the shaft of vengeance. Others also escaped
                    by appealing to his avarice, which seems to have been his ruling passion. Edward
                    the son of Ethelred was kindly and honourably received at his court—a noble act
                    of generosity; yet the author of it died of intemperance at the nuptial feast of
                    a Danish lord.</p>
                <p>Edward, surnamed the Confessor, the surviving son of Ethelred, was chosen king of
                    England in 1042. He was a weak and feeble prince, and incompetent to the task of
                    vigorous government; yet the commencement of his reign was characterized by an
                    act of severity. He despoiled his mother Emma of her property, and deprived her
                    of her influence. These proceedings were prompted by the antipathy which she
                    bore to the king, and by her lukewarmness in not punishing the murderers of her
                    son Alfred, of whose blood it was even whispered she was not entirely guiltless.
                    The weak and irresolute character of the king threw the power entirely into the
                    hands of the three noblemen who divided the Saxon territory amongst them, Siward
                    earl of Northumberland, Leofrie earl of Mercia, and Godwin earl of Kent, whose
                    daughter, Editha, Edward had been induced to marry. Godwin was by far the most
                    powerful of the three; for besides his own territory in Wessex, his two sons,
                    Sweyn and Harold, held large domains northward of the Thames. In 1051 he at last
                    presumed to bid defiance to his sovereign and son-in-law<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332339" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2339-0708"/>. Edward, who had sojourned a
                    long time in Normandy, where he was well treated, when he ascended the throne
                    invited the guardians and friends of his youth to accompany him to England. They
                    accordingly flocked to him in great numbers, and received ample preferment. One
                    of them, named Robert, obtained the primacy, at that time the station of highest
                    dignity and power. Amongst those who resorted to England was Eustace count of
                    Boulogne, who had married Edward’s sister. At Dover, one of Godwin’s towns, a
                    foolish affray took place between the followers of the count and the English.
                    This circumstance gave vent to the popular jealousy of the people against
                    foreigners. Godwin assembled a force, and claimed the surrender of Eustace; but
                    the latter was supported by the king, who ultimately succeeded in driving Godwin
                    and his sons into exile. The star of Godwin seemed now to have fairly set; but
                    just at this moment there arose another of far more disastrous omen to the Saxon
                    line. William duke of Normandy came to England with many of his followers, on a
                    visit to his cousin Edward. He was received with great honour, and loaded with
                    presents when he returned to his own country.</p>
                <p>Had the illustrious stranger never risen to be ruler of England, his first visit
                    to it would probably have been passed over by historians with a simple relation
                    of the event. But his singular fortune has induced some writers to find in it a
                    clue to his subsequent proceedings. It is impossible to conjecture what may have
                    passed in his mind upon this occasion. On the one hand he saw, that in the
                    course of a few years, the crown would soon become vacant, for its possessor was
                    now stricken in years, and, moreover, childless. On the other hand, there stood
                    in the way of his claim to it, first of all, Edward, the son of Edmund Ironside;
                    then his son Edgar Atheling, a weak prince, however; and afterwards the brothers
                    of Edward’s queen. Under such circumstances his vaulting ambition may have led
                    him to indulge in aspirations to the crown; but only a vague probability of
                    ultimate success must have been awakened in a mind possessed of such high
                    reflecting powers as that of William the Conqueror. Too many obstacles stood in
                    the way of his fostering any sanguine hopes of acceding to the throne of
                    England; and it is certain that the objects of his first visit were pacific. It
                    appears highly probable that his politic foresight might induce him to take
                    measures for securing the crown after the death of Edward the son of Ironside,
                    which took place some years subsequently to his visit to England; and a
                    conjecture may be hazarded that it was immediately after the demise of his
                    brother’s son that the Confessor made a promise to William of leaving him the
                    crown. That such a promise was given was afterwards alleged by the Conqueror, as
                    we shall see when he comes before us as a claimant of the sovereignty. In about
                    a year after this the Godwins were restored to their honours and estates; and
                    Editha, who had been repudiated by the king, was called from her prison to the
                    throne. She was innocent of any participation in her father’s guilt. The
                    annalists of the time represent her in the most amiable light, and as incapable
                    of devising evil either against her husband or any other individual. On his
                    re-instalment in his earldom and possessions, Godwin succeeded in inducing the
                    king to outlaw Archbishop Robert and all the Frenchmen; and not long after he
                    died ripe in years and in crimes. In 1055 Siward followed him to the grave; and
                    two years afterwards expired Leofric, the wise and powerful duke of Mercia, who
                    was succeeded in his dukedom by his son Algar. Tostig, brother of Harold,
                    received the earldom of the former; but in a few years afterwards (1065), he was
                    deposed for his cruelties, and his sovereignty conferred upon Morcar, son of the
                    Duke of Mercia.</p>
                <p>Soon after these transactions, the pacific monarch of England began to sicken.
                    When he saw his end approaching, he ordered the magnificent church of St Peter
                    at Westminster, which he had built, to be consecrated with solemnity and
                    splendour. He died two days after, on the 4th or 5th of January 1066, in the
                    twenty-fourth year of his reign, and was interred in the church which he had so
                    recently dedicated. He left no issue; for he had taken a vow of continence for
                    life. Edward Atheling, the only surviving son of Edmund Ironside, had landed
                    from Hungary with his wife and children, for the purpose of being proclaimed
                    heir to the crown; but shortly after his arrival in London he expired,
                    bequeathing his claim to his son Edgar.</p>
                <p>Edward the Confessor presents himself to us only in one character, that of a
                    royal monk. His piety and gentleness might have adorned a cloister, but,
                    unallied with those sterner virtues which fit a monarch for wielding the sceptre
                    with firmness and energy, they rendered him unfit for ruling, except under the
                    influence of able counsel, which he had the good fortune to possess during the
                    greater part of his reign. Abject superstition will unnerve even a strong mind,
                    and to a weak one it imparts a character of childlike feebleness, and forms such
                    an individual as Edward. But he had many amiable qualities, which would have
                    redeemed even greater weaknesses than those with which he is chargeable. He
                    loved his people much; he was averse to the imposition of taxes, some of which
                    he abolished; and his charities were frequent and extensive. His subjects repaid
                    his attentions by lamenting his loss as a national misfortune, and consigning
                    his memory to the veneration of posterity.</p>
                <p>The day which witnessed the funeral of Edward, saw the coronation of Harold, the
                    son of Godwin. A report had been circulated that the Confessor had appointed him
                    his successor, which greatly conciliated the chiefs; indeed the only opposition
                    which he experienced was from his own unnatural family. On Edgar Atheling, the
                    last surviving prince of the house of Cerdic, was conferred the earldom of
                    Oxford, in lieu of the crown. Tostig, the brother of the king, was a competitor
                    for the crown. Harold Hardrada, king of Norway, promised him his support, and
                    the politic duke of Normandy did the same. In Flanders he was permitted to raise
                    an army, with which he landed in Northumberland; but he was defeated by Morcar,
                    on whom the earldom of the province had been conferred. The discomfited Tostig
                    fled to Malcolm, king of Scotland, where he was well received. The Caledonian
                    monarch had himself been sheltered at the English court during the usurpation of
                    Macbeth, and was established on the throne of his ancestors by the aid of
                    England. As a grateful return for the attentions he had received in that
                    country, he always readily welcomed the malcontents who fled from it. The
                    arrival of his Norwegian ally recalled Tostig from his exile. They joined forces
                    at the mouth of the Tyne, and marched upon York, in the neighbourhood of which
                    city the Saxon army sustained a defeat. But this was only a prelude to the grand
                    struggle. Harold, the king, notwithstanding the necessity under which he lay of
                    watching the south-eastern extremity of the island from a still more formidable
                    rival, collected a considerable army, and marched with promptitude and secrecy
                    to meet Tostig and his Norwegian ally. So rapid had been the movements of the
                    king that he took the enemy in some degree by surprise. They, however, retired
                    upon Stamford-bridge on the Derwent, where they drew out their line of battle.
                    The contest which ensued was bloody, and long of doubtful issue. For a while the
                    firm array of the Norwegians bade defiance to all the efforts of the English
                    cavalry, which, accustomed to charge in detached masses, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332352" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2352-0709"/>fell in this dispersed state
                    almost harmless upon the bristling rampart of Scandinavian spears. The king of
                    Norway, conspicuous by his blue tunic and glittering helmet, made the most
                    heroic exertions; but victory forsook his standard; a fatal dart pierced his
                    throat, and he fell lifeless to the ground. Tostig assumed the command, and
                    after a desperate effort to turn the fortune of the day, he perished, with the
                    flower of the Norwegian army. This victory, which is memorable on account of the
                    dreadful slaughter that distinguished it, was gained on the 25th of September
                    1066. It must be recorded to the honour of Harold, that twice he offered peace
                    and pardon to his rebellious brother, once before and once during the heat of
                    battle, when the Norwegian had fallen, but both times these offers were refused.
                    Three days after this conflict William duke of Normandy landed in England, and
                    Harold had to prepare for another desperate struggle to retain the crown. It
                    will now be necessary to examine how far the pretensions of the new competitor
                    for it were legitimate.</p>
                <p>This celebrated claimant to the sceptre of England was the descendant of Rollo, a
                    renowned Vikingr or Sea-King, who flourished at the beginning of the tenth
                    century. Rognvalldr, the father of Rollo, was one of those earls appointed by
                    Harold Harfager, or the fair-haired, to guard his conquests. He had two sons,
                    Thorer and Rolfr, better known by his more celebrated name of Rollo.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the History of England by
                    Sir James Mackintosh (vol. i. p. 90), the following sentence occurs :—“One of
                    the sons of Rogue-vakl, called in the Icelandic poems ∏rolpt, better known to us
                    by the name of Rollo, had, for reasons unknown to our authorities, been excluded
                    from all share in his father’s domains, and had no resource but piracy.” The
                    reason of his exclusion was in all likelihood his being a younger son. We have
                    already noticed, that amongst the Northmen of this period an absurd law
                    obtained, by which all but the eldest son were excluded from any participation
                    in the property left by the father. By this pernicious arrangement the younger
                    branches of families were driven to seek their fortune upon the sea. It is
                    certain that Roguevald left two sons; it is also next to certain that he would
                    observe the law of the land as it then existed. Now, the question comes to be,
                    which of the two was the first born. There is no direct evidence upon the point,
                    but the circumstance of Thorer’s name having always the precedence when the
                    brothers are mentioned together, and also that of Rollo’s piratical exploits,
                    whilst there is no mention made of his brother in that capacity, seem to
                    determine the point that the progenitor of a future royal family of England was
                    the youngest son ;—and thus the difficulty is explained.</p></note> The
                    progenitor of William the Conqueror was expelled from his country on account of
                    a violation of the law which forbade freebooters, under pain of death, to
                    destroy cattle on the Norwegian shore. Driven from his paternal shores, he
                    resolved to seek for a kingdom elsewhere; and after much successful valour he
                    succeeded in establishing a Scandinavian state in France. Rollo proved himself a
                    prince worthy of a kingdom, and his acquisition in course of time assumed the
                    name of Normandy. His exertions for the improvement of his dominions, the
                    civilization of the rude Northmen, and the humanizing of their minds to the love
                    of order, justice, and the arts of peace, class him with those illustrious
                    individuals who have proved themselves benefactors of the human race. He died in
                    931, and was succeeded by his son W illiam. After two others, Robert the
                    Magnificent, or the Devil as he was perhaps more appropriately designated,
                    succeeded. He was father to the duke, who now appears before us as a competitor
                    for the English throne. William was an illegitimate child by a damsel of humble
                    condition, of whom his father was enamoured, but could not wed during the
                    lifetime of his duchess, the sister of Canute. Like their northern progenitors,
                    the nobles of the Norman duke were careless of the distinction between
                    concubinage and wedlock, so that on the death of Robert in 1035, William,
                    although then only eight years of age, was triumphantly placed upon the ducal
                    throne, which he filled with renown for fifty-three years.</p>
                <p>The circumstance of numerous Norman barons having settled in England during the
                    reign of Edward the Confessor, who was the grandson of a duke of Normandy, has
                    already been noticed; as also the visit paid by William to the childless
                    monarch. It was afterwards asserted by the Duke of Normandy, that upon one
                    occasion, probably that to which we have already alluded, Edward had bequeathed
                    to him the crown of England. He also alleged a testamentary bequest, as well as
                    Harold. Both were alike destitute of any claim founded on the modern principles
                    of hereditary descent, but both by consanguinity made out a species of right to
                    inherit; William as the grand uncle of Emma the king’s mother, and Harold as the
                    king’s brother-in-law. The claims of the champions were therefore nearly
                    balanced, and seem to have contented their partizans; the sword alone could
                    decide to whom tha real title should belong.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the claim of Harold suffered considerably on account of a
                    circumstance which occurred a short time before the demise of the late king. The
                    Saxon had been shipwrecked in France, but obtained leave to proceed to Normandy
                    by alleging that he was intrusted with some communications to Duke William. That
                    prince received him kindly, and imparted to him the hopes which he cherished of
                    obtaining the English crown. He received a promise of aid from Harold, and by an
                    artifice succeeded in making him swear fealty to his cause. Underneath the
                    missal on which the Saxon had sworn were concealed various sacred relics, such
                    as the bones of saints and martyrs, and thus he had unconsciously bound himself
                    by the most solemn oath. When the struggle came, Harold urged the plea of
                    compulsion as releasing him from any obligation to keep his vow. Abhorrence of
                    oath-breakers, however, is characteristic of a superstitious age; and whilst the
                    circumstance materially weakened the cause of Harold, it strengthened in a
                    corresponding degree that of his rival. There is also every reason to believe
                    that it was the principal means of enabling William to obtain from the holy see
                    a declaration in favour of his enterprise. At such a period a bull from the pope
                    was itself worth an army, and this the adventurer not only obtained, but also a
                    consecrated standard, a ring, and a lock of his holiness’s hair.</p>
                <p>William now set busily to work in preparing the means of offensive aggression.
                    When his purpose was known, he was speedily joined by all the young knights of
                    the neighbouring countries who sought fortune or renown, and by all the
                    freebooters whom the hope of spoil allured to his standard. With an armament
                    more formidable than the western nations had yet witnessed, he accordingly put
                    to sea. Annalists have greatly exaggerated the number of his troops; for
                    altogether they did not probably much exceed twenty-five thousand men. With this
                    army he landed without opposition at Pevensey, in the county of Sussex, as has
                    already been observed. He made no stay at that place, however, but proceeded
                    immediately to Hastings to procure provisions. Harold, apprised of the arrival
                    of his most dreaded enemy, flew to attack him. William, informed of his victory
                    and advance, was counselled by some to remain in his entrenchments, and not to
                    hazard an open engagement. But the mind of the future conqueror was not liable
                    to the agitations of fear. He had thrown his life upon a east, and was resolved
                    to stand the hazard of the die. In this emergency the conduct of Harold has been
                    severely censured. He appropriated to himself<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332365"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2365-0710"/> all the spoils of the late battle, which added to
                    his unpopularity; whilst the death of his brother was by common report imputed
                    to him. On his march against William, a considerable portion of his army
                    deserted him, and their place had to be supplied by raw and undisciplined
                    levies. When the two rivals were near enough to interchange messages, the Norman
                    offered Harold the choice of abdication, of single combat, or of appeal to the
                    pope. These propositions being rejected, he was then offered Northumberland for
                    himself, whilst Kent would be conceded to his brother Gurth; but the latter
                    proposal shared the fate of the former one; upon which William declared his
                    intention of giving battle to his rival, whom he looked upon and designated as a
                    liar and a perjured wretch, excommunicated by the holy father. He even expressed
                    astonishment that an individual conscious of such guilt as that with which
                    Harold was chargeable should venture his person in battle. We are told that such
                    a feeling also prevailed in the English army, and that the king was advised by
                    his brothers Gurth and Leofwin to withdraw, whilst they would lead on the
                    battle. Harold, however, only smiled at their apprehensions, and expressed his
                    resolution of commanding the army in person.</p>
                <p>On the morning of Saturday the 14th of October William advanced to the attack of
                    the Saxons, after having solemnly heard mass and received the sacrament. The
                    previous night is also said to have been passed in devotion, whilst songs and
                    revelry resounded throughout the Saxon camp. The spot which Harold had fixed
                    upon for this important contest was a piece of rising ground about eight miles
                    inland from Hastings. It was open towards the south, and was covered at the back
                    by an extensive wood. On the front of the declivity the troops were arranged in
                    one compact mass, in the centre of which floated the royal banner, with the king
                    and his two brothers near it. On an opposite hill stood William in front of his
                    warriors, with the relics upon which Harold had sworn hung round his neck, and
                    the consecrated standard waving by his side. After a short address to animate
                    his soldiers, he advanced upon the enemy, shouting the national war-cry “God is
                    our help ;” whilst the cry of “Christ’s rood, the holy rood,'* rose from the
                    adverse ranks. The impetuous onset of the Normans was received by the English
                    with their battleaxes, with which theÿ broke the lances and cut the coats of
                    mail, on which their opponents placed great reliance. The confidence of the
                    Normans began to waver, and the left wing, both horse and foot, actually gave
                    way. With eager rashness the English pursued, and thus exposed themselves to the
                    hazard of being cut off; for William with dauntless fortitude and presence of
                    mind had succeeded in rallying his fugitive bands. The attack was renewed, and
                    again the English repulsed it. The duke had now recourse to an artifice which
                    ultimately proved the destruction of the enemy’s army. By a feigned flight he
                    allured a body of them from their strong position, and, whilst the latter too
                    eagerly pursued, he turned upon them with his cavalry, and hewed them in pieces.
                    Twice was this stratagem repeated, and each time with perfect success. Still the
                    main body of the English presented an unbroken rampart of shields, against which
                    the mass of Norman chivalry for a long time was hurled in vain.</p>
                <p>During the conflict both leaders gave proofs of personal bravery and skill worthy
                    of the crown which the one was combating to retain and the other to wrench from
                    his grasp. William had three horses killed under him, and hand to hand he had
                    grappled on foot with his adversaries. A little before sunset Harold, both of
                    whose brothers had already fallen, received an arrow in the eye, which
                    penetrated to the brain. His fall relaxed the vigour of the English. Their lines
                    were penetrated, their standard taken; and a panic having seized upon them, they
                    broke and dispersed through the wood, whilst darkness closed upon the spoils of
                    the field and the hopes of the Saxons.</p>
                <p>Thus ended the battle of Hastings, memorable in various respects, first, as
                    introducing a new dynasty of monarchs to rule the southern part of Britain; and
                    secondly, as opening up to the inhabitants of the island the means of a more
                    extensive intercourse with the continent than they had ever yet enjoyed. By this
                    means were introduced into Britain those modes of life, manners, customs, and
                    institutions which were at the time considered as characteristic of civilization
                    and refined society; and henceforth England was destined to take a large share
                    in the transactions and fortunes of the continental powers, perhaps ultimately
                    for the mutual benefit of all parties.</p>
                <p>On the morning after the battle, the victors, having stripped the bodies of the
                    slain, pranced wantonly over them with their horses. The mother of Harold, like
                    another Andromache, begged the corpse of lier son from the conqueror; but
                    whether her maternal request was complied with or not is a matter of great
                    uncertainty; for upon this point our annalists are either contradictory or
                    ambiguous. By one party it is asserted that the corpse of the fallen monarch was
                    interred upon the beach; by another that it was given up when demanded, its
                    weight in gold having been offered as a ransom. Perhaps both are correct; for it
                    is probable enough that it was first buried on the shore, and afterwards
                    exhumated at the request of the mother. Without entering into any speculation
                    connected with the Norman conquest, we may simply remark, that in order to
                    interest the reader of English history, and excite commiseration and pity for
                    Harold, he has, by a number of historians, been invested with talents, virtues,
                    and accomplishments which he did not possess in a degree sufficient to command
                    the entire affection of his countrymen during his life; whilst his death has
                    also been deplored with' unnecessary regret, as a sort of national loss. Where
                    the stakes are equal, and the game a fair trial of strength and dexterity,
                    sympathy will always side with the loser. Over his opponent Harold had the
                    advantage of fighting for his native land against a foreign invader; but it must
                    be observed that his own aggrandisement and the independence of the nation were
                    inseparably connected, and that in pursuing the one he was combating for the
                    other.</p>
                <p>Before entering into the subsequent history of the conqueror’s proceedings, it
                    will be necessary to pause and take a rapid glance at the Anglo-Saxon
                    institutions before they were supplanted -by the system which the successful
                    invasion of the Normans was destined to introduce.</p>
                <p>The Anglo-Saxon king, without possessing despotic sovereignty, was in dignity,
                    property, and power elevated far above the level of the rest of the nation. He
                    was elected by the assembly called the <hi rend="italic">wittena-gemote</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> a meeting of wise or prudent men. This was the
                    great council of the nation, and seems to have resembled what our modern
                    parliament would be if lords and commons mingled together and debated in one
                    house. It was composed of the prelates, earls, and a great many thanes or
                    considerable proprietors of land, a class similar to our modern gentry; so that
                    the Saxons may be said to have possessed the elements of a free and popular
                    government, though as yet in a rude and chaotic state. This supreme judicial and
                    legislative assembly was convened by the king, and held its meetings on the
                    great festival days of the church, such as Christmas. But these were not
                    confined to such seasons, being called together according as circumstances
                    required. Besides electing the king, and presiding at his coronation, they
                    assisted him in making laws and treaties, in military preparations, in
                    administering justice, and the other affairs of government. Their power was
                    considerable, but it depended<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332378"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2378-0711"/> in a great measure upon the character and
                    capacity of the sovereign. The highest officer in the kingdom was the caldorman;
                    he was chief of a shire, and had great judicial powers. An eorl was the next
                    dignity, which remained separate from the former until towards the close of the
                    Anglo-Saxon period, when the title of caldorman seems to have been superseded by
                    that of eorl; under them were other officers, whom it is unnecessary to
                    particularise. There was of course a wittena-gemote to every kingdom; and when
                    all the principalities merged in Wessex, and gave rise to a single one for the
                    whole country, the monarch occasionally held <hi rend="italic"
                    >shire-gemotes</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or county meetings, where
                    the laws made by the king and his counsellors were proclaimed, and being
                    acknowledged and sworn to, became binding on the whole nation.</p>
                <p>The Anglo-Saxons were divided into freemen and slaves. But there was a third
                    class, such as bordars, cottars, and others, who were cultivators of the soil,
                    and, ranking probably in the lowest order of freemen, were scarcely reduced to
                    the degrading level of slaves. As far as has yet been ascertained, the class
                    which was subject to the most complete thraldom was small in comparison with
                    those who enjoyed superior privileges, probably about one in seven. The
                    Anglo-Saxons paid some attention to the cultivation of the land, which was held
                    by various tenures, and liable to certain burdens, which varied in kind and
                    quantity. Military service, which consisted in providing a certain number of
                    armed men when public safety required them, was one of these. The other two
                    great services were the constructing or repairing of bridges, fortresses, and
                    walls. Besides these, the sub-proprietors of land were more or less liable to
                    many other burdens. With regard to their conveyances, we have several of their
                    grants of land without any pecuniary consideration; of their conveyances on
                    purchase; of their deeds of exchange; of their testamentary devises, and their
                    leases. These were, in the early periods of Anglo-Saxon history, short and
                    simple; but in grants of a more recent date the general words are nearly as
                    numerous as in our present deeds.</p>
                <p>The supreme legal tribunal was the wittena-gemote, which, like the present House
                    of Lords, was paramount to every other. There were also shire-gemotes and
                    burghgemotes, so many yearly meetings of which were strictly enjoined upon those
                    who composed them. Much of their judicial proceedings rested upon oaths, and
                    perjury was therefore severely punished. For the various breaches of the law the
                    punishments were commonly pecuniary. In the case of murder, the amount, which
                    was partly levied by the state as a penalty, and partly granted to the family of
                    the deceased as a satisfaction for the loss of their relative, was proportioned
                    to the rank of the murdered man. Persons accused of crimes had occasionally to
                    pass through an ordeal of hot water or hot iron, of which they had their
                    option.</p>
                <p>There were many popular institutions which rendered the king subordinate to the
                    community. The meetings of the people at the various courts,.from the folkmote
                    of the hundred, to the wittena-gemote of the nation, contributed to foster the
                    principles of equal law and of popular government. From the Anglo-Saxons we
                    derive our language, the names of the most ancient officers among us, and those
                    of the greater part of the divisions of the kingdom, and of almost all our towns
                    and villages.</p>
                <p>In their domestic habits the Anglo-Saxons were social, and loved the pleasures of
                    the table. Their food was that mixture of vegetable and animal diet which always
                    marks the progress of civilization. Ale and mead were their favourite drinks,
                    and wine was an occasional luxury. They had become so far acquainted with the
                    conveniences of civilized life as to display both variety and vanity in adorning
                    their persons. Their dwelling-houses seem to have been small and inconvenient,
                    although they were both expensive and magnificent in their ecclesiastical
                    buildings. Amongst the Anglo-Saxons females were very respectfully treated, and
                    occupied the same independent rank in society which they now enjoy. The trades
                    and mechanical arts had made considerable progress, and even foreign commerce
                    was carried on and considered as a highly honourable calling. With regard to
                    their circulating medium, it may be shortly stated, that they had their pounds,
                    shillings, pence, and farthings, exactly as we have at present. Learning, except
                    amongst ecclesiastics, was neglected; and with regard to literature, little can
                    be said with certainty, for the monuments of this kind which they have left us,
                    except what is historical, have not yet been examined with sufficient care.<note

                <p>The conquest of England did not altogether terminate with the battle of Hastings.
                    London and other important towns were put in a posture of defence, whilst a
                    numerous fleet had assembled at Dover to interrupt the proceedings and distract
                    the attention of the invader. Edgar, the legitimate heir to the throne, appears
                    to have been either crowned or acknowledged as sovereign at London, where the
                    two powerful earls Morcar and Edwin, with the loyal inhabitants, resolved to
                    make a desperate stand against the advancing foe. William, however, instead of
                    attacking the city, chose rather to lay waste the country, which he did most
                    effectually, consigning to the flames what could not be forcibly removed. He now
                    appears before us in a character somewhat new. Formerly he had combated for the
                    crown against an individual who, according to all modern notions of legitimacy,
                    had no more right to it than himself; but in the present instance he was
                    attempting to snatch it from the brow of him who alone had a hereditary claim to
                    wear it. On this account the atrocities committed by his troops are justly
                    contemplated with horror, whilst the disposition to palliate them is
                    proportionally lessened.</p>
                <p>William, however, was the candidate favoured by the see of Rome, and the bishops
                    interfered in his behalf. Stigand, the metropolitan, was the first to throw
                    himself on the mercy of William, whom he met as the conqueror crossed the Thames
                    at Wallingford, and swore fealty to him as his sovereign; others followed his
                    example, as did Edgar, Edwin, and Morcar upon the part of the nobility. The
                    crown was offered to him, and he was formally invested with it in Westminster
                    Abbey, on Christmas 1066. During the ceremony a tumult arose which made the
                    stout heart of the conqueror to tremble beneath its iron mail; and, had an
                    English force, led by any competent commander, and capable of making head
                    against the Normans, appeared at the moment, it might have cost him his crown
                    and his life. Whilst, by loud acclamations, both English and Normans expressed
                    their willingness to have William, for king, his troops set fire to the houses,
                    and commenced the plunder of the city. The coronation service was hastily
                    concluded, and the insurrection quelled without much difficulty, although-the
                    English looked upon it as a bad omen, and William as a most unfortunate
                    occurrence. It was his interest to propitiate the affections of the people whom
                    he bad now been appointed to govern, and he anxiously wished to do so. In
                    explanation of this occurrence, it is usually alleged that the Normans mistook
                    the acclamations<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332391" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2391-0712"
                    /> of those who shouted within the church for an alarm 1 of the English to rise
                    in revolt. But if this had been the case, why did they not instantly fly to the
                    rescue of their king, instead of spreading themselves about and firing and
                    pillaging the city? His safety was surely their first care; for had he fallen,
                    their fate was inevitable. The whole unquestionably originated in the desire of
                    the troops for sack and pillage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Although not mentioned by our historians, contemporary
                    annalists establish and illustrate the fact that the armies of the continent at
                    this period were in a great measure composed of mercenaries, who followed war as
                    a profession, and hired themselves out to the best paymaster. These individuals
                    were different from those who followed the banners of the barons according to
                    the feudal system. They were little better than hired banditti, and were very
                    numerous in the Low Countries, whence λVilliam had sprung. That the force with
                    which he invaded England contained vast numbers of these condottieri, is not
                    only probable, but appears nearly certain, when we contemplate the methods of
                    furnishing out an army in those days. The plunder of the provinces which they
                    overran or conquered seems to have been looked upon by them as not only
                    allowable, but as forming part of their reward. That the affair at William’s
                    coronation arose from their rapacity for pillage, which they looked upon as a
                    right, there can be little doubt; and they chose the most fitting time for
                    successfully carrying their project into execution; a time when their leaders
                    were withdrawn, and in attendance at the ceremony going on within the church.
                    They had previously broken out in the same way at Dover.</p></note></p>
                <p>Hitherto William had been called the Bastard; from this period he obtained the
                    surname of the Conqueror, a term which at the time was employed to designate a
                    person who had sought and obtained his right, as well as a subjugator. It was
                    necessary for William to maintain a strong military force in order to compel the
                    obedience of his subjects; and he could only feel himself secure surrounded by
                    his trusty Norman barons. But the duration of their services being limited to a
                    certain term, they naturally expected to be released from their engagements, and
                    re-conveyed to their country, when the period of servitude had expired. In order
                    to encourage them to remain, he put into their hands the strongholds and
                    principal towns of the kingdom, whilst all the conquered territory of the
                    English, which he bad at his command, was likewise distributed amongst them.
                    Having thus put his dominions in a secure posture, he embarked for Normandy,
                    carrying along with him Morcar, Edgar, and Edwin, and leaving the chief
                    management of affairs in England in the hands of William Fitzosbern, a Norman
                    baron, and Odo, bishop of Bayeux, the son of his mother by a plebeian husband.
                    During the absence of the Conqueror, the Saxons began to mutter threats of
                    vengeance, and even went so far as to enter into a conspiracy to cut off the
                    Normans as their forefathers had done the Danes. It appears, from the testimony
                    of several credible annalists, that the oppression which the English suffered at
                    the hands of the insolent soldiery was most galling, and called loudly for
                    retaliation. These alarming rumours crossed the channel, and reached the ears of
                    William, who hastened from his continental dominions, and, landing in England in
                    December 1067, made a sort of second conquest of that country. The Saxons of
                    Devonshire, joined by the neighbouring Britons in Cornwall, had thrown off their
                    allegiance to him, and against them he first turned his arms. They made a
                    gallant stand; but William having reduced Exeter, succeeded in breaking the
                    spirit of resistance for a time. About this period, Edgar, with his mother and
                    two sisters, having embarked for Hungary, were driven by a tempest upon the
                    coast of Scotland. That country was at the time governed by Malcolm, surnamed
                    Ceanmore, who gladly received the fugitives, and made them a return for that
                    kindness which he had himself experienced under similar circumstances at the
                    English court. Many Saxon nobles followed Edgar, who, with subsequent
                    emigrations of disaffected Normans, founded the greater number or the Scottish
                    noble families. Malcolm afterwards married Matilda, the eldest sister of
                    Edgar.</p>
                <p>William the Conqueror now turned his attention to the north, where his authority
                    had not yet been properly esta blished. From the heart of Mercia to the confines
                    of Scotland a spirit of open insubordination prevailed, and was fostered by
                    Edwin, who had been at one time promised the hand of William’s daughter, but was
                    afterwards refused it. The insurrection became formidable; but it was soon
                    quelled, and this served more and more to confirm the power of the Normans.
                    William penetrated as far as York, which opened its gates to him, scattered the
                    isolated and feeble bands who opposed his march, and reduced all the important
                    towns on his way. During this expedition he also fortified a number of castles.
                    The tranquillity thus produced was, however, of short duration. At Durham the
                    English succeeded in massacring the whole Norman force established there,
                    excepting two men. York followed the example of Durham, and rising upon the
                    garrison, killed the governor, with many of his retainers. Shortly after this
                    event, the sons of Harold, the late king, landed from Ireland with the intention
                    of making an effort to recover the crown; but they were utterly defeated in two
                    engagements, by Brian, son of the Earl of Bretagne.</p>
                <p>A new and formidable auxiliary of the malcontents had now however arrived in the
                    Humber; this was a powerful Danish armament. Edgar Atheling, several illustrious
                    Saxons, and crowds of the English, having joined them, they successfully
                    assaulted York; but William, apprised of their descent, hastened to the scene of
                    war. His usual good fortune attended him; and the Danes were compelled to quit
                    the country without crossing arms with theŃor-mans in any conflict worthy the
                    name of a battle. Hints have occasionally been thrown out that they were bribed
                    by the Conqueror; but of this circumstance there is no direct evidence. Upon
                    another point, however, all historians are agreed, namely, that, piqued by these
                    repeated insurrections, the king, in a transport of passion, had sworn to
                    extirpate Northumbria. This merciless vow was performed nearly to the letter.
                    Unbounded license was given to the soldiery, who ravaged the country with fire
                    and sword. The destroying angel could scarcely have left a more desolate
                    wilderness behind. An historian, William of Malmesbury, who wrote sixty years
                    after the event, thus describes it: “From York to Durham not one inhabited
                    village remained; fire, slaughter, and desolation made it a vast desert, which
                    continues to this day.” The dead remained unburied; famine, with pestilence in
                    its train, stalked throughout the neighbouring provinces; whilst confiscation
                    brought up the rear of this terrible visitation, and completed the ruin of the
                    country and its inhabitants, gleaning whatever the sword had not destroyed. Such
                    atrocities as these imprint a blot upon the escutcheon of William which it is
                    impossible to obliterate. To his authority the rebel chieftains were compelled
                    to submit; and having thus in the most summary manner crushed rebellion in this
                    quarter of his dominions, he returned southwards, clearing the provinces of the
                    disaffected as he proceeded, and repairing or building castles for the
                    subjection of the country.</p>
                <p>William was now undisputed master of England. The conquest of the country,
                    properly speaking, only began <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332404"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2404-0713"/>with the battle of Hastings. It was not until
                    seven years thereafter, when he carried the terror of his arms to York, that the
                    country was completely subdued. Before that period not one half of England
                    acknowledged his authority. But the spirit of the Saxons was now fairly broken,
                    and finding themselves pursued with such extirpating vengeance, many of them
                    sought refuge amongst the hills and forests, whilst others emigrated to foreign
                    lands. A party of them under Hereward, a resolute chief, attempted to make a
                    stand in the island of Ely, immediately after the northern massacre. This land
                    of fens and marshes was the last asylum of Saxon independence; and Morcar, with
                    some bishops and the remainder of the most conspicuous Saxons, repaired thither.
                    For a while William disdained to notice the efforts of Hereward; but at last he
                    invaded his circumscribed territory, and, scattering his little band, compelled
                    him to fly. This bold and patriotic chieftain afterwards gave in his submission,
                    and being allowed to retain his paternal possessions, the end of his days proved
                    happy. His daring exploits had endeared him to his countrymen, and conferred on
                    him a romantic celebrity. His actions were the theme of many a Saxon song; and
                    even the Normans did homage to his warlike virtues. He was the last of the
                    Saxons who drew the sword in the cause of national independence.</p>
                <p>William having now quieted the tumults at home, turned his attention to Malcolm,
                    king of Scotland, whom he compelled to submit. The affairs of the church also
                    occupied him for a time; and several changes were effected, not, it may well be
                    believed, to the advantage of the Saxon prelates. One of them, the Archbishop of
                    Canterbury, was deposed, and his place supplied by Lanfranc, who, although a
                    worthy man, was the creature of William, and in bondage to Rome. In the
                    meanwhile, Edgar Atheling had sought and obtained the friendship of the
                    Conqueror, who, to his honour, ever afterwards maintained this weak and almost
                    imbecile youth in ease and affluence at his court.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir James Mackintosh, in his History of
                    England (vol. i. p. 108), gives a somewhat different account of this youth, but
                    upon what authority is not stated; ours is Mr Turner, who quotes from William of
                    Malmesbury. There is considerable ambiguity in the passage; for Sir James (p.
                    102 of the same work) says that Malcolm Ceanmore “married the Princess Margaret,
                    after the death of her brother Edgar.” Now the king of Scotland espoused this
                    princess several years before the events noticed in p. 108, so that one or other
                    of these statements must be erroneous; for none of our historians makes mention
                    of two contemporary princes named Edgar belonging to the royal house of
                    Wessex.</p></note> William now ventured upon another visit to Normandy, where we
                    shall leave him engaged in petty contests, and take a view of the state of
                    England after its subjugation.</p>
                <p>By the introduction of a foreign sovereign, a foreign hierarchy, and a foreign
                    nobility, the native population suffered severe depression. To supply the
                    liberal grants of land and places of honour and trust to his followers, the
                    English were of course sacrificed; and thus they were compelled to become the
                    servants or dependents of their conquerors. Contempt and oppression became their
                    heritage. Their farms were pillaged, their females violated, their persons
                    imprisoned, and other indignities heaped upon them, at the caprice of the petty
                    tyrants who were set over them. The principal favourites of the Conqueror had
                    another distinction conferred upon them in addition to the grants of land. This
                    was the earldom or command of the several counties. Two legal revolutions
                    occurred or were completed during the reign of William; the separation of the
                    ecclesiastical from the civil judicature, and the introduction or consummation
                    of the feudal system, for an account of which the reader is referred to the
                    proper head. He effected various other judicial changes which were ultimately
                    beneficial to the community. The crown revenues were a continuation of those
                    which the Anglo-Saxon kings enjoyed; but they appear to have been considerably
                    increased by the various changes which took place, and also very carefully
                    collected; for from an ancient historian we learn that the king’s daily income
                    amounted to above one thousand pounds, a sum almost incredible when we reflect
                    that gold was then three times and silver ten times the value which they possess
                    in modern times.</p>
                <p>During the visit of William to his continental possessions, the Norman barons
                    rebelled against him, and were joined by some Saxon chiefs. The king hastened
                    across seas with a band of auxiliaries, and made an easy conquest of the
                    insurgents. The remaining events of his reign are not sufficiently important to
                    require a minute recital. The most remarkable is the revolt of his son Robert,
                    who had been promised the duchy of Normandy when William first invaded England.
                    The French monarch fomented the hostilities between the father and son, which
                    existed for several years, and closed with a most romantic incident. Robert,
                    being besieged in the castle of Gorberoi, engaged a knight enveloped in complete
                    armour, and unhorsed him, at the same time inflicting a wound in his arm. When
                    about to pursue his advantage, Robert recognised in the fallen warrior the voice
                    of his father. A reconciliation was finally effected by the tears and entreaties
                    of Matilda, the mother of this Norman Absalom.</p>
                <p>Whilst engaged in a desolating warfare against Philip, king of France, William
                    came before the town of Montes in July 1087, and ordered it to be burned. He
                    rode to view the scene, and galloping among the smouldering ruins, his horse
                    reared and plunged so violently as severely to wound the rider, who was at the
                    time very corpulent and unwieldy. He was carried in a dangerous state to the
                    vicinity of Rouen, where he breathed his last, on the 9th of September. On his
                    death-bed the conscience of the Conqueror appears to have stung him deeply; for
                    he ordered that several prisoners in England, amongst whom was Odo his
                    half-brother, should be set at large; and that restitution should be made for
                    what he had violently destroyed. But these atonements were inadequate to expiate
                    the crimes of which he had been guilty.</p>
                <p>The character of William has been drawn in the Saxon chronicle by an Englishman,
                    who was his contemporary, and lived at his court. From this document we learn
                    that the king was very wise, very rich, and “more worshipfull and strong than
                    any of his fore-gangers.” It is added, that “he was mild to good men who loved
                    God, and stark beyond all bounds to those who withstaid his will and the
                    chronicler goes on to show that he exercised a passionate as well as politic
                    tyranny. That, in fact, he surpassed his contemporary rulers in capacity for
                    command, the events of his life bear ample testimony. All those qualities which
                    fit an individual for directing and controlling the minds of men in troubled
                    times he possessed in an eminent degree. In extenuation of his perfidy and
                    cruelty, it may be urged that these detestable qualities were not more
                    characteristic of him than of the age in which he lived; and that he is
                    conspicuous for them above his competitors only because, from the vigour of his
                    mind, and the great transactions in which he interested himself, he was their
                    superior in every thing else. In a happier state of society, when moral
                    restraint is generally recognised, and influences the development of the mental
                    con-stitution<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332417" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2417-0714"/>
                    of man, his glories would not probably have appeared more stained with blood
                    than those of Cromwell and other warriors who have attained the seat of
                    successful ambition and uneasy power. Neither these palliatives, however, nor
                    his death-bed penitence, can atone for irrevocable crimes, or erase from the
                    page of history such deeds as the Northumbrian massacre.</p>
                <p>Much has been written concerning the Norman conquest, for it is a subject of
                    inexhaustible interest. That it became ultimately of incalculable benefit to the
                    country, whatever may have been the suffering immediately consequent upon the
                    event itself, no one can doubt who reflects upon the fluctuating condition of
                    England, its oscillation between foreign bondage and native independence, its
                    internal broils and never-ending distractions, previously to the invasion of the
                    Normans, with the consolidated strength which it internally displayed, and the
                    dignified bearing which it outwardly assumed, after it was conquered by them.
                    Insurrections, though not unknown afterwards, were of less frequent occurrence,
                    and far less alarming, than before; and from the period of the invasion of
                    William, no foreign enemy dared to set his foot upon the soil with impunity.
                    Amongst the financial innovations of his reign was the composition of the
                    Doomsday Book, for an account of which the reader is referred to the article
                    under that head.</p>
                <p>The Conqueror left three sons by his wife Matilda. Robert, the eldest, was
                    installed in the duchy of Normandy; whilst William, surnamed Rufus or the Red,
                    from his complexion, obtained the throne of England, and was crowned on the 26th
                    of September 1087. An attempt was made by his half-uncle Odo to dethrone him,
                    and to set up his brother Robert in his stead. But William, alarmed at the
                    formidable demonstrations which were made against him, appealed to the English
                    for aid, and his call was most loyally obeyed.- The Normans who had invaded
                    England were compelled to fly, and William carried the war into Normandy, where
                    a reconciliation was effected in the year 1091. The king of England had acquired
                    several continental fortresses, of which he was still to retain possession. It
                    was also stipulated between the brothers, that on the decease of either, the
                    survivor should succeed to the dominions of the other. Henry, the younger
                    brother, who suffered by the treaty, held out several strong places in Normandy;
                    but they joined their forces together, and besieged him in St Michael’s Mount,
                    whence he was compelled to fly from want of water.</p>
                <p>Robert accompanied his brother to England, where he had been promised possessions
                    as an equivalent for the fortresses which he had yielded up in Normandy. But
                    William did not find it convenient to fulfil the terms of the treaty; upon which
                    his brother, who had again crossed the channel, sent over two heralds for the
                    purpose of declaring him a false and perjured knight. In order to defend his
                    honour, the king followed them into Normandy; but his transactions there belong
                    rather to his own individual history than to that of the country which he
                    governed. The possession of his brother’s dominions was a leading object of
                    William’s ambition; and he gradually acquired an ascendency in Normandy, which
                    he repeatedly invaded, obtaining new cessions at each adventure. Robert finally
                    mortgaged the whole country to him for three years, at an equivalent of ten
                    thousand merks.</p>
                <p>The other events of William’s reign were, an invasion of Wales, which was crowned
                    with the usual success; and a war with Scotland, in which the monarch of that
                    country was slain. His government of England was most unpopular. For the
                    gratification of his own appetites, and the enriching of worthless favourites,
                    he plundered the country with impunity. During the life of Lanfranc, his
                    undisciplined rapacity was checked by the wisdom and influence of that excellent
                    prelate. His death, however, removed every restraint, for the king supplied his
                    place by the appointment of an able but remorseless counsellor, who, according
                    to the king himself, was capable of braving the execrations and the vengeance of
                    mankind, in order to gratify his master’s desires. Many bishoprics, including
                    amongst these the see of Canterbury, were kept vacant by the king for several
                    years, until a severe illness convinced him of the necessity of appointing a
                    primate. The individual whom he fixed upon was Anselm, one of the most learned
                    and meritorious men of his age. This individual at first demurred to accept the
                    archbishopric, dreading the violence of the king; but the earnest solicitations
                    of his friends at last induced him to comply, and he thus became primate of
                    England. William, as long as his illness was of a dangerous character, showed
                    himself penitent and submissive. He commanded all his prisoners to be released,
                    all his debtors to be forgiven, and all offences to be remitted; and he solemnly
                    vowed that if he recovered he would govern the land in righteousness. But no
                    sooner was he convalescent than he showed that his profession of amendment was
                    only a matter of convenience, and extorted from an unforgiving spirit by the
                    terrors of death. Anselm, as was usual in such cases, brought a voluntary
                    present to his master as an acknowledgment for the dignity which had been
                    conferred upon him; but the gift, not corresponding to the avaricious views of
                    the monarch, was refused, and the unfortunate primate was ever afterwards
                    persecuted by him with the most unrelenting tyranny. Anselm at last sought
                    shelter in Rome, where he continued until William’s demise.</p>
                <p>The death of the monarch, like his life, was violent. Whilst hunting in the New
                    Forest, he was accidentally struck by an arrow, which buried itself in his
                    breast, and he expired on the spot. The shaft is believed to have been shot at
                    random, and to have come from the bow of Walter Tyrrel, a French knight, who
                    immediately made his escape. This event happened on the 2d of August in the year
                    1100.</p>
                <p>Henry the First, surnamed Beauclerk or the Scholar, ascended the throne of
                    England three days after the death of his brother, the preceding monarch. The
                    compact which had been made between William and Robert was set aside; but the
                    latter, considering himself as aggrieved, invaded England. The formidable
                    demonstrations made by his brother, however, intimidated him, and a pacification
                    was at last effected at the accession of Henry; and the latter propitiated the
                    favour of his subjects by many wise acts. He removed the unpopular agents of his
                    unfortunate brother, particularly Flambard, the obnoxious minister formerly
                    alluded to, and also abolished the oppressive exactions which the latter had
                    enforced. Anselm was recalled, and the clergy conciliated, whilst the people had
                    restored to them the Anglo-Saxon laws and privileges as amended by Henry’s
                    father. He also gratified the nation by espousing Matilda, or Maud, daughter of
                    Malcolm, king of Scotland, by Margaret, the sister of Edgar Atheling.</p>
                <p>The king now turned his attention to the punishment of the outlaws who had thrown
                    off his authority. Amongst these were included several noblemen, and
                    particularly Robert de Belesme, the most powerful subject in England, and a man
                    haughty, rapacious, and deceitful. He had secured himself within the walls of
                    Shrewsbury, but at the arrival of Henry before this place he made a humiliating
                    surrender, upon which his life was spared, but he was condemned to perpetual
                    exile. Some time after these events Robert unexpectedly arrived in England,
                    where he was received with apparent affection by his brother, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332430" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2430-0715"/>but very soon discovered that
                    he was in reality a captive. The purpose of his visit was to intercede with
                    Henry in favour of the rebels; but instead of compounding for their liberation,
                    he was reduced to solicit his own, which he obtained by consenting to pay an
                    annuity of three thousand merks. After his return to Normandy he entered into
                    terms of friendship with the outlaw Belesme, who possessed numerous castles in
                    the country. Intelligence of this having reached Henry, he renounced the
                    alliance by which he had bound himself to keep the peace with Robert. This
                    compact was similar to that which had subsisted between William and Robert, and
                    a second time the latter became a brother’s dupe. Henry invaded Normandy, and a
                    decisive conflict before the walls of Tinchebrai, on the 27th of April 1106,
                    decided the fate of Robert. His army was completely routed, and he himself taken
                    prisoner and sent to England, where he remained in close confinement till his
                    death, which happened in 1135. The cruel fate of this prince has served as a
                    foil to the virtues which he possessed, and shed over them an artificial or
                    spurious lustre. There can be no doubt, however, that his qualities as a warrior
                    were brilliant, and his mind would seem to have been forgiving and conciliatory.
                    Perhaps an amiable weakness in the latter respect was the ultimate cause of his
                    misfortunes. Amongst the prisoners taken at Tinchebrai was Edgar Atheling.
                    Either from his inherent weakness precluding any thing like fear on his account,
                    or from a desire to retain the golden opinions of the Saxons, Henry pardoned
                    him, and from this period the descendant of Alfred intrudes himself no more upon
                    the page of English history.</p>
                <p>Robert had a son about five years of age named William, whom a faithful vassal
                    succeeded in conveying to the French court. As the age of this prince advanced,
                    the hopes of his partizans proportionally increased. Henry, after obtaining
                    possession of Normandy, had succeeded in tranquillizing it, and restoring peace
                    and order; but as his nephew grew up, the claims which he possessed to the duchy
                    of his father became more and more popular, and disturbed the quiet both of his
                    uncle and the country. Henry should have at once yielded his paternal
                    inheritance to the young prince; and the withholding of it was an act of
                    injustice which harassed his life and dishonoured his name. The Norman barons,
                    along with the king of France, took part with the injured youth; but this
                    coalition terminated with the battle of Brenville, which was fought in the year
                    1119. Louis, the French king, had four hundred, and Henry of England five
                    hundred knights. Both princes displayed great bravery during the engagement,
                    which ended, with comparatively but litt <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> e
                    bloodshed, in favour of the English. William of Normandy made his escape; and
                    the pope, who paid a visit to Henry atGisors, effected a reconciliation between
                    him and Louis, without touching upon the main cause of quarrel, namely, the
                    difference between the English monarch and his brother Robert, or rather his
                    nephew William, the father being now politically dead.</p>
                <p>Matters having been once more pacifically arranged, and the ambition of Henry
                    gratified, he set sail for England towards the end of November 1120. Upon this
                    occasion a most calamitous event occurred in his family, namely, the loss of his
                    only son William. The prince, with a large retinue of gay young knights and
                    noblemen, embarked shortly after his father. Festivity, riot, and intoxication
                    prevailed on board; but in the midst of this feasting and debauchery, the care
                    of‘the vessel being forgotten altogether, she struck upon a rock near Harfleur,
                    and went down. Of three hundred individuals who were on board, only one escaped
                    to record the dismal fate of his companions. Prince William would have been
                    saved but for the shrieks of his natural sister, which recalled him to the wreck
                    with the boat in which he was proceeding towards shore; and it sunk under the
                    multitudes who crowded into it.</p>
                <p>This sudden calamity revived the hopes of Henry’s nephew William, and disturbed
                    all the arrangements of the king in Normandy. A new war was kindled in that
                    country; but it terminated in 1124 in favour of the English monarch. The
                    discomfited youth, however, received a new favour of fortune. Louis of France
                    bestowed upon him the hand of his sister-in-law; and along with her he received
                    several of the provinces nearest to Paris, which had been united to Normandy by
                    conquest. Soon afterwards he was invested with the earldom of Flanders, which
                    had been left vacant by the assassination of Charles the Good in 1127. In the
                    meanwhile, Henry had endeavoured to perpetuate the succession in his own family,
                    by marrying a second time, after the death of Matilda, his first wife, who had
                    brought him a son and daughter. The premature fate of the former we have already
                    noticed; and the latter, named Matilda, had espoused the Emperor of Germany. The
                    marriage of the king proved to be without issue; and his daughter having
                    recently become a widow, was invited to England, for the purpose of settling
                    upon her the succession to the throne. In a general assembly of the prelates and
                    chief tenants of the crown she was proposed by her father and acknowledged by
                    the meeting as heiress presumptive; and shortly after this transaction her
                    father privately married her to the Count of Anjou. This secret negociation drew
                    forth loud complaints from the barons; and many of them declared that the
                    duplicity of the king had released them from the obligation of their oath. This
                    doubtless disturbed the serenity of the king’s reign; but another and more
                    important cause of disquietude arose from the increasing power and fame of his
                    nephew in Flanders. However, the death of that prince soon afterwards removed
                    all uneasiness on his account, and restored at least the prospect of
                    tranquillity. But this was not realized; for a quarrel with his son-in-law
                    retained him in Normandy, and embroiled the last years of his reign, which was
                    now drawing towards a close. Robert, the unfortunate duke of Normandy, died at
                    Cardiff Castle in Wales, in the eightieth year of his age and twenty-eighth of
                    his captivity, a great part of which had been spent in total blindness; for an
                    unsuccessful attempt to escape had provoked his brother to deprive him of sight.
                    All the historians of the period do not mention this circumstance, and some
                    state that the prisoner enjoyed every indulgence; so that the point is doubtful,
                    and for the honour of humanity we leave it in this state. In about a year
                    thereafter, he was followed to the grave by king Henry, who died of a surfeit of
                    lampreys, on the 1st of December 1135, in the sixty-seventh year of his age and
                    thirty-fifth of his reign.</p>
                <p>The character of Henry has been drawn by both friends and enemies, his
                    contemporaries. The former extol him as wise, rich, and brave; and the latter
                    execrate him as cruel, avaricious, and incontinent. By joining the two
                    characters together, we will form a pretty fair estimate of the monarch. He was
                    undoubtedly an able statesman and a courageous soldier, whilst his resolute
                    attack upon the popular system of rapine which disgraced Europe at the time is
                    entitled to very high praise. He punished offences severely; but his
                    administration of justice was highly beneficial to the country; and hence arose
                    his title of the Lion of Justice. On the other hand, the immorality of his
                    private life, his exactions, his cruelty to his brother and others; his
                    dissimulation, for even his favourites distrusted him; and his avarice, for he
                    hoarded gold like a miser; render his character exceedingly equivocal<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193332443" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2443-0716"/> as a man,
                    whatever estimate we may form of him as a sovereign. His reign offers little
                    worthy of praise, excepting what has been noticed above. It was moreover so
                    agitated, that he passed only five years of untroubled tranquillity in
                    England.</p>
                <p>It was the darling plan of Henry that his beloved daughter Maud should be his
                    successor. By her second husband she had three sons, one or other of whom their
                    uncle no doubt looked upon as the future monarch of England. But the claims of
                    the ex-empress of Germany were waived, and Stephen earl of Boulogne, son of
                    Adela, the daughter of William the Conqueror, succeeded to the throne. He was
                    crowned upon the 26th of December 1135, and soon made himself very popular.
                    According to custom, he immediately issued a charter, which promised of course
                    good government and ample redress of grievances. His courts at the solemn
                    festivals were held with extraordinary magnificence. He repulsed the invasion of
                    David king of Scotland, who received a severe defeat at the Battle of the
                    Standard, which was fought near Northallerton; he subdued his enemies in
                    Normandy; and, by a yearly pension, he pacified the husband of the lady whom he
                    had supplanted upon the throne. Robert earl of Gloucester, natural son of Henry,
                    and the great supporter of Maud’s rights, perceiving all hostility to be
                    unavailing, at last swore fealty to the king. For the first two or three years
                    of his reign, Stephen sat secure upon the throne; but he was doomed to be
                    overtaken by a series of calamities. These arose partly from the inevitable
                    consequences of his usurpation, and partly from his defects as a sovereign. That
                    passion for depredation and conflict which the preceding monarch had subdued,
                    again broke out. Every one built his own castle and maintained his own band of
                    mercenary ruffians, who sallied forth day and night to plunder the surrounding
                    country, and drag into dungeons such as they expected would give a high ransom
                    for their freedom. À contemporary chronicler has drawn a horrible picture of the
                    atrocities thus committed with impunity; for the mildness of Stephen’s
                    character, and probably the recollection of his own conduct in obtaining the
                    crown, induced him to be forbearing and indulgent. His popularity rapidly
                    declined; and in the fourth year of his reign it appears to have altogether
                    ceased. In 1139 Matilda, with a few attendants, landed in England, for the
                    purpose of recovering her lost inheritance. She was joined by Robert earl of
                    Gloucester, with a hundred and fifty knights, who commenced a warfare which
                    nearly hurled Stephen from the throne. After many conflicts, which were only
                    characterized by the misery attendant upon them, the army of the Empress Matilda
                    or Maud defeated that of Stephen near Lincoln, in the year 1141. The king was
                    captured after a brave resistance; and Matilda was soon afterwards crowned queen
                    of England at Winchester. The clergy, although they countenanced the accession
                    of Stephen, now acknowledged her prior claim; and the queen, proceeding to
                    London, was joyfully hailed by the citizens.</p>
                <p>But her popularity was of short duration. By her arrogance and contemptuous
                    conduct towards the friends of Stephen, she soon alienated the affections of the
                    people, and was at last compelled to fly from the city and to establish her
                    head-quarters at Oxford. In one of the numerous struggles which followed, the
                    Earl of Gloucester was taken prisoner, which put the fortunes of the
                    belligerents nearly upon a level. The king and the earl were exchanged for each
                    other; and as both parties had now a commander upon whom they could depend, the
                    conflict was perpetuated, with increasing misery to the nation. For some years
                    the balance of power hung nearly in equipoise between them. Stephen reduced
                    Oxford, but Robert defeated him at Wilton; and this miserable warfare continued,
                    until, on the death of her brother Robert, Matilda returned to Normandy in 1147,
                    when a breathing time of two years intervened.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile Henry, the son of Matilda, was advancing in years and in
                    fortune. By his uncle David, king of Scotland, he had been knighted at the age
                    of sixteen; a year thereafter he obtained from his father the cession of the
                    duchy of Normandy; and at the death of that prince he succeeded to the earldom
                    of Anjou. In 1152, by a politic marriage, he annexed the extensive duchy of
                    Aquitaine to his dominions. This aggrandizement of her son’s power having
                    elevated the hopes of Matilda and those of her partizans, Prince Henry landed in
                    England; but in consequence of the death of Eustace, the oldest son of Stephen,
                    the two parties agreed to terms of peace. Stephen adopted Henry, and appointed
                    him as his successor, one of the best acts of his troubled reign. They lived in
                    harmony with each other for about a year, when Stephen died on the 25th of
                    October 1154. He reigned nineteen years, during the greater part of which time
                    England exhibited a scene of misery unequalled since the invasion of the Danes.
                    The cause of these calamities we have already alluded to. The character of
                    Stephen is not so deeply stained with atrocities as that of some of his
                    predecessors, probably because it was not so determined. In comparison with
                    them, the grasp which he held of the sceptre was as feeble as his right to seize
                    it at all was equivocal.</p>
                <p>Henry II. or Plantagenet, the son of Matilda, ascended the throne without a
                    dissenting murmur. He was crowned, along with his queen Eleanor, at Westminster,
                    on the 19th of December 1154, in presence of an immense concourse of people. The
                    prospect which opened up to this young sovereign was more glorious than that of
                    any of his forerunners in England, or his contemporaries in other countries. An
                    unprecedented mass of power was concentrated in his hands. A third part of
                    France, including almost the whole western coast from the borders of Picardy to
                    the mountains of Navarre, acknowledged his authority. These possessions, along
                    with England, comprehended the most warlike portion of Europe; and had the
                    ambition ol the individual who ruled over them been commensurate with his power,
                    the humiliation, if not entire subjugation, ol France would not have been
                    reserved for the Henries and Edwards of after times. Although by no means
                    destitute of a passion for power, Henry possessed a love of literature, which
                    led him to eschew the cloudy and troubled atmosphere of war. The civil discord
                    which prevailed during the reign of his predecessor had inflicted numerous evils
                    on the nation, and to the alleviation of these Henry devoted the first years of
                    his reign. He issued a new coinage, of standard weight and purity; he drove
                    beyond seas the foreign mercenaries who had harboured in England during the
                    reign of Stephen; he seized the royal castles which had been usurped, and
                    demolished those which had been reared for the purpose of systematic plunder. By
                    these vigorous steps of reformation Henry secured the effective administration
                    of justice in his English dominions. One of the leading features of his
                    character was restless activity. On foot or on horseback he was perpetually in
                    motion; and the moments which he could spare from more important concerns were
                    usually devoted to the chase.</p>
                <p>Some of the leading events of Henry’s reign are associated with the name of
                    Thomas a Becket, who has been portrayed as a saint and martyr, or a hypocrite
                    and traitor, according to the religious bias of the historian who happened to
                    draw the picture. Under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Beckei</hi> an account
                    of this celebrated prelate wifl be found; and it is only necessary in this place
                    to allude to those events of his life which are identified with the history of
                    his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332456" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2456-0717"/>country.
                    One of Henry’s first measures was the promotion of this individual to the
                    chancellorship of England, in which capacity he vigorously seconded the measures
                    of reform which the king had undertaken. His administration has been
                    characterized as alike beneficial to the country and to the sovereign, who
                    loaded his favourite minister with honours and emoluments. By the advice of
                    Becket, Henry proposed a treaty of marriage between his eldest son and the
                    daughter of Louis king of France. On this occasion the chancellor undertook a
                    journey to Paris, displaying upon the occasion a pomp and parade transcendently
                    elaborate. Henry himself followed; and although a rupture ensued between the
                    sovereigns about the city of Toulouse, which belonged of right to the king of
                    England, their enmities terminated with the marriage of their children whilst
                    the infants were as yet in the cradle. We have now arrived at that period of
                    Becket’s life in which his conduct has been the subject of a kind of historical
                    crusade. In 1161 Theobald the archbishop of Canterbury died, and Becket was
                    recommended as his successor by the king. The clergy of England, however,
                    resisted the nomination, declaring it to be unseemly for a man who was rather a
                    soldier than a priest, and whose life had been devoted to hunting and falconry,
                    to be appointed an archbishop. More than twelve months elapsed between the
                    nomination and appointment, during which time Becket still retained the
                    chancellorship, and evinced no change in his feelings or way of living, which
                    was eminently worldly. He even went so far as to smile at the idea of
                    metamorphosing the gay and pompous Chancellor of England into the Archbishop of
                    Canterbury; and he appears himself to have thought that the choice arose from
                    Henry’s confidence that he would become the pliable instrument of his will in
                    ecclesiastical affairs. If the king anticipated such a consummation, never were
                    the hopes of man more miserably disappointed. For no sooner was Becket invested
                    with the primacy, than a change took place in his manners, more strongly
                    contrasted with his former life than were the two offices which he had held.
                    Instead of a train, which in splendour and fastidious pomp had rivalled the
                    retinue of kings, he chose a few monks the most conspicuous for their humility
                    and mortification. Instead of the oriental magnificence and gorgeousness of
                    apparel with which he loved to dazzle the eyes even of courtiers, he selected as
                    his chosen garment the roughest sackcloth. His sports and revels were exchanged
                    for deeds of penitence and humiliation. And thus far his conduct appears to have
                    been commendable; but did his future behaviour warrant a belief that this sudden
                    change was attributable to the sincere conviction of a pure and lofty spirit,
                    which had changed its views regarding the relative value of earthly and heavenly
                    things, or to the policy of a deep and designing hypocrite? The remaining
                    particulars of his life will best enable the reader to form his own judgment as
                    to this, which is one of the most disputed points in our history.</p>
                <p>The first step which Becket took after his promotion was to return the seals of
                    his former office to Henry, on the ground of his incompetency to hold two such
                    offices. This measure is said to have at first excited the indignation of the
                    king, who had never before heard Becket object to the prelacy on that account.
                    But it was not until 1163, when hostilities commenced between the church and the
                    state, that Becket and the king came fairly into collision. Previously to the
                    Norman conquest, ecclesiastical affairs had, like others, been decided before
                    the hundred, with the addition of the metropolitan sitting as one of the judges.
                    The Conqueror, however, had instituted a separate tribunal, where the clergy
                    were judged by a court composed of themselves, and from that time they were
                    independent of secular jurisdiction. Becket upheld this claim with firmness, as
                    he ought to have done, until it was formally set aside by the king and his
                    counsellors. This, however, did not justify the decisions which were pronounced,
                    and which had now become notoriously partial. Crimes of the darkest description
                    had frequently been perpetrated by ecclesiastics with the most scandalous
                    impunity; for the judges could not inflict capital, nor indeed any adequate
                    punishment. An abominable instance of seduction having attracted the notice of
                    the king, he determined that those chargeable with such atrocities should be
                    tried before the criminal tribunals of the state. For this purpose he summoned a
                    great council at Westminster, where he demanded that ecclesiastics, whenever
                    convicted of such offences, should be degraded, and handed over to a secular
                    justiciary. His question was, Would they agree to observe the ancient customs of
                    the realm? Becket answered yes, saving his order; an ambiguous reply, which was
                    echoed by the conclave of bishops present, with only one exception. But,
                    although not at this assembly, he was afterwards compelled to yield the point
                    without any reservation respecting his order. This formal assent was obtained at
                    the celebrated council of Clarendon, which took place on the 25th of January
                    1164. At this great or common council of the realm, for the word parliament had
                    not yet been introduced, Becket was compelled to yield compliance to the demands
                    of his sovereign. At first he peremptorily refused his acquiescence; but the
                    king, incensed at his obstinacy, menaced him with exile or death, whilst several
                    individuals of rank present entreated him with genuflections and tears to
                    submit; by which means a compliance was at last reluctantly wrung from him.
                    These customs and usages, the recognition of which was thus so vehemently urged,
                    were contained in sixteen articles, which were afterwards well known under the
                    name of the Institutions of Clarendon, by which it was enacted that clergymen
                    accused of any crime should be tried in civil courts; that laymen should not be
                    tried in spiritual courts, except by legal and reputable witnesses; that no
                    ecclesiastical person should quit the realm without the king’s license; that all
                    causes not ecclesiastical should be finally determined in the king’s court; that
                    all ecclesiastical persons who were tenants <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">capite</hi> of the crown should follow the king’s customs, sue and
                    be sued respecting their fiefs before his justices, and attend, like other
                    barons, at his courts; that vacant dignities in the church should be in the
                    king’s hands; and that he should also receive the profits of his seignorial
                    dues. These, with some others, to the number of sixteen, were subscribed by all
                    the ecclesiastics present, including Becket himself. He was now not only
                    mortified in the highest degree, but, pretending extreme contrition for what he
                    had done, did open penance for his supposed delinquency. He attempted to make
                    his escape to France, but was arrested for an offence against the institutions
                    which he had recently signed. Henry was now exasperated beyond all bounds at the
                    archbishop, and assembled a parliament at Northampton, obviously for the purpose
                    of crushing him. Becket was accordingly summoned to account for rents and
                    profits connected with his primacy. He arrayed himself in his sacerdotal
                    vestments, and, with the cross in his hand, proceeded to the place appointed.
                    The king complained to the council of the insolent behaviour of Becket, and the
                    whole assembly joined in condemning his inconsistency. The suit regarding rents,
                    which was only intended as a menace, he attempted to free himself from, by
                    pleading a release by Henry the king’s son; but this was overruled. After being
                    condemned as a perjured traitor, he left the palace, his eyes fixed upon the
                    cross, which he held uplifted in his hands; and, travelling in disguise, he <pb

                    of Sandwich, whence he immediately embarked for the Continent.</p>
                <p>Becket was received with marks of esteem by the king of France, and likewise by
                    the pope, whose cause he had so strenuously defended in England. When Henry
                    learned the flattering reception which the obnoxious exile had received, he
                    dispatched an embassy to expostulate with Louis, and sent another to Rome, to
                    justify his conduct to the pontiff. But the ambassadors were received with
                    coolness, if not with something which bordered upon contempt. The judgment of
                    the barons and bishops was annulled by the pope, and those who should invade the
                    property of the church were declared to be cut off from the society of the
                    faithful. Henry’s irritation had now reached its climax, and he resolved upon
                    taking a bold step, which, had the human mind been ripe for such a mtasure,
                    might have ended in the separation of the English church from that of Rome; but
                    this achievement was reserved for the Henry of a future day. He gave orders to
                    his justiciaries, prohibiting, under severe penalties, all appeals to the pope
                    or the archbishop, and forbidding any person to receive mandates from them, or
                    to apply to their authority; and he declared it treasonable to bring over from
                    either any interdict against the kingdom. On the other hand, the pope was not
                    slow in issuing his fulminations. Becket was ordered to excommunicate Henry’s
                    chief ministers, and put the see of Canterbury, including about three fourths of
                    the kingdom, under an interdict. But Henry stood firm, and looked with
                    indifference upon the papal lightnings which played around him. At last,
                    however, he began to dread the powers of his victim, chiefly on account of his
                    continental dominions, and proposed a reconciliation. The treaty of
                    accommodation, although more than once broken off, was finally concluded, and
                    Becket returned to the see of Canterbury without having been compelled to make
                    any express submission to the institutions of Clarendon.</p>
                <p>But the wounds had been too deep to be thus suddenly healed, and, though closed
                    at the surface, the venom still rankled underneath. The arrogance and
                    presumption of the primate returned along with his dignity. He refused
                    compliance with the terms of the general amnesty, and would not submit to take
                    the oath of homage for his baronry; neither would he withdraw the whole of the
                    ecclesiastical censure from the prelates who lay under it on account of their
                    obedience to the king’s commands. Several very imprudent excommunications soon
                    followed, and so provoked Henry that he is said to have dropped certain
                    passionate expressions, intimating something which was interpreted into a desire
                    that Becket’s life might be taken away. The supposed will of the king was
                    instantly accomplished by four knights of distinguished rank, who repaired to
                    the church of Canterbury, where the primate then officiated, and barbarously
                    slew him at the foot of the altar. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Becket.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus perished by foul murder, in the fifty-third year of his age, Thomas a
                    Becket, who, every thing considered, was probably the most remarkable man of his
                    time. That he believed he was all the while conscientiously performing his duty,
                    in preserving the immunities of the church, there seems little reason to doubt;
                    for he would not have met his fate with such heroic and martyr-like firmness
                    unless this had been the case. His virtues were of an austere character, and
                    wanted that amiable attractiveness which we usually associate with the character
                    of one who is profoundly inspired by the morality of the gospel. His vices, on
                    the other hand, were the reverse of mean and grovelling; for his spirit was
                    lofty and aspiring, and his designs were invested with a dazzling grandeur, and
                    pursued with a fearless firmness much more calculated to excite awe than
                    detestation, far less contempt. That Henry did not intend the murder of Becket,
                    appears certain from his subsequent conduct. He was thrown into the utmost
                    consternation on hearing of it, knowing well that the primate’s death would
                    accomplish what his most violent opposition during his lifetime could never have
                    effected. He abandoned himself to sorrow and mortification, and for some time
                    refused to take any nourishment. The pope was with some difficulty made sensible
                    of the king’s innocence; but declined to grant him a pardon, except on condition
                    that he should make every future submission, and perform every injunction which
                    the holy see thought proper to prescribe or impose. He was likewise enjoined to
                    perform a humiliating penance at the tomb of Becket, who was in due time
                    canonized as a saint and venerated as a martyr. The assassins, despairing of
                    pardon, sought refuge in a distant castle. By the pope they were enjoined to
                    make a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where they all died, and were buried before
                    the gate of the temple at Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>We come now to a very important event in the reign of Henry II. that is, the
                    annexation of Ireland to the English crown; but the details of his invasion it
                    is unnecessary to relate here, as they will come in due order to be treated of
                    under the head <hi rend="smallcaps">Ireland.</hi></p>
                <p>The king was scarcely freed from the Irish war, and the dangerous controversy in
                    which he had engaged with the church of Rome, when he found himself involved in
                    the most unnatural contests with his own children, to whom he had always behaved
                    in the most tender and affectionate manner. He had ordered Henry, his eldest
                    son, to be anointed king; and he had destined that prince as his successor in
                    the kingdom of England, the duchy of Normandy, and the counties of Anjou, Maine,
                    and Touraine, territories which lay contiguous, and which might thus easily
                    afford mutual assistance to each other when necessity required. Richard, his
                    second son, was invested with the duchy of Guienne and the county of Poitou;
                    Geoffrey, his third son, inherited, in right of his wife, the duchy of Brittany;
                    and the new conquest of Ireland was destined for John, his fourth and youngest
                    son. The last sixteen years of Henry’s life were embittered by family
                    hostilities. A mighty confederacy was secretly formed against him, in which his
                    three eldest sons participated. Louis VII. king of France, fed the discord; for
                    the power of the English monarch had now become so formidable as to excite alarm
                    and kindle up jealousy in the breasts of the continental sovereigns. The young
                    prince was persuaded to demand of his father some of the dominions which he had
                    been promised, and of which he was nominal sovereign; but he was refused. Upon
                    this the prince made his escape, and put himself under the protection of the
                    king of France. The French monarch then invaded Normandy; and Richard and
                    Geoffrey, the sons of King Henry, severally raised the standard of revolt in
                    Guienne and Bretagne. William the Lion, king of Scotland, considering this as a
                    favourable opportunity for invading England, advanced into the northern
                    counties, destroying all he met with. A great force of foreign mercenaries,
                    called Brabançons, landed in Sussex, under the command of the Earl of Leicester,
                    whilst Prince Henry collected another army in France in order to co-operate with
                    them. To meet this formidable coalition against his authority, King Henry made
                    the best preparations which circumstances admitted of; and if we may judge of
                    these by the results which followed, he must have taxed his constitutional
                    activity to the utmost in collecting forces, and in opposing a barrier to the
                    tide of war which thus rolled onward from every quarter, threatening to
                    overwhelm his throne. Few of his own barons could be depended upon, and he had
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332482" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2482-0719"/> recourse to
                    the foreign mercenaries so largely employed by his adversaries. Twenty thousand
                    of these auxiliaries enlisted under his banners, and with them were united such
                    of his own nobles and retainers as could be trusted.</p>
                <p>The enmity of the young princes against their father had been in no
                    inconsiderable degree excited and fostered by Eleanor their mother, whom the
                    incontinent and licentious life of Henry had for ever estranged from her
                    affections. She attempted to make her escape; but was taken prisoner, and
                    consigned to dose imprisonment, where, with the exception of a short interval,
                    she remained till the death of her husband.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile, the plan devised by the allies began to be acted upon, as
                    already indicated; but Henry of England proved himself superior to the
                    emergency. His foreign enemies were on all sides discomfited, and William of
                    Scotland having accidentally fallen into the hands of Henry, the Scottish army
                    broke up and dispersed. Their sovereign afterwards obtained his freedom by the
                    humiliating surrender of his authority as king of Scotland; for conceding to
                    Henry the title of lord paramount of his kingdom was virtually casting his crown
                    at the feet of his enemy. A pacification was brought about at Falaise, on the
                    28th of September 1174, by which the princes were pardoned and enriched with new
                    liberalities.</p>
                <p>King Henry, however, was permitted to enjoy but a few years of repose. The
                    dissensions between him and his children again broke out. The latter also
                    quarrelled amongst themselves, and a most unnatural war ensued, in which neither
                    party gave quarter. But the death of Henry, the eldest son, for a time suspended
                    these disputes. This unfortunate prince died in 1183, of a fever brought on by
                    vexation and fatigue. Three years afterwards Geoffrey perished beneath the feet
                    of a horse in a tournament at Paris, so that the subjects of discord were
                    diminished. The widow of Geoffrey, soon after his decease, was delivered of a
                    son, who was named Arthur, and invested with the duchy of Brittany, under the
                    guardianship of his grandfather, who, as duke of Normandy, was also suzerain
                    lord of that territory. Philip, as lord paramount, disputed the title of the
                    English king to this wardship; but he was obliged to yield to the wishes of the
                    Bretons, who preferred the government of Henry. Some other causes inflamed the
                    dissension between these monarchs, and Philip once more seduced Richard from his
                    duty. He insisted that the marriage of that prince with Adelais, his sister,
                    should be immediately completed, and threatened to enforce his demands with a
                    formidable army. This lady had been confined for a long time in a castle by
                    Henry, who procrastinated the nuptials, until a suspicion arose that he intended
                    to appropriate her to himself. At the conclusion of the truce which had followed
                    the death of Geoffrey, Richard finally forsook his father, and did homage to the
                    king of France for his continental dominions.</p>
                <p>For some time the eyes of the monarchs of Christendom had been turned to
                    Palestine, which the Sultan Saladin was overrunning with his mighty hosts. Henry
                    of England was desirous of taking the cross and proceeding to Syria, but his
                    perpetual contests with his family detained him until the holy city was taken by
                    the infidels. The news of this event awakened feelings of regret and indignation
                    throughout Christendom. The Emperor of Germany marched his bravest knights
                    towards Asia. Philip of France and Henry agreed to follow, but the union of the
                    former with Richard the son of the latter compelled the king of England, in the
                    first place, to look to the defence of his own territories, which were once more
                    invaded by the confederates. The war proved very unfortunate for Henry, who lost
                    several towns, and very narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the enemy. A
                    treaty was at length agreed to, but the terms of it were very humiliating to the
                    English monarch. With a heart overwhelmed with grief, he returned to the castle
                    of Chinon, where he soon afterwards expired, on the 6th of July 1189, in the
                    thirty-fifth year of his reign and the fifty-seventh of his age. Upon his
                    death-bed he was sedulously attended by one of his natural sons, the fruit of an
                    amour with Rosamond, whom popular romance and tradition have surnamed the Fair,
                    and invested with every virtue but one. Henry was interred with little pomp in
                    the convent of Fon-tevraud, in the presence of his rebellious son Richard, and a
                    few knights; but Eleanor, his queen, survived him many years, having been
                    liberated by her son Richard. The character of Henry II. has been already
                    detailed at sufficient length. During his reign important changes in ancient law
                    and usage were matured, and became conspicuous, on which account they have been
                    ascribed to the administration of this monarch; but it is more probable that
                    they resulted from the slow growth of circumstances, with little aid from
                    rulers, who were perhaps unconscious that any change had occurred.<note

                <p>Richard I. succeeded to the throne without opposition, and was crowned on the 3d
                    of September 1189. The reign of this monarch, the Achilles of modern Europe, is
                    interwoven with events which are more akin to romance .than to real history. His
                    life is made up of the adventures of a knight-errant. His character was a
                    singular compound of qualities noble and mean; of the grand and the grovelling,
                    the sublime and the grotesque. It has been thus drawn by Mr Turner, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of England:</hi> “Haughty, irascible, and vindictive, a
                    towering and barbaric grandeur, verging sometimes into barbarian cruelty,
                    distinguished his actions. Valiant beyond the common measure of human daring,
                    unparalleled in his feats of prowess; inferior to no man in hardihood, strength,
                    and agility; stern and inflexible in his temper; rapacious and selfish, yet
                    frequently liberal to profusion; gorgeous to ostentation, yet often gay,
                    familiar, satirical, and jocular; unshaken by adversity; resolute to obstinacy,
                    furious in warfare, fond of battle, and always irresistibly victorious; his life
                    seems rather the fiction of a poet’s imagination than the sober portrait
                    ofauthentic history.” But this character for martial prowess and heroism was
                    softened by a love of literature, particularly Provençal poetry; and although
                    the specimens of his compositions which have been transmitted to us scarcely
                    deserve the name of poetry, still they evince the presence of the passion in his
                    mind. It was the same sentiment which thus penetrated the tempestuous atmosphere
                    so congenial to his soul that imbued his exploits with the spirit of genius and
                    romance. An overweening love of praise added its inspiration to his feelings,
                    and contributed to render his actions pre-eminently conspicuous even in the high
                    and palmy age of chivalry. He had no sooner ascended the throne than he began to
                    make arrangements for joining the new levies of crusaders preparing to embark
                    for the Holy Land. In such a sphere nature had fitted.the king of England to
                    shine without a rival. His landing in Palestine was destined to mark an era,
                    when the Moslemins were to encounter a warrior superior even to the most
                    distinguished of their own in lofty daring and proud contempt of danger, and
                    when the brows of their bravest chieftains were to darken at the name of
                    Richard.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332495" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2495-0720"/>
                <p>At his coronation an event occurred which it is painful to mention, and too
                    shocking to give in detail. The Jews, eager to express their fealty to the new
                    sovereign, approached him in numbers, bearing rich presents of gold and silver,
                    commodities which they well knew would be peculiarly acceptable to the king. In
                    their endeavours to press forward towards the hall door during the state dinner,
                    a scuffle ensued. The Jews resisted the ill treatment they received, which so
                    inflamed the passions of the English mob that they arose upon the defenceless
                    strangers, and drove away or destroyed them. This example of violence spread not
                    only over the city, but throughout the country; and the unfortunate Israelites
                    were massacred and plundered without mercy. It was in vain that the king
                    attempted to allay the tumult; the sanguinary rabble would not desist until its
                    ferocity and rapacity were completely satiated.</p>
                <p>Richard having equipped his armament, and acquired the necessary treasure by
                    every means in his power (and from his natural impatience he was never
                    scrupulous upon that point), joined Philip of France and marched with him to
                    Lyons. As the principal events connected with this expedition are already
                    embodied in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Crusades,</hi> we shall not
                    recapitulate here the whole details, but only notice such as have not been there
                    introduced. On his way Richard relieved Portugal, by joining the sovereign of
                    that country with five hundred knights, and bidding defiance to the Moors or
                    Saracens. This was an evil omen for the followers of the Prophet. After landing
                    at Messina, he remained there six months, which were chiefly occupied in warm
                    disputes with Tancred, who had usurped the Sicilian crown. On the 10th of April
                    1191 Richard set sail from this place; but his fleet having been dispersed by a
                    storm, and the ship in which were his sister Joan, and his betrothed wife
                    Bcrengaria, being driven into Cyprus, he landed on that island for the purpose
                    of chastising the governor, who had treated the royal ladies with some
                    discourtesy. Richard reduced the whole island, and after marrying Berengaria,
                    and causing her to be crowned queen of England, he set sail for St Jean d’Acre,
                    which afterwards surrendered to him. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Acre.)</hi> The
                    fall of this place opened the way to Jerusalem, towards which he now advanced,
                    performing on his way those chivalrous deeds which taught the infidels to
                    shudder at the apparition of his name. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Crusades.)</hi>
                    In October 1192 Richard set sail from the Holy Land for England, with a fleet,
                    which contained his wife and sister, who appear to have reached their
                    destination in safety. But a storm having dispersed the ships, Richard was
                    driven near Marseilles. Having learned, however, that plans were in agitation to
                    seize his person (for Philip of France and other continental sovereigns,
                    together with his brother, were leagued against him), he formed the unfortunate
                    resolution of passing through Germany in disguise.</p>
                <p>He landed at Zara, and after a variety of adventures and hairbreadth escapes, he
                    was at last arrested by Leopold, duke of Austria, who immediately ordered him to
                    be loaded with fetters. This prince had served under Richard at the siege of
                    Acre, where he received, or imagined he had received, some injury at his hands,
                    and took this base method of revenging himself. Henry VI. emperor of Germany,
                    was then equally an enemy to Richard, on account of his having married
                    Bercngaria, the daughter of Tancred king of Sicily. He therefore required the
                    royal captive to be delivered into his hands, and stipulated to pay a large sum
                    of money to the duke as a reward for his services.</p>
                <p>The disaster which had befallen the English monarch could not be long concealed.
                    The news of his captivity spread general indignation at home; a feeling which
                    was responded to by the disinterested portion of Europe. Richard’s mother, along
                    with the clergy of Germany, appealed to the pope; and the emperor, finding that
                    his conduct was condemned as disgraceful, made an attempt to justify it, by
                    charging his prisoner with several weighty crimes. These were, his behaviour in
                    Sicily, his conquest of Cyprus, and the alleged murder of Conrad, who was
                    assassinated whilst contending for the Christian kingdom of Palestine. The
                    latter charge being by far the most serious, every effort was made to vindicate
                    Richard from the guilt of the alleged crime. At home the ministry exerted
                    themselves to the utmost; and the most able prelates set out for the Continent
                    to bargain for his ransom, He was removed from a dungeon in the Tyrol to the
                    residence of the emperor at Haguenau, and was taken from thence to Worms, for a
                    final adjustment of differences.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile, his brother John, with Philip of France, were busily
                    prosecuting their plans for his destruction. Their design was to effect the
                    utter ruin of Richard; and every method was tried to accomplish their purpose.
                    John made his feudal submission to Philip for his brother’s continental
                    possessions; and having assembled an army, he returned to England with the
                    intention of seizing the crown, whilst his colleague invaded Normandy. Both the
                    confederates were completely unsuccessful. John, by circulating false reports of
                    his brother’s death, attempted to give a gloss of right to his projected
                    usurpation; but his duplicity was too well known, and his armament of foreign
                    mercenaries was repulsed from the coast.</p>
                <p>The negociations for Richard’s liberation ended at last in the agreement that a
                    ransom of one hundred thousand marks of silver should be paid for it. It was in
                    vain that his mortal enemies, Philip and John, protracted his imprisonment. By a
                    general tax the sum was raised; and soon after his emancipation he set out for
                    England, where he arrived on the 13th of March 1194. The remainder of his reign
                    is very unimportant; it was chiefly occupied with a species of petty bickerings
                    with Philip of France. The money required for the crusade, and the ransom of
                    Richard, had so exhausted the finances of England, that the king found himself
                    unable to undertake war upon a grand scale. If we contemplate the character of
                    the individual who found himself thus fettered by pecuniary necessities, this
                    was a fortunate circumstance. It would be difficult to estimate the amount of
                    human misery which was thus saved. After various undecisive battles and
                    equivocal victories, Richard was mortally wounded before Chaluze, an obscure
                    castle in the province of Limousin, held by a rebellious vassal, and expired on
                    the 6th of April 1199, in the forty-second year of his age and the tenth of his
                    reign.</p>
                <p>Thus perished, in the prime of life, one of the most romantic characters to be

                    discover any thing in which it added to the civilization or prosperity of the
                    country. For the immense sums of money which he drew from it, the only <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193332534" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2534-0721"/> return worthy of
                    notice was an equalization of weights and measures throughout the realm.</p>
                <p>John, the brother of the late king, and the youngest legitimate son of Henry IL,
                    succeeded to the throne without opposition; for, although the hereditary right,
                    according to the modern acceptation of the term, was vested in his nephew
                    Arthur, son of John’s elder brother Geoffrey, the uncle had likewise a
                    hereditary claim, as being nearest of kin to the deceased monarch, and the
                    nation declared in his favour. His coronation took place on the 27th of May
                    1199. The character of John is perhaps more strongly marked, and possesses more
                    individuality, than that of any other monarch on the list of English kings. In
                    cowardly villany, in perfidious malignity, in base ingratitude, in unprincipled
                    cruelty, in grossness of appetite, in meanness, weakness, and every vicious
                    infirmity, this prince figures in the page of history almost without a rival.
                    Other kings there may have been whose vices are black enough to call forth the
                    execrations of posterity; but the halo of talent which emblazons their names
                    serves to mitigate the severity of censure. John, however, stands before us
                    utterly divested of any such quality; his character is unredeemed by one
                    solitary virtue; his reign is unillustrated by one solitary good action
                    performed without compulsion. He is altogether alone, the lowest and most abject
                    slave that ever wore a crown.</p>
                <p>Richard had destined Arthur as his successor, and, on his death, Mons, Tours, and
                    Anjou, appointed the youth, then Earl of Bretagne, their lord. Onthe assumption
                    of the crown of England and the dukedom of Normandy by John, Constance, the
                    mother of Arthur, gave her son over to the care of Philip, king of France, who
                    claimed for him his continental possessions. A struggle ensued between the
                    monarchs of France and England. Philip, who, it would appear, used Arthur
                    entirely as a tool to suit his own purposes, sent him with a military retinue
                    into the dominions to which he laid claim. He took the town of Mirabeau, saving
                    a tower, which held out under Eleanor, the widow of Henry II.; but on the night
                    between the 31st of July and 1st of August 1202, John arrived, and compelled the
                    besiegers to surrender. The prisoners were treated with a cruelty truly
                    demoniacal, and worthy of the man; but this was only the opening scene of the
                    tragedy. Prince Arthur was brought to Falaise, where he was confined for some
                    time. He then all of a sudden disappeared, and contemporary history has ascribed
                    to John the guilt of his murder. That the hapless youth met with a violent death
                    is evident, and that he fell either by his uncle’s own hands, or by his orders,
                    there seems no reason to doubt. Even in that semi-barbarous age, there was
                    scarcely an individual capable of committing such an atrocity, excepting the
                    wretch who, a few years afterwards, took a diabolical pleasure in starving to
                    death the wife and children of a nobleman who had offended him, and hanging
                    twenty-eight Welsh hostages, besides other atrocities too horrible to be
                    named.</p>
                <p>By this foul deed, a third part of John’s dominions were wrenched from his grasp.
                    Philip Augustus summoned John, as duke of Normandy and Aquitaine, to answer
                    before a court of peers to the charge of having murdered Arthur duke of
                    Brittany. But he dreaded the tribunal, and having refused to appear, he was
                    branded as a murderer, condemned to death, and adjudged to lose all his French
                    territories. The king of France moved onwards from conquest to conquest, and one
                    by one the provinces of the English monarch were seized and annexed to the
                    dominions of Philip; Touraine, Maine, and Anjou in 1203, the duchy of Normandy
                    in 1205, and the county of Poitou in 1206.</p>
                <p>Another important event in the reign of John was his contest with the pope, the
                    only contest indeed in which he ever displayed any thing of that spirit which
                    had fired the bosoms of his ancestors. The clergy had for some time acted as a
                    community independent of the civil power, owning subjection to the pope alone,
                    by whom their elections were usually confirmed. The election of the Archbishop
                    of Canterbury had been a subject of contention between the suffragan bishops of
                    the province, and the monks of St Augustin’s Abbey in that city. Each party
                    claimed the right of choosing; but under this question was concealed the more
                    important one, whether the king or the pope had the power of nomination; for the
                    bishops were accessible to the influence of the crown, and the monks, in
                    consistency with the genius of their order, were biassed by Rome. In the mean
                    time the archbishop died, and the monks privately elected Reginald their
                    superior in ħis room. The bishops remonstrated against this as an innovation on
                    their privileges; and the king took part in the contest, with the resolution of
                    raising the Bishop of Norwich to the primacy. The cause was appealed to Rome;
                    and Pope Innocent HL, eager to^extend his power in England, commanded the
                    election of Stephen Langton, a most unexceptionable individual, and one who, in
                    the sequel, proved himself eminently worthy of the highest station. John,
                    however, incensed at this proceeding, violently expelled the monks from their
                    convent, took possession of it himself, and seized upon the revenues. The tiara,
                    however, was not to be thus contemptuously treated. An interdict was threatened,
                    unless compliance with the wishes of the papal court was immediately yielded. In
                    vain the prelates in the most supplicating manner entreated the king to give his
                    consent to the measure. With that stoical indifference to human suffering which
                    he uniformly evinced, he determined that both himself and the nation should
                    brave the vengeance of Rome. He swore that if it descended upon him, he would
                    banish the whole clergy, and confiscate their possessions. The pope, however,
                    laughed his menaces to scorn, and published that terrible interdict, which in
                    those ages was calculated to make the heart of a nation tremble. A stop was
                    immediately put to divine service, and the administration of all the rites of
                    religion except baptism, and the confession, absolution, and extreme unction to
                    the dying. The chürch-doors were shut, and the images of the saints deposed. The
                    dead were refused Christian burial, and thrown promiscuously into ditches and on
                    the highways, without any funeral solemnity. Other injunctions, equally severe,
                    were included in this formidable interdict; and John, in revenge, persecuted the
                    clergy with unsparing rigour. But his furious and imprudent efforts proved
                    useless. Innocent remained firm, and, in two years thereafter, 1209, launched
                    his last thunderbolt at the English monarch. He excommunicated John, absolved
                    his subjects from their oath of allegiance, and soon afterwards deposed him. He
                    also commissioned the king of France to take his crown; and published a crusade
                    all over Christendom against King John, exhorting the chivalry of Europe to take
                    up arms against him, and enlist under the French banner. Philip was not less
                    active on his part. He summoned all the vassals of the crown to attend him at
                    Rouen; and having collected a fleet of 1700 vessels, was ready in 1213 to invade
                    England.</p>
                <p>But the fulminations of the pope were alike disregarded by John and his subjects,
                    who had now become familiar with them. His strength does not appear to have been
                    lessened, for the only successful expeditions of his reign, those against
                    Ireland and Wales, were undertaken during the period of his proscription by the
                    see of Rome. In order to meet the king of France, he assembled a vast army; but
                    it was not the interest of his holiness to allow matters <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332547" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2547-0722"/>to be carried to extremities.
                    He accordingly sent over two legates, Pandulf and Durand, who, in a meeting <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> parliament holden at Northampton, ventured to declare to
                    John that he was bound to obey the holy see as much in temporal as in spiritual
                    affairs. After shuffling, according to custom, John, at the head of an army
                    capable of bidding defiance to any invader, surrendered himself to the will of
                    the pope, and acceded to all the terms which Pandulf had exacted. With a
                    meanness of spirit almost exceeding belief, he laid his crown at the feet of the
                    haughty legate, resigned England and Ireland into the hands of the pope, swore
                    homage to him as his liege lord, and took an oath of fealty to his successors.
                    The terms of this remarkable oath deserve a place in every history.</p>
                <p>“I John, by the grace of God king of England and lord of Ireland, in order to
                    expiate my sins, from my own free will and the advice of my barons, <hi
                    rend="italic">give</hi> to the church of Rome, to Pope Innocent and his
                    successors, the kingdom of England, and all other prerogatives of my crown. I
                    will hereafter hold them as the pope’s vassal. I will be faithful to God, to the
                    church of Rome, to the pope <hi rend="italic">my master,</hi> and to his
                    successors legitimately elected. I promise to pay him a tribute of 1000 merks;
                    to wit, 700 for the kingdom of England, and 300 for the kingdom of Ireland.”
                    This memorable submission took place on the 15th of May 1213.</p>
                <p>This oath was taken by the king before all the people, kneeling, and with his
                    hands held up between those of the legate. Having then agreed to install Langton
                    in the primacy, he received the crown which he had been supposed to have
                    forfeited; whilst the legate, to add to his former insolence, trampled under his
                    feet the tribute which John had consented to pay, but afterwards stooped to
                    gather it up. The king of France was enraged at this behaviour of the pope, and
                    resolved to execute his project of conquering England in spite of him and his
                    censures. His fleet, however, was attacked in their harbours by the English, who
                    took three hundred vessels, and destroyed about a hundred more; whilst Philip,
                    finding it impossible to prevent the rest from falling into the hands of the
                    enemy, set fire to them hiłnself, and thus abandoned the enterprise. This naval
                    action is memorable as being the first which took place between the fleets of
                    France and England, and was a good omen for the latter.</p>
                <p>John being thus delivered from all danger, continued to follow the same cruel and
                    tyrannical measures which had hitherto rendered him odious to his subjects. His
                    scandalous subjection to the clergy now gave the barons an opportunity of
                    exerting themselves, in order to reduce the enormous prerogatives of the crown.
                    Their designs were greatly facilitated by the concurrence of Langton the
                    primate, who on all occasions showed a sincere regard for the interests of the
                    kingdom. At a synod of his prelates and clergy, convened in St Paul’s on
                    pretence of examining into the losses of some bishops who had been exiled by
                    John, he privately conferred with a number of barons, to whom he expatiated upon
                    the vices and injustice of their sovereign. He showed them a copy of Henry I.’s
                    charter, the only one in the kingdom, having been found amidst the rubbish of an
                    obscure monastery. Langton exhorted the barons to insist on a renewal thereof;
                    and this they solemnly swore to perform. The same agreement was afterwards
                    renewed at a more numerous meeting of barons summoned by Langton at St
                    Edmondsbury. Here it was resolved that at Christmas they should prefer their
                    common petition in a body, and in the mean time they separated, intending to put
                    themselves in a posture of defence, to enlist men, and to make other warlike
                    preparations. In the beginning of January 1215 they repaired to London,
                    accoutred in the military garb and with their equipage, and presented their
                    petition to the king, alleging that he had promised to grant a confirmation of
                    the laws of Edward the Confessor, at the time when he was absolved from his
                    excommunication. John resented their presumption; and required a promise under
                    their hands and seals that they would never demand or attempt to extort such
                    privileges in future. But this they refused with such unanimity and resolution,
                    that the king desired time to consider of their petition; at the same time
                    promising that, at the festival of Easter, he would give a positive answer. He
                    also offered securities, which the barons accepted, and thereafter withdrew.</p>
                <p>John, however, had no intention of complying with their demands, for it is
                    evident that his promise was extorted from him by fear. He had recourse to the
                    clergy, whose favour he propitiated by promising many things which he had not
                    the slightest intention of ever performing. The pope was likewise appealed to,
                    who threw the weight of his authority into the scale of his vassal, and exhorted
                    the barons to abandon their treasonable enterprise. At the same time his
                    holiness also agreed to consider their petition, and to endeavour to obtain for
                    them the concession of those demands which appeared to be just. But, happily for
                    English liberty, the confederates disregarded the injunctions of Innocent III.,
                    who by his decision had now more embroiled the fray. Both parties gave up all
                    hopes of a peaceful negociation at the ensuing festival, and made the best
                    preparations they could for war, in which the barons had an unequivocal
                    superiority.</p>
                <p>After waiting until Easter, when the king promised to return them an answer, they
                    met by agreement at Stamford. There they assembled a forefâ of above two
                    thousand knights, with a prodigious number of foot, and thence marched to
                    Brackley, about fifteen miles from Oxford, then the court residence. John,
                    hearing of their approach, sent the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Earl of
                    Pembroke, and others of his council, to know the particulars of their request,
                    and what those liberties were which they so much importuned him to grant. The
                    barons delivered a schedule containing the chief articles of their demands,
                    founded on the charters of Henry and Edward, but which were in the highest
                    degree displeasing to the king. He burst into a furious passion, and, asking the
                    barons why they did not also demand his kingdom, swore that he would never
                    comply with such exorbitant requests. The confederates then as their general
                    chose Robert Fitzwalter, whom they dignified with the title of Mareschal of the
                    army of God and of the holy church. They laid siege to Northampton, but were
                    repulsed; they, however, took Bedford, and were joyfully received into
                    London.</p>
                <p>The concurrence of the metropolis proved decisive of the contest. It was in vain
                    that the pope fulminated a bull in favour of his vassal John; the many were
                    unanimous, and the few were compelled to yield the point. The king, with a court
                    now reduced to seven attendants, retired to Odiham, where, seeing the necessity
                    of submitting, he agreed to a friendly conference. The barons named, as a proper
                    place for meeting, Runnymede. It was a meadow situated between Staines and
                    Windsor, and, like the holy ground of the Hebrews, it is still held in
                    veneration as the spot where the standard of English freedom was first unfurled.
                    On the 15th of June 1215, both parties met there; and having taken up separate
                    stations, a long discussion ensued, which terminated in the king signing the
                    charter, called, by way of pre-eminence, Magna Charta. For a particular account
                    of the great charter, which for centuries afterwards was looked upon as the
                    palladium of our national freedom, the reader is referred to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Magna</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Charta.</hi></p>
                <p>This charter, however, at the time when it was granted, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332560" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2560-0723"/>secured liberty to the
                    clergy, the barons, and the gentlemen, much more than to the bulk of tĥe people,
                    who did not for a long time obtain any privileges of importance. Freedom of
                    elections was secured to the clergy; and it was determined that fines imposed on
                    them for any offence should be laid on in proportion to their estates, and not
                    the value of their benefices. The privileges secured to the barons were, either
                    abatements in the rigour of the feudal laws, or relief from arbitrary and
                    ambiguous decisions before the courts. It was also decreed that barons should
                    recover the lands of their vassals, even though forfeited by felony, after
                    having been in the possession of the crown for a year and a day; and no tax was
                    to be imposed without consent of the great council of the nation, excepting in
                    case of the captivity of the king, the knighting of his eldest son, or the
                    marriage of his eldest daughter. No land belonging to any baron was to be seized
                    for a crown debt, except when the possessor had not personal property enough to
                    pay it; neither was any vassal to be allowed to sell so much of his land as to
                    incapacitate him from performing the necessary service to his lord. It was also
                    determined, that when the great council of the nation was called, the prelates,
                    earls, and barons should be summoned by a particular writ, and that the lesser
                    barons should receive a summons from the sheriff. In favour of the people it was
                    stipulated, that they should receive from the barons all the immunities and
                    privileges granted by the king to the former. Merchants were to be allowed to
                    carry on their business without any arbitrary tolls or impositions, and to go
                    out of the kingdom and return at pleasure. The goods of every freeman were to be
                    disposed of according to his will; or if he died intestate, the nearest heir was
                    in that case to succeed him. No carts, horses, or wood were to be taken by the
                    crown officers without the consent of the owner. The king’s courts were to be
                    stationary; no delay was to take place in doing justice to every one; and no
                    freeman was to be taken or imprisoned, dispossessed of his free tenement,
                    outlawed, or banished, unless by the legal judgment of his peers. It was
                    likewise stipulated that London should remain in the hands of the barons, and
                    that the Tower should be consigned to the primate, till the 15th of August
                    following, or till the articles contained in the charter were fulfilled. In
                    order to secure the accomplishment of this, the king allowed them to choose
                    twenty-five of their own number, to whose authority no limits were assigned. If
                    any complaint were made of a violation of the charter, either by the king or his
                    officers, any four of the barons might admonish the king to redress the
                    grievance; and if satisfaction were not obtained, they might assemble the whole
                    council of twenty-five and, in conjunction with the great council, compel him to
                    fulfil the charter. In case of his resistance, they had liberty to levy war
                    against him, attack his castles, and use every kind of violence, except against
                    his person, or those of his queen or children. All men throughout the kingdom
                    were bound, under the penalty of confiscation, to swear obedience to the
                    twenty-five barons; and the freeholders of each county were to choose twelve
                    knights, whose business it was to report such obnoxious customs as ought to be
                    redressed in terms of Magna Charta.</p>
                <p>But although John had thus been obliged to recognise the liberty of his subjects,
                    he had no mind that they should in reality enjoy it. The sense of his subjection
                    to his own vassals sunk deep into his soul, and he became sullen, silent, and
                    reserved. He shunned the society of his former friends, and retired into the
                    Isle of Wight, as if to hide his disgrace in solitude, but, in reality, to
                    meditate plans of revenge. He sent to the Continent in order to enlist a large
                    body of mercenary troops, and made heavy com plaints to the pope on account of
                    the insurrections of the barons against him. The pontiff, as might be expected,
                    warmly espoused his cause; a bull was sent over annulling the whole charter; the
                    principal barons were excommunicated by name, and declared to be worse than
                    Saracens; and at the same time the foreign troops arriving, the king once more
                    found himself in a condition to demand his own terms from his untractable
                    subjects.</p>
                <p>The barons had made no preparations for war, not suspecting the introduction of a
                    foreign army. The king, therefore, was for some time undisputed master of the
                    field, and the most horrid cruelties were committed by his army. The nobility
                    who had been most active in procuring the great charter accordingly fled with
                    their families to Scotland, where they obtained the protection of King Alexander
                    by doing homage to him. The barons, finding themselves totally unable to raise
                    an army capable of contending with that of John, resorted to the equivocal and
                    perilous expedient of calling in foreign aid. They applied to their old enemy
                    Philip of France, offering the crown to his eldest son Louis, upon the condition
                    of their being protected from the fury of John, and the unprincipled mercenaries
                    whom he commanded. The French king eagerly accepted their proposals, and
                    dispatched his son with a powerful army to England. He was received by the
                    barons with great acclamations, and having united their forces, they secured all
                    the southern counties. Essex and Sussex were soon after added; and they advanced
                    successfully into Norfolk, spreading around them all the devastations of civil
                    war. The forces of John occupied the northern districts, where the king of
                    Scotland harassed him by an invasion of Northumberland. But these hostilities,
                    which might ultimately have ruined the independence of the country, by sinking
                    it to the level of a French province, were happily terminated by the death of
                    John, in the forty-ninth year of his age, and seventeenth of his reign. His
                    demise took place at Newark, on the 19th of October 1216. The death of this
                    monarch was as much a public blessing as his reign had been a national
                    misfortune. The signing of Magna Charta is the only event of his life which is
                    worthy of being recorded in history. He, however, deserves no credit for that
                    act, which was the result of compulsion. As well might we consider honesty the
                    actuating principle or motive of the malefactor who consents to deliver up the
                    treasure of which he had possessed himself, when he comes in sight of the wheel
                    upon which, in case of refusal, he is to be broken alive.</p>
                <p>John left six legitimate children, namely, three sons and three daughters. The
                    eldest of the former, Henry of Winchester, was only ten years of age when he
                    found himself in possession of the title, although not entirely of the power, of
                    king. He was crowned as Henry III. upon the 28th of October 1216, nine days
                    after he succeeded to the inchoate right to the throne. The care of his person
                    was entrusted to the Earl of Pembroke, earl-marshal, with the style and title of
                    guardian of the kingdom. Through the instrumentality of this nobleman the great
                    charter of liberties was revived, and the claims of the crown were reconciled
                    with those of the subject, to the satisfaction of the adverse barons. Besides
                    the eldest son of John, there was another competitor for the crown, namely,
                    Louis of France, who had been called over by the barons of Runnymede, in order
                    to take possession of the English throne. For some time Louis kept the field,
                    and not without success; but he was defeated at Lincoln; and a fleet which his
                    father had sent to him with succours having been totally destroyed by the
                    English, he was compelled to abandon the enterprise, and to make an honourable
                    retreat.</p>
                <p>A peaceful king is looked upon either as imbecile or as pusillanimous by an age
                    which feels the intoxication of military glory, and considers the principal
                    duties of a monarch<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332573"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2573-0724"/> to be “tó go out and in before his people, and
                    fight their battles.” The reign of Henry III. is but little adorned with the
                    triumphs of war; and, if we are not mistaken, it has been too much depreciated
                    on this account. But this fact, as well as his monarchical character, we will be
                    enabled to ascertain with more certainty after we have passed in review the
                    principal events of his reign. Its early history exhibits only some of those
                    evils incident to an injudicious, but not, strictly speaking, wicked
                    administration. In 1225 the great charter was a third time confirmed, upon the
                    occasion of Henry assembling a great council, and urgently demanding aid against
                    a pretended invasion of the French. In consequence of this, it has ever since
                    retained its place at the head of English statutes. The wardship of the young
                    king had now solely devolved upon Hubert de Burgh, the grand justiciary, and a
                    man of ability and spirit, but nurtured under Richard and John. For several
                    years he ruled as the favourite without control, repressing the disorders of the
                    times with a vigorous, but, in the eye of an enlightened age, cruel policy. In
                    1227, Henry was declared in parliament to have attained to the years of
                    discretion; and two years afterwards he resumed the project of conquering
                    France, and landed there with a considerable army. The expedition proved most
                    disgraceful to the English arms; and in a year after he returned to his country
                    not a little humbled in its estimation, as well as his own. The next event of
                    importance which we meet with is the disgrace of De Burgh, who was accused of
                    negligence and treachery in the discharge of his duties; with what degree of
                    truth it is difficult now to determine. He was imprisoned for some time, but
                    afterwards restored to liberty, honours, and emoluments.</p>
                <p>In 1236, Henry espoused Eleanor of Provence. This event gave rise to anew
                    immigration of foreigners of higher rank and more specious pretensions than
                    those who usually flocked to the soil of England. One of the queen’s uncles
                    became prime minister, a second was made primate, and a third Earl of Richmond.
                    This favouritism excited much discontent both amongst the native barons and the
                    people. The other events of this long reign consist of petty wars and bickerings
                    with France, Scotland, and Wales. The prodigality of the king was extreme, and
                    he was repeatedly compelled to lay his necessities before parliament and solicit
                    supplies. These were as often afforded; but notwithstanding these grants, he had
                    frequent recourse, under specious pretexts, to the most unjust exactions.
                    Meanwhile England rapidly increased in wealth, and widely extended her
                    commercial relations with other countries.</p>
                <p>In the year 1254, at the instance of the pope, Henry accepted of the crown of
                    Sicily for his son Edmund. It had been formerly offered to his brother Richard,
                    who was wise enough not to accept of it, probably because he felt himself unable
                    to compete with the other powerful princes who aspired to it. In order to raise
                    the money necessary to carry his foolish project into execution, Henry had
                    recourse to every expedient which the regal or papal ministers could devise. The
                    principal burden fell upon the clergy, who, by the menace of excommunication on
                    the one side, and of forfeiture on the other, were compelled to submit. This
                    oppression widened more and more the breach between the king and his people; and
                    he found it necessary at last to look to the security of his own crown, instead
                    of fighting for a foreign diadem to grace the brow of his son.</p>
                <p>Amongst the foreigners of distinction who established themselves in England
                    during the reign of Henry III. was Simon de Montfort, earl of Leicester. He was
                    the younger son of the Count de Montfort, celebrated in the annals of religious
                    warfare for his cruel crusade against those dissenters from the Roman faith
                    called Albigois or Albigenses. Simon the younger received the hand of King Henry
                    s sister in marriage, and very early began to act a conspicuous part in the
                    civil commotions which agitated the country. He was a bold and ambitious man;
                    and placing himself at the head of the disaffected barons, he formed a powerful
                    confederacy against the king. In the year 1258, a famous parliament was summoned
                    at Oxford, in order to digest the new plan of government, and to elect to the
                    chief authority such individuals as were deemed worthy of trust. This assembly,
                    afterwards celebrated in our annals by the derisive name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">mad parliament,</hi> went very expeditiously to work in the
                    business of reformation. Twenty-four barons were appointed, with supreme
                    authority, in order to reform the abuses of the state; and Leicester was placed
                    at their head. Twelve of these barons were chosen by the king’s council, and
                    twelve by the parliament. Their first step was to order four knights to be
                    chosen out of each county, who should examine into the state of their respective
                    constituents, and attend at the ensuing parliament to give information of their
                    complaints. They ordained that three sessions of parliament should be regularly
                    held every year; that a new high sheriff should be elected annually; that no
                    wards nor castles should be entrusted to foreigners, no new forests made, nor
                    the revenues of any counties farmed out. Thus far these provisions were good,
                    and an approximation to popular representation, although some modern writers
                    have designated the whole transaction as a revolution.</p>
                <p>The twenty-four barons continued to conduct the affairs of government for several
                    years; but they at last began to quarrel amongst themselves. The Earls of
                    Gloucester and Leicester pursued opposite interests, and formed opposite
                    parties, who eyed each other with mutual jealousy. Leicester, perceiving that
                    his rival was likely to gain the ascendency, retired to France; but the balance
                    was again restored in his favour by the union of Prince Edward with his friends.
                    A short time after this event, the rival parties seem to have assumed, if not
                    the reality, at least the appearance of unanimity. In 1262, Henry made a
                    fruitless attempt to escape from the authority of the barons; but his son Edward
                    remained firm to their cause, on account of his having sworn to observe the
                    provisions of Oxford. After other ineffectual attempts upon the part of the
                    king, he agreed that the twenty-four noblemen should continue to govern, not
                    only during his own reign, but also during that of his successor. By this
                    stipulation, Edward joined his father, which restored vigour to the royalists,
                    and more equally balanced the power of the parties. It was proposed that the
                    differences between them should be submitted for arbitration to Louis IX., and
                    both swore to abide by his decision. That excellent monarch enjoined the
                    restoration of all castles, possessions, and royal rights enjoyed by the crown
                    before the parliament of Oxford, upon condition of universal amnesty, and of the
                    full enjoyment of all the privileges and liberties granted by the charter. The
                    award was confirmed by the pope, who empowered the Archbishop of Canterbury to
                    excommunicate all who refused to submit to it.</p>
                <p>The moment the decision was made known to the barons, they declared it to be
                    contrary to truth and justice, and immediately took the field. The contest was
                    at first favourable to the royal prerogative; but in 1264 Prince Edward lost a
                    great battle by his impetuosity in pursuing too far one of the wings of the
                    enemy’s army, which he had defeated. His father and uncle were taken prisoners,
                    and placed in the castle of Lewis, where he contrived to join them. They acceded
                    to the propositions submitted to them, and the administration of the kingdom
                    fell into the hands of the Earls of Gloucester and Leicester, and the Bishop of
                    Chichester.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332586" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2586-0725"/>
                <p>The situation to which the kingdom was now reduced proved at last the means of
                    settling the government upon a more proper foundation. Leicester, in order to
                    secure himself, was obliged to have recourse to an aid, till now entirely
                    unknown in England, namely, that of the body of the people. He called a
                    parliament, where, besides the barons of his own party, and several
                    ecclesiastics who were not properly tenants of the crown, he ordered returns to
                    be made of two knights from every shire; and also deputies from the boroughs,
                    which had been hitherto considered as too inconsiderable to be allowed any share
                    in the legislation. This parliament was called on the 22d of January 1265; and
                    here we find the first outline of an English House of Commons; an institution
                    which has ever since been considered, and justly, as the bulwark of British
                    liberty.</p>
                <p>The new parliament was far from being so compliant to Leicester as he had desired
                    or expected. Many of the barons who had hitherto stedfastly adhered to his party
                    were disgusted with his boundless ambition; and the people, who found that a
                    change of masters was not a change of circumstances, began to wish for the
                    re-establishment of royal authority. Leicester at last, making a virtue of
                    necessity, released Prince Edward from his confinement, and had him introduced
                    at Westminster-hall, where his freedom was confirmed by the unanimous voice of
                    the barons. But though Leicester had all the popularity of restoring the prince,
                    he was yet politic enough to keep a strict watch over him. Edward was nominally
                    free, but in reality a prisoner. At last, however, he found means to effect his
                    escape. The Duke of Gloucester, being disgusted with Leicester, left the court,
                    and retired to his estates upon the borders of Wales. His antagonist pursued him
                    thither, and, in order to give the greater authority to his arms, carried the
                    king and Prince Edward along with him. This afforded young Edward an opportunity
                    which he had long desired of making his escape. Being furnished by the Earl of
                    Gloucester with a horse of extraordinary speed, he took leave of his attendants,
                    or rather his guards, under pretence of trying the mettle of his steed. He was
                    hotly followed; but an end was put to the pursuit by the appearance of some of
                    Gloucester’s troops.</p>
                <p>No sooner was the prince at liberty than the royalists joined him from all
                    quarters, and an army was soon assembled which proved more than sufficient to
                    meet the forces of Leicester. The latter now found himself in a remote quarter
                    of the kingdom, surrounded by his enemies, and shut out from all communication
                    with his friends by the river Severn, the bridges on which Edward had broken
                    down. In this extremity he wrote to his son to hasten to his assistance from
                    London, with a considerable body of troops which the latter had under his
                    command. With this view his son advanced to Kenilworth; but here he was
                    surprised by Prince Edward, and the greater portion of his followers were made
                    prisoners. The young prince immediately advanced upon Leicester himself, whose
                    last anchor had given way with the defeat of his son. He was by no means able to
                    cope with the royalists; his men were inferior both in numbers and resolution to
                    their antagonists. In the battle which ensued, the royalists gained a signal
                    victory over their opponents, defeating them with great slaughter. Leicester
                    himself was slain, together with his eldest son Henry, and abouta hundred and
                    sixty knights and other gentlemen. The body of the fallen earl was mutilated in
                    a frightful manner, and portions of it sent to various places. His memory was
                    long revered by the people, who looked upon him as a martyr to the liberties of
                    the realm. But a vigorous reign ensued, and the national feeling was suppressed,
                    or directed to other objects. He left, however, an imperishable name, as the
                    first who had called together a parliament of which the lower house composed
                    part.</p>
                <p>The victory of Evesham restored the fortunes of the royalists. The followers of
                    Leicester were proscribed, and their lands distributed amongst the victors. With
                    the death of Montfort the spirit departed from the baronial party, whose members
                    hastened to give in their submission, and to open the gates of their castles to
                    the king. Several places, however, still held out; but by the activity and
                    valour of Prince Edward they were all finally reduced. The country submitted,
                    and the royal authority was completely re-established throughout the realm. The
                    good sense of Edward, however, infused a wiser and more popular spirit into the
                    conduct of government. So judicious appears to have been his administration,
                    indeed, that, in a few years after the battle of Evesham, he felt himself in a
                    capacity to take the cross, and enlist under the banners of the crusaders. This
                    step of the heir apparent to the crown of England may appear somewhat
                    extraordinary, when we consider the advanced period of life to which his father
                    had now attained, and the civil commotions from which he had so recently
                    emerged. But in an age when it was common to ascribe any sudden transition of
                    fortune from one extreme to another, to the immediate interposition of
                    providence, it is less to be wondered at. The recent deliverance of himself and
                    his father from their enemies had incurred a debt of gratitude to heaven which
                    it was now his desire to pay off. His expedition to the Holy Land was of little
                    importance, and was moreover in no way connected with the history of his
                    country, although it was distinguished by those romantic adventures and
                    chivalrous feats of arms peculiar to the age, and more especially to the wars in
                    Palestine.</p>
                <p>The remaining events of Henry HI.’s reign afford no materials for history. He
                    died on the 16th of November 1272, in the fifty-seventh year of his reign. The
                    character of Henry is not strongly marked either by good or by evil. During its
                    long continuance we see no premeditated crime, no deep laid plot involving the
                    liberties of his subjects, with which to impeach his memory. The evils which
                    grew and prospered whilst he held the sceptre did not arise from vices in the
                    sovereign, but from the unsettled state of society and the turbulent spirit of
                    the times. His virtues, however, were not very conspicuous; they were rather of
                    a passive than of an active kind; rather the negative of vice than positive
                    moral greatness. With regard to intellect, he appears to have been below
                    mediocrity; and it is usual with historians to describe him as deficient in
                    capacity to govern. This was probably the case, but it was productive of
                    inconvenience to himself rather than misery to his subjects. Under his pacific
                    rule, as we have already observed, the nation grew more rapidly in wealth and
                    prosperity than it did under the more dazzling sway of his military
                    progenitors.</p>
                <p>Edward, upon hearing the news of his father’s death, and feeling himself secure
                    of the throne, returned slowly from the Holy Land. He arrived in England in
                    August 1274, and was crowned at Westminster on the 19th of the same month. Two
                    years afterwards he undertook an expedition against Lewellyn, prince of Wales,
                    who had refused to do homage for his crown. The conquest of that country cost
                    him some trouble, and was not completed until the year 1283. After this period
                    the principality of Wales was annexed to the crown of England, and thenceforth
                    conferred a title upon the king’s eldest son. In 1286, Wales had been so
                    entirely broken into subjection, that Edward undertook a journey to the
                    Continent for the purpose of mediating a peace between Alonzo of Aragon and
                    Philipthe Fair of France. These two monarchs had differed <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332599" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2599-0726"/>about the kingdom of Sicily;
                    but a negociation was effected, and the king of England returned to his country
                    after an absence of three years, during which period much disorder had been
                    introduced into his dominions. Robbery and violence had become frightfully
                    prevalent, and the corruption of the judges had poisoned the fountains of
                    justice. In order to remedy these evils, Edward summoned a parliament, and cited
                    the delinquents to appear and take their trial. All of them,' except two
                    clergymen, having been convicted of flagrant acts of corruption and bribery,
                    were accordingly fined, and deposed from their office.</p>
                <p>The next great event of Edward’s reign was an attempt to subjugate Scotland. This
                    he never altogether effected, although he succeeded in reducing the country to
                    great distress, and in even nominally attaching it to the English crown as a
                    conquered province. For an account of these transactions, see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Scotland.</hi> Edward was at the same time engaged in expensive
                    contests with France; and these multiplied wars, by obliging him to have
                    frequent recourse to parliamentary supplies, became the remote causes of great
                    and important changes in the government. The parliament was modelled into the
                    form which it has ever since retained. As a great part of the property of the
                    kingdom, by the introduction of commerce and by improvements in agriculture, was
                    transferred from the barons to the lower classes of the people, so their consent
                    was thought necessary in order to raise the supplies. For this reason the king
                    issued writs to the sheriffs, enjoining them to send to parliament, along with
                    two knights of the shire, two deputies from each borough within their county;
                    and these, too, provided with sufficient powers from their constituents to grant
                    such demands as they should think reasonable for the safety of the state. The
                    charges of these deputies were to be borne by the boroughs which sent them; and
                    so far were they from considering this deputation as an honour, that nothing
                    could be more displeasing to any borough than to be thus obliged to send a
                    deputy, or to any individual than to be thus chosen. The authority of these
                    commoners, however, increased in course of time. Their union gave them weight;
                    and it became customary among them, in return for the supplies which they
                    granted, to prefer petitions to the crown for the redress of grievances. The
                    more the king’s necessities increased, the more he found it necessary to give
                    them an early hearing, until, from requesting, the commons proceeded to
                    demanding; and having all the property of the nation, they by degrees began also
                    to be possessed of a considerable share of the power.</p>
                <p>Edward I. died of a dysentery, near Carlisle, on the 7th of July 1307, as he was
                    leading a great army into Scotland, against the inhabitants of which he had
                    vowed the most dreadful vengeance. Edward ranks amongst the greatest monarchs of
                    England. In military talents, in sound judgment, in vigour, decision,
                    irascibility, and vindictiveness, he bore some resemblance to the Conqueror.
                    Like him too he possessed an unsatiable ambition, and his unholy crusade against
                    the independence of Scotland must be regarded as an indelible blot upon his
                    memory. He was succeeded by the eldest of his surviving sons, who bore his
                    father’s name, but inherited nothing of his capacity, and who was crowned on the
                    8th of July 1307, with great magnificence. His father had charged him upon his
                    death-bed to prosecute the war against Scotland until he had finally subdued the
                    kingdom; but war had few attractions for Edward IL, and he withdrew his army
                    ingloriously from the country which his father went to subjugate. The first
                    years of Edward’s reign are distinguished for nothing but bickerings with his
                    barons, who finally extorted from him a reformation of abuses in full
                    parliament. The Scots in the mean time gradually recovered their power; and
                    Edward having invaded their country with a prodigious force, was met by Robert
                    Bruce at Bannockburn, near Stirling, who totally defeated the puissant army of
                    the English on the 24th of June 1314. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Scotland.</hi></p>
                <p>The reign of Edward 11. was one continued series of quarrels with his turbulent
                    subjects. His favourites were the most general causes of discontent. The first
                    of these was one Pierce Gaveston, the son of a Gascon knight of some
                    distinction. The latter had honourably served the late king, and, in reward for
                    his services, had obtained an establishment for his son in the family of the
                    Prince of Wales. To be the favourite of any king whatsoever is no doubt in
                    itself a sufficient offence to the rest of the courtiers. Numberless faults were
                    therefore found with Gaveston by the English barons. When the king went over to
                    France to espouse the Princess Isabella, to whom he had been long contracted,
                    Gaveston was left guardian of the realm, with more ample powers than had usually
                    been conferred in such cases. But upon the arrival of the queen, who was of an
                    imperious and intriguing spirit, Gaveston had the misfortune to fall under her
                    displeasure, on account of the ascendency he had acquired over the king. A
                    conspiracy was soon formed against the favourite, at the head of which was the
                    queen and the Earl of Lancaster, a relation of the king’s, and the most powerful
                    nobleman in England. Edward found himself unable to protect his favourite
                    against such a formidable combination, and was compelled to banish him. His
                    recall some time afterwards again spread alarm over the country, and kindled a
                    civil war. The nobility were successful in obtaining possession of the obnoxious
                    Gaveston; and, in order to free themselves for ever from uneasiness on his
                    account, they put him to death.</p>
                <p>After the defeat of Bannockburn, King Edward chose a new favourite named Hugh le
                    Despencer. He was a young man of a noble English family, and possessed some
                    merit, and engaging accomplishments. His father was a person of apparently
                    unimpeachable character, but he also enjoyed the king’s favour, and that was a
                    sufficient crime. The king imprudently dispossessed some lords of their estates,
                    in order to bestow them upon young Despencer. This afforded a sufficient pretext
                    to the barons for openly attacking both the father and son. The Earls of
                    Lancaster and Mortimer, chief of the Welsh marshes, flew to arms; and sentence
                    of perpetual exile against the two Spencers, with a forfeiture of all their
                    estates, was procured from parliament. At last the king took the field, and
                    obtained a signal victory over the other party at Boroughbridge. The Earl of
                    Lancaster was made prisoner, and beheaded a few days afterwards at his own
                    castle of Pomfret. This individual was canonized in 1389. Many other noblemen
                    suffered the same punishment without having the same respect paid to their
                    memory, whilst Mortimer was condemned to perpetual imprisonment.</p>
                <p>The triumph of the Spencers was now complete; but the partiality with which the
                    king regarded his two favourites had the effect of alienating not only the
                    affections of his subjects, but also those of his queen. Other charges are
                    brought against Edward as having contributed to effect this estrangement, and
                    Isabella sought an opportunity of escaping from her husband. Thè palace of her
                    brother at Paris was her natural place of refuge. A rupture having commenced
                    between England and France, the queen proceeded to the court of the latter as
                    negotiator, and concluded a peace humiliating to her husband. But she had
                    another object in view in visiting her native country. Her residence became a
                    sanctuary for the English malcontents, who flocked to her in great numbers; and
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332612" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2612-0727"/> amongst these
                    came Mortimer, who had contrived to effect his escape, and for whom she has been
                    charged with entertaining a stronger passion than that of friendship. The cause
                    of quarrel between the two powers was the county of Guienne, for which the
                    monarch of France required Edward to do homage and fealty. The disputed
                    territory was resigned to the young Prince of Wales, who joined his mother, and
                    made the necessary submissions. When Isabella considered that matters were
                    sufficiently matured for executing her purpose, she landed in England on the 22d
                    of September 1326, where she was universally welcomed, and immediately joined by
                    the most potent barons. The unfortunate king found that the spirit of disloyalty
                    had spread over the whole kingdom. Some dependence was placed upon the garrison
                    of Bristol, which was commanded by the elder Spencer; but the soldiers rebelled
                    against their governor, and delivered him into the hands of the barons, by whom
                    he was cruelly put to death. Young Spencer did not long survive his father.
                    Along with some others who had followed the fortunes of the wretched king, he
                    was made prisoner in an obscure convent in Wales; and the queen having no
                    patience to wait the formality of a trial, gave orders for his immediate
                    execution.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the king was discovered and delivered up to his adversaries, who
                    loaded him with insults. He was conducted to the capital, and consigned to the
                    Tower. The charge against him exhibited no other crimes than his incapacity to
                    govern, his indolence, his love of pleasure, and his accessibility to evil
                    counsel. His deposition was quickly voted by parliament; he was assigned a
                    pension for his support; his son Edward, a youth of fourteen, was appointed to
                    succeed him, and the queen was nominated regent during the minority. But the
                    deposed monarch did not long survive his disgrace. He was at first put into the
                    custody of the Earl of Lancaster; but this nobleman having shown some marks of
                    respect and pity for the misfortunes of his sovereign, the latter was taken out
                    of his hands and delivered over to the Lords Berkeley, Maltravers, and Gournay,
                    who were entrusted alternately, each for a month, with the charge of guarding
                    him. Whilst he was in Berkeley’s custody, he was still treated with some degree
                    of humanity; but when the turn of Maltravers and Gournay came, every species of
                    indignity was practised upon him, as if they had designed to accelerate his
                    death by accumulating his mental sufferings. As his persecutors, however, saw
                    that his death might not speedily arrive, even under every cruelty which
                    ingenuity could devise, and as they were daily afraid of a revolution in his
                    favour, they determined to put their fears to rest by destroying him at once.
                    Mortimer, therefore, secretly gave orders to the two keepers to dispatch the
                    king; and these ruffians contrived to render the manner of his death as
                    barbarous as possible. Taking advantage of Berkeley’s sickness, in whose custody
                    he then was, and who was thereby incapacitated from attending to his charge,
                    they came to Berkeley Castle, and obtained possession of the king’s person. They
                    threw him on a bed, and held him down with a table which they had placed over
                    him. They then ran a horn pipe into his bowels, through which they conveyed a
                    red-hot iron; and thus deprived him of life without disfiguring his body. The
                    murderers fled on the perpetration of this horrible enormity; for the dying
                    agonies of the king created suspicions which ended in the discovery of the
                    crime. One of the fugitives was taken at Marseilles, and beheaded on his way to
                    England. The other concealed himself for some years in Germany; but having found
                    means of rendering some services to Edward III. he ventured to approach the
                    person of that monarch, and by his humiliating submission received a pardon.</p>
                <p>By the death of Edward 11. the government fell entirely into the hands of the
                    queen and Mortimer, who had now the disgraceful pre-eminence of royal paramour.
                    The parliament, which had raised young Edward to the throne, had indeed
                    appointed twelve persons as his privy council, to direct the operations of
                    government. Mortimer excluded himself, under a show of moderation; but at the
                    same time secretly influenced all the measures which came under their
                    deliberation. As this influence began very soon to be perceived, and the queen’s
                    criminal attachment to Mortimer was universally known, the administration soon
                    became obnoxious to the people. It had continued four years, when a circumstance
                    occurred which added greatly to its unpopularity. The Scots having made an
                    irruption into England, were met by an overwhelming force under young Edward, or
                    rather Mortimer. The results of this mighty expedition were most ludicrous. By
                    their superior skill and activity, the Scots foiled the English commanders, and
                    made their escape into their own country. Soon after this inglorious campaign, a
                    solemn treaty of peace was concluded, in which Edward, for a sum of money,
                    renounced every claim of superiority over Scotland. This, although a commendable
                    act of moderation, was not calculated to propitiate the favour of the English
                    people. It was not long before another stroke of Mortimer’s power and policy
                    startled the nation from its propriety, and paved the way for his own
                    destruction. Amongst those who began to betray indignation against the
                    encroaching spirit of Mortimer, was Edmund earl of Kent, who, deceived into a
                    belief that his brother Edward II. was still alive, wrote a letter to that
                    prince, which was betrayed into the hands of Mortimer, now Earl of March, by the
                    individual who had undertaken to deliver it. The writer of the epistle was
                    immediately tried for high treason, condemned, and executed. There is little
                    doubt that the whole affair of the letter was a plot laid for the destruction of
                    Kent, not only to get him out of the way, but to show that there was no one too
                    high not to be struck down by the vengeance of Mortimer.</p>
                <p>Edward finding the restraint under which he was retained becoming irksome,
                    resolved to shake it off, and to rid himself and the nation at once of an
                    authority which had now become alike odious to both. The queen and her paramour
                    had repaired to Nottingham, where a parliament was then held. They had chosen
                    the castle as a place of residence, and taken every precaution to ensure their
                    safety; for fear follows guilt like its shadow. The enemies of Mortimer,
                    however, found means to obtain admission at dead of night; and having seized him
                    as he lay in an apartment adjoining to that of the queen, he was taken prisoner
                    to London, tried before his peers for various crimes, convicted, and
                    executed.</p>
                <p>The queen, who was perhaps the most culpable of the two, was screened from
                    capital punishment by the dignity of her station, but stripped of all power, and
                    confined for life to the castle of Risings. From this imprisonment she was never
                    liberated, but during her life the king paid her an annual visit of
                    ceremony.</p>
                <p>Edward III. proved one of the greatest warriors who had ever sat on the English
                    throne. His first attempts were to raise Edward Baliol to the throne of
                    Scotland: this however he failed in effecting. But his mind now began to be
                    diverted to loftier and more ambitious speculations. The crown of France became
                    the object of contest between Edward, the son of Philip the Fair’s daughter
                    Isabella, and Philip of Valois, the son of the brother of Philip. The question
                    was, whether the crown was descendible only through males, or whether it might
                    be claimed by the nearest male although his descent was by females. Charles the
                    Fair died in 1328, and left the crown of France without<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332625" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2625-0728"/> direct male descendants to
                    inherit it. The three last kings were the sons of Philip the Fair, and they all
                    reigned successively, but died without issue. According to the English law, the
                    son of the daughter precedes the nephew in inheritance; but the French Salic law
                    excluded females. Edward contended that the feudal laws of France forbade
                    females to inherit who could not perform the feudal duties, yet that their male
                    heirs were not debarred by the spirit of this law, because they were competent
                    to discharge all the military services required. On the other hand, it was
                    insisted by the French advocates for Philip de Valois, that the exclusion of the
                    female in the first instance was an exclusion of all the descendants of either
                    sex. If it had been a question of succession to the English crown, it would have
                    been rightfully determined by the parliament and law of England; but as it
                    concerned the crown and law of France, it was clearly a matter for the French
                    state and lawyers to decide. They decided in favour of Philip de Valois, and he
                    was accordingly crowned king of France. In this decision they displayed the
                    soundest principles of national policy, and Edward ought undoubtedly to have
                    acquiesced.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Turner’s
                    History of England, vol. ii. p. 144.</p></note> The king of England, however,
                    thought otherwise, and accordingly began to make preparations for an invasion of
                    France.</p>
                <p>By doing homage to Philip for the duchy of Guienne, Edward gained time to collect
                    such an army and treasure as were necessary for the enterprise. Two powerful
                    continental allies appeared in his favour; namely, Robert of Artois, who had
                    been excluded from the county to make way for his aunt Matilda, a nearer
                    relative by blood to the preceding count; and James von Artaveldt, a famous
                    brewer of Ghent, and leader of the democratical party among the Flemings. It was
                    at the suggestion of the latter that Edward assumed the title of king of the
                    French, as a pledge that he would pursue his undertaking with inflexibility of
                    purpose. The king of England landed at Antwerp in July 1338; but it was not
                    until more than a year thereafter that he reached the confines of France. His
                    first campaign was unimportant, but in the second he achieved a considerable
                    naval victory on the 22d of June 1340. Flushed with this success, he marched to
                    the siege of Tournay at the head of 100,000 men. Near this town the king of
                    France had encamped himself in a situation so strong as to bid defiance to
                    attack. Edward challenged him to single combat, but this was refused; and the
                    English were at last compelled to raise the siege, and to retire sullen and
                    discontented from the place.</p>
                <p>The efforts of Edward began now to be much crippled for want of money. The
                    exchequer of England was unable to satisfy his demands, and his allies had
                    become clamourous for their arrears. Some of his courtiers having instilled into
                    his mind suspicions of the fidelity of his ministers, he suddenly returned to
                    London, where he landed about midnight at the Tower. Next morning he displaced
                    the chancellor, treasurer, and master of the rolls, confined three of the
                    judges, and ordered the arrest of most of the officers employed in the
                    collection of the revenue. Archbishop Stratford, however, boldly opposed his
                    career of resentment and cruelty, and vindicated the cause of the ministers. The
                    king was compelled at last to abandon his process against the primate, for the
                    urgency of his wants admitted of no delay.</p>
                <p>The failure of his first two campaigns did not wean Edward from his attachment to
                    foreign alliances. By a disputed succession to the duchy of Brittany, in which
                    he took the part of the individual who opposed Philip of France, a new road was
                    opened up to him into that country. He collected a vast army, with which he
                    landed near Cape la Hogue about the end of July 1346. His career in France was a
                    series of triumphs most glorious to the English arms. On the 26th of August 1346
                    was fought the decisive battle of Cressy, which is still memorable after the
                    lapse of many centuries. In this celebrated conflict, Edward the Black Prince, a
                    youth only sixteen years of age, gained unfading laurels. The siege of Calais
                    followed, and the place was reduced after an obstinate defence. The first fruit
                    of the reduction of this place was a truce, which lasted till 1355, when Edward
                    the Black Prince, who governed his father’s dominions in France, undertook an
                    expedition into the neighbouring provinces, and in the following year carried
                    his arms into the heart of France. The victory of Poitiers was another
                    mortifying humiliation to the French. John their king was taken prisoner, and
                    treated with noble hospitality and respect by his renowned conqueror. He was
                    conveyed to England, where his reception resembled rather the return of a
                    victorious prince than the humiliation of a captive monarch. For a particular
                    account of these and other transactions of the English in France, the reader is
                    referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">France.</hi></p>
                <p>During the absence of the king of England on the Continent, his country was
                    harassed by the Scots, who invaded it, but experienced a defeat at Nevelles
                    Cross. In 1355, Edward himself invaded Scotland; and the havoc caused by this
                    expedition was long remembered by the natives. The death of Edward Baliol in
                    1364 left David Bruce without a rival to the Scottish throne; and the
                    pretensions of the Plantagenets to Scotland were terminated by Edward Hl.’s
                    recognition of his brother-in-law. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Scotland.</hi></p>
                <p>In the mean time Edward the Black Prince, after a Spanish campaign, in which he
                    gained the celebrated battle of Navarete, returned to England in pursuit of
                    health and quiet. But thirty years of toil and war had exhausted his robust
                    frame, and he expired at Canterbury on the 8th of June 1376, in the forty-sixth
                    year of his age. He left behind him a lofty reputation for bravery and skill as
                    a commander, generosity as a knight, and wisdom and vigour as a statesman. His
                    father Edward III. did not long survive his loss. He died on the 21st of June
                    the year following. The reign of this monarch is generally considered by
                    Englishmen as the most illustrious period of their ancient annals. “The
                    victories of Cressy and Poitiers,” says Mr Turner, “may have produced the
                    popular sentiment; but the reflective mind will adopt the opinion as steadily,
                    when it observes, during this reign, that our navy established its preponderance
                    over the most celebrated fleets that were then accustomed to navigate the
                    British channel; that our parliament enjoyed, in full and upright exercise,
                    those constitutional powers which the nation has long learnt to venerate as its
                    best inheritance, but which weaker sovereigns have too eagerly contested; that
                    our manufactures and commerce began to exhibit an affluence and an expanding
                    growth, and to be conducted on the true principles of public improvement; that
                    our clergy evinced a disposition to emancipate themselves from the papal
                    despotism, and some to exercise a just freedom of thought on the most important
                    of all human concerns; that the lineaments of our prose literature became
                    distinctly discernible; that the pursuit of the mathematical and natural
                    sciences, and of the art of reasoning, at one or both of our venerable
                    universities, was ardent and successful; that our poetry assumed the attractive
                    form with which its life, sympathy, utility, and immortality are most surely
                    connected; and that our manners displayed a moral sentiment, which, though
                    somewhat fantastic, and always<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332638"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2638-0729"/> pure, yet contributed to soften the horrors of
                    war, and has led to that more cultivated feeling which, continually increasing
                    and refining, has made Englishmen distinguished for their generosity,
                    magnanimity, and honour.” It may be added, on the authority of Sir Mathew Hale,
                    that during this reign the law was greatly improved, and nearly attained its
                    meridian. The monarch himself kept pace with the progress of the time, and his
                    reign was sufficiently protracted to afford opportunities for the development
                    and consolidation of all improvements. He left his country ennobled in the eyes
                    of Europe, and possessed of gigantic energies capable of realising the glorious
                    destinies which awaited her.</p>
                <p>Edward III. was succeeded by Richard II. son of the beloved Black Prince. He
                    commenced his reign, being only eleven years of age, on the 22d of June 1377,
                    with many expressions of congratulation from his subjects. His coronation took
                    place on the following year, and parliament was opened with a speech from the
                    Archbishop of Canterbury, which, being “soothing and gracious,” was meant to
                    propitiate the favour of the representatives of the nation in behalf of the
                    young sovereign. The Dukes of Lancaster, York, and Gloucester, uncles to the
                    king, with some other noblemen, were appointed regents during Richard’s
                    minority. The war, which was still prosecuted in France on a small scale, and
                    the expenses necessary for retaining the towns already taken, required supplies
                    of money, which could not be raised without additional taxation; and this gave
                    rise to much discontent amongst the people. An imposition of three groats upon
                    each person of both sexes and every condition who had passed the age of sixteen,
                    particularly excited the minds of the common people against the government. The
                    manner, too, of collecting this tax, soon furnished an occasion of revolt. The
                    insurrection began in Essex, where a report was industriously spread that the
                    peasants were to be destroyed, their houses burned, and their farms plundered.
                    At Dartford, an individual, well known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Wat
                    Tyler,</hi> was the first who excited the malcontents to arms. The tax-gatherers
                    proceeded to this man’s house whilst he was at work, and demanded payment for
                    his daughter. He refused to comply, on the ground that she was under the age
                    stipulated in the act; upon which one of these fellows offered to prove the
                    contrary in a very indecent manner, and for this purpose laid hold of the
                    maiden. Such insolence, however, roused the spirit of the father, and with one
                    blow he laid the ruffian dead at his feet. A shout of applause burst from the
                    bystanders, who declared themselves prepared to protect Wat from the vengeance
                    of his enemies. The cry of the men of Kent was responded to by those of the
                    neighbouring counties, and Wat soon found himself at the head of an enormous
                    body of insurgents. They advanced to Blackheath in the month of May 1381, and
                    proceeded to enforce their counsels by an attack upon London, in which they
                    succeeded. The king, finding that resistance was vain, agreed to listen to their
                    demands. On this they made a very humble remonstrance; requiring a general
                    pardon, the abolition of slavery, freedom of commerce in the market-towns, and a
                    fixed rent instead of those'services required by the tenure of villenage. The
                    king granted all these requests; and charters were made out by which the grant
                    was ratified. In the mean time, another body of these insurgents had broken into
                    the∕l’ower, and murdered the chancellor, the primate, and the treasurer, with
                    some other officers of distinction. They then divided themselves into parties,
                    and took up their quarters in different parts of the city. At the head of one of
                    these was Wat Tyler, who led his men into Smithfield, where he was met by the
                    king, who invited him to a conference, under pretence of hearing and redressing
                    his grievances. Tyler ordered his companions to retire till he should give them
                    a signal, and boldly ventured to begin a conference with the king in the midst
                    of his retinue. His demands were, that all slaves should be set free, that all
                    commonages should be open to the poor as well as to the rich, and that a general
                    pardon should be granted for the late outrages. During the interview, the rebel
                    kept playing with his dagger, and at last he is said to have laid his hand on
                    the bridle of his sovereign’s horse; upon which Walworth, lord mayor of London,
                    alarmed for the king, plunged a basillard in the throat of Tyler, and at the
                    same moment another esquire dispatched him with his sword. This is the tale told
                    by the writers of the victorious party, for the partizans of Wat Tyler had no
                    historian to give their version of the story. The insurgents who witnessed the
                    fall of their leader bent their bows with the design of revenging his death. But
                    Richard, though only sixteen years of age, with admirable presence of mind
                    galloped up to them, exclaiming, “What are you doing, my lieges? Tyler was a
                    traitor. Follow me, and I will be your leader.” With sullen and wavering
                    discontent they followed him into the fields at Islington, where a body of
                    troops had been collected for the protection of the young king. The insurgents
                    were ordered to return to their homes instantly, and under the penalty of death
                    they were forbidden to skulk about the city during night. But the whole of the
                    rebels did not thus escape, and the revolt was not finally extinguished without
                    much bloodshed and cruelty.</p>
                <p>The courage, address, and presence of mind which the king had discovered in
                    quelling such a dangerous tumult, gave great hopes to the nation: but, in
                    proportion as Richard advanced in years, these hopes began to wither; and his
                    want of capacity, or at least of solid judgment, appeared in every enterprise
                    which he attempted. The king had unluckily lost the favour of the common people
                    after the insurrection just mentioned. He allowed the parliament to revoke the
                    charters of enfranchisement and pardon which had been granted; some of the
                    ringleaders in the late disorders had been severely punished, and others were
                    put to death without any form or process of trial. Thus the popular leaders were
                    greatly exasperated by this cruelty, though probably the king did not in this
                    follow the dictates of his own mind so much as the advice of his counsellors.
                    But having thus lost the favour of one party, he quickly afterwards fell under
                    the displeasure of the other also. Conceiving himself to be in too great
                    subjection to his uncles, particularly the Duke of Gloucester, he attempted to
                    shake off the yoke, by raising others to an equal share of rank and favour.
                    Accordingly one of his favourites, Michael de la Pole, was created Earl of
                    Suffolk, and raised to the chancellorship; whilst another, Robert de Vere, earl
                    of Oxford, a young man of an agreeable person, but dissolute in his behaviour,
                    soon acquired an absolute ascendency over him. This nobleman was first created
                    Marquis of Dublin, and afterwards Duke of Ireland, both preposterous and
                    invidious titles. The duke having soon become the dispenser of all the king’s
                    favours, a conspiracy was formed against him by some of the most powerful
                    nobility in the kingdom. The Earl of Suffolk was impeached in parliament, and,
                    being convicted of certain charges brought against him, was condemned to pay a
                    suitable fine. Soon afterwards the king was prevailed upon ŗo vest the
                    government in the hands of eleven commissioners along with the three great
                    officers of state. This measure was carried into effect by the Duke of
                    Gloucester, who stood at the head of the committee; and the king could not
                    without regret perceive himself thus totally deprived of authority. He first
                    endeavoured to gain over the parliament to his interests, by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332651" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2651-0730"/>influencing the sheriffs of
                    each county, who were then the only returning officers; and this measure
                    failing, he next applied to the judges, who declared that the commission which
                    had deprived the king of his authority was unlawful, and that those who procured
                    or advised it deserved condign punishment; buttheir sentence was quickly opposed
                    by declarations from the lords. The Duke of Gloucester armed his partizans, and
                    appeared at the head of a body of men sufficient to intimidate both the king and
                    his adherents. These insurgents, sensible of their own power, began by demanding
                    of the king the names of those who had advised the adoption of the late rash
                    measures. A few days afterwards they appeared armed in his presence, and accused
                    by name the Archbishop of York, the Duke of Ireland, the Earl of Suffolk, and
                    Sir Robert Tresillian, one of the judges who had declared in his favour,
                    together with Sir Nicholas Brembre, as public and dangerous enemies to the
                    state. The parliament which met on the 3d of February 1388 condemned the five
                    accused persons to suffer the death of traitors. The Duke of Ireland escaped to
                    Flanders, where he expired four years afterwards; De la Pole died at Paris in
                    the same year; Tresillian and Brembre were put to death, and the Archbishop of
                    York became a Flemish curate, and died in that humble capacity. The other
                    individuals who had subscribed the bold opinion were condemned to perpetual
                    imprisonment; with the exception of Black, who had drawn up the questions, and
                    Usk, appointed under-sheriff to arrest the Duke of Gloucester, who were both
                    executed.</p>
                <p>But the king became restive in the traces with which his uncle restrained him. In
                    a meeting of parliament he declared himself competent to manage his own affairs,
                    as he had by this time attained his twenty-second year. This bold announcement
                    was followed by his ordering Thomas Arundel, whom the commissioners had recently
                    appointed chancellor, to give up the seals, which, on the following day, he
                    delivered into the hands of William Wickham, bishop of Winchester. The council
                    was next cleared of the Duke of Gloucester, the Earl of Warwick, and other
                    opposition lords; and the great officers of the household, as well as the
                    judges, were changed for more pliable instruments.</p>
                <p>Being now his own master, Richard notified by proclamation that he had taken the
                    reins of government into his own hands; and, whether it was owing to the king or
                    his ministers, it must be owned that for some years his administration was
                    tranquil and happy. During this halcyon period he made a journey into Ireland,
                    in order to divert the melancholy with which he was afflicted on account of the
                    loss of his wife Anne. Soon afterwards he espoused Isabella, a princess of
                    France, then in her eighth year, which contributed to an armistice with that
                    kingdom for twenty-five years.</p>
                <p>This alliance with the royal family of France encouraged Richard to execute a
                    scheme of vengeance which he had long nourished in his bosom against Gloucester
                    and others who had been instrumental in the punishment of his favourites. The
                    duke, with the Earls of Warwick and Arundel, were appealed for treason; in
                    consequence of which the former was sent prisoner to Calais, and the two latter
                    committed to the Tower. Here the head of Arundel was shortly after struck off,
                    and Warwick was banished; but the fate of the Duke of Gloucester is involved in
                    some obscurity. On the 21st of September 1397 a writ was issued to Thomas
                    Mowbray, carl marshal, governor of Calais, commanding him to bring the body of
                    his prisoner, the Duke of Gloucester, to answer before the king in parliament to
                    the appeal of treason against him. The reply of the governor of Calais was, that
                    the prisoner had died in his custody. At a subsequent period circumstances
                    transpired which indicate that the duke perished by the foulest murder,
                    doubtless at the instigation of his own nephew. It remains to be mentioned, that
                    at the meeting of parliament, in which these noblemen were impeached, all the
                    acts in which Gloucester had taken a share were annulled, the commission of
                    government was cancelled, the opinions of the judges were declared to be legal,
                    and the judgment against Michael de la Pole was reversed.</p>
                <p>After the destruction of Gloucester and the heads of his party, a
                    misunderstanding arose amongst the noblemen who had joined in the prosecution.
                    The Duke of Hereford, son to John of Gaunt, appeared in parliament, and accused
                    the Duke of Norfolk of having uttered treason in a private conversation. Norfolk
                    denied the charge, and offered to establish his innocence by single combat. The
                    challenge was accepted; but the king interrupted the duel, and commanded both
                    the parties to leave the kingdom. The Duke of Norfolk was banished for life, but
                    the Duke of Hereford only for ten years. The former retired to Venice, where he
                    died shortly afterwards. Hereford displayed so much resignation to the will of
                    his sovereign, that the latter commuted the period of his exile to four years.
                    The king had obtained the object of his wishes, namely, the civil destruction of
                    those whose power he dreaded. Even his uncles, either through affection or fear,
                    seconded all his measures, which were now deeply tainted with despotism. On the
                    death of John of Gaunt, “time-honoured Lancaster,” the crown claimed his immense
                    estates, to the exclusion of the banished Earl of Hereford, who was pronounced
                    incapable of inheriting them after the judgment which had been pronounced
                    against him in parliament.</p>
                <p>By these and other impolitic acts, the king overstrained the bow, and excited a
                    spirit of discontent, which finally hurled him from the throne. The resentment
                    of Hereford had been inflamed by the injury which he had received, and he only
                    waited for a favourable opportunity of retaliation, which soon afterwards
                    occurred.</p>
                <p>The Earl of March, presumptive heir to the crown, having been appointed the
                    king’s lieutenant in Ireland, was slain in a skirmish with the natives of that
                    country; and Richard, regardless of his precarious situation at home, went over
                    to Ireland with a considerable army, in order to revenge the death of his
                    relative. Hereford, now duke of Lancaster, took advantage of the king’s absence.
                    Solicited by the discontented lords, and aware of the alienation of the people
                    from Richard, he embarked at Nantes, and, with a retinue of only sixty persons
                    in three small vessels, landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire. The Earl of
                    Northumberland, who had long been a malcontent, together with Henry Percy, his
                    son, surnamed <hi rend="italic">Hotspur</hi> on account of his impetuous valour,
                    immediately joined him with their forces; and the people flocked to him in such
                    numbers that in a few days he found himself at the head of sixty thousand
                    men.</p>
                <p>Richard in the mean time continued in fancied security in Ireland. Adverse winds
                    for three perilous weeks together prevented his receiving any news of the
                    rebellion which had broken out in his native dominions; but when the
                    intelligence arrived he was overwhelmed with dismay. Some advised him to sail
                    immediately and face the danger; others recommended that he should first send
                    over the Earl of Salisbury, for the purpose of collecting all who were disposed
                    to support his interests, which plan was adopted. A numerous army joined the
                    earl, but the king protracted his stay in Ireland so long, that on his arrival
                    the whole of this force had melted down to less than an hundred men. To take the
                    field against Henry of Lancaster was consequently out of the question. He
                    therefore proceeded in disguise to the fortress of Conway, where <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332664" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2664-0731"/>Salisbury had taken up his
                    quarters. It was the policy of Henry to show symptoms of negotiation, in order
                    to allure the king into his own hands. This he effected in a very deceitful
                    manner. The Earl,of Northumberland was dispatched to Richard with a thousand
                    men, who concealed themselves at some distance, whilst the earl proceeded to the
                    fortress where the king was lodged, and by fair promises induced him to quit his
                    stronghold and go along with him to . Henry for the purpose of effecting a
                    reconciliation. But during the journey Richard was made prisoner, and finally
                    committed to the Tower to await the judgment of parliament. On Monday the 29th
                    of September 1399, a deputation of lords and commons waited upon the king, and
                    having reminded him of a declaration which he had formerly made at Conway
                    Castle, of his unfitness to govern, and readiness to resign the crown, required
                    his resignation of the regal power. To this he consented, according to the
                    ancient chroniclers, “with a cheerful countenance.” During his whole reign,
                    Richard held the sceptre with a wavering grasp, and in the paralysis with which
                    he was now stricken, he as it were unconsciously relinquished it. He likewise
                    recommended Henry his nephew as a fitting successor to the throne.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding with the reign of Henry IV. we shall follow the deposed monarch
                    through the few sad weeks of his unhappy life. By parliament he was adjudged “to
                    a perpetual prison, to remain there <hi rend="italic">secretly</hi> in safe
                    custody.” Richard was accordingly consigned to close confinement, and shortly
                    afterwards came to his end, there can be little doubt in an unnatural manner.
                    His fate .seems to have been accelerated by a conspiracy amongst his friends to
                    restore him to the throne. The Earls of Kent, Huntingdon, and Salisbury, laid a
                    plot for the destruction of King Henry; but the secret was betrayed, and the
                    confederated noblemen were executed. The death of Richard seems to have
                    immediately followed this unsuccessful enterprise, but the manner of it is
                    involved in impenetrable mystery. According to some chroniclers, several
                    ruffians were sent to the castle of Pomfret, where he had been removed, for the
                    purpose of dispatching him. They rushed unexpectedly into his apartment; but he
                    succeeded in wresting a pole-axe from one of the murderers, with which he killed
                    several of them, but was at length overpowered and slain. Others relate that he
                    was starved in prison, and that he lingered fifteen days before he expired.<note

                    Richard had effected his escape into Scotland, and that, he lived there twenty
                    years. This ancient tradition has been revived by Mr Tytler, in his History of
                    Scotland, and he supports his views with considerable ingenuity. The chief
                    evidence upon which he relies consists in charges made by the regent of Scotland
                    for the expenses of the king of England. But Sir James Mackintosh, in a note at
                    the end of the first volume of his History of England, gives several cogent, and
                    we think unanswerable reasons for differing from Mr Tytler upon this point, and
                    adhering to the common narrative. Those who feel an interest in this subject are
                    referred to the work above mentioned, and to the appendix to the third volume of
                    Mr Tytler’s History of Scotland.</p></note> According to some accounts, he was
                    condemned to suffer this miserable and protracted death; whilst others state
                    that it was a voluntary abstinence, to which he was impelled by despair. He died
                    in the thirty-fourth year of his age, and twenty-third of his reign. It was
                    during the life of Richard II. that Wicklirf, the celebrated reformer,
                    promulgated his doctrines in England. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Wickliff.</hi></p>
                <p>After the throne had been vacated by its legitimate occupant, Henry duke of
                    Lancaster stepped forward and claimed it in right of his being a descendant of
                    Henry III. He was descended from this monarch both by father and mother, but he
                    could not claim by the father’s side, because the young Earl of March was sprung
                    from the Duke of Clarence, the elder brother of John of Gaunt, nor by the
                    mother’s side, because she was sprung from Edmund of Lancaster, a younger
                    brother of Edward I. It was pretended that Edmund was the elder brother, but it
                    was never proved. By the law of succession it belonged to the descendants of
                    Lionel, the third son of Edward III. That prince died without issue male, and
                    his possessions and pretensions descended to his daughter Philippa, wife of
                    Roger Mortimer, the male representative of the powerful baron who was attainted
                    and executed for the murder of Edward II. the grandfather of the Duke of
                    Clarence. The son of that powerful delinquent had been restored to his honours
                    and estates at a late period of the reign of Edward III. The fourth in descent
                    from the regicide was Roger Mortimer, lord-lieutenant of Ireland, who was looked
                    upon as heir to the crown during the early part of Richard’s reign; but his son
                    Edmund Mortimer was only ten years of age when Richard was deposed, so that his
                    claim was easily set aside. Mortimer died in 1425 without male issue, and the
                    pretensions which he inherited through the Duke of Clarence fell to his sister
                    Anne Mortimer, who espoused Richard of York, earl of Cambridge, the grandson of
                    Edward III. by his fourth son Edmund of Langley, duke of York. But from the
                    foregoing pedigree it is clear that during the life of the Earl of March no
                    right to the crown had descended to any branch of the house of York. Henry,
                    however, notwithstanding the inferiority of his title, was unanimously
                    acknowledged by both houses, and was crowned within a fortnight after the
                    deposition of his predecessor. He was the idol of the populace, the master of
                    parliament, and the heir of the fame and possessions of John of Gaunt.</p>
                <p>The reign of Henry IV. was little else than a continued series of insurrections.
                    In the very first parliament which he assembled, a great number of challenges
                    were given and accepted by different barons; and though Henry had ability and
                    address enough to prevent these duels, it was not in his power to avoid
                    continual combinations and revolts against himself.</p>
                <p>The most formidable of these disorders was that under the Earl of Northumberland.
                    Various causes are assigned for this insurrection. One is, that the resentment
                    of the Percies had been excited by the king denying them the privilege to
                    liberate or ransom their prisoners; for at the battle of Homildon, where the
                    Scotch suffered a defeat, a number of noblemen had fallen into the hands of
                    Hotspur, who commanded the English. The insurgents themselves assigned another
                    cause for the quarrel, and this was probably the real one. In the course of a
                    war with the Welsh, the Lord Grey of Ruthyn and Sir Edmund Mortimer had both
                    fallen into the enemy’s hands. The former being a friend to the king, was
                    allowed to be ransomed by his relations; but the latter, who was uncle to the
                    young Earl of March, the lawful heir to the throne, and of course an object of
                    jealousy to Henry, was denied the privilege of being liberated. This fired with
                    resentment the inflammable spirit of Hotspur, who had married the sister of Sir
                    Edmund; his father the Earl of Northumberland, and his uncle the Earl of
                    Worcester, shared his discontent; and amongst them they projected nothing less
                    than the dethronement of the king.</p>
                <p>With this view they formed an alliance with the Scots and Welsh, who were to make
                    an irruption into England, at the same time that the Percies were to raise what
                    forces they could inorder to join them. The Earl of Northumberland, by a sudden
                    fit of illness, having been incapa-citated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332677"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2677-0732"/> for active warfare, young Percy took the command,
                    and marched to Shrewsbury for the purpose of joining the Welsh. But the king had
                    assembled a small army, with which it was his intention to act against the
                    Scots; and, knowing the importance of celerity in civil wars, instantly hurried
                    to meet the rebels. He approached Shrewsbury before a junction could be effected
                    with the Welsh; and by his headstrong impatience Percy was impelled to risk an
                    engagement, which at that time he ought to have declined. The evening before the
                    battle he sent a manifesto to Henry, in which he renounced his allegiance, set
                    the king at defiance, and enumerated all the grievances of which he imagined the
                    nation might justly complain. Amongst the charges with which he reproached the
                    king, were those of perjury, murder, and usurpation of rightful property. All
                    this vituperation was productive of no other effect than that of exasperating to
                    the utmost both the king and his adherents.</p>
                <p>The armies were fairly matched, consisting of about fourteen thousand men each,
                    and both leaders were men of approved valour. The action, which took place on
                    the 21st of July 1403, was obstinate and bloody. After a chivalrous display of
                    his characteristic valour, Percy was slain by a random arrow, and with his fall
                    the courage and the confidence of his followers evaporated. They were completely
                    routed, and driven from the field with great loss. Lord Worcester and two other
                    conspicuous individuals were beheaded on the field. The Earl of Northumberand,
                    however, notwithstanding his connection with the rebels, was mercifully treated
                    by Henry. But this lenity does not appear to have quieted the country; for
                    various insurrections, particularly amongst the Welsh under the celebrated Owen
                    Glendower, disturbed the remaining years of Henry’s reign. Owen, under the title
                    of Prince of Wales, gained so many remarkable successes over the royal troops,
                    that the king himself publicly attributed them to necromancy. The unconquerable
                    spirit of the Welsh leader actuated all classes of his countrymen, who flocked
                    to his standard from every part in England where they had taken up their abode.
                    Owen remained free and unsubmissive to the English yoke till the close of his
                    career, and the last glimpse which history affords of his patriotic course is as
                    bright as the first.</p>
                <p>The reign of Henry was much disturbed, and the language which our great dramatist
                    makes him employ, “uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,” is remarkably
                    appropriate from the lips of such a monarch. The swell with which the nation
                    heaved when he ascended the throne never subsided during his lifetime. The
                    position in which he stood with regard to the succession seems to have caused
                    him much concern; for the case was a difficult one. In his first parliament his
                    eldest son Henry was created Prince of Wales; and in 1404 the right of that
                    prince’s brothers to reign, in the event of his dying without issue, was
                    recognised by parliament. The most disgraceful feature of Henry’s reign was his
                    deadly persecution of those who entertained the new religious doctrines. In his
                    second year was passed that sanguinary act, the first that stains the English
                    statute-book on the subject, which orders heretics to be burned; and many an
                    unfortunate Lollard suffered for his faith during the sway of the Bolingbrokes.
                    A remarkable circumstance occurred in 1405, namely, the capital punishment of a
                    clergyman of the highest rank. Scroop, archbishop of York, was an enthusiastic
                    defender of the claims of the Earl of March, and, being taken in arms against
                    his sovereign, was beheaded without trial, conviction, or defence.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the act against the Lollards, the doctrines of Wickliff gained
                    ground; and the support which Henry gave the hierarchy did not preclude his
                    parliament from attempting its reformation, and even from despoiling it of part
                    of its possessions.</p>
                <p>In 1405 the Commons, who had been required to grant supplies, proposed to the
                    king to seize all the temporalities of the church, and employ them as a
                    perpetual fund to meet the exigencies of the state. When this address was
                    presented, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who then attended the king, objected
                    that the clergy, though they went not in person to the wars, sent their vassals
                    and tenants in all cases of necessity; whilst at the same time they themselves
                    who staid at home were employed night and day in offering up their supplications
                    for the success of the enterprise and the prosperity of the state. The speaker
                    answered with a sarcastic smile, that he thought the prayers of the church but a
                    very slender supply. The archbishop, however, prevailed in the dispute; the king
                    discouraged the application of the Commons, and the Lords rejected the bill
                    which the lower house had framed. The Commons were not discouraged by this
                    repulse; in 1410 they returned to the charge with renewed zeal and
                    determination.</p>
                <p>A Lollard had been burnt, and the lower house of parliament, as if in retaliation
                    of this atrocity, presented a schedule to the king, showing that he might have
                    from the temporal possessions of the bishops, abbots, and priors, that were then
                    uselessly wasted, 15 earls, 1500 knights, and 6200 esquires. But the reply of
                    the king was severe, and he forbade them to discuss such topics for the future.
                    They then petitioned that the clergy should be subjected to the civil tribunals,
                    but this was also refused; and a request that the statute against the Lollards
                    might be mitigated shared the same fate.</p>
                <p>The reign of Henry was now drawing towards a termination. The last years of his
                    life were darkened by disease, and undistinguished by vigour. He had been
                    subject to eruptions in his face and to attacks of epilepsy. By one of these he
                    was carried off, at Westminster, on the 20th of March 1413, in the forty-seventh
                    year of his age and fourteenth of his reign. Henry owed the English sceptre,
                    not, in the first instance, to his own plotting or ambition, but to a popular
                    revolution against the authority of his predecessor. He landed in England for
                    the avowed purpose of only seizing his own possessions, of which he had been
                    most unwarrantably deprived; but finding Richard a most unpopular sovereign, and
                    his own reputation very high, whilst his affinity to the blood royal was, though
                    not so near as that of the Earl of March, sufficiently so to give him a
                    plausible pretext for standing forward as a candidate for the crown, he
                    accordingly did so, and proved successful. He united in a high degree
                    watchfulness and circumspection, with a bold and decisive policy. For his
                    arbitrary measures he brought forward the plea of necessity, “which,” says Sir
                    James Mackintosh, “prevented them from growing into precedents subversive of the
                    constitution.” As he owed his throne to popular revolt, so he was in some
                    measure compelled to adopt popular principles. Under his reign the House of
                    Commons advanced with a steady pace towards importance and authority. It assumed
                    a higher and more decisive tone than had hitherto characterized its proceedings,
                    and pushed its inquiries into all the affairs and departments of government.</p>
                <p>Henry of Monmouth, eldest son of the preceding monarch, ascended the throne
                    immediately after the death of his father. With the early life of Henry V. we
                    usually associate acts of frivolity, insubordination, and even low vice. But to
                    the creative genius of a powerful poet must in a great measure be attributed
                    this almost universal impression. That he was guilty of delinquencies beneath
                    the dignity of the heir apparent to the English throne, may be true; but there
                    is no satisfactory evidence <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332690"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2690-0733"/>either to confirm or refute the traditionary
                    stories which are told of him. At an early age he discovered talents of no
                    common order. He was only sixteen years of age when the battle of Shrewsbury was
                    fought, and on that occasion he displayed equal firmness and ability.
                    Afterwards, when intrusted with the guardianship of the Welsh marches, he
                    conducted hims∙elf in a manner so highly creditable, that he more than once
                    received the thanks of the House of Commons for his conduct. On his accession to
                    the throne, he made himself popular by several wise and generous measures. He
                    liberated his cousin the Earl of March from the constraint under which that
                    prince, undoubtedly the heir of Edward III., had been held by the jealousy of
                    Henry IV. The Percies, who were exiles in Scotland, he restored to their
                    possessions, and even to a command over their martial vassals. Those ministers
                    of his father who had recommended themselves by their uprightness and decision,
                    were retained in the offices which they held. The chief justice, in particular,
                    who had formerly imprisoned the king, whilst Prince of Wales, for his
                    misconduct, was not only pardoned, but received into high favour. He expressed
                    deep regret for the fate of Richard IL, and performed his funeral obsequies with
                    becoming pomp and solemnity. That Henry had a mind which towered above the level
                    of his contemporaries, his remarkable triumphs in France are evidence; but that
                    in some respects he was not in advance of his age, the severities which he
                    practised against the Lollards afford ample proof. The head of that party was
                    Sir John Oldcastle, an individual alike distinguished for his valour and
                    military talents, and who had acquired the esteem both of the late and present
                    king. His high character pointed him out as a proper object of ecclesiastical
                    fury, and he was accordingly denounced to Henry, who, at a private interview,
                    attempted to make him recant his faith; but in vain. Oldcastle was therefore
                    condemned to suffer the death of a heretic; but having effected his escape, he
                    raised an insurrection, which was soon crushed. He succeeded however in eluding
                    pursuit for four years, but he was at last taken and executed as a traitor.
                    After the suppression of the revolt, the most severe laws were passed against
                    the unfortunate Lollards. It was enacted, that whoever should be convicted of
                    Lollardy, besides suffering capital punishment according to the laws formerly
                    established, would also forfeit his lands and goods to the king; and the
                    officers of government were likewise bound by oath to use their utmost
                    endeavours to extirpate the heresy.</p>
                <p>The restoration of tranquillity afforded Henry an opportunity of turning his
                    attention to France, the miserable condition of which offered a fair prospect of
                    success to his arms. The claim of his family to the crown of that country was
                    revived; and on the 15th of April 1415 he assembled a great council at
                    Westminster, to whom he announced his determination of making a “voyage in his
                    own proper person, by the grace of God, to recover his inheritance.” He
                    appointed his brother, the Duke of Bedford, lord lieutenant of the kingdom
                    during his absence. When about to set sail for Normandy, a rash conspiracy broke
                    out, which detained him for a little time; but it was soon suppressed, and Henry
                    embarked at Southampton with an army of aboiit thirty thousand men, the greater
                    proportion of whom were archers. He entered the Seine, and having reduced
                    Harfleur, he challenged the dauphin to meet him in single combat, and decide the
                    contest for the crown of the country which he had invaded. But this was destined
                    to be competed for on a far wider arena than that which two combatants could
                    occupy. Henry crossed the Somme, and was proceeding on his road towards Calais,
                    when he came up with the enemy at a small village, called by the French
                    Azincourt, and by the English Agincourt. Here was fought a great and decisive
                    battle, which ended in the total defeat of the French army, estimated at not
                    less than four times the strength of that of the English. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Agincourt.)</hi> Henry did not immediately pursue his victory,
                    and returned to England, where he was received with the utmost enthusiasm; but
                    he soon afterwards rejoined his troops in France. The claimants for the crown of
                    that kingdom were so numerous, that had he boldly prosecuted his own schemes,
                    the opposing factions might have leagued together against him as a common enemy.
                    It was therefore his policy to remain inactive, and, by tampering with them
                    separately, to foment the discord which prevailed amongst the French leaders. On
                    the 21 st of May 1420, a treaty was at length concluded at Troyes, which
                    promised to crown the hopes of the Plantagenets with success, and establish them
                    on the throne of France. The principal articles stipulated the marriage of Henry
                    with Catherine, daughter of the French king; that Henry should be regent of
                    France whilst Charles remained alive; and that he should succeed that monarch
                    after his decease. Henry accordingly espoused the French princess; but he was
                    not long permitted to enjoy his connubial happiness or his good fortune. A fatal
                    malady seized him at Paris; and having been conducted by his own orders to
                    Vincennes, he expired there on the 31st of August 1422, in the thirty-fourth
                    year of his age, and the tenth of his reign.</p>
                <p>The name of Henry V. is adorned with all the splendour of brilliant conquest and
                    Successful ambition. By a single victory he brought the crown of France within
                    his reach, if not within his grasp. But he had other qualities besides those of
                    a warrior; he was a statesman of consummate skill, as his conduct after the
                    victory of Agincourt sufficiently testifies. His mind was altogether of a
                    superior order, and there seems nothing to prevent his being ranked with the
                    greatest of English monarchs, except the countenance which he gave to
                    ecclesiastical persecutions.</p>
                <p>By Catherine of France Henry had a son who succeeded him when not yet <hi
                    rend="italic">a year</hi> old. The whole of his long reign is occupied with a
                    war for the French crown, and a disastrous civil war in England between the
                    houses of York and Lancaster. At the accession of Henry VI. parliament ordered a
                    new royal title, in which he was recognized as king of France and England, and
                    lord of Ireland; appointed his father’s eldest brother, the Duke of Bedford,
                    protector, defender, and chief counsellor of the kingdom and of the English
                    church; and in his absence invested the Duke of Gloucester, his younger brother,
                    with these honours. A council was named, and certain articles enacted, for the
                    purpose of limiting the power of the protector. The kingdom of France was now in
                    the most deplorable situation. By the solemn investiture off the infant king of
                    England with the royal prerogative in that country, Charles VII. succeeded only
                    to a nominal kingdom; for the greater portion of it adhered to the interests of
                    Henry. But notwithstanding all these advantages, the English daily lost ground,
                    and in the year 1450 they were finally expelled from the country. See the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">France.</hi></p>
                <p>• It may be easily conceived that such a train of bad success was likely to be
                    productive of discontent at home. Continual animosities were kept up amongst the
                    king’s counsellors during the first thirty years of his nominal rule. This
                    tended to plunge the nation in convulsions, and prepare it for becoming the
                    theatre of a sanguinary civil war. Humphrey duke of Gloucester was envied by
                    many on account of his high station. Amongst these was Thomas Beaufort, bishop
                    of Winchester, afterwards cardinal, the legitimate son of John of Gaunt, brother
                    to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332703" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2703-0734"/>Richard IL
                    This prelate, to whom the care of the king’s education had been committed, was a
                    man of some capacity and experience, but of an intriguing and restless
                    disposition. He had frequent disputes with the Duke of Gloucester, over whom he
                    gained several advantages. The Duke of Bedford employed both his own authority
                    and that of parliament to reconcile them, but in vain; their mutual animosities
                    served for several years to embarrass government, and to lay it open to its
                    enemies. The sentiments of the two leaders were particularly divided with regard
                    to France. The bishop laid hold of every prospect of accommodation with that
                    country; and the Duke of Gloucester was for maintaining the honour of the
                    English arms, and regaining whatever had been lost by defeat or delay. Both
                    parties, therefore, called in all the auxiliaries they could command. The bishop
                    resolved to strengthen himself by procuring a proper match for Henry, at that
                    time twenty-three years of age, and then by bringing over the queen to his
                    interests. Accordingly, the Earl of Suffolk, a nobleman whom he knew to be
                    stedfast in attachment to him, was sent over to France, apparently to settle the
                    terms of a truce which had then been contemplated, but in reality to procure a
                    suitable consort for the young king.</p>
                <p>The bishop and his friends had turned their attention to Margaret of Anjou,
                    daughter of Regnier, titular king of Sicily, Naples, and Jerusalem, but who was
                    destitute of either real power or possessions. She was looked upon as the most
                    accomplished princess of the age, both in mind and person; and it was thought
                    the abilities which she possessed would supply the want of them in her husband,
                    to whom maturity of years had brought no maturity of understanding. He was a
                    child from the cradle to the grave. The treaty was therefore hastened on by
                    Suffolk, and soon afterwards ratified in England. Previously to the king’s
                    marriage, however, a conspicuous blow was struck at the protector’s greatness.
                    In that age a charge of sorcery was capable of blasting any character, however
                    spotless or pure; and even of throwing odium upon all who were related to the
                    individual accused. It was an irresistible weapon made use of by churchmen for
                    the destruction of their enemies, and it was wielded by the prelate against his
                    political opponent with tremendous force. He brought forward an accusation of
                    sorcery and treason against Elinor Cobham, wife or concubine of the Duke of
                    Gloucester. She was charged with having made an image of the king in wax, which
                    being placed before a gentle fire, gradually dissolved; and it was expected that
                    as the wax wasted away, the strength of the king would also disappear, and that
                    his death would take place when the whole of the image had melted. Three other
                    individuals were implicated in this accusation, which was readily believed. The
                    prisoners were pronounced guilty; the duchess was condemned to do penance and
                    suffer perpetual imprisonment; one priest was hanged, and another died in
                    prison; whilst, to consummate the affair, Margaret Jourdemayn, a reputed witch,
                    was burnt at Smithfield.</p>
                <p>The Bishop of Winchester was resolved to carry his resentment against Gloucester
                    to the utmost. He procured a parliament to be summoned, not at London, which was
                    too well affected towards the duke, but at St Edmundsbury, where the prelate’s
                    adherents greatly preponderated. As soon as Gloucester appeared, he was accused
                    of treason, and thrown into prison. On the day appointed for him to make his
                    defence, he was found dead in his bed, though without any signs of violence upon
                    his body. This, however, is no proof that he came not by a violent end.</p>
                <p>The death of the Duke of Gloucester was universally ascribed to the cardinal of
                    Winchester, who himself died six weeks thereafter, without leaving behind him so
                    good a name as his political adversary. The Lancasterian party was thus deprived
                    of its chiefs: no male Plantagenet of that lineage remained except the king, who
                    was at best but an apology for one.</p>
                <p>After the demise of the cardinal of Winchester, Suffolk governed with
                    uncontrolled sway. But his conduct was obnoxious to the rest of the nobility,
                    who now concerted measures for his destruction. In the year 1447 he was
                    impeached of high treason on various charges. He was accused of exciting the
                    French to invade England, in order to depose Henry and place on the throne De la
                    Pole’s son, who was to marry Somerset’s daughter, considered by the Lancasterian
                    party as the next in succession to the crown. He was also charged with the loss
                    of France by his negotiations in that country, and with revealing state secrets
                    to the French ministers. Other illegal acts were ascribed to him in the bill of
                    impeachment; and so strong did the current of opinion run against him, that,
                    whether guilty or not, the king was compelled to banish him from the kingdom.
                    But this did not satisfy his enemies, who looked upon expatriation as a
                    sheltering from justice rather than as a punishment. The captain of a ship was
                    therefore employed to intercept him in his passage to France; and, having been
                    seized near Dover, his head was struck off in a small boat, and his body
                    consigned to the waves.</p>
                <p>The complaints against Henry’s government were heightened by an insurrection,
                    headed by an individual of equivocal descent, but who has been transmitted to
                    posterity by the name or nickname of Jack Cade. He assumed the honourable name
                    of John Mortimer; and having assembled a great body of the peasantry of Kent, he
                    marched to Blackheath. A message was sent to him by the king, demanding the
                    cause of the insurrection. The audacious Cade answered in the name of the
                    community, that their purpose was to punish evil counsellors, and to obtain a
                    redress of grievances. Henry assembled a force; but part of it having been
                    defeated, the remainder refused to fight, and the king retired from the field.
                    Lord Say, the treasurer, was committed to the Tower, in order to satisfy the
                    revolters. In the mean time, the citizens of London opened their gates to the
                    victorious rebel, who made a triumphant entry into the city arrayed in the
                    shining armour and gilt spurs of a knight. For some time he maintained great
                    order and regularity amongst his troops. He always led them out into the fields
                    in the night-time, and published several edicts against every kind of plunder
                    and violence. His followers, however, were not to be thus restrained. Lord Say,
                    without any trial, was beheaded; and soon afterwards, the insurgents, having
                    committed some irregularities, were shut out of the city by the inhabitants.
                    Cade endeavoured to force his way back to his quarters, when a bloody scuffle
                    ensued, which was only terminated by the approach of night. The Archbishop of
                    Canterbury, and the chancellor, who had taken refuge in the Tower, hearing how
                    matters stood, drew up an act of amnesty, which was privately circulated amongst
                    the rebels. This had an electrical effect upon them, and in the morning Cade
                    found himself totally abandoned by his followers. He effected his escape, but
                    was afterwards captured and slain. A number of circumstances now contributed to
                    revive the long dormant pretensions of the house of York to the throne. France
                    had been lost; the arms of England had been disgraced; Margaret the queen, by
                    violence and arrogance, was most unpopular; the king himself was a perfect
                    cipher; whilst, in strong contrast to him, appeared the Duke of York, a man of
                    popular virtues, and the legitimate heir to regal power, according to the
                    English laws of real inheritance. All the males of the house of Mortimer were
                    now extinct; but Anne, the sister of the last Earl of March, having <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193332716" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2716-0735"/> espoused the Earl
                    of Cambridge, who had been beheaded for treason in the reign of Henry V. had
                    transmitted her latent but unforgotten claim to her son Richard. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> -</hi> This prince, descended by his mother from Philippa,
                    only daughter of the Duke of Clarence, third son of Edward III. stood plainly in
                    order of succession before the king, who derived his descent from the Duke of
                    Lancaster, fourth son of that monarch. The duke was a man of valour and
                    abilities, as well as of some ambition; and he thought that the weakness and
                    unpopularity of the present reign afforded a favourable opportunity for
                    asserting his title. The ensign of Richard was a white rose, and that of Henry a
                    red one; circumstances which gave names to the two factions who were now about
                    to deluge the kingdom in blood.</p>
                <p>The Duke of York was in Ireland during the proceedings against Suffolk and the
                    sedition of Cade. in September 1450 he returned to England, a circumstance which
                    excited considerable alarm at court. He advanced upon London; and, proceeding to
                    the palace at Westminster, knelt before the king, and, deploring the state of
                    the kingdom, entreated him to summon a parliament. The queen appears to have
                    evinced her usual arrogance upon this occasion; but York succeeded in extorting
                    a promise from the king that he would comply with his request, upon which he
                    retired to his castle at Fotheringay. He was scarcely gone, however, when the
                    Duke of Somerset, returned from France, and was chosen favourite adviser of the
                    king. The session of parliament proved unquiet and stormy. York presented a
                    complaint against the administration of Somerset, and in the year following
                    exhibited several articles of impeachment against him. But the power and
                    influence of the queen rendered his efforts fruitless. Legal prosecutions became
                    thus inadequate to suit the feelings of the enraged York, and he accordingly
                    assembled an army. The king, doubting his ability to triumph by opposing force
                    to force, affected to acquiesce in the demands of the duke, and put Somerset
                    under restraint. Upon this York disbanded his troops, and retired unattended to
                    the royal pavilion, where he was immediately made prisoner, and compelled to
                    take an oath of allegiance to the king. Somerset rose higher in favour than
                    ever, and completed his ascendency in the government by obtaining the entire
                    confidence of the king and his consort.</p>
                <p>On the !3th of October 1453 Queen Margaret presented her husband with a son and
                    heir, the ill-fated Edward prince of Wales. Not long afterwards the king sunk
                    into a state of mental as well as bodily incapacity, and the star of York again
                    appeared above the horizon. The total imbecility of the king having been
                    ascertained, the Duke of York was chosen protector and defender of the kingdom.
                    Previously to this event Somerset had been removed from the palace of the queen
                    to the Tower. The king’s malady was not permanent, and on his recovery he put an
                    end to the protectorate, released Somerset from his confinement, and reinstated
                    him in his honours. This was a mortal blow to the peace of York; and having
                    conferred with the powerful Earls of Warwick and Salisbury, who united
                    themselves to his interests, he took the field with the declared intention of
                    only expelling Somerset from the government. But this nobleman’s fate involved
                    that of the house of Lancaster. It was in vain that the king attempted a
                    reconciliation of interests; he was compelled to have recourse to arms, and meet
                    the Yorkists in open warfare. A battle took place* at St Albans, in which the
                    royalists were totally defeated; Somerset, the immediate cause of the conflict,
                    having fallen in the action.</p>
                <p>The king relapsed into his former state, and the Duke of York was a second time
                    chosen protector; but the queen, who could not brook the idea of his continuing
                    at the head of government, procured his dismissal. She is even charged with
                    having conspired his destruction, and that of his most conspicuous adherents. A
                    temporary reconciliation was effected, but discord was again introduced; and the
                    parties having irrecoverably lost confidence in each other, prepared for the
                    deadly struggle of arms.</p>
                <p>The forces of the Duke of York under the Earl of Salisbury gained an advantage
                    over the royalists at Blore-heath; but a fatal desertion on the part of York’s
                    troops at Ludlow turned the balance in favour of the king; and York fled to
                    Ireland, where he was joyfully received.</p>
                <p>But this disaster, though in appearance it suppressed the party of York, was far
                    from being fatal to its power. The snake was scotched, not killed, and it only
                    waited a favourable opportunity for darting on its victim. This soon presented
                    itself. Warwick, who had retained the government of Calais, landed in Kent, and,
                    being joined by a number of barons, advanced upon the capital, which he entered
                    amidst the acclamations of the people. The number of his troops had now so much
                    increased that he found himself in a condition to encounter the royal army.
                    Early in July 1460 he came up with them at Southampton, and a bloody battle
                    ensued, in which the king was taken prisoner, and his army utterly dispersed.
                    Meanwhile the Duke of York having returned from Ireland, openly laid claim to
                    the crown. in the House of Lords the cause of Henry and the Duke of York was
                    solemnly debated; and the latter, though a conqueror, did not absolutely gain
                    his cause. It was determined that Henry should possess the throne during his
                    life, and that the Duke of York should be appointed his successor, to the utter
                    exclusion of Henry’s offspring.</p>
                <p>Though the royal party now seemed destitute of every resource, the queen still
                    retained her intrepidity, disdaining every arrangement which implied the
                    dethronement of her child. Wales seemed the natural place of refuge for the
                    mother of him who was called its prince, and thither accordingly she fled. This
                    warlike dame assembled a considerable army to rescue her pusillanimous husband,
                    and marched to the northern provinces, where Northumberland and Clifford joined
                    her with their borderers. This union having alarmed the victorious party, York
                    and Somerset hastened to anticipate their designs, and, having assembled a
                    sufficient force, succeeded in reaching the strong castle of Sandal before
                    Christmas. Actuated by the pride of prowess and the impatience of inaction, York
                    engaged the queen’s army with one of inferior force. The conflict took place at
                    Wakefield on the 30th of December 1460, and terminated in the total defeat of
                    the Yorkists. The duke himself was either slain in the action, or put to death
                    after it; whilst the Earl of Salisbury was taken during the night, and
                    decapitated next day. But no one was so much lamented as the young Earl of
                    Rutland, the son of York, a boy in the twelfth year of his age. He was made
                    prisoner, and coolly stabbed to the heart by Clifford, in revenge for the death
                    of his father, who had perished at the battle of St Albans.</p>
                <p>After this victory Margaret marched towards London, in order to set the king at
                    liberty; but the Earl of Warwick, who had now put himself at the head of the
                    Yorkists, led about the captive king in order to give a sanction to his
                    proceedings. Except by the countenance which his presence seemed to give to the
                    transactions of the Yorkists, he was as inert an instrument in their hands as
                    the royal standard which waved above their lines. Warwick engaged the queen’s
                    forces at St Albans; but, through the treachery of Lord Lovelace, who deserted
                    with a considerable force during the heat of the action, Warwick was defeated,
                    and the pageant king fell once moíe into the hands of his own party.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332729" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2729-0736"/>
                <p>The submission of the city of London seemed now to be all that was wanting to
                    complete the queen’s success; but Warwick had secured it in his interests, and
                    the citizens refused to open their gates to the royal victor. In the meań time,
                    young Edward, eldest son of the late Duke of York, put himself at the head of
                    his father’s party. He was now in the bloom of youth, remarkable for the beauty
                    of his person and for bravery; and he was, moreover, a very great favourite with
                    the people. He defeated Jasper Tudor, earl of Pembroke, at Mortimer’s Cross in
                    Herefordshire; the earl himself being taken prisoner, and immediately beheaded
                    by Edward’s orders.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile he was joined by the remainder of Warwick’s army, and the united forces
                    entered the metropolis amidst the applause of the people of the city and of the
                    surrounding provinces. Edward laid his claim before a council of lords, and on
                    the 4th of March 1461 he was proclaimed king by the style and title of Edward
                    IV.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding all her disasters, the queen remained inflexibly devoted to
                    her purpose. She retired to the northern counties, where such numbers flocked to
                    her standard that her army very soon amounted to sixty thousand men. Edward IV.
                    was a voluptuary, but he never allowed his activity and vigilance to slacken.
                    With Warwick and an army of forty thousand men he commenced his march to the
                    north. The hostile forces met at Towton, in the county of York, on the 29th of
                    March 1461, and an obstinate engagement ensued, which continued during the
                    night, and was renewed with the utmost fierceness on the following morning. The
                    queen’s army was totally defeated, and, as quarter was given on neither side,
                    the slaughter was dreadful. Between thirty and forty thousand persons perished
                    in these two bloody days. After this disaster the queen with her husband took
                    refuge in Scotland, whilst Edward returned to the metropolis, where he was
                    crowned on the 29th of June 1461. For three years Edward IV. possessed the
                    throne without any serious insurrection having taken place on the part of the
                    Lancasterians. But during this period Queen Margaret was making strenuous
                    exertions both in France and Scotland to raise a force capable of taking the
                    field against Edward. Having collected a small army, she made an inroad into
                    England, but after several indecisive skirmishes she was totally defeated at
                    Hexham, in Northumberland, on the 17th of May 1464. The Duke of Somerset, who
                    commanded for her, was beheaded; and a number of gentlemen were also executed at
                    York, with little form of law or justice. ∙ . ,</p>
                <p>By these repeated misfortunes the house of Lancaster became so effectually
                    reduced that Margaret was obliged to separate from her husband, and both were
                    compelled to seek their safety in individual flight. The king was still
                    protected by some of his friends, who conveyed him to Lancashire, where he was
                    at last discovered, and consigned to the Tower as a prisoner. The queen made her
                    escape through Scotland into France, along with her son, and his famous
                    preceptor Sir John Fortescue.</p>
                <p>In the mean time King Edward vigorously applied himself to the affairs of
                    government. Feeling secure on the throne, he now also began <hi rend="subscript"
                    > i</hi> to give way to the gratification of his amatory passions, to which he
                    was exceedingly prone. In order to divert his mind from such debasing
                    indulgences, the Earl of Warwick, hitherto his steady friend, advised him to
                    marry. Edward consented, and the earl was appointed to negotiate a match with
                    the Princess Bonne of Savoy. He was successful in his mission, but before the
                    conclusion of the marriage treaty the king privately espoused a lady of whom he
                    had become enamoured, and who resisted all his efforts to form an illicit
                    connexion. This lady was Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Philip Woodville, and relict
                    of Sir John Grey, a Lancasterian, who had fallen at the second battle of St
                    Albans. The parties were solemnly united in marriage on the 1st of May 1464, and
                    the bride was acknowledged and in due time crowned. This transaction highly
                    displeased Warwick, who afterwards became still more disgusted at the favour
                    shown to the queen’s party, his own and his sovereign’s natural enemies. A plan
                    of revenge was therefore set on foot, and a most powerful conspiracy was also
                    formed against Edward. To accomplish his aim, Warwick not only employed his own
                    influence, which was very extensive, but likewise that of the Duke of Clarence,
                    Edward’s brother, on whom the earl had conferred the hand of his daughter
                    without the king’s permission. The effects of Warwick’s secret combination with
                    Clarence, his own brother Montague, and the discontented nobility and gentry,
                    soon began to appear. Sedition was fomented throughout the country, and a
                    popular insurrection at last broke out in Yorkshire, where Robin of Redesdale, a
                    hero amongst the moss troopers of the border, appeared at the head of sixty
                    thousand men. The articles of their manifesto were principally directed against
                    the king’s counsellors and the church.</p>
                <p>Henry earl of Pembroke was sent against them with a body of seven or eight
                    thousand men. He was joined by Lord Stafford with five thousand more troops, and
                    the two commanders prepared to meet the insurgents. They at first received a
                    repulse, but it was <hi rend="italic">of no</hi> material importance. An
                    unfortunate dispute, however, between Pembroke and Stafford, caused the latter
                    to march off the field with his troops; and in a battle which immediately
                    afterwards ensued, the royalists were cut to pieces, and their commander taken
                    prisoner and beheaded.</p>
                <p>The king, enraged at this, caused Stafford to be executed in a like summary
                    manner. This event completed the disaffection of the king’s followers, who now
                    deserted him in thousands; and he himself was at last taken prisoner by Warwick
                    and his friends; but this conquest embarrassed the confederated nobles. The
                    detention of the king was not popular; and the military refused to act until he
                    was released, which took place accordingly, and a reconciliation was effected.
                    The truce was, however, of short duration. A new insurrection broke out in
                    Lincolnshire, in .which Warwick and Clarence were deeply involved. The rebels
                    were commanded by Sir Robert Welles, son to a nobleman of the same name. Under
                    an alleged charge of treason, the latter was beheaded by the king, who marched
                    against the insurgents with his usual celerity, and gave them a total overthrow
                    at Erpingham, in Rutlandshire, on the 12th of March 1469. Warwick and Clarence
                    again attempted to entrap Edward, but having failed of success, they escaped to
                    France.</p>
                <p>Louis XL openly espoused the cause of the malcontent barons, and effected a
                    reconciliation between them and the fugitive Queen Margaret. Their mortal
                    enmities were reconciled in common hatred of the king of England. A treaty was
                    concluded, which stipulated that Edward should espouse Anne Neville, Warwick’s
                    daughter, and that they should combine their efforts to restore Henry to the
                    throne of which he had been deprived. It was likewise agreed upon, that in case
                    of failure of issue by the prince, the crown should descend to Clarence. After
                    these preliminary arrangements, Warwick assembled a small force, and set sail
                    for England, where he landed whilst Edward was in the north suppressing an
                    insurrection which had there broken out. This seems to have been an artifice
                    practised by a brother-in-law of Warwick’s, who thus drew the incautious monarch
                    to a distant part of the kingdom, and left the southern counties open to the
                    invader. Warwick was a great favourite with the people, the subject of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193332742" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2742-0737"/> popular ballads,
                    which resounded his praise throughout every town in the kingdom. Thousands
                    having flocked to his standard, he advanced upon London, and there proclaimed
                    Henry VI. The usual activity of Edward seems to have forsaken him, or else his
                    pernicious frivolities had alienated the affections of his troops, whose
                    fidelity towards him likewise decreased as Warwick drew near to them. Edward was
                    compelled to fly to Holland, Clarence and Warwick made their triumphal entry
                    into the capital, and Henry was formally restored to regal authority. But those
                    who had reinstated him had placed only a barren sceptre in his grasp, for the
                    real power resided with them. Edward was pronounced an usurper, and all acts
                    passed under his sanction were repealed. The crown was settled on the male issue
                    of Henry VI., and in default of such issue, on the Duke of Clarence and the
                    heirs of his body. But Edward’s party was not yet destroyed. After an absence of
                    nine mouths, he, seconded by a small body of troops granted him by the Duke of
                    Burgundy, made a descent at Ravenspur in Yorkshire. At first he met with little
                    success; but his army increasing on his march, he was soon in a condition to
                    appear before the capital, which instantly opened its gates to receive him.</p>
                <p>The unfortunate Henry was thus again plucked from the throne; and the hopes of
                    Warwick were almost totally blasted by the defection of Clarence, Edward’s
                    brother. He however advanced to within about ten miles of London, resolving to
                    wait the approach of Edward, and took a position at Barnet, where, on the 14th
                    of April 1471, a battle was fought, more remarkable for its consequences than
                    for the number of the slain or the obstinacy of the combatants. Considering the
                    animosity existing between the parties, the general slaughter was unusually
                    small; but amongst the fallen were Warwick and his brother Montague; and the
                    death of the first of these individuals was of far more importance to Edward
                    than the victory which he had gained. It broke the charm which associated with
                    his name the certainty of victory and success to the cause which he espoused. On
                    account of the remarkable transactions in which he had been engaged, he received
                    the appellation of “the king-maker.” FIis death also destroyed the greatness of
                    the house of Neville.</p>
                <p>At this time the queen had just returned with her son from France, where she had
                    been soliciting supplies. She had scarcely time to refresh herself from the
                    fatigues of the voyage, when she received the fatal news of the death of
                    Warwick, and the total destruction of his forces. All her resolution was unable
                    to support her under this calamity, and she sunk to the ground in despair. Upon
                    recovering herself, she took sanctuary in the Abbey of Beaulieu in Hampshire,
                    where she still found friends ready to assist her. Tudor earl of Pembroke,
                    Courtenay earl of Devonshire, the Lords Wenlock and St John, with some other men
                    of rank, encouraged her yet to hope for success, and promised to stand by her to
                    the last. On this assurance she resumed the undaunted bearing which was natural
                    to her, and, advancing through the counties of Devon, Somerset, and Gloucester,
                    collected a considerable army. The hostile forces came in sight of each other at
                    Tewkesbury on the I4th of May 1471, where a battle was fought, which decided
                    this sanguinary war. The queen’s army was totally defeated; the Earl of
                    Devonshire and Lord Wenlock were slain in the conflict; the Duke of Somerset,
                    and about twenty other persons of distinction, who had taken shelter in a
                    church, were surrounded, dragged forth, and immediately beheaded; about three
                    thousand of their soldiers fell in battle, and the rest were entirely dispersed.
                    Queen Margaret and her son were taken prisoners, and brought to the king, who
                    asked the prince how he dared to invade his dominions. The youth replied that he
                    came hither to claim his just inheritance; upon which Edward struck him on the
                    face with his gauntlet. The Dukes of Clarence and Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and
                    Sir Thomas Gray, taking this blow as a signal for further violence, hurried the
                    prince into the next apartment, and there, it is said, dispatched him.<note

                    charge ûf murder in this case. (See Turner’s History of England, vol. ii. p.

                    thousand crowns. She survived her deliverance about seven years, during which
                    time she lived in France, withdrawn from the tumults of state.</p>
                <p>Edward being now freed from all his enemies, began to inflict punishment on those
                    who had formerly appeared against him. Amongst the cruelties which he committed,
                    that on his brother the Duke of Clarence was the most remarkable. They had been
                    formally reconciled to each other; but this hollow truce to fraternal animosity
                    was broken by a singular incident. Whilst the king was one day hunting in the
                    park of one Burdett, a servant of the duke, he killed a white buck which was a
                    great favourite of the owner. Burdett, concerned at the loss, broke into a
                    transport of rage, and declared that he wished the horns of the deer were in the
                    bclly of the person who advised the king to that insult. For this exclamation
                    Burdett was tried, for his life, and executed at Tyburn. Clarence exclaimed
                    against this sentence as iniquitous, for which he was attainted of treason, and
                    charged with sorcery, in order to give to Burdett’s expressions the dignity of
                    necromantic imprecation. Sentence of death was pronounced against him; but the
                    king having some repugnance to order the public execution of a brother, he was
                    dispatched in private. There was a rumour prevalent at the time that he was
                    drowned in a butt of malmsey wine, to which he is said to have been very
                    partial; but there is no proof that his murder was effected in this manner.</p>
                <p>The remainder of Edward IV.’s reign is unimportant. A war with France, which
                    followed the civil wars in England, terminated in 1475 without being
                    characterized by any memorable events. But the foolish idea of aggrandisement in
                    France was still popular with the people, and Edward employed a considerable
                    portion of the latter years of his reign in making apparent preparations for
                    reviving the pretensions of his predecessors to the crown of that country. It
                    does not appear, however, that he ever had any intention of carrying his threats
                    into execution. Edward died on the 9th of April 1483, in the forty-second year
                    of his age and twenty-first of his reign, calculating from the period of his
                    first assuming the crown. In the character of Edward IV. we see a combination by
                    no means singular of great and vicious qualities. As a commander he possessed
                    decision, promptitude, daring, and valour, in a remarkable degree; in these
                    respects indeed he surpassed all his competitors. But the laurels which he won
                    in the field were stained by many cool-blooded atrocities, which altogether
                    deprive the individual who perpetrated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332755"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2755-0738"/> them of any claim to real greatness. He was cruel
                    and faithless, and no barrier was capable of restraining him from indulging in
                    sensual gratifications. Besides five daughters, he left two sons; Edward prince
                    of Wales, his successor, then in his twelfth year; and Richard duke of York,
                    then in his eleventh year.</p>
                <p>On the death of Edward IV. the kingdom was divided into new factions; and those
                    of the queen’s family, who, during the last reign, had come into power, were
                    obnoxious to the old nobility, who looked upon them as upstarts and inferiors.
                    The king had endeavoured to prevent these animosities proceeding to any extent,
                    by desiring on his death-bed that his brother Richard duke of Gloucester should
                    be entrusted with the regency; and he recommended peace and unanimity during the
                    minority of his son. But the monarch was no sooner dead than the former
                    resentment between the two parties burst forth with violence; and the Duke of
                    Gloucester, to whom it is customary to attribute every bad quality, resolved to
                    profit by their contentions. As soon as he learned the tidings of his brother’s
                    death, he proceeded to Ludlow Castle, where Prince Edward then was under the
                    charge of Lord Rivers, his uncle by the mother’s side. This nobleman was charged
                    by Gloucester with having instilled into the mind of his young ward unfavourable
                    opinions of the protector, and under this groundless accusation he was put into
                    confinement, along with others of the Woodville family. Gloucester, with
                    Buckingham, his noted accomplice, marched to London with Prince Edward, and the
                    other young prince’s person having also been secured, both of them were
                    consigned to the Tower, under the specious pretext that they would there be safe
                    from the machinations of their enemies. The coronation was postponed from the
                    4th of May till the 22d of June, so that the secret purposes of the protector
                    began to be unveiled; and it would seem probable that Hastings and Stanley, the
                    friends of the late king, began to show some misgivings as to the designs of
                    Richard. At a council held in the Tower on the 13th of June 1483, Hastings was
                    seized, and soon afterwards executed upon a log of timber, without any form of
                    trial. Stanley and other obnoxious lords were thrown into various dungeons; and
                    on the same day Earl Rivers and some others were executed at Pomfret Castle, on
                    the most unjust pretences of treason.</p>
                <p>The protector now considered himself as in a situation to lay claim to the
                    throne. He used his utmost endeavours to inspire the people with a notion of the
                    illegitimate birth of the late king, and that his children were not only
                    illegitimate on this account, but also because their father had been secretly
                    wedded to Elinor Butler previously to the solemnization of marriage between him
                    and Elizabeth Woodville. Shaw,, a popular preacher, was hired to harangue the
                    people to this effect from St Paul’s cross. The number of Edward’s amours gave
                    some plausibility to these rumours, and prepared the minds of the people for the
                    usurpation of the crown by Richard. Two days afterwards Buckingham harangued the
                    populace in much the same manner as Shaw; and on the 25th of June 1483, that
                    nobleman presented Richard with a parchment purporting to be a declaration of
                    the estates of parliament in favour of the protector, as the only legitimate
                    prince of the house of York. Richard, with his usual dissimulation, evinced some
                    hesitation upon the point; but on the following day he took possession of the
                    crown, and from the 26th of June 1483 Js accordingly dated the commencement of
                    his reign.</p>
                <p>The only obstacles which now interposed between Richard and the peaceful
                    possession of the crown were his two nephews, whom he still kept in the Tower,
                    for the sake of safety, as he miscalled their imprisonment. During a progress
                    through the kingdom a confederacy was formed against him, and meetings were
                    held, which had for their object the liberation of the princes. But this was
                    unnecessary, as they had been privately dispatched by the king’s orders. The
                    manner of their death was kept a profound secret, and. it is very doubtful if
                    even yet we are acquainted with the real facts. The most probable account,
                    however, is, that Richard having tampered in vain with Brackenbury, the governor
                    of the Tower, to put them to death, found a ready instrument for the execution
                    of his diabolical purpose in Sir James Tyrrel, his master of the horse. This
                    individual, with two other ruffianly associates, having obtained access during
                    the night to the apartment of the princes, smothered them as they lay asleep,
                    and buried their bodies at the foot of the staircase.</p>
                <p>Richard having thus secured himself on the throne, attempted to strengthen his
                    interest by means of foreign alliances, and also by procuring the favour of the
                    clergy at home; but he found his power threatened from a quarter where he least
                    expected an attack. The Duke of Buckingham, who had been so instrumental in
                    raising him to the throne, either thinking his services inadequately rewarded,
                    or for some other causes which cannot now be ascertained, instigated a revolt
                    against Richard. The horror with which the intelligence of the midnight murder
                    in the Tower was received prepared the public mind for seconding the designs of
                    Buckingham, who, with several other leading individuals in the kingdom, now
                    declared for Henry, the young Earl of Richmond, in opposition to Richard. The
                    earl, at this period an exile in Brittany, was considered as the chief of the
                    Lancasterian party. His right to the crown by succession was, however, very
                    equivocal; but the cruel behaviour of Richard inclined the people generally to
                    favour his pretensions; and, in order to give an additional strength to his
                    title, a match was projected between him and the Princess Elizabeth, the eldest
                    daughter of Edward IV., which, by uniting the two rival families, would put an
                    end to those dissensions which had so long distracted the kingdom and deluged it
                    with kindred blood. Messengers were accordingly dispatched to give him
                    information of the conspiracy, which fortunately escaped the usual vigilance of
                    Richard; and, in about a fortnight afterwards, Richmond returned an answer,
                    which was no sooner communicated to his friends than it reached the cars of the
                    king. The latter immediately summoned his adherents to join him with their
                    retainers at Leicester; and after proclaiming Buckingham a traitor, he marched
                    against him at the head of his army. In the mean time storms nterrupted the
                    voyage of Henry; and the army of Buckingham, dispirited by broken bridges and
                    impassable currents, broke up and dispersed. A price was set upon the head of
                    Buckingham, who fled, but was betrayed into the hands of Richard, and
                    immediately put to death.</p>
                <p>Richard, now emboldened by his success, employed every means of confirming his
                    title to the throne, and destroying the plans of the exiles and malcontents. He
                    summoned a parliament, the first which he had ventured to call together; and an
                    act was passed declaring him undoubted king of the realm, and settling it upon
                    his son Edward, prince of Wales. The marriage of Edward IV. with Elizabeth
                    Woodville was declared null, and his son pronounced a bastard: then followed a
                    severe bill of attainder, in which several noblemen, bishops, knights, and
                    gentlemen, were deprived of their estates, honours, and rights.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding all the measures of severity adopted by Richard, he was
                    seriously alarmed at the projected marriage between Henry of Richmond and the
                    eldest <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332768" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2768-0739"
                    />daughter of the late king. To defeat this project, therefore, now became the
                    chief policy of the king. The princess was induced to quit her sanctuary and
                    come under the protection of Richard, who probably had destined her for his son;
                    but the death of that prince forced him to alter his plans, and secure her for
                    himself. Lady Anne Neville, Richard’s queen, was in infirm health, and this
                    induced him secretly to make an offer of his hand to the young princess, which
                    she agreed to accept. During the illness of Anne, Elizabeth discovered, it is
                    said, an unnatural degree of impatience, and hinted her surprise at its
                    duration; a most suspicious circumstance. Her apprehensions, however, were soon
                    allayed. In less than a month the queen died; but her hopes of sharing the
                    throne with Richard were not realized. The match was so very unpopular that the
                    royal wooer was dissuaded from his purpose, and his attention was soon directed
                    to another quarter.</p>
                <p>The crimes of Richard had alienated the greater portion of the York party from
                    his interests; and a union between Elizabeth and Henry, for the purpose of
                    reconciling conflicting factions, became a topic of serious consideration. The
                    latter prince again conceived the hopes of seizing the crown by another invasion
                    of England; and having collected an army of three thousand men, he set sail from
                    Harfleur early in August 1485, and landed at Milford Haven on the 6th of that
                    month. Richard affected to hear the intelligence with joy; and display ing the
                    vigilance and activity of his brother Edward, he marched from London on the
                    16th. His competitor had directed his march through the northern districts of
                    Wales, a tract of country in the interest of the Stanleys. Both armies met at
                    Bosworth in Leicestershire, on the 22d of August 1485, where a battle was
                    fought, memorable for having restored tranquillity to the kingdom, which had so
                    long been the theatre of sanguinary civil wars.</p>
                <p>The army of Richmond amounted to about six thousand men, that of the king to
                    nearly twice the number; and both prepared for the contest, equally confident of
                    victory. For, notwithstanding the inferiority of Richmond’s troops, he was
                    secretly encouraged by the promises of Lord Stanley, who was hastening, with
                    seven thousand men under his command, apparently to join the royalists, but
                    really with the intention of siding with Henry. Stanley continued his march
                    slowly; and on the morning of the battle he took up a neutral station on the
                    wing of either host. The king entrusted his vanguard to the Duke of Norfolk,
                    whilst that of Henry was assigned to the Earl of Oxford; and the two competitors
                    for the crown placed themselves at the head of the main bodies of their
                    respective armies. Richard, taking advantage of a marsh which covered his right
                    flank, ordered a shower of arrows to be discharged into the adverse ranks, which
                    for a moment threw them into confusion. He sent orders to Stanley to join him
                    immediately; but the refusal of that nobleman to comply with his request shook
                    his confidence and also that of his army, which now began to waver. To complete
                    his dismay, he saw Stanley join the ranks of Henry, a circumstance which
                    determined the fortune of the day. But, in order to retrieve it, Richard made a
                    vigorous effort worthy of a better cause. Chancing to observe Henry in the midst
                    of the conflict, he made a dash at him, determined to cut him down or perish in
                    the attempt. He slew with his own hand Sir William Brandon, the bearer of the
                    hostile standard, unhorsed Sir John Cheney, and was within a blow of his rival,
                    when he was overpowered by numbers, struck to the ground, and immediately slain.
                    After his fall resistance was hopeless, and his army broke up and dispersed. The
                    crown which he wore on that day was taken up by Lord Stanley and placed on
                    Henry’s head, who was instantly greeted with shouts of “Long live King Henry.”
                    Of Richard’s army a considerable number were killed in the battle and pursuit,
                    and amongst these wete the Duke of Norfolk, and Lords Ferrers, Radcliff, and
                    Brackenbury. The victors lost but few, and none of any note except their
                    standard-bearer. To enhance their triumph, Lord Strange, the son of Stanley,
                    whom Richard had ordered for execution before or during the conflict, escaped in
                    the confusion and rejoined his father. The body of the tyrant was thrown
                    carelessly across a horse and conducted to Leicester, where it was interred with
                    small ceremony.</p>
                <p>Of Richard’s character little remains to be said. The crimes of which he was
                    undoubtedly guilty almost remove him from the ranks of mankind, and class him
                    with the most ferocious animals. The arguments which have been brought forward
                    in modern times to prove his innocence are inconclusive, and scarcely to be
                    named, when confronted with the mass of evidence which may be arrayed against
                    him. His fall excited no regret, éxcept amongst a few of his partizans, the
                    slaves of his despotic will. How could it? The death of his unoffending nephews
                    must have still been fresh in the memory of his subjects.</p>
                <p>The quarrel between the houses of York and Lancaster was now brought to a
                    conclusion. In order to secure the blessings of peace and an undisputed
                    succession, it was necessary for Henry at once to espouse Elizabeth, and, by so
                    doing, to blend the white and the red roses together. There is no concealing the
                    fact that his title to the crown was of a very amb guous description. It rested
                    on three grounds, first, his marriage with Elizabeth; secondly, his descent from
                    the house otLancaŝter; and thirdly, the right of conquest. According to the
                    sagacious Bacon, “he rested on the title of Lancaster in the main, using the
                    marriage and the victory as supporters.” But this main support was not a valid
                    one; for even allowing his descent from John of Gaunt to have been legitimate,
                    he was not the nearest descendant of that prince’s children. There were several
                    who had claims superior to his; but the individual whom Henry looked upon with
                    peculiar jealousy was Edward Plantagenet, son of the late Duke of Clarence.
                    After the death of this prince’s father, Richard sent for him to court, and
                    created him Earl of Warwick, the title borne by his grandfather; but fearing
                    that he might afterwards become a dangerous competitor, Richard had him conveyed
                    to a distant fortress; and one of the first acts of Henry was to change his
                    place of confinement, and put him in the Tower, as a prison of greater security.
                    Elizabeth, who had been his fellow-captive, was ordered to be conducted to the
                    house of her mother in London, whilst Henry himself leisurely followed her to
                    the capital. He was received there with every demonstration of joy, and greeted
                    by the inhabitants as the deliverer of his country. His coronation was delayed
                    for a time, by the breaking out of a dreadful disease, called from its
                    predominant symptom the sweating sickness. But at the end of a month its
                    virulence began to abate, and Henry was crowned on the 30th of October 1485. To
                    heighten the splendour of the ceremony, he bestowed the rank of knights-banneret
                    on twelve persons, and conferred peerages on three. Jasper earl of Pembroke, his
                    uncle, he created Duke of Bedford; Thomas, Lord Stanley, his father-in-law, Earl
                    of Derby; and Edward Courtenay, Earl of Devonshire. At the coronation likewise
                    appeared a new institution, which the king had established for personal security
                    as well as pomp; a band of fifty archers, who were denominated yeomen of the
                    guard. But lest the people should take umbrage at this step, as if it implied a
                    diffidence in their loyalty, he declared the institution to be perpetual. The
                    ceremony of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332781" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2781-0740"
                    />coronation was performed by Cardinal Bourchier, archbishop of Canterbury. On
                    the I8th of January 1486, Henry was united to the Princess Elizabeth; and his
                    marriage was celebrated at London with even a greater appearance of joy than
                    either his first entry or his coronation.</p>
                <p>The reign of Henry VII. was for several years disturbed by plots and
                    insurrections. The people, by a long course of civil war, had become so
                    turbulent and factious, that no governor could rule, nor was any king likely to
                    please them. The violent animosity expressed by this monarch, however, against
                    the house of York, may justly be considered as one of the causes of the extreme
                    proneness to rebellion which was manifested amongst his subjects. Instead of
                    endeavouring to conciliate the affection of the opposite party, he invariably
                    strove to quell them by force and violence. For this purpose, soon after his
                    accession he took a journey to the north of England, where the Yorkists were
                    very numerous, trusting that his presence might overawe them. On his way thither
                    he received intelligence of an insurrection against him, headed by Viscount
                    Lovel, with Sir Henry Stafford and his brother Thomas. The two latter had raised
                    an army, and were marching to besiege the city of Worcester; whilst Lovel was
                    hastening to their assistance with a body of several thousand men. But they were
                    induced to disperse by the offer of a general pardon. Lovel withdrew from bis
                    troops, who immediately gave in their submission to the king. The Staffords took
                    refuge in the church of Colnham, near Abingdon; but they were dragged from this
                    sanctuary, as it was found not to possess the privilege of sheltering rebels.
                    The elder brother was executed at Tyburn, but the younger one received a
                    pardon.</p>
                <p>Henry returned from his northern tour, and soon afterwards his queen presented
                    him with a son, whom he named Arthur, in honour of the supposed progenitor of
                    the house of Tudor, the renowned King Arthur; but Henry was not permitted to
                    enjoy undisturbed security. He never was at any time popular except amongst his
                    own party; and in the northern counties, particularly, the late King Richard was
                    remembered and spoken of with regret. Henry was hated for his success, and even
                    charged with having put to death the young Earl of Warwick, whom he had
                    imprisoned, as has already been mentioned. It was necessary for the king to
                    exercise extreme caution, on account of the dangers which surrounded him; and
                    hence he is described as having been mysterious and impenetrable. Sir Thomas
                    More remarks that one thing was frequently pretended whilst another was meant;
                    and Bacon says that the king had a fashion rather to create doubts than
                    assurance. The birth of his son seems to have roused his enemies to make some
                    exertions against him; and being destitute of any chief of sufficient ability
                    round whom insurgents might rally with any hope of success, they were urged to
                    make one of the most extraordinary attempts recorded in history. One Richard
                    Simons, a subtle priest of Oxford, took under his charge Lambert Symnel, the son
                    of a tradesman belonging to the same town. The boy was about eleven years of
                    age, comely, and not withoufdignity and grace in his person. With this
                    individual, who was well tutored to perform the extraordinary part which was to
                    be assigned him, the churchman landed in Ireland, and presented him to the
                    lord-deputy of the county as Edward Plantagenet, earl of Warwick, who had made
                    his escape from the Tower. It seems to have been at first the design of the
                    fabricators of this singular deception to have presented him to the public as
                    the younger of the princes who had been put to death by Richard in the Tower. In
                    order to further this scheme, a report was circulated that one of these princes
                    had made his escape from his assassins. Why tills plan should have been changed,
                    and the youthful impostor seduced to personate an individual still living, it is
                    difficult to conjecture; but such is the fact. The Earl of Kildare, to whom he
                    was presented in Ireland, swallowed the bait, and allowed the claims of Symnel
                    without discussion. This nobleman was a zealous adherent of the house of York;
                    and the little colony called the English Pale, long ruled by that party,
                    retained all its ancient attachments. A belief in the identity of Symnel with
                    the Earl of Warwick became universal, both amongst the nobility and the people.
                    He was lodged in the castle of Dublin; the inhabitants universally took an oath
                    of allegiance to him, as the true descendant of the Plantagenets; he was crowned
                    with a diadem taken from the statue of the blessed virgin, and proclaimed king
                    by the title of Edward VI.</p>
                <p>Such an unexpected event so alarmed Henry that he would have gone over to Ireland
                    in person to quell the rebellion, had he not dreaded the machinations of the
                    queen dowager in his absence. To prevent any thing of this kind from occurring,
                    it was resolved to confine her for life in a monastery, under pretence, however,
                    that it was done on account of her having formerly delivered up the princess her
                    daughter to King Richard. The royal dame murmured at the severity of her
                    sentence; but the king persisted in his resolution, and she remained in
                    confinement till her death, which did not take place till some years
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>The next measure was to exhibit the person of Warwick to the people. That prince
                    was accordingly taken from the Tower, and conducted through the principal
                    streets of London; after which the procession moved to St Paul’s, where great
                    numbers were assembled to see him. Still, however, the fictitious Warwick
                    prospered in Ireland, and being furnished by the Duchess of Burgundy with a body
                    of two thousand veteran Germans, under the command of Martin Swart, a brave and
                    experienced officer, the invasion of England was determined upon. He landed in
                    Lancashire, whence he marched towards York, expecting that the country people
                    would rally round his standard during his march. But in this he was
                    disappointed; the people were unwilling to join a body of foreigners, and were
                    besides kept in awe by the reputation of Henry. Lord Lincoln, therefore, who
                    commanded the rebel army, determined to bring the matter to a speedy issue.
                    Accordingly he met the royalists at Stoke, in the county of Nottingham, and an
                    obstinate engagement took place, which terminated in Henry obtaining a complete
                    victory. Lord Lincoln, with four thousand soldiers, perished in the action; and
                    Symnel with his tutor Simons were taken prisoners. Simons being a priest, could
                    not be tried by the civil power, and was only committed to close confinement.
                    Symnel was pardoned, and made a scullion in the king’s kitchen, whence he was
                    afterwards advanced to the rank of falconer, in which capacity he died. Thus
                    ended this most absurdly planned and injudiciously executed revolt; but it was
                    not destitute of good results. It taught the king that the house of York was not
                    to be trampled upon with impunity; for to such an extent had his antipathy to
                    the branches of that family and its adherents been carried, that it was said his
                    own queen was not exempt from the common odium which was thrown upon them. It
                    was asked by the people, why was she, the rightful heir to the throne, not
                    crowned, and invested with the usual insignia of royalty? Henry silenced these
                    rumours by ordering her coronation; and from that period she shared with him the
                    usual honours of royalty. .</p>
                <p>Having thus to a great extent established his authority at home, he thought of
                    diverting the minds of his subjects from domestic insurrection to foreign
                    enterprise. He <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332794" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2794-0741"
                    />does not appear, however, to have had any intention of prosecuting a serious
                    war in a distant country, but he used the pretext as a means of aggrandising
                    himself. A parliament was summoned, which granted the king a considerable sum
                    for prosecuting the war in Bretagne, the only great fief of the French crown
                    which still retained its own prince and its ancient constitution; by force, by
                    policy, or by good fortune, the French monarchs had obtained possession of all
                    the others. But of the supply granted by parliament, only a small part could be
                    raised. The northern counties not only refused payment of their proportion, but
                    rose in revolt, and murdered the Earl of Northumberland, the king’s lieutenant.
                    The insurrection, however, was quickly suppressed by the Earl of Surrey. John a
                    Chambre, one of the ringleaders, suffered at York; and Sir John Egremont, the
                    other, escaped to the Duchess of Burgundy, where he had leisure to hatch new
                    schemes of rebellion. The money which Henry by this means obtained, and also in
                    consequence of another grant from parliament, was quietly deposited in his
                    coffers. For although he collected a considerable army, with which he proceeded
                    to Calais, the king had other objects than victory and conquest in view. Some
                    months previously to his landing on the Continent, he had commissioned the
                    governor of Calais to negotiate á peace and alliance with Charles of France,
                    which was formally concluded. To the French monarch the possession of Bretagne
                    was an important object; and Henry, naturally avaricious, agreed to accept about
                    L.200,000 as a reimbursement for the expenses of the expedition. It was also
                    stipulated that the king of France should pay to him and· his heirs an annual
                    pension of 25,000 crowns.</p>
                <p>But Henry’s hopes of a tranquil possession of the crown of England were doomed to
                    perpetual disappointment. His reign was now to be disturbed by one of the most
                    mysterious personages to be met with in English history. About the time when war
                    was declared against France, a pretender to the regal dignity appeared in
                    Ireland, which seems to have been the natural soil for these spurious shoots of
                    royalty. This impostor passed under the name of Perkin Warbeck, but asserted
                    himself to be Richard duke of York, the second son of Edward IV. who, it was
                    alleged, had escaped from the Tower when his brother was murdered. Previously to
                    his appearance in Ireland, he had been heard of at the court of Margaret, his
                    supposed aunt, who interested herself to the utmost in his favour, and fondly
                    styled him the White Rose of England. But he was compelled to quit Burgundy; for
                    Henry had dispatched some ambassadors to the sovereign of that country, with
                    secret instructions to demand either the person of the impostor, or his
                    expulsion from the territories of the duke. Warbeck was received with open arms
                    in Ireland, for the Irish were fanatically attached to the house of York.
                    Several noblemen who had credulously believed in the fraud of Symnel, from which
                    they had just escaped, gave countenance to his pretensions. A deputation was
                    sent to Flanders to ascertain his history; but they had been corrupted by Henry
                    before their landing in Burgundy, and they returned fraught with charges of
                    treason against the disaffected nobility. Some of the most eminent malcontent
                    Yorkists were put to death, and amongst the rest Sir William Stanley,
                    lord-chamberlain, to whom the king had owed his life on Bosworth field. His fate
                    was most mysterious, and the conduct of Henry upon this occasion is open to the
                    most odious suspicions. Sir Robert Clifford, the individual whose information
                    led to these executions, was a confidential Yorkist; and his behaviour towards
                    his own party, so different from what might have been expected, tended to
                    dissolve the ties which subsisted between it and the malcontent exiles.</p>
                <p>Three years had now elapsed since the pretender had set forth his claim, and
                    during that period he had never attempted to establish it by legal proof. He
                    began to feel that he stood upon delicate ground, and resolved at once to
                    enforce his pretended right by an appeal to the sword. With a small force
                    collected in Flanders (for he had been for some time absent from Ireland) he
                    made a descent in the neighbourhood of Deal; but the adventurers were attacked
                    by the inhabitants, and all of them driven back to their vessels, or taken
                    prisoners. Warbeck himself made his escape, and returned in despair to Flanders.
                    From this country he was ejected at the instigation of Henry; and after vainly
                    attempting to gain a footing in Ireland, he set sail for Scotland, where he was
                    well received by the young king, who professed a conviction in the justice of
                    his title. King James conferred upon him the hand of Lady Catherine Gordon, a
                    near kinswoman of his own. The adventurer’s fortunes being thus suddenly
                    elevated, he, along with the king of Scotland, advanced into England; but not a
                    native sword was unsheathed in favour of the White Rose. The enthusiasm which
                    had been excited amongst the Scots by his first appearance in their country had
                    begun to decline, and during a long truce, which served all the purposes of a
                    treaty of peace between James and Henry, it was agreed to by the former that he
                    should induce Warbeck to quit Scotland. The adventurer, with a few adherents,
                    accordingly departed, and, after touching once more at Cork, and in vain
                    soliciting the aid of Earl Desmond, steered for Cornwall, where he landed on the
                    7th of September 1497.</p>
                <p>His arrival in this part of the country was a politic step, for an attempt to
                    raise a tax there some time before gave rise to an insurrection, which, although
                    quelled, left behind heartburnings and discontent. A considerable body of
                    Cornish men joined his standard, and before he reached Exeter his army amounted
                    to six thousand men. But the king arrived, and preparations were made for a
                    battle; the heart of the pretender, however, failed him at the sight of the
                    royal standard, and instead of risking an engagement for the crown, he withdrew
                    during the night, and entered his name in the sanctuary of Beaulieu in
                    Hampshire. His followers laid down their arms to the king, and his wife also
                    submitted to his authority, and was placed near the person of the queen. From
                    his sanctuary the fugitive was removed by the king to London, where he was
                    ordered to keep within the precincts of the palace. He contrived, however, to
                    make his escape, but, despairing of getting out of the country, surrendered
                    himself to the prior of the monastery of Shene. The monk contrived to prevail
                    with the king to spare his life; but he was condemned to stand in the stocks and
                    make a public confession of his imposture, after which he was committed to the
                    Tower. In this fortress he met with a singular companion, the real Earl of
                    Warwick, who had now been a prisoner for the period of fourteen years. His life
                    had thus been passed in cheerless captivity, for no other offence than that of
                    being the sole survivor of the male descendants of Edward III. The two contrived
                    a means of escape, but they were discovered. Warbeck was executed at Tyburn; and
                    the son of Clarence having been arraigned for high treason, was condemned to
                    death and beheaded on the 28th of November 1499. This deed was worthy of Richard
                    III. It was a cool-blooded murder, aggravated by circumstances; for the harmless
                    and joyless victim was, from his long confinement, reduced to a state of idiocy.
                    The human soul shudders to think of such atrocities, perpetrated in defiance
                    alike of justice and humanity. From the guilt of shedding innocent blood it is
                    impossible to purify the name of Henry VII.</p>
                <p>In 1501, the king’s eldest son Arthur was married to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332807" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2807-0742"/>the Infanta Catherine of
                    Spain; but he survived the marriage only a few months, having died on the 2d of
                    April following. It was agreed upon a short while afterwards, by the parents of
                    the parties, that the widow of the late prince should be espoused by Henry’s
                    next son, now Prince of Wales, and afterwards Henry VIII. The union was
                    sanctioned by the pope, who granted a bull, dispensing with any impediment which
                    their affinity might otherwise cause. The eldest daughter of King Henry was
                    conferred upon James IV. of Scotland; an important union,* as from this stock
                    sprung all the sovereigns who have since reigned in Great Britain. King Henry,
                    in his own time, was called the Solomon of England; and, without allowing him to
                    possess undisputed claims to so high-sounding a title, the saying recorded of
                    him regarding the Scottish marriage displays no common foresight and sagacity.
                    When some of his counsellors objected to it, on the ground that the kingdom
                    might thereby fall to the king of Scotland, he answered, “Scotland would then
                    become an accession to England, not England to Scotland; the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> greater would draw the less; it is a safer union for
                    England than one with France.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Bacon, iii. 409.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the latter part of this king’s reign, his economy, which had always been very
                    exact, degenerated into avarice, and his oppressions at last became severe. In
                    Empson and Dudley he possessed two ministers, who did all that inventive minds
                    could suggest, and hearts of stone perform, to gratify a rapacity, which fed
                    with equal appetite on friend and foe. We are informed by one of the wisest of
                    historians and of men, that these individuals had no reputation, otherwise than
                    by servilely following his bent, and that they “shaped his way to those
                    extremities fo: which himself was touched with remorse at his death.”<note

                    The hoard which the king had amassed by their unjust extortions, and which was
                    mostly kept in “secret places at Richmond,” is said to have amounted to nearly
                    L.16,000,000 of our present money. This amount of specie is so enormous as to
                    warrant a conviction that it has been greatly exaggerated. It may be doubted
                    whether the whole circulating medium of the country at that period amounted to
                    the sum which the avaricious monarch is said to have accumulated.</p>
                <p>Henry, who had enjoyed an uncommon share of health during his life, was at
                    fifty-two years of age attacked by severe indisposition. He died on the 21st of
                    April 1509, in the twenty-fourth year of his reign, which, although perpetually
                    disturbed by domestic insurrections, was upon the whole prosperous. He was
                    interred in the chapel at Westminster, which still bears his name; one of the
                    noblest trophies of architectural genius produced in any age, and which confers
                    peculiar distinction upon that in which it was erected. There are many acts of
                    Henry’s administration, and some of these have already been particularised,
                    which cannot be related but to his discredit. He was mean, sordid, and unamiable
                    in his nature. No tenderness softened his rigid nature, if we except that which
                    he evinced towards his mother; a virtue, however, too common to be praised even
                    in a king. We see no qualities about the man which inspires us with regard for
                    him; but there are many virtues to admire in the ruler. He favoured every
                    national improvement; and, though penurious to excess in ordinary or essentially
                    private matters, he was munificent in public works. He greatly improved the laws
                    of the realm. V ιth respect to these, Lord Bacon remarks, with his usual
                    clearness and sagacity, “his laws are deep, not vulgar; not made upon the spur
                    of a particular occasion, for the present, but acts of prudence for the future,
                    to make the estate of his people still more happy, after the manner of the
                    legislators in ancient and heroical times.” He manifested great regard for
                    trade, as is evinced by his excellent laws for promoting it, and by the extended
                    commercial intercourse of the country. He accepted the offer of Columbus to make
                    that most memorable of voyages, in which he lifted the veil that covered a grand
                    division of the globe, and would have patronized it if he had not been
                    forestalled by Isabella. He gave his sanction to Cabot’s celebrated voyage (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cabot),</hi> and fitted out a ship to join the expedition.
                    In fine, the country improved under his government, and became steadily attached
                    to his family.</p>
                <p>Henry VIII. son of the preceding monarch, ascended the throne on the 22d of April
                    1509, being then in the eighteenth year of ħis age. He assumed the reins of
                    government under most auspicious circumstances. His title was undisputed; his
                    treasury was well stocked; commerce was in a flourishing condition; and the
                    kingdom, which now may be supposed to have looked to the youthful monarch with
                    hope and indulgence, was at peace with every foreign power, and quiet in itself.
                    He was prepossessing in person, accomplished in mind, and adroit in every
                    martial and fashionable exercise. But these advantages belonged to an individual
                    whose heart was usurped by debasing passions, and whose mind was cast in the
                    true mould of despotism.</p>
                <p>On the 6th of June 1509, Henry and Catherine were finally united in wedlock, and
                    on the 24th of the same month they were crowned with great splendour. One of
                    Henry’s first acts was to bring Empson and Dudley, the obnoxious ministers of
                    his father, to trial. As a capital accusation could not be brought against them
                    for merely executing the will of the late king, it was found necessary to indite
                    them for a conspiracy to seize upon London with an armed force during the last
                    illness of Henry. Of this charge, absurd and incredible as it appears to be,
                    these individuals were convicted; and though it seems probable that the king
                    would have been satisfied with imprisonment for life, yet so clamorous were the
                    people for the blood of the culprits, that he was compelled to sign a warrant
                    for their execution, which took place on Tower Hill.</p>
                <p>In 1511, Henry entered into a league with Pope Julius IL, Ferdinand king of
                    Spain, and other continental powers, against Louis XII. of France. In this
                    alliance the king of England was not a deeply interested individual; but his
                    vanity was flattered with the idea of receiving the title of Most Christian
                    Majesty, which was promised to him by the pope. The object which the
                    confederates had in view was to wrest from Louis some valuable provinces which
                    he had obtained in Italy; and although Henry had no hope of sharing the spoil
                    with them in this quarter, yet the occupation of the French monarch in schemes
                    of aggrandisement beyond the Alps afforded an opportunity to the English of
                    invading France, and reviving the old chimera of conquering that country. The
                    point, whether England should aim at continental dominions, was debated in
                    parliament; and the arguments against it greatly preponderated. But the vanity
                    of Henry was too much flattered to relinquish the scheme. He sent an ambassador
                    to demand of Louis the ancient patrimony of the English crown in France, and
                    this being refused, war was denounced. Parliament granted a supply, and an army
                    was equipped and sent into Spain. But this expedition was attended with no
                    success, and the troops, dispirited and mutinous, returned to England towards
                    the close of 1512. On the north-western frontier of France, however, the arms of
                    Henry were triumphant, and also in Scotland, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332820"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2820-0743"/>which had been tempted by French councils to
                    invade England. James IV. with a considerable army under his command, was met by
                    the Earl of Surrey at Flodden, where a bloody battle was fought, in which the
                    Scots were totally routed, and their king, with the greater portion of his
                    nobility, perished. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Scotland.)</hi> Henry received the
                    news of this victory at Tournay, which he had invested, after having demolished
                    Terouanne. The latter city opened its gates to him in eight days; but all
                    parties being now disposed for peace, a general treaty was eon-eluded in August
                    1514.</p>
                <p>With regard to the administration of government in England, when Henry mounted
                    the throne, the leading ministers in the cabinet were, Howard, earl of Surrey,
                    lord treasurer; and Fox, bishop of Winchester, lord privy seal. Amongst the
                    inferior dependents of the court there now appeared an individual, whose
                    ambition and talent enabled him speedily to supplant every competitor. This was
                    Thomas, afterwards Cardinal Wolsey, who, although only the son of a burgess of
                    Ipswich, gradually raised himself to the first offices of state. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Wolsey.)</hi> His preferment had been rapid beyond all
                    precedent, and this was not likely to be forgiven by an envious world. From the
                    year 1513 to 1515, he had passed through the various gradations, from being
                    bishop of Tournay, to the honours of the eardinalate, and he succeeded
                    Archbishop Worham in the office of chancellor. With respect to the manner in
                    which he executed his duty as a high public functionary, Sir James Mackintosh
                    remarks, that “his administration of justice as chancellor has been celebrated
                    by those who forget how simple the functions of that office then were; and his
                    rigid enforcement of criminal justice appears only to have been a part of that
                    harsh but perhaps needful process by which the Tudor princes rather extirpated
                    than punished criminals, in order to reelaim the people from the long license of
                    civil wars. As he was chiefly occupied in enriching and aggrandizing himself, or
                    in displaying his power and wealth, objects which are to be promoted either by
                    foreign connections, or by favour at court, it is impossible to determine what
                    share of the merit or demerit of internal legislation ought to be allotted to
                    him. His part in the death of the Duke of Buckingham was his most conspicuous
                    crime; yet, after all, it is probable that he was no worse than his contemporary
                    statesmen. The circumstance most favourable to him is the attachment of
                    dependents.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>History of
                    England, vol. ii. p. 121.</p></note></p>
                <p>On the death of Maximilian, which happened towards the end of the year 1519,
                    Henry, along with the kings of France and Spain, became a candidate for the
                    imperial throne. The Spanish monarch was the successful competitor, and, to
                    soothe the wounded pride of Henry, he paid him a visit of ceremony at Dover. His
                    principal design in this was to persuade Henry to abandon a projected meeting
                    which was to take place between him and the king of France, the wily emperor
                    dreading that such an interview might be fraught with danger to himself. He was
                    unsuccessful, however, and the two monarchs met between Ardres and Guines in
                    1520. The place where this meeting was held has been long celebrated under the
                    name of the Field of the Cloth of Gold. The pomp and parade, the tournaments and
                    other sports of the age, exhibited upon the occasion, were on the grandest
                    scale, and peculiarly calculated to delight the young king of England, a
                    creature of impulse, and one who sacrificed policy to temper, and interest to
                    passion. It was thus that the continental monarchs flattered his foibles, and
                    ingratiated themselves into bis favour.</p>
                <p>About the same time a crime was perpetrated, in the guilt of which both Henry and
                    his minister Wolsey have been implicated; we mean the execution of Edward
                    Stafford, duke of Buckingham. This nobleman was descended from the youngest son
                    of Edward III.; and the principal accusation brought against him was, that he
                    had tampered with a priest who laid claim to the gift of prophecy, and who had
                    foretold that he would yet ascend the throne in virtue of his descent. Several
                    other charges equally absurd, and not amounting to an overt act of high treason,
                    were brought against him; he was tried by a jury of peers, condemned to death,
                    and beheaded on the 17th of May 1521. Upon this occasion the populace vented
                    their indignation against Wolsey, whose subtle policy had brought the sufferer
                    to the scaffold, by loud cries of “the butcher’s son.”</p>
                <p>Wolsey, however, continued to rule with unabated sway from 1521 till 1527. This
                    period is not distinguished by any events of importance, if we except the
                    opposition which the House of Commons offered to the minister in his attempts to
                    raise supplies. That body obstinately disputed these grants, and attempts were
                    made to raise money by the expedients of forced loans and pretended
                    benevolences, which the legislature had already condemned. But these attempts
                    produced a small supply and a great deal of discontent. Wolsey, notwithstanding
                    his unwearied exertions in behalf of his master, never felt himself perfectly
                    secure in his elevated situation. The capricious and tyrannical temper of Henry
                    forbade his ministers to be at ease in any place of trust near his person. The
                    fall of Wolsey seems always to have appeared to himself as an event of very
                    likely occurrence, and these gloomy forebodings were at last realized. The cause
                    of the rupture between the king and him was the divorce of Queen Catherine,
                    which the former had begun to project. But the fall of Wolsey was not the only
                    event connected with Henry’s divorce; it ultimately led to one of the most
                    memorable transactions in the history of England, namely, the separation of that
                    country from the communion of the church of Rome.</p>
                <p>The doctrines of the reformation, propagated by Luther in 1517, had gained
                    considerable ground in England, and many professed a belief in them,
                    notwithstanding the severe persecution which had been carried on against
                    heretics during some of the preceding reigns. The papal authority, though still
                    very great, had in the space of ten years declined considerably; but a detail of
                    the circumstances connected with this subject is not required in this place. It
                    may be noticed in general, that the reformation in England was facilitated by
                    the undeniable corruption of the clergy, and the experience which many
                    individuals had of, and the partiality which they entertained for, the doctrines
                    of Wickliff. The seed sown by that divine had never been destroyed; and if it
                    did not show itself above ground, it was extending itself underneath,
                    perpetuating a sort of dormant existence, and ready to spring up on the first
                    propitious occasion. Besides, the marriage of King Henry was looked upon by many
                    as in itself illegal, and only sanctified by a dispensation from the pope.</p>
                <p>Whether Henry himself, during the early years of his reign, felt any scruples
                    about the validity of his marriage, may reasonably be doubted; for no trace of
                    any thing of the kind can be discovered in his public conduct till the year
                    1527. The queen was some years older than himself, and was now past the meridian
                    of life. Her personal charms had decayed, and the heart of the royal sensualist
                    could not be attracted by beauty that belonged purely <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332833" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2833-0744"/>to the mind. She had born him
                    several children, all of whom died in infancy except the Princess Mary, who
                    survived both her parents, and afterwards ascended the throne. It is reported of
                    the inconstant monarch, that he attributed the mortality in his family to the
                    curse of heaven, which blighted his unnatural alliance with Catherinc, his
                    brother’s widow. But there was another and more powerful circumstance which led
                    him to contemplate a divorce from his queen; this was the love which he had
                    contracted for Anne Boleyn. The charms of this lady had touched his fiery but
                    not unsusceptible heart; and as his passion could not be gratified except by
                    means of an alliance sanctioned by law, he set seriously to work for the purpose
                    of removing the amiable partner of his throne and bed, and placing the youthful
                    beauty in her stead. The secret intentions of the king having become to some
                    extent public, he ventured to ask the opinions of the most eminent ecclesiastics
                    upon the point. The dangers of a disputed succession, if the king should die
                    without male issue, were brought forward as an urgent plea for taking the step
                    which he had in view. He had also recourse to his theological lore, and certain
                    religious scruples connected with his first marriage helped to give a colour of
                    principle to his real desires, and at the same time to impart to them life and
                    warmth. Some of the divines whose counsel was asked declared that no
                    dispensation could authorize a marriage with the widow of a brother; which they
                    proved from a passage in the Pentateuch. Others, who also founded their
                    arguments upon a portion of Scripture, contended that the prohibition referred
                    to by the opposite party was not universal, and might be dispensed with in
                    the*king’s case, where the first marriage had been unproductive of issue.
                    Cardinal Wolsey, who had a hazardous game to play, coincided with the former,
                    and gave Henry hopes that his petition to the court of Rome would be successful.
                    But Anne was not the individual whom the prelate had in his eye as a wife for
                    the king. He was desirous of wedding his master to a French princess, and, we
                    are informed, threw himself on his knees before Henry, and entreated him to
                    desist from a project so unworthy of his birth as an alliance with the Boleyn
                    family. But the 'pliant mind of the cardinal yielded to the impetuositv of his
                    master and to the force of circumstances; and he found it necessary to atone for
                    his indiscreet zeal by displaying redoubled activity to promote the marriage
                    with the lady upon whom the king had fixed his affections. The illustrious Sir
                    Thomas More declined to support the divorce, and Fisher bishop of Rochester
                    acted with the same integrity.</p>
                <p>A deputation was sent to Rome by Henry for the purpose of sounding Pope Clement
                    upon the subject of the divorce. The pontiff was in a situation unfavourable to
                    the success of the application; and although he was bound to the English monarch
                    by the ties of gratitude, he declined giving an immediate assent to the
                    proposition, but appointed two legates to hear and determine the validity of the
                    first marriage of Henry. He also gave a solemn promise not to recall the
                    commission, nor to do any act which should annul the judgment or prevent the
                    progress of the trial. The pontiff was at this period engaged in a contest with
                    the imperialists; but he at last concluded a treaty of alliance with the
                    emperor, who appeared the only potentate capable of shielding him from his other
                    enemies. The forensic disputes respecting the divorce still remained unsettled,
                    and, from the date above mentioned, Clement took his final part against the
                    degradation of the queen of England, who was an Austrian princess. But still, by
                    ingenious delays and plausible formalities, he contrived to amuse Henry, whose
                    power it was not his interest to treat with direct contempt. The patience of the
                    English monarch, however, was now completely worn out by these fruitless
                    attempts at negotiation, and he redoubled his entreaties to the pope to comply
                    with his demands. Clement, in order to show a willingness to acquiesce in the
                    wishes of Henry, sent over Cardinal Campeggio, who, either separately or in
                    conjunction with Wolsey, was empowered to hear and determine the matrimonial
                    suit. The legate at first attempted to dissuade Henry from pursuing the divorce;
                    but being unsuccessful with the monarch, he next tried to persuade Catherine to
                    embrace a religious life, in which he also failed. The popular feeling was
                    against Henry, and he felt himself compelled to remove Anne Boleyn from court,
                    where she had for some time resided. At a great council which he convoked, he
                    declared that in prosecuting this matter he was solely actuated by a desire to
                    know whether or not his only remaining child Mary was the rightful heir of the
                    crown. On this occasion he made an appeal to the feelings and consciences of his
                    hearers which affected them much; and the perplexities consequent upon the late
                    proceedings afforded Campeggio an opportunity for putting off the decision of
                    the question until he had obtained further instructions from Rome. Meanwhile
                    Clement was seized with a dangerous illness, which retarded his answer, and is
                    said to have revived in the ambitious mind of Wolsey a hope which he had before
                    indulged in, of obtaining possession of the tiara. This occurred in the spring
                    of 1529; and although the pope recovered from his sickness, his degate contrived
                    from time to time to postpone the trial. On the 3lst of May, however, the court
                    of parliament met, and summoned the king and queen to meet on the 18th of June.
                    The latter obeyed, but protested against the judges, and appealed to the pope.
                    At the next session, on the refusal of the cardinals to admit the appeal, she
                    rose, and in a calm and dignified manner threw herself at Henry’s feet,
                    imploring him in a truly eloquent address to desist from his intended purpose of
                    repudiating her. It made a profound impression upon the audience, and even
                    touched the cold heart of her husband. The legates carefully prolonged the trial
                    until July, when a vacation from July to October took place, during which time
                    all courts were bound to suspend their sittings; and, notwithstanding the
                    importunities of the king, Campeggio contrived to get the suit removed to Rome.
                    Agreeably to the instructions of Clement, Campeggio quitted England, and the
                    pope summoned Henry to appear before him in forty days.</p>
                <p>In these transactions Wolsey took no inconsiderable share, and the compliant
                    manner in which he gave his consent to the suggestions of Campeggio excited the
                    suspicions of the king, that his minister was playing a double game with him.
                    The symptoms of approaching disgrace now became too palpable to escape the
                    notice of the cardinal; for all parties joined either openly or privately to
                    destroy him who had so long enjoyed the favour of the king. It was a singular
                    coincidence that the friends both of Queen Catherine and Anne Boleyn were
                    employed as instruments of his overthrow. On the 9th of October 1529 a
                    prosecution was commenced against him for procuring bulls from Rome without the
                    king’s license. On the 17th of the same month the great seal was taken from him
                    and given to Sir Thomas More. On the 1st of December the lords presented an
                    address to the king, in which were embodied various articles of accusation
                    against the cardinal; and notwithstanding that the more serious parts of the
                    charge were refuted by his servant Thomas Cromwell, the court at last pronounced
                    him to be beyond the protection of the law, and “that his lands, goods, and
                    chattels were forfeited, and that his person was at the mercy of the king.”
                    Wolsey had confessed his offence against the statute of <hi rend="italic"
                    >praemunire, of</hi> which he was technically guilty, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332846" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2846-0745"/>inasmuch as he had received
                    the bulls without a formal license. It is scarcely necessary to observe that the
                    sentence pronounced was most unjust; for the bulls had been obtained with the
                    consent and for the service of his ungrateful master, under whose eye they had
                    been executed for years without a word being uttered as to the manner in which
                    they had been obtained. But nothing could now save the cardinal. He was at once
                    hurled from his place of pride and power, and fell, with his vast possessions, a
                    helpless victim, into the hands of the king. But it would appear that, from
                    habit perhaps, Henry still cherished a feeling of partiality for his old
                    favourite, and sent him from time to time tokens of his esteem and regard. In
                    February 1530 Wolsey was actually pardoned, and restored to his see of
                    Winchester, and to some other emoluments. Even the great diocese of York was
                    shortly afterwards restored; but at the moment when he was making magnificent
                    preparations for his installation on the archiepiscopal throne, he was arrested
                    at Cawood on a charge of high treason. His health was infirm, and during his
                    journey from York he was seized with a dysentery, which confined him for some
                    time at the seat of Lord Shrewsbury. As soon as he was able he mounted his mule
                    and resumed the journey. But his strength rapidly declined, and he was compelled
                    to take refuge in the abbey of Leicester, where he expired on the 30th of
                    November 1530, in the sixtieth year of his age.</p>
                <p>After the death of λVolsey, the king, by the advice of his ministers, had the
                    legality of his marriage debated in all the universities of Europe. (See the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Cranmer.)</hi> By dint of money he succeeded in
                    obtaining their votes in his favour, but not without a stubborn opposition.
                    Backed by these judgments, Henry appealed to the pope; but Clement remained
                    inflexible, and the king prepared to resist the papacy, though not yet to
                    separate himself entirely from the church of Rome. In 1532 Cranrncr was elevated
                    to the archbishopric of Canterbury; and early in the following year Henry
                    privately married Anne, and thus himself determined the long debated topic. A
                    few months afterwards he openly solemnized his marriage with Anne, who went in
                    state with him as queen. On the 23d of May Cranmer pronounced, not a divorce,
                    but a sentence that the king’s marriage with Catherine had been and was a
                    nullity, because it had been contracted and consummated against the divine law;
                    and not long afterwards he confirmed the marriage of the king with the Lady
                    Anne, whose coronation was performed in the most gorgeous manner on the first of
                    June 1533. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Boleyn.)</hi> The unfortunate Catherine,
                    perceiving all further opposition to be vain, retired to Ampthill, near
                    Dunstable, where she remained for the rest of her days in privacy and peace.</p>
                <p>The pope was no sooner informed of these proceedings, than he passed a sentence
                    declaring Catherine to be the king’s only lawful wife; requiring him to take her
                    again, and denouncing censures against him in the event of refusal. Henry, on
                    the other hand, knowing that his subjects were entirely at his command, resolved
                    to separate altogether from the church of Rome. In the year 1534 he was declared
                    head of the church by parliament; the authority of the pope was completely
                    abolished in England; all tributes formerly payable to the holy see were
                    declared illegal; and the king was intrusted with the collation to all
                    ecclesiastical benefices. The nation readily entered into the king’s measures,
                    and took an oath called the <hi rend="italic">oath c] supremacy</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> all the authority which the popes had maintained over
                    England for ages was overthrown at a blow; and none seemed to repine at the
                    change except those who, from their dependence upon Rome, were immediately
                    interested.</p>
                <p>But though the king thus separated from the church of Rome, he by no means
                    adhered to the doctrines of Luther which had been lately promulgated. He had
                    himself written a book against this celebrated reformer, which the pope
                    pretended greatly to admire, and honoured King Henry, on this account, with the
                    title of Defender of the Faith. This character he seemed to be determined to
                    maintain, and therefore persecuted the reformers most violently. Many were burnt
                    for denying the Catholic doctrines, and some also were executed for maintaining
                    the supremacy of the pope. The courtiers knew not which side to take, both the
                    new and old religions being equally persecuted; and as both parties equally
                    courted the favour of the king, he was by that means enabled to assume an
                    absolute authority over the nation.</p>
                <p>The established clergy co-operated actively in the revolution which was in
                    progress. Six bishops sanctioned by their vote every blow which was struck at
                    the power of Rome; and fourteen abbots were usually present when the number of
                    temporal peers who attended were somewhat more than forty. “They did not
                    shrink,” says Sir James Mackintosh, “from the deposition of Catherine, by
                    reducing her title to that of Princess Dowager of Wales. By ratifying the
                    marriage of Anne Boleyn they adopted those parts of the king’s conduct which
                    most disgusted the people. The bill for subjecting the clergy to the king, as
                    their sole head, was so favourably treated as in one day to be read three times
                    and passed: no division appears to have taken place on these measures.”<note

                    p. 17θ∙</p></note></p>
                <p>The attention of the king was now turned to Elizabeth Boston, a nun in the priory
                    of St Sepulchre at Canterbury, who believed herself endowed with the power of
                    working miracles, and foretelling future events. Several clergymen and other
                    gentlemen of Kent believed in her mission; and some individuals of the highest
                    order, both of intellect and piety, gave credit to her pretensions. She was
                    subject to convulsions; and in the trances into which she frequently fell,
                    visions of a marvellous nature were vouchsafed to her, which turned of course
                    upon the extraordinary events taking place around her. She was tried and
                    executed for high treason, and her abettors were arraigned on the same charge.
                    Fisher, bishop of Rochester, was attainted by the act against this modern
                    Pythia; but by a separate statute he was afterwards attainted of misprision of
                    treason, for not having taken the oath to the succession. He was eminent for his
                    learning and virtue, and probably his life would have been saved had not the
                    pope sent him a cardinal’s hat while in prison, which roused the jealousy of
                    Henry. The remorseless tyrant ordered him to be executed, at the same time
                    remarking, with his usual heartlessness, that the pope might send him a hat, but
                    that Fisher should have no head to wear it. Another deed of blood was
                    perpetrated a short time afterwards, which alone is calculated to consign the
                    name of Henry VIII. to the execration of all future times. Sir Thomas More, the
                    first Englishman of his day, one who had exalted the nation in the eyes of
                    Europe, and whose fame was universal, was tried and executed for misprision of
                    treason, in not taking the oath to maintain the succession. The legal pretext,
                    if there was any, for the accusation, was grounded on the obnoxious clause of a
                    recent act, which made it treason “to do any thing by writing or act which was
                    to the slander, disturbance, or prejudice of the marriage with the Lady Anne, or
                    to the disherison or disturbance of the king’s heirs by her.” Both More and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193332859" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2859-0746"/> Fisher had
                    abstained from either affirming or denying, first, that Henry’s marriage with
                    Catherine was invalid; secondly, that his marriage with Anne was valid; and,
                    thirdly, they refused to disclaim all foreign authority in the kingdom,
                    spiritual authority included. After his condemnation Sir Thomas avowed that he
                    had studied the question for seven years, and could not escape from the
                    conclusion that the king’s marriage with Catherine was valid. For this
                    scrupulous conscientiousness he expired upon the scaffold on the 7th of July
                    1535.</p>
                <p>This wanton shedding of righteous blood excited the utmost indignation in foreign
                    countries, particularly in Italy. Here Giovio, an historian, compared the
                    tyranny of Henry to that almost preternatural wickedness which the Grecian
                    legends had embodied under the appellation of Phalaris. Other individuals lashed
                    the tyranny of the English monarch with the utmost rigour, and lamented, in
                    strains of affecting eloquence, the fate of More, whom they designated the
                    martyr of unshaken probity. Amongst the most eminent of these writers was
                    Cardinal Pole, an Englishman, allied to the royal family.</p>
                <p>Catherine, the former consort of Henry, expired at Kimbolton in the beginning of
                    January 1536, having died as she had lived, mild, forgiving, and resigned. On
                    her deathbed she wrote a most affectionate letter to her husband, whose iron
                    nerves were touched by the perusal of it. His less prudent queen had the levity
                    to express her satisfaction at the event. But if she expected that it would in
                    any way be conducive to her further happiness, and a more devoted attachment on
                    the part of her husband, she was most miserably disappointed. She soon after
                    gave birth to a still-born child, and her brutal lord is said to have reproached
                    her upon the occasion for the loss of his boy. His desire for male issue, and
                    his repeated disappointments, seem to have at last weaned the affections of the
                    fickle monarch from the idol whom he had worshipped with so much devotedness and
                    ardour. A new passion had kindled in his breast, the object of which was Jane
                    Seymour, a young lady of the queen’s bed-chamber, which office Anne herself had
                    held in that of Catherine. The circumstances connected with the queen’s arrest
                    may be briefly stated. On May-day 1536 a tilting match was held at Greenwich, in
                    which her brother was the chief challenger, and Norris, groom of the stole, the
                    opposing defendant. The queen having dropped her handkerchief, had it gallantly
                    handed up to her by Norris, who was supposed to be her lover. The jealousy of
                    the king burst out; he left the joust precipitately; and ere night his queen had
                    passed through an examination, and was committed a prisoner. Such was the trifle
                    “light as air,” which to the jealous mind of Henry seemed a “confirmation strong
                    as proofs of holy writ.” By the researches of Mi-Turner it has been discovered,
                    that some days before the tournament certain individuals were appointed to
                    inquire into the alleged misdeeds of Anne. The commission put their authority
                    into execution upon the 10th of May, when a grand jury of Westminster was
                    assembled. The charge against her was adultery, and its consequence in such a
                    case, treason. Whether innocent or not, the unhappy Anne was deserted in her
                    utmost need, and had not a friend to counsel her in this alarming emergency. On
                    the day after the queen was committed to the Tower, Cranmer had written to the
                    king imploring the king’s mercy towards her, “his life solate, and sole delight
                    but in vain. The archbishop had been forbidden to approach the court until
                    desired by the king. The subsequent proceedings were as rapid as they were
                    terrible. On the 12th of May, Norris, Weston, Brereton, and Smeaton, were tried
                    in Westminster Hall for the crime of high treason. Smeaton pleaded guilty to the
                    charge; the others resisted, but were convicted. Three days afterwards the House
                    of Lords assembled for the trial of the queen. She was without counsel, and
                    attended only by her ladies. Anne defended herself with modesty and firmness,
                    but, upon evidence of which no traces now remain, she was condemned to suffer
                    death. On hearing the sentence of her judges, she raised up her hands and
                    exclaimed, “0 Father and Creator I 0 thou who art the way, the truth, and the
                    life! thou knowest that I have not deserved this death.” It is difficult to
                    reconcile such an ejaculation with a consciousness of guilt. She afterwards
                    turned to her judges, and made a serious protestation of her innocence. On the
                    17th of May the other individuals who had been convicted were carried forth to
                    execution. Smeaton, who had confessed to the guilt, probably from an erroneous
                    impression that he would by this means save his life, was the last to suffer.
                    Anne’s brother Rochford was also tried and condemned on the same day with
                    herself, and was executed with the others. The curtain dropped upon this
                    horrible tragedy with the death of the queen, who was beheaded on the day after
                    her supposed accomplices had suffered. For further particulars respecting this
                    unhappy personage, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Boleyn.</hi></p>
                <p>That Henry sacrificed his queen in a fit of vindictive resentment against her,
                    who, he too rashly believed, had dishonoured him, is all that can be urged in
                    his favour. That he really believed her guilty, must also in common fairness be
                    allowed. To think otherwise would be to attaint his name with one of the most
                    horrid enormities that ever disgraced the annals of crime. It seems very
                    improbable that the violent attachment which he had all along entertained for
                    her should have cooled so suddenly, and been supplanted by such deadly hate,
                    without supposing that some levities in the conduct of Queen Anne had fired his
                    jealous soul, and roused him to demand her blood as an expiation for the guilt
                    imputed to her. But he was not content with taking away her life under the
                    charge of adultery and incest; he deprived her of the name and the right of wife
                    and queen, and bastardized the daughter which she had born him, even when he
                    acknowledged that daughter to be his own. FIis contempt for her memory was
                    displayed in a manner which could be believed of few other individuals. He
                    dressed himself in white on the day of her execution, and actually married Jane
                    Seymour next morning.</p>
                <p>In bringing this tale of blood to a termination, we have unavoidably outrun
                    several important events. When the news of Sir Thomas More’s execution reached
                    the court of Rome, a bull was prepared against Henry. In this extraordinary
                    instrument were embodied all the offences of the English monarch against the
                    papal see, and he was allowed ninety days, and his fautors and abettors sixty,
                    to repent, and to appear at Ptome either in person or by attorney. In case of
                    default, he was to be excommunicated, and deprived of his crown; his children by
                    Anne were to be rendered incapable of inheriting for several generations; his
                    subjects were to be absolved from their allegiance to him; and all treaties and
                    alliances between him and other powers were to be null and void. This
                    thunderbolt, however, though forged for the purpose of punishing the king’s
                    apostacy, it was resolved should be suppressed for a time, and lodged in the
                    papal armoury until a more favourable opportunity should occur for launching it
                    at the royal culprit.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Thus far historians are perfectly agreed with regard to this bull. It is
                    also-certain, that in 1538 the suspension of the bull was revoked, and its
                    publication ordered by the pope. But whether or not this really took place is a
                    matter of doubt. Dr Lingard ob <pb corresp="kp-eb0708-2872-0747"
                    xml:id="pbn7747"/>serves, “I cannot find any proof that it was ever published at
                    all.” Sir James Mackintosh is silent upon the point. Mr Turner, in his History
                    of the Reign of Hemy VIII. says, that in 1538 “it was given unblushingly to the
                    world. This last order recites, that it had been suspended for three years on
                    the persuasion of some princes. Cherubini, 623.” In order to reconcile these
                    conflicting statements, it may perhaps be supposed that it never was “published
                    at all” in England, although it may have been “given unblushingly to the world”
                    in other countries.</p></note> The election of Henry as supreme <pb

                    the church we have already noticed, and also some of the events which followed
                    his assumption of that presumptuous title. Henry, however, at first assumed it
                    with wariness, and the language in which the statute is couched shows that his
                    supremacy might be reconciled with the papal authority, if the jurisdiction of
                    that power were only of a spiritual nature. But by the statutes of later years,
                    the revolution in church government had been consummated in England. The ancient
                    doctrine of the Roman Catholic faith was acknowledged; but the king was placed
                    as a sort of lay patriarch at the head of the ecclesiastical establishment.
                    Thomas Cromwell, who had now become Henry’s chief minister (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cromwell, Thomas),</hi> was at this time raised to the new
                    office of the king’s vicegerent, and empowered to send commissioners into the
                    several counties of England to inspect the monasteries, and to report, with
                    rigorous exactness, the conduct and deportment of such as were found there. This
                    appointment, which had been made between the parliaments of 1536 and 1539, was
                    confirmed by the recognition of the latter; and it was provided that the
                    vicegerent should take his seat in the House of Peers before the Archbishop of
                    Canterbury, and be ranked above all temporal lords, except some branches of the
                    royal family. The first experiment which Cromwell made of his unlimited power
                    was the gradual suppression of the various classes of religious houses, and the
                    seizure of their possessions, at that time amounting to a large proportion of
                    the landed property of the kingdom. This seizure of vested territorial
                    possessions was, in a legal point of view, direct spoliation. But it was urged,
                    on the other hand, that from the immorality, ignorance, and indolence in which
                    those who enjoyed them indulged, they had forfeited their right, and might
                    lawfully be deprived of these. By the inspectors of the religious houses, the
                    public were informed of the existence of monstrous disorders in these
                    communities. In 1536 the lesser monasteries were suppressed, amounting to nearly
                    four hundred. Their revenues, computed at L.30,000 per anmím, were confiscated
                    to the king’s use, besides their plate and other goods, estimated at L.100,000
                    more. The confiscation, however, was most unpopular, especially in those places
                    where the ancient faith retained most sway, and occasional revolts broke out.
                    Such a sweeping calamity must have brought ruin upon many innocent and even
                    worthy and deserving persons. The spectacle of individuals, invested with the
                    most sacred of all functions, expelled from their only habitations, where they
                    had probably grown old, and were now unfit for bodily toil, was calculated to
                    awaken feelings of sympathy for the sufferers, and probably of detestation for
                    those who had driven them forth to perish in the wilderness. A disturbance broke
                    out in Lincolnshire, where the first visitation of religious houses took place.
                    But in the north a more serious affair, amounting to an insurrection, occurred.
                    Between the Humber and the Tweed the people had rushed to arms, and they were
                    joined by the inhabitants of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and a portion of
                    Lancashire. This formidable body was led into the field by Robert Ask, a man of
                    Yorkshire, and was preceded by priests bearing banners emblazoned with paintings
                    of the sufferings of Christ. Several important towns fell into their hands; but
                    the king met them with a superior force, which arrested their progress. They,
                    however, succeeded in obtaining a general pardon, and then dispersed.</p>
                <p>A second visitation of the monasteries took place shortly afterwards. Various
                    circumstances had occurred to exasperate Henry against the Catholic clergy; and
                    the alarming revolts, at which priests had presided, and principally instigated
                    the people by their inflammatory addresses, were of a nature to inflame such a
                    combustible temper as his. In this second spoliation, the richest and most
                    revered shrines were pillaged and destroyed, and the sacred relics, objects of
                    so much superstitious veneration, were held up to the derision of the public.
                    Various historians have enumerated a great number of these, and some of them are
                    certainly calculated to excite surprise at the depth of that superstitious
                    feeling which could induce a people to believe that the parings of St. Edmund’s
                    toes, or the felt of St Thomas of Lancaster, or the shirt of St Thomas of
                    Canterbury, were infallible recipes for certain disorders. On this occasion the
                    shrine of the latter saint was demolished, and the wealth which it yielded was
                    enormous. These shrines were pillaged, on the allegation, too often true, that
                    they were the scenes of imposture, where miracles were pretended to be wrought.
                    The king, on the whole, suppressed upwards of six hundred monasteries, above two
                    thousand chantries and free chapels, and about two hundred colleges and
                    hospitals. The confiscation was closed by a statute passed in 1539, which
                    provided that “all monasteries, and other religious houses, dissolved,
                    suppressed, surrendered, renounced, relinquished, forfeited, or by any means
                    come to his highness, shall be vested in him, his heirs and successors, for
                    ever.” It must be owned, that although great abuses may have been detected,
                    revenue not reformation, plunder not punishment, were the objects which the
                    visitors had in view. With respect to the important question regarding property,
                    involved in this measure, we shall avail ourselves of the remarks of Sir James
                    Mackintosh on the subject.</p>
                <p>“Thus was completed the confiscation of a fifth or a fourth part of the landed
                    property of England and Wales within the space of five years. It may be a fit
                    moment therefore to pause here, in order calmly and shortly to review some of
                    the weighty questions which were involved in this measure. There is no need of
                    animadverting upon the means’ by which it was effected, though we must assent to
                    the affirmation of a great man, ‘ that an end which has no means but such as are
                    bad, is a bad end.’ But the general question may be best considered, keeping out
                    of view any of those attendant misdeeds which excite a very honest indignation,
                    but which disturb the operation of the judgment. Property is legal possession.
                    Whoever exercises a certain portion of power over any outward thing in a manner
                    which, by the’ laws of the country, entitles him to an exclusive enjoyment of
                    it, is deemed a proprietor. But property, which is generally deemed to be the
                    incentive to industry, the guardian of order, the preserver of internal quiet,
                    the channel of friendly intercourse between men and nations, and, in a higher
                    point of view, as affording leisure for the pursuit of knowledge, means for the
                    exercise of generosity, occasions for the returns of gratitude; as being one of
                    the ties which join succeeding generations, strengthening domestic discipline,
                    and keeping up the affections of the kindred; above all, because it is the
                    principle to which all men adapt their plans of life, and on the faith of whose
                    permanency every human action is performed; is~an institution of so high and
                    transcendent a nature, that every government which does not <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332885" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2885-0748"/>protect it, nay, that does
                    not rigorously punish its infraction, must be guilty of a violation of the first
                    duties of just rulers. The common feelings of human nature have applied to it
                    the epithets of sacred and inviolable. Property varies in the extent of the
                    powers which it confers, according to the various laws of different states. Its
                    duration, its descent, its acquisition, its alienation, depend solely upon these
                    laws. But all laws consider what is held or transmitted agreeably to their rules
                    as alike possessing the character of inviolable sacredness. There may be, and
                    there is, property for a term of years, for life, or for ever. It may be
                    absolute as to the exercise of the proprietor’s rights, or it may be
                    conditional, or, in other words, held only as long as certain conditions are
                    performed. There are specimens of all these sorts of property n the codes of
                    most civilized nations. But in all these cases the essence of property is
                    preserved, which consists in such a share or kind of power as the laws confer.
                    The advantages may be extremely unequal. The inviolable right must, by the force
                    of the terms, continue perfectly equal. .</p>
                <p>“The legal limits of the authority of the supreme legislature are not a
                    reasonable object of inquiry <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, nor indeed an
                    intelligible form of expression. But to conclude that, because the law may in
                    some cases be said to create property, the law is to be deemed on that account
                    as entitled rightfully to take it away, is a proposition founded on a gross
                    confusion of two very distinguishable conceptions. It uses the word property in
                    the premises for a system of rules, and in the conclusion for a portion of
                    external nature, of which the dominion is acquired by the observance of these
                    rules. It is only in the first of these senses that property can be truly called
                    the creature of law. In the second sense it is acquired or transmitted, not by
                    lpw, but by the acts of a man, when the acts are conformable to legal rules. It
                    is impossible within our present limits to canvass the small or apparent
                    objections which may occur to this scheme of reasoning. It is sufficient,
                    perhaps, here to remark, that these are the generally acknowledged principles,
                    and that deviations from them in practice are no more than partial
                    irregularities, to which the disturbing forces of passion and interest expose
                    human society. *</p>
                <p>“The clergy, though for brevity sometimes called a corporation, were ιather an
                    order in the state composed of many <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> corporations.
                    Their share of the national wealth was immense, consisting of land devised by
                    pious men, and of a tenth part of the produce of the soil set apart by the
                    customary law of Europe, for· the support of the parochial clergy. Each
                    clergyrhan had only in this case an estate foï life, to which, during its
                    continuance, the essential attribute of inviolable possession was as firmly
                    annexed by law as if it had been perpetual. The corporate body was supposed to
                    endure till it was abolished in some of the forms previously and specially
                    provided for by <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> law.</p>
                <p>“For one case, however, of considerable perplexity there was neither law nor.
                    precedent to light the way. Whenever the supreme power deemed itself bound to
                    change the established church, or even materially to alter the distribution of
                    its revenues, a questicn necessarily arose concerning the moral boundaries of
                    legislative authority in such cases. It was not, indeed, about a legal boundary;
                    for no specific limit can be assigned to its right of exacting obedience within
                    the national territory. The question was, what governments could do morally and
                    righteously <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, what it is right for them to do, and
                    what they would be enjoined to do by a just superior, if such a personage could
                    be found among their fellow-men. At first it-may seem that the lands should be
                    restored to the heirs of the original grantor But no provision for such a
                    reversion was made in the grant; no expectation of its occurrence was
                    entertained by their descendants; no habit or plan of life had been formed on
                    the probability of it. The grantors or founders had left their property to
                    certain bodies under the guardian power of the commonwealth, without the reserve
                    of any remainder to those who, after the lapse of centuries, might prove
                    themselves to be their representatives. It is a case not very dissimilar to that
                    of an individual who died without discoverable heirs, and whose property for
                    that reason falls to the state. It appeared, therefore, meet and, righteous that
                    in this new case, after the expiration of the estates for life, the property
                    granted for a purpose no longer deemed good or the best, should be applied by
                    the legislature to other purposes which they considered as better. But the
                    sacredness of the life estates is an essential condition of the justice of such
                    measures. No man thinks an annuity for life less inviolable during his life,
                    than a portion of land granted to him and to his heirs for ever. That estate
                    might, indeed, be forfeited by <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> a misperfonnance
                    of duty; but perfect good faith is in such a case more indispensable than in
                    most others. Fraud can convey no title; false pretences justify no acts. There
                    were gross abuses in the monasteries; but it was not for their offences that the
                    monastic communities fell. The most commendable application of their revenues
                    would have been to purposes as like those for which they were granted as the
                    changes in religious opinion would allow. These were religious instruction and
                    learned education. Some faint efforts were made to apply part to the foundation
                    of new bishoprics; but this was only to cover the profusion with which the
                    produce of rapine was lavished on courtiers and noblemen, to purchase their
                    support of the confiscations, and to ensure their zeal and that of their
                    descendants against the restoration of popery.</p>
                <p>“It is a melancholy truth, and may be considered by some as a considerable
                    objection to the principles which have been thus shortly expounded, that if in
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> the seizure of abbey lands’ the life estates had
                    been spared, the monks, who were the main stay of papal despotism, and the most
                    deadly foes of all reform, would have had arms in their hands which might have
                    rendered them irresistible. It must perhaps be acknowledged, that it was more
                    necessary to the security of Henry’s partial reformation to strip the monaster
                    ;s at that moment, than to dissolve communities which a better regulation might
                    in future reconcile to the hew system.</p>
                <p>“We are assured by Sir Thomas More, ‘ that in all the time while he was
                    conversant with the court, of all the nobility of this land he found no more
                    than seven that thought it right or reasonable to take away their possessions
                    lrom the clergy.’ So inconsiderable was the original number of those who, not
                    many years after, accomplished an immense revolution in property.</p>
                <p>“To which it must be answered, that the observance of justice is more necessary
                    than security for any institution; that many regulations might have stood
                    instead of one deed of rapine; that the milder expedients would have provoked
                    fewer and more reconcilable enemies; that if, on. the whole, they afford less
                    security, the legislature were at least bound to try all means before they who
                    were appointed to be the guardians of right set the example oř so great a wrong.
                    Rulers can never render so lasting a service to a people as by the example, in a
                    time of danger, of justice to formidable enemies, and of mercy to obnoxious
                    delinquents. These are glorious examples, for which much is to be hazarded.”</p>
                <p>Henry had now so far separated himself from the communion of Rome, that it became
                    in some measure necessary for him to concoct a creed of his own. The <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193332898" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2898-0749"/> clergy were
                    divided into two factions, denominated the men of the old and the new learning.
                    The chief of the former was Gardiner bishop of Winchester, who was supported by
                    Lee archbishop of York; Stokesly bishop of London, Tunstall of Durham, and
                    Clarke of Bath and Wells. The latter acknowledged as leaders, Cranmer archbishop
                    of Canterbury, Haxton of Sarum. Latimer of Worcester, and Fox of Hereford. These
                    could depend on the powerful interest of Cromwell the vicar-general, and of
                    Audley the lord chancellor; those on that of the duke of Norfolk, and of
                    Wriothesley the premier-secretary. Various long debates took place upon the new
                    creed, but it was neither completed nor sufficiently fenced round with suitable
                    penalties, till an act was passed by the parliament, which sat in April 1539,
                    entitled “an act for abolishing diversity of opinions.” This convocation was
                    opened by the chancellor informing the House of Lords that it was his majesty’s
                    earnest desire to extirpate from his kingdom all diversity of opinions with
                    regard to religion; and as this enterprise was, he owned, difficult and
                    important, he desired them to choose a committee from amongst themselves, who
                    might frame certain articles, and communicate these afterwards to parliament.
                    The lords named the vicar-general Cromwell, now created a peer; the Archbishops
                    of Canterbury and York; and the Bishops of Durham, Carlisle, Worcester, Bath and
                    Wells, Bangor, and Ely. But this small committee itself was agitated with such
                    diversity of opinions that it could come to no conclusion. The Duke of Norfolk
                    then moved, that since there was no hope of having a report from the committee,'
                    the articles of faith proposed to be established should be reduced to six, and a
                    new committee be appointed to frame an act respecting them. As this peer was
                    understood to speak the king’s mind, his motion was immediately complied with;
                    and, after a short prorogation, the bill of the six articles was introduced,
                    and, having passed the two houses, received the king’s assent. By this law the
                    doctrine of the real presence was established, the communion in one kind, the
                    perpetual obligation of vows of chastity, the utility of private masses, the
                    celibacy of the clergy, and, lastly, the necessity of auricular confession. The
                    denial of the real presence was punishable with death by fire, and the same
                    forfeiture as in cases of treason, and admitted not the privilege of abjuring;
                    an unheard of cruelty, unknown even to the inquisition itself. The denial of any
                    of the other articles, even though afterwards recanted, was punishable by the
                    forfeiture of goods and chattels, and imprisonment during the king’s pleasure.
                    An obstinate adherence to error, or a relapse, was adjudged to be felony, and
                    subjected the delinquent to death. The marriage of priests was punished in the
                    same manner. Their commerce with women was, for the first offence, forfeiture
                    and imprisonment; and for the second, death. Abstaining from confession, and
                    from receiving the eucharist at the accustomed times, subjected the person to
                    fine, and to imprisonment during the king’s pleasure; and if the criminal
                    persevered after conviction, he was to suffer death and forfeiture, as in cases
                    of felony. Commissioners were to be appointed by the king, for inquiring into
                    these heresies and irregular practices, and the criminals were to be tried by a
                    jury.</p>
                <p>Henry had now been a widower for above two years. In 1537 Jane Seymour, his third
                    queen, had born him a son, afterwards Edward VI.; but she herself expired in
                    less than a fortnight afterwards. The king afterwards made proposals of marriage
                    to several foreign princesses, and others, without success. Under these repeated
                    disappointments, he readily listened to the suggestions of Cromwell, who
                    proposed to him Anne, sister of the Duke of Cleves, a considerable prince on the
                    Lower Rhine, who had lately established Lutheranism in his principality. This
                    choice showed the leaning of his secretary’s mind, and the progress of men in
                    general towards reformation. Henry had seen a painting by Holbein of this lady.
                    The artist had invested her with fictitious charms, which captivated the sensual
                    monarch, and inspired him with such eagerness to behold her, that he proceeded
                    to Dover, where she was to disembark, his mind no doubt swelling with pleasing
                    anticipations. But he was miserably disappointed, and could not conceal his
                    chagrin. She was indeed of the standard dimensions, being large and tall as his
                    heart could desire; for stature had now become an indispensable qualification in
                    the individual who should aspire to gain the affections of the king of England.
                    Without entering into the disgusting particulars connected with his marriage
                    with Anne of Cleves, it is sufficient to state that the nuptials were
                    solemnized, and that the lady was treated, not as a wife, but as a friend. The
                    distress of Henry was great, and at last drew the attention of the House of
                    Lords to the subject on the 6th of July 1540. These obsequious peers entreated
                    him to make inquiry into the validity of his marriage with the Lady Anne of
                    Cleves; and the Commons having concurred with them, the king granted their
                    prayer. Of course this drama was' all arranged, and the characters cast, some
                    days before the meeting of parliament. The convocation appointed-to examine into
                    the matter declared the marriage to be null by the consent of Lady Anne herself,
                    which was insured by the grant <hi rend="italic">of an</hi> income of L.3000
                    annually; and the lady, it would appear, lived comfortably on her annuity for
                    sixteen years in England. The bill for the nullity was passed by both houses,
                    and received the royal assent on the 24th of July 1540. About a fortnight
                    afterwards the king married his fourth wife, Catherine Howard, niece to the Duke
                    of Norfolk. But let us look back upon the fate of Cromwell, who was instrumental
                    in procuring the former union. It was indispensably necessary that the
                    revolutions which took place in Henry VIlI.’s palace and bed should in some way
                    or another be marked with blood.</p>
                <p>The arrest, condemnation, and execution of Cromwell, is another of those cruel
                    and tyrannical measures which have entailed accumulated odium upon the name of
                    Henry VIII. A bill to attaint the vicar-general of high treason was brought into
                    parliament in June 1540; and before the end of the month it had passed through
                    both houses. He was charged with heresy because he had favoured the new
                    doctrines, and with treason because he had performed several acts of royal
                    authority without the warrant of the king. Cromwell was condemned unheard, and
                    executed in about a month afterwards. This was an act of gross injustice, but it
                    was far from being unpopular. The nobility were glad to be rid of an individual
                    who had raised himself from the shop of a fuller to the highest offices of
                    state; and the Roman Catholic party, who were the most numerous,’ and had
                    regained much of their ascendency, rejoiced at the fall of one who was the
                    active conductor of that system of confiscation which struck such a blow at
                    their power in England. In that business he certainly must have connived at much
                    rapine and robbery, which it was out of his power to prevent. He has also been
                    charged with Machiavelian policy; but there is no satisfactory evidence that he
                    was unfaithful to his sovereign. Like Wolsey, he seems to have served his king
                    more faithfully than his God; and it is remarkable that he fell into his own
                    snare, having repeatedly shown the example of attainder without trial.</p>
                <p>At this period the act of the six articles was in the fullest vigour of its
                    cruelty; and many iniquitous executions took place. One of the most horrid of
                    these was that of Courtney marquis of Exeter, with Lord Montague and Sir
                    Edward<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332911" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2911-0750"/> Nevil.
                    They were descended from Edward IV., and this seems to have constituted their
                    only crime. Towards the dose of 1538 they were first arrested and committed to
                    the Tower; and shortly afterwards the Countess Margaret, the mother of the
                    Poles, was also taken into custody. Exeter was charged with the offence of
                    having conspired to raise Reginald Pole to the throne. This individual, best
                    known as a cardinal, was the son of the above-named lady, who was daughter of
                    the Duke of Clarence. Her son’s life was principally passed in Italy, where he
                    was much celebrated for his talents; and Henry appears to have been proud of
                    him, for he munificently discharged his expenses. Their friendship, however,
                    terminated with the king’s divorce from Catherine, which the English monarch
                    vainly besought Pole to sanction. The revenge of Henry, who seems now to have
                    thought that without the shedding of blood there could be no remission of
                    offences, fell upon the mother of the cardinal, and the last of the
                    Plantagenets. She was attainted of high treason, and sent to prison, as above
                    noticed. The noblemen committed about the same time were soon afterwards
                    executed; but the lady lingered two years in confinement, and was at last
                    conducted to the scaffold on the 27th of May 1541, where, to complete the horror
                    of the transaction, from mismanagement on the part of the executioner, her neck
                    was horribly mangled, and her grey hairs, clotted with blood, fell dishevelled
                    over her face ere the bloody act was consummated.</p>
                <p>To return to the domestic affairs of Henry, he had not been many months married
                    to Catherine Howard before he received such information of her dissolute life
                    before marriage as induced him to suspect that she might still continue it, and
                    to cause a rigid inquiry to be made into her conduct. There was no doubt as to
                    her vices previously to her union with the king; and some acts of infidelity
                    after it were also brought home to her, but the details are too disgusting for
                    human feelings. Cranmer was one of the individuals employed to communicate
                    information to the king; and although there is no evidence that he was ever
                    guilty of a malicious or vindictive act, yet he sometimes wanted the courage to
                    resist crimes; and the slavish manner in which he, along with the rest of the
                    ministers and parliament in general, bowed to the despotic will of the king,
                    cannot be extenuated.</p>
                <p>Two of Catherine’s paramours were arrested, and confessed their crimes; and the
                    queen herself acknowledged her guilt previously to the marriage, but denied
                    having committed any act of infidelity subsequently thereto. This, however, was
                    not believed; and on the 14th of February 1542 she was executed in the Tower,
                    along with Lady Rochford, who in some way or another was implicated as an
                    accomplice in the guilt of the queen.</p>
                <p>1o attaint without trial had now become fashionable; but to punish with death
                    that which was not made criminal by any former statute, was altogether new. To
                    countenance such severities as those which had lately taken place, it was
                    enacted in the very bill of attainder, that every woman about to be married to
                    the king or his successors, not being a maid, should disclose her unchastity to
                    him, under the penalty of treason; that any person knowing the fact and not
                    disclosing it, should be subject to the lesser penalty of misprision of treason;
                    and that the commission of adultery by the queen or wife of the prince should be
                    punishable with death.</p>
                <p>These laws afforded some amusement to the people, who now said that the king must
                    look out for a ’ widow, as no reputed maid would be disposed to offer herself
                    whilst such a dreadful statute was suspended over her head. This in reality took
                    place, for on the 10th of July 1543 Henry espoused Catherine Parr, the widow of
                    Lord Latimer, and a lady of mature age. She had read Lutheran books, and was
                    inclined to support the doctrines of the ' reformers. She even went so far as to
                    enter into controversy with her imperious lord, who valued himself not a little
                    on his theological knowledge. He ordered Wriothesley and Gardiner to give orders
                    for her imprisonment, and to prepare articles of impeachment against her. The
                    third Catherine had very nearly been honoured with a place upon the list of
                    victims which were sacrificed by this Blue Beard of the west, but she evaded the
                    blow by her ingenuity and tact. During the remainder of her life, however, she
                    never again ventured to provoke the vengeance of the royal polemic.</p>
                <p>As head of the church, the attention of the king was now principally turned to
                    the management of its affairs. He enforced an observance of the six articles
                    both by Protestants and Catholics, and any deviation from them was punished with
                    tyrannical severity. He was very impartial in his distribution of what he called
                    justice; and it was not uncommon for individuals professing opposite faiths to
                    perish at the same stake. The Christian of those days had a difficult part to
                    perform; for whilst the king renounced in one respeect the authority of the
                    pope, he acknowledged it in another by his adherence to the doctrines of the
                    church of Rome; so that it frequently happened that those who were against the
                    head of it were burned, and those who were for him were hanged. In connection
                    with church affairs, Henry effected a further dissolution of colleges,
                    hospitals, and other foundations of that nature, with the spoils of which he
                    enriched his treasury. He also extorted from many bishops a surrender of their
                    chapter lands, and in this manner he succeeded in pillaging the sees of
                    Canterbury, of York, and of London. Amongst the religious orders suppressed was
                    that of the Knights of Malta, or, more properly, St John of Jerusalem. They
                    obstinately refused to surrender along with the other monasteries who laid their
                    rights at the feet of the king, and he was compelled to have recourse to
                    parliament for the purpose of obtaining its authority for dissolving the order,
                    which was very rich, and whose spoil was therefore precious in his sight.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of maintaining a rigid purity in speculative principles, he
                    nominated a commission of divines to make out a creed for the benefit of his
                    subjects. In connection with this appointment a circumstance occurred which
                    strongly marks the character of this reign, as well as of those who composed the
                    council of the nation. Before the reverend conclave had made any progress in its
                    arduous undertaking, the parliament passed a law which went to ratify all the
                    tenets which the divines might establish in accordance with the king’s consent.
                    This clearly shows that the individuals composing that body, as well as the
                    parliament, were merely ciphers, and that Henry was the initial unit which gave
                    them value. A small volume was published under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Institution of a Christian Man,</hi> which was made the infallible standard
                    of orthodoxy. But the king’s inconsistency was as strikingly exemplified in his
                    religion as in his morals. A new book was ordered to be composed, and three
                    years were spent before it could be brought to that desirable state of
                    perfection which the king wished. At length, however, it came forth under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">A necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any Christened
                    Man</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in order to distinguish it from the former
                    work upon the same subject, it was called emphatically the king’s book. It
                    taught the same doctrines as the preceding compilation, with the addition of
                    transubstantiation and the sufficiency of communion under one kind. The new
                    creed was generally approved of, and all writings in opposition to it were
                    prohibited. From the period of the publication of the “king’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193332924" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2924-0751"/>book” until the accession of
                    the next sovereign, it continued to be the only authorized standard of English
                    orthodoxy. Henry had formerly sanctioned the publication of the Bible in
                    English, and permission was granted to all his subjects to peruse it. But he
                    afterwards retracted the liberty which he had vouchsafed them, and prohibited
                    the reading of the Scriptures by the lower orders of the people under the
                    penalty of imprisonment. The mass book was also examined, and some alterations
                    were made upon it.</p>
                <p>But to return to the political affairs of the nation; in the beginning of the
                    year 1543 Henry renewed his friendship with the emperor, which had been
                    suspended by the divorce question. They concluded an alliance against Francis;
                    and on the 14th of July 1544 Henry crossed the seas in a ship furnished with
                    sails of cloth of gold. The principal event of this war was the surrender of
                    Boulogne, into which the English monarch made a triumphant entry on the Ί 8th of
                    September. But he shortly afterwards returned to England. On the 7th of June
                    1546 hostilities were concluded by a treaty, of which the principal stipulation
                    was, that within eight years Henry should receive two millions of crowns, with
                    arrears and costs, which are enumerated; and, on payment of these sums, Boulogne
                    and its dependencies were to be restored to Francis. Henry’s warlike
                    propensities were also exercised in reference to Scotland and Ireland; but peace
                    was finally restored after both countries had suffered considerably, especially
                    the former. These wars, however, exhausted the treasury of the English monarch.
                    He was compelled to extort money from parliament in his usual manner, and also
                    to depreciate the coinage of the realm, which he had not scrupled to do
                    before.</p>
                <p>The cruelty of Henry continued conspicuous to the very close of his life. Disease
                    made dreadful ravages upon his worn-out and unwieldy frame, so that he had to be
                    moved from place to place by machines contrived for the purpose; yet even these
                    unequivocal tokens of approaching <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> dissolution had
                    no effect in subduing the vindictive spirit or humanising the mind of the
                    sufferer. It was in this pitiable state that he perpetrated an act which has
                    become memorable from the fame of the illustrious victim. This was the execution
                    of Henry Howard, earl of Surrey, so justly renowned for his poetical genius.
                    There had for some time existed a spirit of rivalry between the Seymours and the
                    house of Howard. The Duke of Norfolk was indignant at the ascendency of the
                    former in the royal favour; and his son, the Earl of Surrey, could not forgive
                    the Earl of Hertford, a member of the other family, for having superseded him in
                    the command of the garrison of Boulogne; he had also been heard to predicate
                    that the time of revenge was not far distant. The house of Howard alone stood in
                    the way of the Seymours in the pursuit of their aggrandisement under the
                    approaching minority; and they accordingly employed every means of drawing down
                    the vengeance of the king upon their heads. Norfolk and Surrey were accordingly
                    committed to the Tower on the 12th of December 1546. Surrey was tried on the
                    13th of January following, on a charge of having quartered on his shield the
                    arms of Edward the Confessor. He vainly defended himself with his usual
                    eloquence and spirit, and showed that he had worn the arms fourteen years
                    without giving offence, and that they had been assigned to him by a decision of
                    the heralds. But the fact being admitted, it was taken as sufficient evidence
                    that he aspired to the throne, and the jury condemned him to suffer death. About
                    a week after the sentence was pronounced, this gallant and accomplished nobleman
                    expired upon the scaffold. His father was also tried and condemned to perish in
                    the same manner on the 29th of January. But on the morning of the 28th the
                    spirit of Henry VIII. followed that of Surrey to the judgmentseat; and Norfolk,
                    after remaining in prison for several years, was at length set at liberty.</p>
                <p>Henry VIII. is one of the most repulsive sovereigns to be met with in the list of
                    English kings. There is a gross brutality about the man, and a remorseless
                    tyranny and blood-thirstiness about the king, which totally obscure any human
                    features which his character may have possessed. Some of his crimes are of so
                    dark a dye, and so peculiarly diabolical, as to make the mind shudder at the
                    very mention of his name. It is difficult to extend charity to, or rank with
                    ordinary humanity, one who could repeatedly hurry from his arms to the scaffold
                    those whom he had loved and embraced with passionate tenderness, if such
                    language may be used in reference to any feeling which animated the breast of
                    such a barbarian. It was after the fall of Wolsey that the prominent features of
                    Henry’s moral deformity fully developed themselves; and they are such as have
                    attached to his name a degradation which can neither be removed nor palliated.
                    For the good which he was the means of doing, in sanctioning a reformation in
                    the affairs of the church, he deserves no credit; for it originated in a spirit
                    of vindictive revenge, and was perpetuated by plunder and cruelty. Henry was not
                    destitute of ability; and the esteem which we may infer he. entertained for
                    literature, since he patronised learning, is one of the few traits of his
                    character which are not repulsive and odious.</p>
                <p>Henry was succeeded by his only son Edward, a boy of nine years of age. He was
                    proclaimed king of England on the 31st of January 1547, and crowned in the month
                    following. The most remarkable transactions of his reign are those connected
                    with religion. The restraint which Henry VIII. had laid upon the Protestants was
                    now taken off; and they not only maintained their doctrines openly, but soon
                    became the prevailing party. Henry had fixed the majority of his son at eighteen
                    years of age; and, in the mean time, appointed sixteen executors of his will, to
                    whom, during the minority, he entrusted the government of the king and kingdom.
                    But the first act of the executors was to choose the Earl of Hertford,
                    afterwards Duke of Somerset, protector of the realm; and in him was lodged all
                    the regal power, together with a privilege of naming his own privy council.</p>
                <p>The Duke of Somerset had long been numbered amongst the secret partisans of the
                    reformers; and, immediately on his elevation to his high dignity, he began to
                    express his intention of reforming the abuses of the ancient religion. Under his
                    direction and that of Cranrner, therefore, the reformation was vigorously
                    carried forward; persecutions under the act of the six articles ceased,
                    prisoners were released, and exiles were recalled. Homilies were composed by
                    Cranmer, and ordered to be read by parish priests to their congregations.
                    Visitors were appointed to inspect ecclesiastical establishments, and see that
                    four sermons were yearly preached against the papal authority; that the worship
                    of images should be denounced, and those who were the objects of pilgrimages and
                    offerings should be destroyed; that the English Bible, with Erasmus’s commentary
                    on the gospels, should be placed in every church for the use of the people;
                    together with many other points, which, without being very important in
                    themselves, were calculated to assure the people that the government was no
                    longer neutral in matters of religion. The principal person who opposed these
                    innovations was Gardiner bishop of Winchester; a man of great learning,
                    abilities, and resolution, but one of Henry’s devoted agents in the suit for a
                    divorce from Catherine, his first queen. He made a manly and becoming resistance
                    to these injunctions, from principles of civil liberty, as much as of
                    ecclesiastical<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332937" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2937-0752"/>
                    discipline. To the disgrace of their own principles, the reformers now displayed
                    as virulent a spirit of persecution as the Catholics had formerly done. Gardiner
                    was committed to the Fleet prison, where he was treated with great severity. He
                    was afterwards sent to the Tower; and having continued there two years, he was
                    commanded to subscribe several articles, amongst which was one confessing the
                    justice of his own imprisonment. To all the articles but this he agreed to
                    subscribe; but that did not give satisfaction. He was then committed to close
                    custody; his books and papers were seized; all company was denied him; and he
                    was not even permitted ,the use of writing materials. Bonner of London, more
                    violent and more subservient, escaped protracted imprisonment by obsequious
                    submission. Several bishops also screened themselves by sacrificing a
                    considerable share of their revenues; others were deprived of their offices; and
                    Tunstal bishop of Durham, an eminent prelate, was ejected from the privy
                    council, in order to impress on the people by a strong example the
                    disinclination of the protector to the ancient faith. In November 1547 a
                    parliament was assembled, in which several bills were passed to promote and
                    enlarge the reformation. The communion was appointed to be received in both
                    kinds by the laity as well as by the clergy, without condemning the usages of
                    other churches. Bishops were to be nominated by the king, and process was to run
                    in the king’s name in ecclesiastical courts. The statutes against the Lollards
                    were repealed, as well as all the acts of Henry VIII. upon religious matters,
                    excepting those directed against the supremacy of the pope; and other acts
                    relating to civil affairs were also abrogated. In the next session uniformity in
                    public worship was established, in which the use of the book of common prayer,
                    as prepared by the primate and his brethren, was enjoined. This composition is
                    the foundation of that which, having undergone various alterations in subsequent
                    reigns, continues in use at the present day. By one law the observance of fast
                    days and of Lent was enjoined under penalties; and by another the English clergy
                    were emancipated from compulsory celibacy.</p>
                <p>The rest of this reign presents little but the history of the intrigues and
                    cabals of courtiers. There was a war with Scotland, which began with injustice
                    and was conducted with inhumanity. Insurrections also took place in Ireland,
                    where the reformation made no progress. The details of these transactions will
                    be given in the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Scotland</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Iceland.</hi> The protector was first opposed by bis own
                    brother Admiral Sir Thomas Seymour, who had married Catherine Parr, the late
                    king’s widow. She died soon after the marriage; and the widower is said to have
                    then paid his addresses to the Princess Elizabeth. His brother the duke, who was
                    at that time in the north, being informed of his ambitious projects, speedily
                    returned, had him attainted of high treason, and at last condemned and executed.
                    The Duke of Somerset himself, however, became unpopular, and a powerful
                    confederacy was formed against him, at the head of which was Dudley earl of
                    Warwick. This nobleman succeeded in overthrowing the power of the protector, and
                    getting him committed to prison on the 13th of October 1549, whilst be himself
                    was installed in the office of lord high admiral. In the month of February
                    following Somerset was ιcleased upon payment of a fine and ransom; but towards
                    the end of 1551 he was again sent to the Tower, tried for high treason and
                    felony, and condemned. He was acquitted of the first charge, but not of the
                    second, as he ought to have been. He suffered upon the scaffold on the 22d of
                    January 1552. Warwick, now duke of Northumberland, had thus the reins of
                    government entirely at his own disposal. Not satisfied with the office of
                    protector, he aimed at altering the succession, and placing the crown upon the
                    head of his son. He represented to Edward, who was now in a declining state of
                    health, that his sisters Mary and Elizabeth, who were appointed by Henry’s will
                    to succeed to the crown, in failure of direct heirs, had both been declared
                    illegitimate by parliament; that the queen of Scots, his aunt, stood excluded by
                    the king’s will; and being also an alien, lost all right of succeeding. The
                    three princesses being thus excluded, the succession naturally devolved upon the
                    Marchioness of Dorset, eldest daughter of the French queen, Henry’s sister, who
                    had married the Earl of Suffolk after her first husband’s death. The next heir
                    to the marchioness was Lady Jane Grey, the wife of Northumberland’s fourth son,
                    Lord Guildford Dudley. The king, who was accustomed to submit to the politic
                    views of tin’s minister, agreed to have the succession altered, and sketched
                    with his own hand a draft of the new destination of the crown, which was
                    submitted to a council. The judges, however, were far from acquiescing in the
                    proposal contained in this instrument; and they hesitated to sign it, because it
                    would subject those who had drawn and those who had advised it to the penalties
                    of treason. Their hesitation excited the rage of Northumberland, who threatened
                    them with his authority, and, pronouncing them traitors, declared that he would
                    fight in his shirt with any man in so just a cause as that of Lady Jane’s
                    succession. A new paper was drawn up, by which the judges were screened from any
                    consequences which might have resulted from their signing of it. By the new
                    patent for changing the succession, the princesses Mary and Elizabeth were set
                    aside, and the crown settled upon the heirs of the Duchess of Suffolk, rvho was
                    contented to forego her own claim.</p>
                <p>For some time the king had languished under a pulmonary complaint, and symptoms
                    of an advanced stage of consumption began to make their appearance. After the
                    settlement of the crown, his health visibly declined every day, and little hopes
                    were entertained of his recovery. The deathbed devotions of Edward bear
                    testimony to his love for his subjects, and his zeal for what he believed to be
                    the purest form of Christianity. “0 Lord, save thy chosen people of England,
                    defend this realm from papistry, and maintain thy true religion.” Such is a
                    specimen of the supplications which this pious and short-lived prince breathed
                    forth. On the 6th of July 1553, Edward, being then in the sixteenth year of his
                    age and seventh of his ιeign, breathed his last. Whilst he filled the throne of
                    England, no Roman Catholic had suffered death on account of his religion. By his
                    gentleness and docility he was indisposed to shed blood, and, on the whole, his
                    reign was more free from religious persecution than any administration of the
                    same length, in any great country of Europe, since the rise of protestantism. In
                    abilities be was equal, probably superior, to most boys of his years; but the
                    flattering praises lavished upon him by his panegyrists are to be received with
                    abatements, lt was his dying wish that Lady Jane Grey, the companion of his
                    infancy, should be his successor.</p>
                <p>The death of Edward was carefully concealed for two days; but on the Sth of July
                    the event was communicated to the ambassadors, and the civic functionaries of
                    London were ordered to make preparations for the coronation of Lady Jane Grey.
                    The intelligence was transmitted to Mary by her friends at court, and on the 9th
                    she wrote a letter to the privy council, expostulating with them upon their
                    conduct; and, solemnly affirming her right, she tendered a pardon to them if
                    they would order her immediate proclamation. The council, however, adhered to
                    the interests of Jane, and both parties prepared to decide the contest by an
                    appeal to arms.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332950" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2950-0753"/>
                <p>When Edward’s death, and her own elevation to the throne, were announced to Lady
                    Jane, she was thrown into a state of great agitation. The manner in which she
                    was affected will be best understood from a passage in a letter of hers which
                    she afterwards transmitted to Mary. “As soon as I had, with infinite pain to my
                    mind, understood these things, how much I remained beside myself, stunned and
                    agitated, I leave to those lords to testify who saw me fall to the ground, and
                    who knew how grievously I wept.” She urged the preferable claim of the
                    princesses to inherit; but being pressed by the authority of the judges, she at
                    length consented to accept of the royal dignity. She suffered herself to be
                    conveyed to the Tower, and on the same day the heralds proclaimed the death of
                    Edward and the succession of Jane. Mary was also proclaimed at Norwich, and it
                    is somewhat singular that the populace took no interest in either of the
                    proclamations. No shouts of applause or outward demonstrations of joy followed
                    the announcement of the choice of a new sovereign. Northumberland was unpopular,
                    a great part of the Protestants cooperated with the Catholic partisans of Mary,
                    who were numerous and powerful; and the protector, by his supineness, allowed
                    them to assemble in great force at Framling-ham Castle, in Suffolk, where the
                    princess had fixed her residence. Northumberland became alarmed, and although he
                    had assembled a considerable army, his heart failed him when he saw the
                    demonstrations which were made by the people in favour of Mary. He had taken the
                    field in person, which was a fatal step; for his absence afforded an opportunity
                    to the adherents of Mary who were in the council to make arrangements for
                    exalting her to the royal dignity. It is sufficient to observe that they
                    effected their purpose. Mary was proclaimed, and Jane, after a ten days reign,
                    resigned the crown with a great deal more satisfaction than she had accepted of
                    it. Northumberland had been compelled to proclaim Mary at Cambridge; but this
                    did not prevent him from being led a prisoner to the Tower, which had lately
                    been his palace.</p>
                <p>Mary, accompanied by her sister Elizabeth, made her triumphal entry into London
                    on the 3d of August 1553. Her attentions were first turned towards those who had
                    suffered in her cause. She released several prisoners from the Tower, amongst
                    whom were the aged Duke of Norfolk, and her kinsman Edward Courtenay, whom she
                    soon afterwards created Earl of Devonshire. On the 18th of August the Duke of
                    Northumberland, the Marquis of Northampton, and the Earl of Warwick, were tried
                    for high treason; and on the following day Sir John Gates, Sir Henry Gates, Sir
                    Andrew Dudley, and Sir Thomas Palmer, were tried for the same offence. Of the
                    culprits who were condemned, three were selected for execution, Northumberland,
                    Sir John Gates, and Sir Thomas Palmer, who suffered upon the scaffold on the 22d
                    of August.</p>
                <p>The mind of Mary now became solicitous about the affairs of religion. All the
                    deprived Catholic bishops were restored. The acknowledged abilities of Gardiner
                    soon raised him to the post of prime minister. He early received the custody of
                    the seals, and not long afterwards be was appointed chancellor. The Protestant
                    bishops, in the eyes of their Roman Catholic brethren, had incurred deprivation
                    by marriage, or still more severe penalties by preaching heresy. On the 2d of
                    September Cranmer was committed to the Tower, and on the 13th Latimer followed
                    him into the same captivity. The latter, in point of moral heroism, was the
                    antipodes of Cranmer, who was gentle and kind, timid and pliant. Latimer was
                    brave, sincere, and inflexible. As he passed through Smithfield on his way to
                    the Tower, he remarked, “Smithfield has long groaned for me.” By an early
                    proclamation Mary had declared that “she could not hide her religion, but that
                    she mindeth not to compel any of her said subjects thereunto, until such time as
                    a farther order by common consent shall be taken therein. <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,i</hi> The “farther order” did take place, although not in accordance with
                    “common consent.” On the 5th of October 1553, parliament assembled, and, in a
                    session of nineteen days, passed only three acts; one for the abolition of all
                    the treasons and felonies of Henry VIII.; another for the restoration in blood
                    of Gertrude marchioness of Exeter; and a third for the like reśtitution of that
                    lady’s son, Edward Courtenay, now Earl of Devonshire. But on the 24th of the
                    same month, several important acts were passed, by which the road was paved for
                    the re-introduction of the Roman Catholic faith as the creed sanctioned by
                    royalty. By these acts Henry’s divorce was declared void, and his first marriage
                    pronounced valid; so that the claim of Elizabeth, on whom the Protestants had
                    fixed their eyes with anxious hope, was virtually set aside. But the progress of
                    the revolution in religious matters was slow; and before the perfect re-union
                    with the Church of Rome was consummated, several’ events of considerable
                    importance took place. Mary having been crowned at Westminster with the usual
                    solemnity on the last day of September 1553, it now became the interest of the
                    Catholic party to obtain a suitable marriage for her. Of natives only two were
                    proposed to her choice, both descended from the house of York; these were
                    Cardinal Pole, and Edward Courtenay, the individual whom she had released from
                    confinement. But the Emperor Charles having heard of Mary’s intention to choose
                    a husband, proposed his son Don Philip. This Spanish match was so broad and
                    decisive a step towards Rome, that the House of Commons took the alarm, and
                    presented an address to the queen, in order to dissuade her from her purpose.
                    She returned a haughty answer; and on the 30th of October, having conducted the
                    imperial minister into her private oratory, she there solemnly called God to
                    witness that she plighted her troth to Philip prince of Castille. To obviate all
                    clamour, the articles of marriage were drawn up as favourably as possible for
                    the interests of England. It was agreed that though Philip should have the title
                    of king, the administration should be entirely in the queen; that no foreigner
                    should be capable of holding any office in the kingdom, nor should any
                    innovation be made in the laws, the customs, and the privileges of the people;
                    and that Philip should not carry the queen abroad without her consent, or any of
                    her children without the consent of the nobility. Sixty thousand pounds a year
                    were to be settled upon her as a jointure, and the male issue of this marriage
                    were to inherit Burgundy and the Low Countries as well as the crown of England;
                    and in the event of the death of Don Carlos, Philip’s son by his former
                    marriage, without any heiι∖ the queen’s issue were also’to inherit the rest of
                    the Spanish dominions.</p>
                <p>All these concessions, however, were not sufficient to quiet the apprehensions of
                    the people. They were considered merely as words of course, which might be
                    retracted at pleasure; and the nation murmured loudly against a transaction so
                    dangerous to its ancient liberty and independence. The Duke of Suffolk, a
                    zealous Protestant, attempted to excite his tenants in Warwickshire to revolt;
                    but with little success. His followers were routed by Lord Huntingdon, and he
                    himself was betrayed into the hands of his enemies. An insurrection was also
                    raised by Sir Thomas Wyatt, a Roman Catholic, at the head of four thousand men,
                    who set out from Kent to London, publishing a declaration against the Spanish
                    match and the queen’s evil counsellors. Having advanced as far as Southwark, he
                    required that the queen should put the Tower of London into his hands; that she
                    should <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332963" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2963-0754"/>deliver
                    four counsellors as hostages; and that, in order to ensure the liberty of the
                    nation, she should marry an Englishman. But his force was still by far too
                    inconsiderable to support such magnificent pretensions, although it was
                    afterwards augmented to fifteen thousand men; and he unluckily wasted so much
                    time without attempting any thing of importance, that the popular ferment
                    entirely subsided, his followers gradually abandoned him, and he was at last
                    obliged to surrender himself near Temple-Bar to Sir Maurice Berkeley, who
                    committed him tothe*Tower, where, in a short time, he was joined by the chief of
                    the surviving conspirators. The nohility and gentry immediately repaired to St
                    James’s to congratulate the queen on the suppression of the rebellion. But two
                    were excepted; Courtenay duke of Devonshire, and the young Earl of Worcester,
                    who, on the first approach of the enemy, had turned their horses’ heads and
                    fled. On the 3d of November 1553, Lord Guildford Dudley and Lady Jane Grey had
                    been convicted of high treason. Lady Jane and her husband were both only in
                    their seventeenth year, and no time was fixed upon for their execution; but the
                    revolt of Suffolk, Lady Jane’s father, proved an incentive sufficiently strong
                    to prevail over the slender pity of bigots and politicians, and the sacrifice
                    was consummated.</p>
                <p>On the 8th of February Mary signed a warrant for their execution, and on the 12th
                    of the same month it was put in force. Lord Guildford Dudley had requested an
                    interview with his beloved wife, who, however, declined the meeting, justly
                    fearing that it might unfit them for the dreadful scene through which they were
                    about to pass. She saw him issue through the gate of the Tower to the scaffold;
                    and soon afterwards, in chancing to look from the same window, she saw the
                    bloody carcass, half covered in the vehicle which bore it back from the place
                    where vengeance and injustice, disguised under the name of law, had done their
                    worst. Lqrd Dudley was beheaded on Tower-Hill; but his wife, on account of her
                    royal descent, was spared the ignominy of a public execution. Lady Jane Grey is
                    celebrated as exhibiting a matchless union of beauty with genius, and learning
                    with virtue and piety. She astonished the learned of Europe by her talents and
                    accomplishments, and will be recognised by all posterity as one of the purest
                    and most amiable of historical characters. Were Mary chargeable with no other
                    atrocity than that of putting Lady Jane to death for the crime of a father (for
                    it was on his account that the daughter suffered), it were quite sufficient to
                    cover her memory with irremoveable degradation. “It was a death,” says Sir James
                    Mackintosh, “sufficient to honour and dishonour an age.” Suffolk, her father,
                    perished in the same manner a few days afterwards. Sir Nicholas Throgmorton was
                    tried, but the defence which he made was found so good in law, that the jury
                    acquitted him. Above sixty others of the conspirators were condemned to the
                    block, amongst whom were Lord Thomas Grey the brother of Suffolk, and Wyatt the
                    principal mover of the rebellion.</p>
                <p>This revolt had very nearly proved fatal to the Princess Elizabeth, who for some
                    time had experienced harsh treatment at the hands of her sister. Mary, upon whom
                    the mantle of Henry VIII. had descended, felt antipathy to her on account of the
                    quarrel between their mothers. This circumstance, in the mind of one whose
                    tender mercies were cruel, was sufficient to change the milk of sisterly
                    affection into mortal venom; and a favourable opportunity was only necessary to
                    make her feel its deadly effects. Nearly a month was spent in labouring to
                    extract information against Elizabeth from Wyatt whilst he lay in prison. But
                    the unfortunate gentleman honourably acquitted her, although he might, in all
                    probability, have saved his own life by implicating her in the late rebellion.
                    At Ashridge, whither she had retired to escape the constrained participation in
                    a worship which she disapproved, overtures had been made to her by the chiefs of
                    the revolters; but her acceptance or consent was neither shown nor seriously
                    alleged. Immediately after Wyatt’s discomfiture, she was conducted to London in
                    a very infirm state of health. It was doubted whether she would reach her
                    destination alive; but youth and strength triumphed over the malady with which
                    she was affected. Courtenay earl of Devonshire was also arrested, and committed
                    to the Tower. Two councils were held on the fate of Elizabeth, and the judges
                    were divided in their opinions as to her guilt. Gardiner, although he professed
                    to think Elizabeth deserving of death, yet considered her confinement at
                    Ashridge, and Courtenay’s residence at St James’s, as irreconcilable with a just
                    conviction of treason. The head and front of her offending seems to have been
                    misprision, or concealment of projects of revolt, which was now not a capital
                    crime. It was fortunate for Elizabeth that one of the first measures of her
                    sister, when she ascended the throne, was to sweep away the odious heap of
                    treasons raised up by her father, and the punishment of misprision with death
                    was one of them. But Elizabeth, although absolved from a capital charge, was
                    nevertheless committed to the Tower; and shortly afterwards she was put under
                    the charge of Sir Henry Bedingficld, keeper of Woodstock. During her stay in the
                    Tower, the princess had no other expectation than that of mounting the scaffold
                    which had been trodden long before by her unhappy mother, at her father’s stcm
                    behest, and on which the blood of Lady Jane Grey, the purest of the pure, was
                    scarcely dry. When Bedingfield came with his soldiers to conduct her to
                    Woodstock, she asked, with her usual quickness and poignancy, “Is the scaffold
                    of Lady Janet taken away?” A few days later, Courtenay was transferred from the
                    Tower to Fotheringay Castle.</p>
                <p>The rebellion had suspended for some weeks the proceedings relative to the
                    queen’s marriage. But in the beginning of March the English ambassador returned
                    from the Continent with the ratification of the treaty; and Philip landed at
                    Southampton on the 19th of July 1554, attended by a magnificent train of Spanish
                    grandees and Burgundian lords. The marriage between him and Mary was solemnized
                    by Gardiner in his cathedral at Winchester, before crowds of noblemen from all
                    parts of Christendom, and with a pomp and splendour seldom surpassed. Philip was
                    then in the twenty-ninth year of his age, and Mary in her thirty-eighth year.
                    The countenance and form of the prince were far from being disagreeable; but the
                    stately reserve of his Spanish manners was not calculated to lessen the
                    repugnance of the English people to the union.</p>
                <p>Soon after her marriage, Mary resolved to restore the religious polity of the
                    kingdom to that state in which it had existed at the time of her birth.
                    Accordingly, on the 12th of November a parliament was holden for this purpose,
                    and a bill passed both houses <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">for</hi>
                    the restitution in blood of the Lord Cardinal Pole.” But a difficulty arose
                    regarding the abbey lands; for it was feared that those who possessed them in
                    spite of the indelible claims of the church might be called before the tribunal
                    of the pious cardinal. However, on the 20th of November, Pole arrived at Dover,
                    armed apparently with ample powers to do every thing necessary for the
                    reconciliation of England with the church of Rome; and amongst these was full
                    authority to do with the abbey lands as lie thought fit. Nine days after his
                    arrival, he made an oration to the two houses, exhorting them to return to the
                    bosom of the universal church, at the same time absolving the kingdom from the
                    papal interdict<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332976" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2976-0755"
                    />. The request was formally acceded to, and Pole ' was enabled to announce to
                    the pontiff the success of his mission. In order to quiet the possessors of
                    church property, the legate issued his dispensation, declaring that they should
                    not be molested; and a statute passed confirming his sentence. By another, the
                    acts which had abolished the papal supremacy were repealed. This new restoration
                    of power to the papacy formed a sad and dark augury for the devoted Protestants.
                    It was the first indication that the time approached when the fires of
                    persecution were to blaze forth in every county of England, and when heaven was
                    to be insulted by the profanation of its sacred name as sanctioning the foulest
                    deeds of blood.</p>
                <p>An act was passed by the parliament of 1554 for the revival of the statutes of
                    former sovereigns against heretics, and especially against Lollards; which
                    revival was to take effect from the 20th of January 1555. During the last reign,
                    no Roman Catholic had suffered capital punishment on account of his faith, nor
                    does there appear to have been any kind of jurisdiction or mode of procedure for
                    the trial of heresy, although the law remained in full force agunst anabaptists
                    and anti-trinitarians, whose doctrines were looked upon both by Catholics and
                    Protestants as sapping the very foundations of Christianity. It has been alleged
                    by the opponents of Protestantism, that in <hi rend="italic">The Reformation of
                    Laws,</hi> composed in the latter part of Edward’s reign, there are indications
                    of a preparation for lighting the faggot against the adherents of the ancient
                    religion; and as the point is of some importance, we shall avail ourselves of
                    the following observations by Sir James Mackintosh, which seem to put the matter
                    in its true light. Referring to the allegation that severity against the
                    adherents to Catholicism was about to be put in execution, he says,</p>
                <p>“This statement is chiefly grounded on a text of that projected code, which
                    directs that contumacious and incorrigible heretics, after all other means have
                    been exhausted, shall be at length delivered to the civil magistrate to be
                    punished. It is assumed that the punishment must be death. Yet in the very first
                    article of the code, which relates to atheists and unbelievers in Christianity,
                    death is denounced against them in express words.</p>
                <p>“The admission of it into another article by mere implication is therefore
                    unreasonable. It is too terrible an enactment to be admitted without express
                    words. If punishment is held to be synonymous with capital punishment, by force
                    of this clause death must be applied to all heresies. If it was intended to
                    confer on the civil magistrate a large discretion in the infliction of inferior
                    punishments for the enumerated heresies, the article is perfectly agreeable to
                    the practice of the framers and the opinions of the times. It is incredible that
                    capital punishment could be denounced against the whole of a long series of
                    heresies, of which the catalogue nearly occupies twenty quarto pages, besides
                    what is called a monstrous heap of other errors, less necessary to be specified,
                    as being less prevalent in that age. Even admitting this unreasonable
                    construction of the plan for a reformed code, it affects only the reputation of
                    the projectors. It never was adopted by public authority. It was not laid before
                    parliament. There is no reason to doubt that the Protestant parliament would
                    have altered the very articles in question, if, when they were communicated to
                    that assembly, they could be supposed to establish or countenance a practice
                    perfectly at variance with that of the king and parliament of England in the
                    reign of Edward VI. To hold that a few words in a Latin manuscript, of projected
                    but not adopted laws, not printed till many years afterwards, could have been
                    the incentive of those who kindled the fires of Smithfield under Mary, is one of
                    the most untenable of all positions. Truth and justice require it to be
                    positively pronounced, that Gardiner and Bonner cannot plead the example of
                    Cranmer and Latimer for the bloody persecution which involved in its course the
                    destruction of the Protestant prelates. The anti-trìnitarian and the anabaptist,
                    if they had regained power, might indeed have urged such a mitigation, but the
                    Roman Catholic had not even the odious excuse of retaliation.”</p>
                <p>The year 1555 opened with gloomy forebodings for the reformed clergy; and ere a
                    month had expired, the lowering tempest burst upon them with unexampled
                    fury.</p>
                <p>On the 28th of January a commission, with Gardiner at its head as lord
                    chancellor, assembled in the church of St Mary Overies, in Southwark, for the
                    trial of Protestants. From the station which this individual held, and from his
                    commanding talents, there appears to be little doubt that he was instrumental in
                    pushing forward this bloody work, although some writers have attempted to remove
                    this reproach from his character. Whether he was the main author or not, is a
                    matter of comparatively little importance. As lord chancellor, and as head of
                    the commission, he sanctioned the whole proceedings. He must therefore be held
                    responsible for the deeds of those who acted under his authority, and suffer the
                    lash of posterity, in the same way as Cromwell, on whom Catholic writers have
                    poured out the vials of their wrath, from his having acted as captain of the
                    banditti who plundered the holy places in the reign of the eighth Henry.</p>
                <p>The first martyrs in this persecution were Hooper bishop of Gloucester, and
                    Rogers, a clergyman of Essex, both eminent divines of the reformed cause. They
                    died with feelings of triumphant piety in the midst of suffocating flames; and
                    other victims were rapidly hurried to the stake. The principal were, Archbishop
                    Cranmer, Ridley bjshop of London, and Latimer bishop of Worcester. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cranmer.)</hi> These persecutions soon became odious to the
                    whole nation, and the perpetrators of them were all willing to shift the blame
                    from themselves upon others. Many of the Catholic prelates, to their honour,
                    exercised occasionally an effectual and perhaps hazardous humanity in their
                    favour. Gardiner himself withdrew from this unavailing slaughter, and his place
                    was supplied by Bonner bishop of London, a less scrupulous dealer in blood. Even
                    Philip himself was moved to pity, and discountenanced these diabolical
                    proceedings. To describe the sufferings of those persons of eminence and
                    distinction who perished, would fatigue the patience and harrow the feelings of
                    the reader. For four years the persecution was carried on with unsatiated
                    cruelty; and, keeping out of view those who perished in dungeons under every
                    form of misery, and also those who expatriated themselves, nearly three hundred
                    individuals are calculated to have expired at the stake. We are positively
                    informed by Lord Burghley, that in this number of victims are comprised no less
                    than one hundred women and children. The perpetrators of these “more than
                    heathen cruelties” deserve no quarter from posterity; such deeds as those laid
                    to their charge stamp infamy deep on their names, and hold them up to execration
                    now and for ever.</p>
                <p>The other events of this reign unconnected with religion are, with the exception
                    of the loss of Calais, unimportant. The reduction of this town had cost Edward
                    III. a siege of eleven months, and the English standard had waved over its
                    battlements for above two centuries. It surrendered to the arms of France after
                    a siege of only eight days, and its loss so affected the queen, that when lying
                    on her deathbed she said, “If you open me you will find Calais written on my
                    heart.” Philip, her husband, appears to have treated her with formal but cold
                    respect.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193332989" xml:id="kp-eb0708-2989-0756"/>
                <p>He had succeeded to the greatest monarchy then in the world, and had been some
                    time absent from England in superintending its affairs. He returned again, but
                    his departure a second time left Mary to brood over her fruitless barbarity
                    alone. She had more than once entertained the nation with rumours of her
                    pregnancy, and was herself cheated with the illusive hopes of offspring. But
                    this Shiloh of the ancient faith, like that of a celebrated dreamer of after
                    times, was the manifestation of a deadly disorder. She died of dropsy on the
                    17th of November 1558, to the unspeakable relief of the greater portion of her
                    subjects.</p>
                <p>It is customary to load the name of Queen Mary with every kind of opprobrium. But
                    in estimating human character, care should always be taken to diśtinguish
                    between acts committed under the influence of religious principles, and
                    agreeably to conscience, however erroneous such convictions may be, and those
                    perpetrated from the sheer brutality of passion, or from an instinct of cruelty
                    and bloodshed. That the atrocities of Mary belong to the former class of crimes,
                    we have little hesitation in saying, even with the ease of Lady Jane Grey before
                    us. Her ministers, also, must share with her no inconsiderable portion of the
                    odium which is always associated with her reign, for to their errors or
                    prejudices much of the misery which she caused must be ascribed.</p>
                <p>Although in the private life of Mary there is much to praise, yet her nature was
                    sour and unamiable, and almost destitute of that tenderness which peculiarly
                    distinguishes the female character. Whether or not she was a tyrant like her
                    father, she was at all events pre-eminently fitted for becoming the tool of
                    tyrants. She was not remorseless, for she is reported to have suffered much on
                    account of her conduct towards the Protestants, but unfortunately her conscience
                    never took effect in time.</p>
                <p>After the death of Mary, the Princess Elizabeth succeeded to the throne without
                    opposition. She was at Hatfield when the news of her sister’s death were brought
                    to her, and hastening to London immediately, she was received there with great
                    joy. For the preservation of her life this princess was indebted to Philip, the
                    husband of Mary. The Spaniard was aware that her death would remove the only
                    obstacle which stood between Mary of Scotland and the throne of England. That
                    sovereign had been married to the heir-apparent of France, his great political
                    enemy; and the balance of power which might thus be thrown into the hands of the
                    latter would have endangered the stability of Philip’s throne; a circumstance
                    which induced him ,to this unusual act of liberal humanity. The first measure of
                    Elizabeth was to assemble around her throne a body of counsellors who had
                    recommended themselves to public notice by the power of their talents or the
                    steadiness of their principles. Her state council was composed of both Catholics
                    and Protestants, although her more confidential advisers were confined to a
                    select portion of the latter, and amongst these was Sir William Cecil, whom she
                    appointed her first secretary. Precautionary measures were taken to meet any
                    invasion on the part of France in order to raise Mary Queen of Scots to the
                    throne; for the government of that country had made demonstrations to this
                    effect, by instigating Rome to hostilities against Elizabeth. Mary had left a
                    vacant treasury, and one of the first cares of the new administration was to
                    obtain pecuniary supplies; and, from the high character and popularity of the
                    queen, these were immediately granted by the people. Her coronation was then
                    celebrated with all possible splendour and festivity.</p>
                <p>To establish the Protestant religion was Elizabeth’s most ardent desire. With
                    this view the statutes passed in the late reign for the support of the ancient
                    faith were repealed; and the acts of Henry VIII. in derogation of the papal
                    authority, and of his successor in favour of the ' reformed church, were for the
                    most part revived. There were some deviations in the new book of common prayer
                    from the liturgy of Edward VI., but of these only two are important. The first
                    consists in the omission of a prayer to be freed from the “tyranny of the bishop
                    of Rome and all his detestable enormities;” which certainly displayed a
                    conciliatory spirit towards the Catholic church. The second was an alteration of
                    the language which spoke of the sacrament as being only a remembrance of the
                    death of Christ, and the substitution of words which indicate the real but not
                    corporeal presence. Towards the middle of 1559 the Protestant liturgy was
                    introduced, and the oath of supremacy administered. Strong opposition to it was
                    evinced on the part of the clergy, especially amongst those of a dignified
                    station; and out of sixteen bishops only one took the oath tendered to them. But
                    the lower orders were less scrupulous; and it is probable that in many instances
                    necessity induced them to make a compromise with their consciences. Those of the
                    clergy who refused compliance with the new code of religious doctrines were
                    deposed, and their places supplied by professors of the reformed religion.
                    According to the standard of punishments which followed contumacy in these ages,
                    the treatment of the bishops was mild. Bonner was imprisoned; but he was a man
                    so empurpled with blood as to be odious to all part⅛s. This was the highest
                    degree of suffering to which any of the nonconformists were subjected.</p>
                <p>During the time that the queen and her counsellors were thus settling the
                    religious affairs of the nation, negotiations were carried on between England
                    and France for a peace, which was at last concluded on the following terms, viz.
                    that the French king should restore Calais at the expiration of eight years;
                    that in case of failure, he should pay five hundred thousand crowns, and
                    Elizabeth’s title to Calais should still remain; that for the payment of this
                    sum he should find the security of eight foreign merchants, not natives of
                    France; and that until such security was provided he should deliver five
                    hostages. If during this interval Elizabeth should break the peace with France
                    or Scotland, she was to forfeit all title to Calais; but if the French king was
                    to make war on Elizabeth, he was to be obliged to restore the fortress
                    immediately.</p>
                <p>The reign of Elizabeth for the first eleven years, that is, from the twenty-fifth
                    to the six and thirtieth year of her life, was distinguished for the internal
                    quiet and happiness of the country. During this interval she displayed the very
                    best qualities of a sovereign; firmness, prudehee, vigilance, activity, and
                    foresight. These qualities were tempered with habitual amenity, and a rational
                    piety. By her subjects she was admired, applauded, and imitated; and during this
                    halcyon period her throne· received an accession of strength which enabled it to
                    stand unshaken amid the tumultuous storms with which it was afterwards assailed.
                    .’She was repeatedly advised to engage in a matrimonial alliance, but uniformly
                    declined to do so, declaring her resolution of remaining single for life.
                    Amongst her suitors were various foreign princes, Catholic as well as
                    Protestant; and some of her own subjects even presumed to intrude their offers
                    upon her “maiden meditation,” but without success. During the religious war
                    which raged in France, Elizabeth, ever ardent in the cause of the reformation,
                    assisted the Huguenots with arms and money.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the pretensions of Mary, queen of Scotland, to the crown of
                    England, involved Elizabeth in transactions which have left a stain upon her
                    name. Mary, who was espoused to the dauphin of France, had quartered <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193333002" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3002-0757"/> the arms of
                    England with those of France and Scotland upon her escutcheon; and to this she
                    was advised by the Catholics, who looked upon Elizabeth as a usurper, having
                    been illegitimised in her youth by the cruel mandate of her father at the time
                    when he consigned her mother to the block. The result of this appropriation of
                    the armorial bearings of the English sovereign was a quarrel between the two
                    princes, which only terminated with the execution of the unfortunate queen of
                    Scotland. See the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Mary</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Scotland.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1569 Elizabeth was excommunicated by Pope Pius V. These anathemas, by
                    absolving subjects from the oath and the duty of allegiance, and suspending the
                    offices of religion, and even those of humanity, were sometimes most disastrous
                    to a country, upon which they descended like a deadly epidemic. But the majority
                    of the queen’s subjects were of the same religion with herself, and had thrown
                    off the papal yoke; so that it was in the present instance productive of no
                    other effect than the publication of a severe act against all who held any
                    communication with the bishop of Rome. Severe measures were also taken with the
                    puritans and other dissenters. At this time the English nation was divided into
                    three theological and political parties; the <hi rend="italic">Churchmen,</hi>
                    who considered the ecclesiastical revolution as already perfect; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Puritans,</hi> who sought further reformation by agitating the
                    minds of the people; and the <hi rend="italic">Catholics,</hi> who, supported by
                    the great continental powers, did not yet despair of seating their religion upon
                    the throne. But men of all these persuasions united in their abhorrence of
                    anabaptists; and, in order to extirpate them, the fires of Smithfield were,
                    after an interval of seventeen years, re-kindled. Fox the celebrated
                    martyrologist dared to interfere in behalf of this hated sect; but his
                    courageous humanity obtained for them only a temporary respite. Two men were
                    burned, and numbers were imprisoned or otherwise corporally punished. These
                    events took place about the middle of the year 1575, and this was the first
                    blood spilt by Elizabeth on account of religion; it, however, forms a dark stain
                    upon her government, which may be pronounced mild when compared with others of
                    the same period. The blood of Henry VIII. was not yet sufficiently purified in
                    this its first descent from the fountain-head.</p>
                <p>Amongst the other domestic events connected with the history of England, was that
                    of the rebellion of Percy earl of Northumberland, and Neville earl of
                    Westmoreland. This revolt partook both of a civil and of a religious character,
                    for the noblemen at its head were adherents of the ancient faith, and were
                    encouraged to embark in their lawless enterprise by the Catholic states. But on
                    the approach of the royal troops under Sussex, the insurgents broke up and fled.
                    Northumberland was made prisoner in Scotland, and executed at York; and
                    Westmoreland died in Flanders, in the humble capacity of commandant of a Spanish
                    regiment. Other treasonable transactions originated with the Duke of Norfolk,
                    whose vaulting ambition aspired to the hand of Mary queen of Scots. Indeed he
                    and the two insurgents just named, together with several other nobles, united in
                    a conspiracy against Elizabeth, The timely arrest of Norfolk, however,
                    disconcerted the confederacy, of which the northern rising was merely a
                    premature explosion. Mary of Scotland is positively asserted to have been a
                    participator in the plot. Norfolk was brought to trial; and there seems little
                    doubt that he had incurred the penalties of treason, by having had intercourse
                    with Catholic princes who had undertaken to land in England with a hostile army,
                    and by his clandestine renewal of negotiations for the delivery and espousal of
                    Mary, at that time a prisoner in the hands of Elizabeth. He was condemned to
                    death, and executed, after a great deal of hesitation on the part of the
                    queen.</p>
                <p>England now began to distinguish herself in her natural career of maritime
                    enterprise. Amongst the most distinguished of the nautical adventurers of this
                    age was Sir Francis Drake, whose exploits will be found related under the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Drake.</hi> A vague rumour had for some time
                    pervaded Europe, of vast naval preparations by the king of Spain, for the
                    invasion and conquest of England. In 1587 Sir Francis Drake having been
                    dispatched with a fleet to attack the Spanish ships which lay in the bay of
                    Cadiz, was completely successful in his enterprise, burning and destroying above
                    one hundred vessels laden with ammunition and naval stores. The fruits of his
                    expedition were of vast importance. Philip’s preparations were disturbed, and
                    his project of invasion put off for twelve months, during which period Elizabeth
                    had time to make head against the storm which was gathering in that quarter.
                    These were the obvious results of Drake’s bravery; but who can estimate the
                    moral effect which it had produced? It gave a heroic impulse to the nation, and
                    inspired it with confidence in its ow n strength and resources. It taught
                    English seamen to look without terror upon the towering bulk of the Spanish
                    vessels; whilst the Spaniards themselves must have in a proportional degree lost
                    the confidence of having an advantage over the enemy by means of their floating
                    castles.</p>
                <p>The king of Spain having once more completed his complement of vessels, manned
                    them with the ablest seamen and soldiers, under the command of the most renowned
                    leaders. This Armada was truly imposing and magnificent; it was baptized The
                    Invincible, but not with English blood. Never before had the ocean borne a more
                    splendid fleet than that which sailed from the Tagus on the 25th of May 1588.
                    The ships and their equipments had been fitted out in every port of its king’s
                    dominions. In Flanders, the forest of λVaes had been felled; the dockyards of
                    Antwerp, Dunkirk, Newport, and Gravelines swarmed with artificers; and the
                    rivers and canals were covered with boats adapted for the transport of soldiers
                    destined to serve in the expedition. On the 20th of May the following
                    enumeration of the vessels was made: “The general sum was 130 ships, of 57,868
                    tons; 19,295 soldiers and 8450 mariners, with 2088 slaves, and 2630 great pieces
                    of cannon of all sorts; also .twenty caravals for the service of the others,
                    with ten salvers of six oars a piece.” Towards the end of June another armament
                    of eighty sail left Lisbon to join them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Strype, p. 538-9, from the Spanish book, which rather styled
                    the whole “Felicissima Armada.”</p></note> To meet this overwhelming armament
                    the royal navy of England mustered 181 ships, containing between seventeen and
                    eighteen thousand seamen. There were only eight ships above five hundred tons
                    burden, and the largest was only eleven hundred. The aggregate burden of the
                    whole English fleet amounted to 31,985 tons, being little more than one half of
                    that of the Spaniards. The preparations made on land displayed equal spirit and
                    enthusiasm. A loyal patriotism and active magnanimity pervaded the whole
                    kingdom. The city of London set a noble example. The lord-mayor, in the name of
                    the metropolis, put at the disposal of his sovereign ten thousand soldiers and
                    thirty vessels. The whole nation emulated this wise liberality; and every city,
                    town, and hamlet poured forth its ardent patriots to take their stand upon the
                    coast and repel the insulting invader. About fifty thousand men under the
                    command of Earl Hunsdon, a brave and able general, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193333015" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3015-0758"/>guarded the queen’s person.
                    The Thames at Tilbury was watched by Leicester with a considerable force. Sir
                    Walter Raleigh was stationed at Portland Castle, in Dorsetshire, and the Earl of
                    Sussex at Portsmouth. In the other parts of the country the wisest measures of
                    defensive warfare were adopted. At sea one division of the fleet under Lord
                    Henry Seymour guarded the narrow seas; whilst the main body under Lord Charles
                    Howard, the high admiral, was stationed in the Western Ocean. The gallant Sir
                    Francis Drake and the able navigators Hawkins and Frobisher were in this
                    division.</p>
                <p>Under the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the Spanish Armada set sail for the invasion of
                    England. It was for some time retarded by a tempest, which also harassed the
                    English fleet; and news were brought to the queen of England that Medina’s
                    Armada had been so injured and scattered that the expedition was for the present
                    abandoned. The English ships withdrew to various ports, where they might have
                    been surprised and burned, had not intelligence accidentally arrived that the
                    Spanish fleet was bearing down full sail upon the coast. On the 20th of July the
                    English admirals came in sight of the enemy, and next day the first engagement
                    took place. The plan of Lord Howard was to evade a direct attack; for his
                    vessels being so much inferior in bulk and weight of metal to the enemy’s ships,
                    were incapable of grappling in close action with them; but being superior in
                    mobility and expedition, he resolved to annoy their rear, and to cut off the
                    sluggish sailers. In the first attack neither fleet suffered much. Early in the
                    morning of the 23d the second conflict began, and both fleets fought with
                    valour; but the advantage was at last on the side of the English, over whose
                    smaller vessels the iron shower from the higher sides of the Spanish ships flew
                    harmless, whilst their own took full effect. On the 24th a pause took place in
                    the battle, which was, however, renewed next day; but the mighty armament forced
                    its way unbroken to the vicinity of Calais. They were now prepared to act in
                    concert with the Duke of Parma, who had completed his preparations. He possessed
                    in the harbours of Newport and Dunkirk transports which carried about
                    twenty-eight thousand men, and which waited the general’s command to make the
                    grand attempt.</p>
                <p>The concentration of the Spanish Armada off Calais suggested to the English
                    admiral the idea of employing fireships to destroy it. Eight vessels were
                    thereupon hastily prepared for this purpose, and during the night of the 29th,
                    which was cloudy and boisterous, they were sent down blazing with combustible
                    materials into the heart of the Spanish fleet. A cry of horror burst from the
                    Spaniards, and, seized with an irresistible panic, they cut their cables with
                    the intention of standing out to sea. But in their terror and confusion they
                    inflicted severe injury upon one another; and, to augment their distress, a
                    fierce gale sprung up, which scattered the Armada along the coast from Ostend to
                    Calais. Some struck on the shallows at Flanders, whilst others beat out to sea;
                    the remainder, amounting to about forty sail, were assailed by Drake and the
                    rest of the English fleet. This was the most severe engagement which had yet
                    taken place, and was maintained with great bravery for a whole day. The
                    Spaniards lost several of their best ships; and after vainly endeavouring to
                    regain their position in the narrow strait, where Parma could alone join them,
                    they resolved to return to Spain by making a circuit round Great Britain. The
                    want of ammunition compelled the English to refrain from pursuing the invaders
                    at a time when they might have annihilated them. But this was reserved for an
                    enemy even more formidable than that before which they fled. A storm overtook
                    them on their unfortunate voyage, and the coasts of Scotland and Ireland were
                    strewed with the wrecks of the Invincible Armada, so that only a feeble remnant
                    of that splendid fleet reached the shore from whence it had sailed, in all the
                    pomp and circumstance of war, as if to an assured triumph.</p>
                <p>The events of Elizabeth’s reign which followed the discomfiture of the Spanish
                    attempt to invade England may be briefly related. The Earl of Leicester, who had
                    for a long time maintained an enviable place in the queen’s favour, was invested
                    with fresh honours. A new and unprecedented office was created for him, that of
                    lord lieutenant of England and Ireland, which exalted him to an authority only a
                    little lower than that of sovereignty. But the ink was scarcely dry upon the
                    warrant which wanted but the royal signature to complete the triumph of the
                    favourite, when he was cut off by a violent disease, which, whether it arose
                    from natural causes, or from poison being administered, at all events speedily
                    terminated his career. Of this nobleman little need be said. He is one of a
                    numerous class of historical characters who possess a degree of notoriety, not
                    on account of any brilliant endowments which they themselves possessed, but from
                    their proximity to or connection with distinguished personages. He possessed no
                    intellectual or moral qualities which, deprived of adventitious aid, would have
                    thrown him into the foreground of his country’s history; whilst, if we listen to
                    the opinion of his contemporaries, he must be looked upon as dissolute and
                    unprincipled, notwithstanding his affectation of piety. He is a sateliite only
                    conspicuous from the light which is reflected upon him by his sovereign.</p>
                <p>The English navy, emboldened by its late triumph, now made several very
                    successful descents upon the Spanish coast, not so much for the purpose of
                    obtaining permanent conquest, as of harassing the enemy. These expeditions were
                    conducted by the most able commanders, amongst whom were some of the brightest
                    names in the history of maritime discovery and enterprise, such as those of
                    Raleigh, Drake, Cavendish, Hawkins, and Howard. It was then that the English
                    navy assumed the empire of the sea, which it has ever since maintained with
                    triumphant heroism.</p>
                <p>On the death of Leicester, the young Earl of Essex succeeded him as prime
                    favourite of the queen. But the desire of glory or the hope of plunder induced
                    this volatile young nobleman to join the armament preparing to sail for Spain.
                    The expedition was unfortunate, and when Essex returned to England, he found two
                    rival candidates for royal favour, Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Charles Blount. By
                    the superior influence of these noblemen, the former was driven to cultivate a
                    portion of land which had been granted to him in Ireland; and with the latter
                    Essex fought a duel, in which he was wounded. But by the queen’s command they
                    were reconciled to each other, and in process of time they became sincere and
                    attached friends.</p>
                <p>In the year 1596, a new expedition was fitted out for Spain, which was completely
                    successful. The Spanish fleet was defeated, and lost thirteen men-of-war. Cadiz
                    was taken, and its defences, which rendered the town the strongest fortress in
                    the country, were razed to the ground. This was the severest blow which the king
                    of -Spain received from his daring enemy subsequent to the repulse of the
                    Armada. Matters might have been still worse with him had not dissension sprung
                    up amongst the English commanders, the majority of whom, against the suggestion
                    of Essex, who was one of the leaders, declared for an immediate return to
                    England. The town, with the exception of the churches, was reduced to ashes; and
                    the troops, taking with them the most valuable portion of the plunder,
                    re-embarked, and the fleet returned to Plymouth in less than ten weeks after it
                    had set sail. Essex, on his arrival<pb break="no" facs="nls:193333028"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3028-0759"/> in England, was compelled to appear before the
                    queen in council, and answer to several charges connected with the late
                    enterprise. These charges merely related to pecuniary matters, and the favourite
                    was acquitted; but this was the commencement of numerous subsequent quarrels
                    which he had with his sovereign, none of which are important to history except
                    the last. Having been appointed lord deputy of Ireland, he suddenly left his
                    command in that country and returned to England. He was committed a prisoner,
                    and called upon to account for his extraordinary conduct. The queen, however,
                    was unwilling to carry matters too far against her favourite. He was allowed to
                    go about as a prisoner on parole; but this high-spirited and aspiring nobleman
                    could not remain content with the humiliating circumstances to which he was now
                    reduced. He attempted to excite the city of London to revolt against the queen’s
                    authority; but the rebel was taken prisoner, tried for high treason, condemned,
                    and executed. This proved a severe blow to Elizabeth, who was now tottering upon
                    the brink of the grave. She had been all her life subject to fits of
                    indisposition, which were occasionally violent; but it was not till the
                    beginning of March 1603 that her mortal illness came on. Her mind became
                    depressed with gloomy recollections, especially those connected with the
                    shedding of Essex’s blood; and her nervous melancholy and general decline
                    increased, accompanied by symptoms which indicated a disease of the heart, and
                    by a laboured and convulsive respiration. She was questioned by her confidential
                    advisers as to her successor, and signified her desire that the king of Scotland
                    should succeed to the throne. Her speech soon afterwards failed entirely, and
                    all hope of her recovery vanished. She tranquilly breathed her last, about three
                    hours after midnight, on the 24th of March 1603, in the sixty-seventh year of
                    her age and forty-fifth of her reign.</p>
                <p>In the opinion of her contemporaries, whose judgment has been ratified by
                    posterity, Elizabeth ranks amongst the greatest and the most fortunate of
                    English sove reigns. The domestic tranquillity which signalized her rule during
                    nearly half a century; her triumphant repulse of the Spanish monarch, and the
                    severe retaliation which she inflicted upon that lord of empires; the spirit
                    displayed by her navy in its numerous warlike expeditions by sea, and also by
                    her army on land, are indications of uncommon vigour on the part of the
                    sovereign, and of sagacity on that of her counsellors. She found England
                    comparatively inferior to other nations of Europe, but she left it amongst the
                    proudest and the most powerful. It was during her reign and that of her
                    successor, that the human intellect sprung up at once to full maturity, and
                    produced those works which are the peculiar glory of English literature. Hers
                    was the Augustan age of poetry, the age of Spenser, Shakspeare, and others; and
                    during her reign Bacon began to put forth those gigantic energies of mind which
                    were destined to change the whole aspect of science, and even the condition of
                    man as a civilized being. The human failings ascribed to Elizabeth are,
                    excessive vanity, love of popularity which is part of it, parsimony, and a
                    leaning towards despotism. But those whose interest it has been to vaunt the
                    glory of her sister’s reign, and the purity of her life, have not failed to
                    charge Elizabeth with great personal depravity; yet if we discredit every
                    defamatory story which can be clearly traced to her enemies, the imputations
                    will not have much weight, or attach any grave stigma to her name.<note

                    shedding of which cannot be justified, however it may be palliated by taking
                    into account the circumstances of the times, and the critical situation in which
                    she stood; but in this respect her conduct is almost purity itself compared
                    either with that of her sister or of her father. For an account of the private

                    Climate.</hi></p>
                <p>England, the southern, and by far the most fertile division of Britain,
                    corresponds in latitude with Holland and the north of Germany, extending from
                    50° to 55° 45' N. Its figure is nearly triangular, and its extent of coast is
                    very great, both from being much indented, and from the sea bounding it on all
                    sides except along a width of seventy miles on the Scottish border. The adjacent
                    seas are the German Ocean on the east, St George’s Channel on the west, and the
                    English Channel on the south. No country can be more fortunately situated; its
                    climate is temperate; its extent is sufficient for its political security;
                    whilst its insular position not only presents the greatest capabilities of
                    aggrandisement in a commercial sense, but has, by rendering a great military
                    force unnecessary, in all probability been the chief cause of preventing the
                    executive branch from usurping absolute power, as in the countries of the
                    Continent,</p>
                <p>Its superficial extent had long been a question of considerable doubt, and the
                    different estimates varied no less than ten millions of acres. Mr Pitt, on the
                    authority of Arthur Young, assumed, in 1798, the superficial extent of England
                    and Wales to be nearly 47,000,000 of acres; a later calculation by Dr Becke,
                    approaching more to accuracy than any. preceding one, fixed it at 38,500,000
                    acres;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Observations on
                    the Produce of the Income Tax, &amp;c. 1800.</p></note> but, according to
                    Arrowsmith’s map, which, as it is principally founded on the trigonometrical
                    survey, cannot involve any material error, the area of England and Wales amounts
                    to 57,960 square miles of 69∙15 to the degree, or to 37,094,400 imperial acres.
                    This is the measure that is now adopted in all the parliamentary reports.</p>
                <p>England is, in general, a level country. In the north, F Westmoreland, and a
                    considerable part of Cumberland, c&lt; Lancashire, and Yorkshire, are
                    mountainous; but most of the other counties present a succession rather of
                    picturesque eminences than of great elevations, forming a striking contrast to
                    the barren ridges of the northern part of the island, and still more to the
                    abrupt and awful scenery of Switzerland or the south of Germany. The highest
                    mountains of England are in the north-west, where there are several exceeding
                    3000 feet in height; of these, the most noted, if not the highest, is Skiddaw.
                    Between Lancashire<pb break="no" facs="nls:193333041"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3041-0760"/> and Yorkshire there is a range of nearly equal
                    altitude; in Shropshire there are various hills; also in Somerset, Devon, and
                    Cornwall, none of which, however, reaches the height of2000 feet. There is a
                    long hilly range which traverses the southern counties, in a line nearly due
                    east and west from Dorsetshire to Kent; and another that stretches in a
                    north-east direction from Wiltshire to the East Riding of Yorkshire; but both
                    are of inconsiderable elevation. The traveller who proceeds northward from
                    London to York meets very few hills, and hardly one mountain, in a distance of
                    200 miles. To the east of this road, the country, particularly Cambridgeshire,
                    Lincolnshire, and part of the East Riding of Yorkshire, is almost entirely
                    level, and bears a great resemblance to Holland; consisting of fens apparently
                    gained in a very remote age from the sea. In Wales the face of the country is
                    altogether different, being mountainous throughout, and some of the hills, in
                    particular Snowdon and Cader Idris, attaining a height nearly 3600 feet above
                    the level of the sea.</p>
                <p>The sea-coast of England presents a very different aspect in different
                    situations; in some quarters, as in Cornwall, Kent, part of Norfolk, and Wales,
                    it is steep and elevated; in other parts it is low, sandy, or marshy;
                    exhibiting, on the whole, a variety which hardly admits of being brought under a
                    uniform description, and which, though partaking much more of a level than
                    rugged character, still differs greatly from the opposite shore of Flanders,
                    Holland, and Friesland, which is one continued flat for more than 300 miles.</p>
                <p>Of the rivers of England, the largest are the Thames, the Severn, and the Trent.
                    The Thames has no pretensions to romantic effect in any part of its course, nor
                    is its body of fresh water large; but it is navigable for more than 120 miles,
                    and, in the approach to London from the Ncre, presents to the admiring spectator
                    a prospect which, whether we consider the quantity of shipping, the thickening
                    population, or the high state of improvement of its banks, is wholly without
                    parallel. The Severn, though not equal to the Tay in quantity of fresh water, is
                    superior to the Thames, and during the first part of its course preserves the
                    characteristics of a mountain stream, being clear, and at times bordered by
                    picturesque scenery; but on leaving Wales, and entering a more level country, it
                    assumes a different aspect, and becomes a full slow-flowing river, admitting of
                    easy navigation, and facilitating greatly the commerce of Shropshire,
                    Worcestershire, and Gloucestershire. Towards its mouth it receives the Wye, a
                    large navigable river from Wales. The Trent rises in Staffordshire, and after a
                    course, often tortuous, but generally in a north-east direction, falls into the
                    Humber, which soon after becomes a broad estuary. The Mersey, as a river, is of
                    no great importance, but as an arm of the sea it affords, from the west, a very
                    capacious inlet to the trade of Liverpool, and facilitates the conveyance of the
                    produce of the interior. The Tyne is a large stream, having Newcastle on its
                    banks, and Shields near its mouth. The Medway, as a fresh-water river, is small
                    and sluggish, but acquires, by the influx of the tide, such a depth of water at
                    Chatham as to adapt it to the reception of the largest men of war. Speaking
                    generally, it is only the rivers of Wales, Westmoreland, Cumberland, and a few
                    mountainous districts, that are rapid or transparent; the great majority of
                    English rivers, particularly in the eastern and central part of the kingdom, are
                    slow in their course, and owe the degree of beauty which they possess, less to
                    the effect of the water or scenery, than to the high cultivation and elegant
                    disposition of the adjacent grounds.</p>
                <p>A similar remark applies to the lakes of England. Nothing can exceed the beauty
                    of Winandermere, Keswick, and Ulleswater; whilst the unvaried and uninteresting
                    collections of water, such as Whittleseameer, and others in the fen district,
                    are to be compared only to those in North Holland or Friesland. In regard to
                    wood, England is very well provided, without having many of those extensive
                    forests which are met with on the Continent upon great mountain ranges, such as
                    on the Jura ridge between France and Switzerland, and the Suabian Alps upon the
                    Upper Rhine. It is in private plantations of limited extent, but of very
                    frequent occurrence, and sometimes oř great beauty, that the chief stock of
                    English timber is to be found. Several very extensive tracts, such as the New
                    Forest in Hampshire, the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, and Sherwood in
                    Nottinghamshire, belong to the crown.</p>
                <p>The soil of England is suited to a great variety of products; but it has not the
                    exuberant fertility of southern climates, much labour and vigilance being
                    requisite to obtain from it a grateful return. The quantity of moisture makes it
                    admirably adapted for pasture; a characteristic which does not particularly
                    strike those whose travels have never extended beyond their own country, but is
                    of the highest importance in the view of those who have visited the Continent,
                    and have witnessed the parched and arid state of the richest plains in the
                    months of autumn. In regard to husbandry, it happens, by a singular coincidence,
                    that in England, as in Scotland, the best is practised in the east part of the
                    island, particularly in Norfolk and Northumberland. As to mineral treasures, the
                    eastern counties of England, to the south of Yorkshire, are remarkable for
                    containing no mines either of coal or of metal: these valuable deposits are to
                    be sought in the more uneven districts of the north and west, viz. in
                    Northumberland, Durham, Westmoreland, Lancashire, Shropshire, Worcestershire,
                    Devon, and Cornwall, in Wales, and in the midland counties of Warwick, Stafford,
                    and Derby. In the east, particularly in Lincoln and Cambridgeshire, vast
                    improvements have been made in the present age by draining; but there are still
                    the means of making further and valuable acquisitions. Much also remains to be
                    done in bringing into culture extensive heaths and moorlands in almost every
                    county in the kingdom. The soil of these is in general poor, but the tillage
                    required would seldom be obstructed, as in many parts of Scotland, by the
                    ruggedness of the surface. Comparing the soil of England with that of the
                    adjacent countries, we find it greatly superior to that of Scotland, except
                    along our eastern coast; it is perhaps better also than that of Ireland, fertile
                    as the latter naturally is; nor needs it, on the whole, dread a comparison even
                    with the soil of France, where, amidst districts of great beauty and luxuriance,
                    the eye of the traveller is often struck with extensive tracts of heath or
                    marsh.</p>
                <p>The following table exhibits the area of each county in England and Wales, in

                <p>This table, originally given in the Report of the Committee of the House of
                    Commons on Emigration, was compiled by Mr Coaling, civil engineer. It can of
                    course only be regarded as an approximation; but as Mr Couling has bestowed
                    great attention to the subject, we do not suppose that it involves any material

                <p>The climate of England is that or an insular country of limited extent, subject
                    in consequence to rain, and exempt from intensity of either heat or cold.
                    Compared with the adjacent countries, it is less humid than Ireland, which, like
                    Portugal, in a different latitude, is the first land to intercept the vapours of
                    the Atlantic; but, on the other hand, the climate of England is less dry than
                    the opposite shores of Holland and Germany, to which every wind but the west
                    arrives across a tract of continent. The climate of the south of England
                    resembles much that of the opposite coast of Brittany, Normandy, and Flanders;
                    whilst that of the north is very similar to the temperature of Denmark, which,
                    like the north of England, is a narrow country inclosed on either side by the
                    sea. In regard to the relative degrees of heat or cold, if England have not so
                    much summer warmth as continental countries on the same parallel, she generally
                    escapes in winter that intensity of frost, which in less than forty-eight hours
                    of easterly wind so frequently seals up their harbours. On the other hand, our
                    weather is much more variable than in the inland part of the Continent, and our
                    sky is less clear; still it by no means follows that the balance of disadvantage
                    is on our side. The moderate heat and frequent returns of rain preserve
                    throughout the year that verdant pasture which in autumn the Continent enjoys
                    only in its maritime districts; whilst those droughts in spring, which are so
                    noxious in the south of France and in similar latitudes of the Continent, are
                    hardly known among us. In point of salubrity, also, we may fairly stand a
                    comparison with our neighbours; for, variable as is our atmosphere, no country
                    perhaps exhibits a larger proportion of examples of longevity.</p>
                <p>There exists, however, a considerable difference in the climate of different
                    parts of England. The west, exposed to the Atlantic, and containing hills and
                    mountains which intercept the clouds, is much more rainy than the east, where
                    the aspect of the country is level, and the expanse of adjacent water much less
                    considerable. Another and equally remarkable difference arises from latitude,
                    the season being a fortnight or three weeks later in the north than in the south
                    of England. Notwithstanding all the skill of the Northumbrian farmers, the
                    traveller who leaves the harvest finished in the south of England in the first
                    week of September, and who sees the corn cut, if not carried, in the midland
                    counties, will generally find it, in the middle of that month, untouched and
                    standing in most parts of the country to the northward of York. In winter this
                    difference in the temperature of the north and south of England is less
                    perceptible. As to the spring months, March is proverbially raw and cold, from
                    the prevalence of easterly winds, particularly in that part of the kingdom
                    adjacent to the German Ocean. April is in general wet and favourable to
                    vegetation; but May, though a pleasant month, can hardly be said with us to
                    bring more “indulgent skies.” It is in June, July, and August, that our climate
                    assumes a more settled aspect; whilst, at the same time, the power of taking
                    exercise on almost any day is indicative of a very gratifying advantage over the
                    sultry atmosphere of our southern neighbours on the Continent. November, though
                    frequently wet and foggy, is only a prelude to winter; even December does not
                    often bring intense frost, which is commonly reserved for January; and during
                    the last twenty years we have been repeatedly without any frost of consequence,
                    or heavy falls of snow, until a considerable time after the days had
                    lengthened.</p>
                <p>During the six winter months from October to March, the mean temperature of the
                    central part of England is commonly between 42° and 43° of Fahrenheit. In
                    December, January, and February, it is generally below 40°; in July and August
                    62° to 65°. The variations of temperature within the space of twenty-four hours
                    are felt most strongly in the equinoctial months, March and September. In these
                    there is often a difference of 18° or 20° between the day and the night, whilst
                    in the summer months this difference seldom exceeds 12° or 15°, and in December
                    or January is only from 6° to 8°. The mean annual temperature, noon and night,
                    of the central part of England, is about 50°. The greatest summer heat seldom
                    exceeds 80°, and the cold of December or January is rarely below 20° or 25°. In
                    mild situations in Devonshire and Cornwall, the winter temperature is 2°, 3°,
                    4°, and even 5° higher than in London. Penzance is the spot in England least
                    visited by severe cold; and it is consequently much recommended in pulmonary
                    cases.</p>
                <p>Of rain, the largest proportion falls in the north-west of England, particularly
                    in Westmoreland and Lancashire, owing to the neighbourhood of the sea and the
                    height of the mountains. There the average quantity is found to be forty-five,
                    fifty, and, in some situations, sixty inches, whilst the average of the kingdom
                    at large is from thirty to forty inches.</p>
                <p>The prevalent winds in England are west and southwest. Our outward-bound
                    merchantmen are often detained, from the want of a northerly or easterly wind;
                    but it rarely happens that our homeward bound are kept beating in the channel by
                    the want of a westerly breeze. In these respects, also, the case is the same on
                    the opposite shores of the Continent; the Dutch and French outward-bound vessels
                    often experiencing detention from the continuance of westerly winds.</p>
                <p>II.— <hi rend="italic">Divisions,</hi><hi rend="italic">Civil and
                    Ecclesiastical.</hi></p>
                <p>The civil divisions of England are those of counties, hundreds, and parishes. The
                    county divisions, like several of our national improvements, date from the reign
                    of Alfred, and, though subsequently increased by the acquisition of the three
                    northern counties from the Scotch, have not, in other respects, experienced much
                    alteration since his time.</p>
                <p>The twelve counties of Wales added to the forty counties of England, make a total
                    of fifty-two. The name of “county corporate” is given to most of the cities of
                    England, and to some of the towns; and this distinction, little attended to by
                    the public, and seldom mentioned but in law papers, implies that the district in
                    question is governed by its own sheriffs and other magistrates, to the exclusion
                    of the officers of the county at large.</p>
                <p>The division into hundreds must have originated in reference to the existing
                    population, and consequently implied a district containing either a hundred
                    able-bodied men or a hundred families. As population increased very differently
                    in different situations, great inequality ensued in regard to these divisions;
                    and, in the reign of Henry VIII., many of the larger hundreds were partitioned
                    into smaller districts. Hundreds were further subdivided in the time of Alfred
                    into tithings, or associations of ten men, for the purpose of mutual defence.
                    But both these subdivisions were unknown in the northern counties, from their
                    not having been subject to the Saxon legislator: the latter, on their subsequent
                    annexation to the crown of England, were divided into “wards” and “wapentakes;”
                    terms sufficiently expressive of the warlike character of the age, and of the
                    exposed situation of a frontier province.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical division of England is into two archbishoprics and twenty-four
                    bishoprics. The archbishopric or “province” of York, though by much the smaller
                    of the two, comprises Northumberland, Durham, Westmoreland, Cumberland,
                    Cheshire, Lancashire, the chief <pb break="no" facs="nls:193333080"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3080-0763"/>part of Yorkshire, and the Isle of Man; and
                    Canterbury extends over all the rest of the kingdom, including even Jersey and
                    Guernsey. 7 The bishoprics are very different in extent of jurisdiction, as well
                    as in annual emolument. The third and most familiar of the ecclesiastical
                    divisions of England is into parishes. This mode of division seems to have
                    existed from a very remote period, and to have continued during the last five
                    centuries on the same footing, with very slight variation, as at present. The
                    total number of parishes in England and Wales is 10,674.</p>
                <p>HI.— <hi rend="italic">Harbours, Roads, Canals, Bridges.</hi></p>
                <p>Portsmouth, Milford Haven, and Plymouth, are the finest harbours in England, and
                    arc surpassed by few if any in the world. Of these, Portsmouth is entitled to
                    the pre-eminence. This noble harbour is about as wide at its mouth as the Thames
                    is ’ *at Westminster Bridge, expanding within into a capacious basin, almost
                    sufficient to contain the whole navy of Great Britain. Its entrance is
                    unobstructed by any bar or shallow; and it has throughout water adequate to
                    float the largest man-of-war at the lowest tides. The anchorage ground is
                    excellent, and it is entirely free from sunken rocks, sand-banks, or any similar
                    obstructions. The western side of the harbour is formed by the island of
                    Portsea; and on its south-western extremity, at the entrance to the harbour, is
                    situated the town of Portsmouth, and its large and important suburb of Portsea.
                    Here are docks and other establishments for the building, repair, and outfit of
                    ships of war, constructed upon a very large scale, and furnished with every
                    conveniency.</p>
                <p>Portsmouth harbour has the additional and important advantage of opening into the
                    celebrated road of Spithead, lying between the Hampshire coast and the Isle of
                    Wight, and forming a safe and convenient retreat for the largest fleets.</p>
                <p>Milford Haven deeply indents the southern part of Pembrokeshire. It is of great
                    extent, and has within it many bays, creeks, and roads. The water is deep and
                    the anchorage ground excellent; and being completely landlocked, ships lie as
                    safely in it as if they were in dock.</p>
                <p>Plymouth, which,after Portsmouth, is the principal naval depot of England, has an
                    admirable double harbour. The roadstead in Plymouth Sound has recently been much
                    improved by the construction, at a vast expense, of a stupendous breakwater more
                    than 1700 yards in length. This bulwark protects the ships lying inside from the
                    effects of the heavy swell thrown into the Sound by southerly and south-easterly
                    winds.</p>
                <p>London stands at the head of the river ports of Great Britain. Considering the
                    limited course of the Thames, there is probably no river that is navigable for
                    large ships to so great a distance from the sea, or whose mouth is less
                    obstructed by banks. London is mainly indebted for the unrivalled magnitude of
                    her commerce to her favourable situation on this noble river; which not only
                    gives her all the advantages of an excellent port, accessible at all times to
                    the largest ships, but renders her the emporium of the extensive, rich, and
                    populous country comprised in the basin of the Thames.</p>
                <p>The Mersey, now the second commercial river in the empire, is more incommoded
                    with banks than the Thames, and is in all respects inferior, as a channel of
                    navigation, to the latter. Still, however, it gives to Liverpool very great
                    advantages; and the new channel which has recently been discovered in the banks
                    promises to be of much importance in facilitating the access to and from the
                    port.</p>
                <p>Bristol and Hull are both river ports. Owing to the extraordinary rise of the
                    tide in the Bristol Channel, the former is accessible even to the largest ships.
                    The Humber is a good deal impeded by banks; but it also is navigable as far as
                    Hull by very large vessels. The Tyne admits vessels of very considerable burden
                    as far as Newcastle, which, next to ’London, is the most important shipping port
                    in the empire.</p>
                <p>It was not until after 1660 that the public took an active part in r¢gard to the
                    highways. Turnpikes were at that time placed on the great North Road, in the
                    counties of Hertford, Huntingdon, and Cambridge; but it was not till after the
                    peace of 1748 that adequate exertions were made to redeem our public roads from
                    their wretched condition. After 1760 the increasing price of agricultural
                    produce, and the general spirit of improvement, had the most beneficial
                    operation in this respect; and in the fourteen years from that time to 1774, no
                    less than 452 acts were passed for the amelioration of our roads. It was then
                    also that our inland navigation assumed an aspect of activity. The Bridgewater
                    and Trent Canals were commenced; yet the number of canal acts which passed
                    between 1760 and 1774 was only nineteen. The American "war interfered
                    considerably with public improvement; and it is only from the date of its
                    cessation that we enter upon an active and prosperous era.</p>
                <p>The total length of paved streets and paved roads in England and Wales may be
                    taken, according to a parliamentary return in 1818, at about 20,000 miles; the
                    total length of all other roads at nearly 96,000 miles. In France the highways
                    are under the care of government, and are kept in repair out of the general
                    taxes, without any tolls or turnpike dues; in England they are managed by the
                    respective counties, represented by commissioners, and no part of the expense
                    comes out of the public treasury. It is defrayed partly by local imposts, partly
                    by dues levied; and the local impost is discharged either by labour or by
                    composition money, thus:</p>
                <p>The value of labour in kind (on an average of the years ending October 1812,
                    1813, and</p>
                <p>1814) was L.535,423</p>
                <p>The average amount of composition money 278,506</p>
                <p>The average amount of dues or rents levied 601,954</p>
                <p>Annual average of the expenditure on the roads of England and Wales
                    L.1,415,883</p>
                <p>being at the rate of nearly L.12. 6s. 8d. per mile. In the Highlands of Scotland,
                    where the travelling is so much less, one third of this allowance is sufficient
                    for the annual repair of the roads.</p>
                <p>The canals of England are extremely numerous; in fact, no country except Holland
                    can enter into competition with us in this respect. Amongst the principal are
                    the Grand Junction, advancing from London above 100 miles into the midland
                    counties; the Grand Trunk, extending from the Severn northward into
                    Staffordshire, a distance of 139 miles; the Liverpool and Leeds, extending 130
                    miles; the Oxford, ninety-one miles. To proceed with the enumeration would be
                    almost endless; suffice it to observe, that the English canals are of moderate
                    size, being from twenty-five to thirty, thirty-five, and forty feet in width,
                    and, in general, from five to six feet in depth; the barges navigating them are
                    very long, frequently seventy or eighty feet, on a width of ten, twelve, or
                    fourteen feet; but in many cases their dimensions, at least their width, are
                    necessarily smaller, the less frequented canals being narrower than those we
                    have mentioned. Could the application of steam to navigation have been foreseen,
                    the canals of England would probably have been made wider. For full details with
                    respect to the canals of England, and the recent improvements in their
                    construction, and in travelling by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193333093"

                <p>The principal bridges in the kingdom are the six erected across the Thames at
                    London, three of which have been opened since 1817. Of these, two, the Southwark
                    and Vauxhall, arc of cast iron, the one being of three very large arches, and
                    the other of nine arches, each of seventy-eight feet span. The first example of
                    an iron bridge on a large scale, either in England or any other, country, was
                    that erected in 1796 at Wearmouth in Durham, the span of which was 240 feet. In
                    the same year was finished at Build was, near Colebrook Dale, over the Severn,
                    an iron bridge of 130 feet in span. See article <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>IV.— <hi rend="italic">Agriculture.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the state of English agriculture in former ages we can form some idea from a
                    reference to the acts of the legislature. In these we find, at a very early
                    date, the traces of that policy which expects abundance and cheapness to result
                    from discouraging the exportation of corn. No permission to export seems to have
                    been granted till 1394, and then only on the payment of certain duties; in 1436
                    some additional latitude was given, and exportation was allowed when the quarter
                    of wheat did not exceed a price corresponding to nearly 13s. of our present
                    money. The reign of Elizabeth was the epoch of a great rise in the prices of
                    ċorn, originating, not, as was vulgarly asserted, in the “decay of tillage,” but
                    in the sudden depreciation of money, produced (as has been explained in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Corn Laws)</hi> partly by degradation of the coin,
                    and partly by the influx of silver from the mines of America. The complaints of
                    the “decay of tillage,” if they express any thing more than the ordinary
                    discontent of the ignorant part of the consumers, are to be accounted for by the
                    gradual consolidation of small farms, and by inclosing land for pasture, with a
                    view to the exportation of wool. In these days, however, government participated
                    in the prejudices of the people; and the general purport of the acts passed
                    under Elizabeth and her successors was to shackle exportation and prevent a rise
                    of price. It was not till the reign of Charles II. (1670) that the exportation
                    of corn was exempted from taxation; and it is from 1689 that we are to date that
                    fundamental change in our corn laws which encouraged exportation by a
                    bounty.</p>
                <p>Clover, turnips, and potatoes were introduced into England in the seventeenth
                    century. In the <hi rend="italic">improver Improved,</hi> published by Blythe in
                    1649, we find the first traces of what maybe termed the modern system of
                    husbandry; that is, of a rotation of crops, and of the occasional substitution
                    of green for culmiferous crops. But the practice, though thus early introduced,
                    and though it lies at the foundation of all good husbandry, made but little
                    progress for a very long period. The writings and the example of the famous
                    Jethro Tull, in the early part of last century, notwithstanding he carried his
                    theory to an excess, did much to introduce the practice of drilling, and had a
                    very favourable influence on agriculture. Nothing, however, did half so much to
                    accelerate the march of improvement, as the wonderful increase of manufactures
                    and commerce, and consequently of the town population, subsequently to the peace
                    of Paris in 1763. The greater number, and still more the improved circumstances,
                    of the people, occasioned, in particular, a very great increase in the demand
                    for butchers’ meat. And it is to this circumstance that we are mainly indebted
                    for the extraordinary improvements which have been made during the last sixty or
                    seventy years in stock husbandry. But the indirect influence of the augmented
                    demand for butchers’ meat has been equally conspicuous, and has proved of the
                    utmost advantage to arable husbandry, inasmuch as it caused a corresponding
                    increase in the demand for green food, that is, for turnips, clover, &amp;c.
                    This did incomparably more than anything else to introduce that intermixture of
                    green and culmiferous crops which is so essential to good husbandry; and it was
                    the real cause of the greatest of all agricultural improvements, namely, the
                    substitution of turnips for fallows on all light lands. This has increased the
                    productive power of the soil in a degree not easy to be conceived; and, coupled
                    with the frequent substitution of beaus for naked fallows on stiff clay lands,
                    has in all probability more than doubled the available raw produce of the
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>For a lengthened series of years England exported large quantities of corn. But
                    notwithstanding the vast additions made to the supplies of corn by the
                    improvements alluded to, the still greater increase of wealth and population,
                    after occasioning, first a diminution, and next a cessation of exportation, has
                    for many years past made the balance incline on the side of importation. It has
                    been supposed by some that this change was owing to the alterations effected in
                    the laws with respect to the importation of corn in 1772; but we have elsewhere
                    shown that there is no room or ground for any such opinion. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Corn Laws and Corn Trade.)</hi> There cannot, indeed, be the
                    shadow of a doubt that our having changed from being an exporting to an
                    importing country, is entirely owing to the demand having shot a head of the
                    supply, in despite of the wonderful increase of the latter. If doubt should
                    remain in the mind of any one as to this being the real cause of the change, it
                    would be removed by attending to the progress of the inclosure bills. The first
                    act for effecting an inclosure was passed in the reign of Charles II. Since the

                <p>In Queen Anne’s reign 2 1,439</p>

                <p>In George IH.’s reign to 1797...1532 2,804,197</p>
                <p>According to this statement, taken from the report of the committee on waste
                    lands, it appears that each inclosure act passed during that period of the reign
                    of George III. which terminated with 1797, inclosed at an average 1830 acres.
                    Now it appears from the official returns, that from 1798 to 1833 both inclusive,
                    2103 inclosure acts had been passed; and supposing each to have inclosed, as
                    before, 1830 acres, the total would amount to 3,848,490 acres, making, when
                    added to the quantity inclosed previously to 1798, an aggregate of no less than
                    6,652,687 acres inclosed since 1760. But as it seems probable that the earlier
                    acts would apply to a larger extent of land than the later ones, we may perhaps
                    estimate the total extent of land inclosed and divided by act of parliament from
                    1760 to 1833 at from 5,500,000 to 5,800,000 acres. And it may be safely
                    affirmed, that in consequence of its inclosure, the produce of this immense
                    extent of land has been increased at least from <hi rend="italic">four to
                    fix</hi> fold.</p>
                <p>As might be expected, a decidedly greater number of inclosure acts were passed in
                    1802, and during the five years ending with 1814, when prices were enormously
                    high, than in any other equal period of time.</p>

                <p>The principal crops cultivated in England and Wales are wheat, oats and beans,
                    barley and rye, turnips and potatoes, with clover, hops, flax, &amp;c. It is to
                    be regretted that no estimate has been formed on which much reliance can be
                    placed, either of the extent of land under different' crops, or of the average
                    product per acre. Mr Middleton, in his <hi rend="italic">Survey of
                    Middlesex</hi> (vol. ii. p. 640), estimated the whole land under tillage in
                    England and Wales at' 12,000,000 acres; and Mr Comber, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Treatise on National Subsistence</hi> (p. 52), estimated it at 11,591,000
                    acres. We incline to think that these estimates are not very wide of the mark as
                    to the number of acres; but in both, the extent of land under wheat seems to be
                    materially underrated, whilst that under fallow seems to be equally exaggerated.
                    The following may, we believe, be regarded as a pretty fair estimate of the
                    extent of land under the different species of crops, and in fallow, in England
                    and Wales, on an average of the last half dozen years.</p>

                <p>In 1800 a committee of the House of Lords was appointed to inquire into the
                    causes of the scarcity which then prevailed. Under the directions of this
                    committee the board of agriculture circulated queries, and investigated with
                    considerable minuteness the subject of the average productiveness of the
                    different species of crops in the different countries of Great Britain. The
                    result of these inquiries are given in the appendix to the Report of the
                    Committee; and from these it appears that the average produce of wheat
                    throughout England and Wales may be taken at from two and a half to three
                    quarters (Winchester measure) per acre, barley at four quarters per ditto, oats
                    four and a half, peas two and a half, beans three and a half, and potatoes at
                    250 bushels. We have, however, been assured that the wheat culture has since
                    been so much improved, that making due allowance for the greater quantities
                    produced in the best wheat counties, as Kent and Essex, the average produce may
                    be safely reckoned at three quarters an acre; and taking these results, and the
                    average prices of the last ten or twelve years, we get the quantity and value of
                    the principal crops as follows:</p>

                <p>The oats and beans are here blended together and reckoned at the price of oats;
                    whereas beans are about 10s. a quarter higher. Allowing for this, the two may be
                    worth together L. 17,500 000. The grounds occupied as gardens, hop-plantations,
                    &amp;c. may produce, at an average, about L.15 an acre, or L.2,250,000 a year;
                    making the total value of the different crops raised in England and Wales
                    L.72,475,000.</p>
                <p>Attempts have frequently been made to estimate the expenses attending the
                    cultivation of land at different periods; but we have not seen any statement of
                    the sort on which we should be disposed to place much reliance. A good deal of
                    the expense is of a very fluctuating nature, depending on the prices of grain
                    and stock, the rate of wages, amount of capital employed and interest thereon,
                    rent, public burdens, &amp;c. It may probably be considered.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193333119" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3119-0766"/>
                <p>and taking all things into account, that the expenses of cultivation in England
                    and Wales are at this moment about thirty per cent, higher than in 1792.</p>
                <p>Owing to the improvements in the breed and in the feeding of cattle, the weight
                    of those now annually slaughtered has increased from a third to a half above
                    what it is stated by Dr Davenant to have been at the beginning of last century.
                    Various discordant estimates have been formed of the number of cattle in England
                    and Wales; but the best authorities seem to think that they may amount to
                    4,000,000 or 4,500,000.</p>
                <p>Horses are of course far less numerous than cattle, and are proved by the tax
                    returns not to exceed 1,400,000 or 1,500,000. (See M‘Culloch’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commercial Dictionary,</hi> art. <hi rend="italic">Horses.')</hi></p>
                <p>According to the elaborate tables of Mr Luccock, revised by Mr Hubbard, there
                    appears to be in England and Wales nearly 15,000,000 of short, and rather more
                    than 4,000,000 of long woolled sheep, with about 7,000,000 lambs. The weight and
                    value of the fleece varies very much according to breed, keep, &amp;c. But, at
                    an average, the weight of the fleeces of short-woolìed sheep may be taken at
                    from three to four pounds, and those of the long-woolled at from seven to nine
                    pounds. The total quantity of wool annually produced in England and Wales is
                    estimated by the same gentlemen at 385,000 packs, of 240 pounds each. Merinos
                    were introduced about the beginning of the present century, and were imported in
                    large numbers after our alliance with Spain in 1809. Opinions differ in regard
                    to their utility, the carcass not having answered so well as the fleece.
                    Considerable advantage, however, has been derived from crossing them with our
                    own breeds, and further experience may lead to more beneficial results.</p>
                <p>The great pasturage counties are Leicester, Northampton, Lincoln, and Somerset.
                    Of the counties producing butter and cheese, the principal are Cheshire,
                    Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire. But notwithstanding the immense supplies of
                    these articles produced at home, the demand is such, that at an average we
                    import about 130,000 cwts. a year of foreign butter, and about an equal quantity
                    of cheese, principally from Holland. The average annual importation of Irish
                    butter into England cannot be precisely ascertained; but in 1825 it amounted to
                    425,000 cwts. and may now (1834) be taken at 500,000.</p>
                <p>The produce of grass-lands may be determined in two ways; either by ascertaining
                    the quantity and value of the different articles annually produced, or by taking
                    a general rough average value per acre. The former would be the most
                    satisfactory mode; but the details are too numerous and too loose to admit of
                    their being put forward with much confidence. We believe, however, that the
                    annual value of the various products derived from pasture-land may be estimated,
                    on an average, at about L.3. lθs. an acre; being equivalent, upon 17,000,000
                    acres, to L.59,500,000.</p>
                <p>This sum of L.59,500,000 consists, probably, of the following items :—</p>

                <p>The total annual value of the agricultural produce of England and Wales may,
                    therefore, be estimated at about L. 132,000,000 (L.72,475,000 +
                    L.59,500,000).</p>
                <p>The rent of land in England and Wales is usually estimated at from one fifth to
                    one fourth of the value of the produce, which, taking the latter at
                    L.130,000,000, would give from L.26,000,000 to L.32,500,000, or L.29,250,000 at
                    an average, as the rent of the kingdom. We incline to think that this is pretty
                    near the real amount. In 1810 the rent of England and Wales, as ascertained by
                    the property-tax commissioners, was L.29,500,673; and the general opinion
                    amongst persons well informed as to such matters seems to be, that the rent at
                    present is about equal to the rent in 1810; the rise that took place in the four
                    succeeding years having been balanced by the fall that has taken place
                    since.</p>
                <p>The capital employed in the cultivation and stocking of the land in England
                    cannot be estimated, at the present' prices, at less than from L.6 to L.7 an
                    acre; which, ex-1 eluding waste land, would give a total capital of from
                    L.172,494,000 to L.201,243,000. It appears from the property-tax returns for
                    1810, that the profits made by the occupiers were almost identical with the
                    rent. But it will be observed, that, besides the interest on, or return for, the
                    capital employed in farming, the profits in question included all that the
                    occupiers received on account of their trouble in superintendence, and for the
                    greater part of their own labour and that of their families.</p>
                <p>We have already, in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture,</hi> treated;
                    of the points of superiority in our husbandry over that ofl the Continent;
                    ascribing it to various causes, and to none more than the medium size of our
                    farms, which differ equally from the large unmanageable tracts held by Polish
                    noblemen, and the diminutive occupancies so common amongst the French peasantry,
                    particularly since the Revolution.</p>
                <p>The size of farms in England is greatest in the best cultivated districts, that
                    is, in the counties to the east of the metropolis, viz. Kent, Essex, Suffolk,
                    and Norfolk. Farms are also extensive in Northumberland. In these counties the
                    engagements of farmers are for larger sums than in East Lothian, Berwickshire,
                    or any part of Scotland, rents being frequently from L.800 to L.1200 and L.1500
                    a year. In more retired districts, particularly in Cumberland, Westmoreland, and
                    Wales, the occupancies, whether farmed or held in property, are in general very
                    small; and an average of all the farms of England and Wales would not much
                    exceed L.150 a year.</p>
                <p>Leases in England are, with the exception of particular] districts, granted for
                    seven years only; when the term is longer the case is peculiar, and applies to
                    land which evidently requires very extensive improvement. But by far the largest
                    portion of England is held by tenants at will, or by tenants holding only from
                    year to year. There is in such cases something like an assurance, on the part of
                    the landlord, that the tenant shall not be removed for a certain number of
                    years, or that otherwise the improvements shall be considered and allowed for.
                    When a tenant holds from year to year there is a written agreement, with
                    specified covenants, the tenant being subjected to fines in the event of a
                    deviation from them. Both methods are highly injudicious; and it is in the
                    prevalence of these, more than in the existence of tithes and poor’s rates, that
                    we are to look for the backward state of agriculture in many of our finest
                    counties. No class of men have more liberality than the English landholders; but
                    it would be in vain to expect a tenant to lay out much capital on the
                    improvement of a farm of which his tenure comes to an end in seven years, or may
                    be disturbed by the commission of a trespass or the occurrence of a death.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193333132" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3132-0767"/>
                <p>A tenant so situated loses the habit of reflecting on improvements, and even of
                    carrying into effect those which he is aware would in time be advantageous. If
                    he succeed in saving money, he is much more likely to place it out at interest
                    than to employ it in his own business.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the rent bears a higher proportion to the gross produce than in
                    England, being in general not less .than from one fourth to one third. This is
                    owing not certainly to greater capital, and still less to superior soil, but to
                    an exemption from tithe and poor’s rate, the use of long leases, and partly, and
                    principally, we believe, to greater economy, particularly in the number of and
                    expenditure upon horses. It is in tillage, not in pasturage, that the Scotch
                    farmers lay claim to superiority. On comparing English agriculture with that of
                    the Continent, we find that our chief superiority consists in machinery and in
                    live stock. Thrashing machines are in a manner unknown on the Continent, and all
                    iron manufacture is of inferior quality. In regard to live stock, the countries
                    which approach nearest to us are Jutland, Holstein, Holland, Flanders, and
                    Normandy, all evidently indebted for their extensive pasturages to the vicinity
                    of the sea; in the interior of the Continent, pasturage is, in general, very
                    indifferent. Even in these maritime provinces, the cattle, though frequently
                    large, are not fattened in the same gradual manner as in our grazing counties;
                    and the meat, consequently, is not of equal flavour. In horses the inferiority
                    is more apparent to the eye, and holds both as to size and shape. Flemish horses
                    are large, but heavy; whilst the Norman breed, though capable of much labour, is
                    small in size when compared with the English. Nowhere are horses seen of such
                    bulk and strength as the drays in London. If they are, as is supposed, of
                    foreign origin, they have greatly surpassed the primitive stock, since neither
                    the Netherlands nor Holstein can now match them.</p>
                <p>We cannot close this part of our subject without a few remarks on the connection
                    between the state of our agriculture and the extent of our financial burdens.
                    Those who compare the heavy pressure of our taxes with the lighter burdens of
                    our continental neighbours, have in general the satisfaction of finding some
                    counterpoise in the superior dexterity of our people, and the productiveness of
                    our capital. This holds true in regard to our navigators, our merchants, and our
                    manufacturers; and it holds in agriculture in regard to grazing, because in
                    grazing little personal labour is requisite, whilst capital and active habits of
                    business are of the most beneficial operation. But, in the department of
                    tillage, much remains to be done ere England can claim any great superiority.
                    Farms are yet too small in more than two thirds of England, and leases are
                    generally too short. The course of husbandry is frequently injudicious, the
                    ploughs are on a bad construction, and there exists a gross misapplication of
                    animal strength. However light the soil, and however strong the horses, it is
                    still customary to put three, four, and frequently five, in a plough, throughout
                    almost all the west and south-west counties. These are the main causes of the
                    comparative unproductiveness of our finest counties, and of our being obliged to
                    pay so heavy a premium in the shape of corn laws to support our agriculture.
                    Without the corn laws, our lower classes would be supported on nearly the same
                    terms as their continental neighbours; and there would be no occasion, with all
                    our taxes, to dread the competition of foreigners in almost any branch of
                    industry; but if the manufacturers of England are obliged to pay for their
                    support thirty per cent, more than those of France and Germany, whilst their
                    wages are very little higher, what other prospect have we than that of
                    increasing emigration and the augmentation of the poor’s rates?</p>
                <p>The quantity of land still remaining uncultivated in the shape of wastes and
                    commons is a frequent topic of animadversion; persons unacquainted with
                    agricultural calculation calling loudly for this island being brought into
                    culture, whilst the landed interest object to passing a general inclosure act,
                    or, in other words, to giving unlimited scope to speculative cultivation. We by
                    no means participate in the apprehensions of the latter; but we would abstain
                    from giving any artificial stimulus to this, more than to any other branch of
                    industry. Let the progress of inclosure be regulated by the gradual increase of
                    our population, and the discovery of better methods of turning such land to
                    account. No benefit can be derived from applying to this purpose any more
                    capital than would go to it voluntarily; and every experienced farmer is aware,
                    that the best prospect of profit lies, not in reclaiming new soils, but in
                    bestowing further labour and expense upon the land already under culture.</p>

                <p>In regard to minerals, England does not yield to any country in Europe in natural
                    abundance, and takes the lead of all in the extent to which these rude treasures
                    have been converted to purposes of utility. Our great superiority lies in our
                    coal-mines, which are not only more productive, but much more advantageously
                    situated, than those of the Continent. To the mines along the coast a ready
                    conveyance is afforded by our insular position, and to those in the interior by
                    our inland navigation. The consumption of coal in England for domestic use has
                    been estimated at 20,000,000 tons annually. Large as this quantity is, and
                    larger as it must be when we add to it the vast consumption of manufactories,
                    such as ironworks, copper-works, salt-works, glass-houses, and the like, there
                    is no reason to apprehend the exhaustion of this precious mineral; the depth of
                    the coal beds being very great, and the extent of ground containing them
                    amounting to many hundred thousand acres. The principal coal-beds lie in
                    Northumberland, Durham, Derbyshire, Staffordshire, and Glamorganshire. The ports
                    for shipping coal in large quantities are Newcastle, Sunderland, Swansea, and
                    Whitehaven. The motive of the tax on coal exported to foreign countries is thus
                    neither an apprehension of eventual scarcity, nor even a calculation of revenue,
                    so much as a dread of giving our continental neighbours the means of rivalling
                    our manufactures. Coal is not wanting in France and Germany, but the mines are
                    at a distance from water carriage, and as yet very imperfectly wrought ∙ whilst
                    for the purpose of domestic fuel the inhabitants give a preference to wood.</p>
                <p>A material advantage was conferred on the coal trade, and on all the southern
                    parts of the empire, by the late abolition of the tax of six shillings a
                    chaldron on all seaborne coal. Mr M‘Culloch, founding upon the calculations of
                    Mr Ruddle and other eminent practical authorities, estimates the total number of
                    persons engaged in the coal trade at from 160,000 to 180,000. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(^Commercial Dictionary,</hi> art. <hi rend="italic">Coah')</hi> The conveyance
                    of coal from the Tyne and the Wear to London, and other southern counties,
                    constitutes by far the most important part of the foreign trade of the
                    empire.</p>
                <p>In 1832 the exports of coal to foreign countries amounted to 588,446 tons, of the
                    real or declared value of L.228,6I5, producing a revenue of L.56,706. We subjoin
                    an account of the quantity of coal brought coastwise and by inland navigation
                    into the port of London in 1831 and 1832, specifying the ships employed and the
                    quantities furnished by each of the shipping ports :—</p>

                <p>In quarries, whether of stone or slate, England is not rich, particularly the
                    eastern half of the kingdom; and hence the almost universal use of brick in
                    ordinary buildings. It is not till the traveller reaches Durham that he finds
                    stone commonly used. In the northern counties quarries occur frequently; in the
                    southern, those of Portland and Bath are the most considerable. Still the annual
                    profits of the whole are small when contrasted with the product of ourines.</p>
                <p>No branch of our industry has increased more rapidly in the present age than our
                    iron-works. A century ago it was computed that we required an annual importation
                    of 20,000 tons of foreign iron; an importation which for many years seems to
                    have been on the increase, so as, after the middle of last century, to carry the
                    quantity required to 30,000, 40,000, and even to 50,000 tons. This supply was
                    brought to us from Sweden and Russia, and, though burdened with duty, it was in
                    quantity more than double our native produce. But fortunately, after the year
                    1780, discoveries were made which increased greatly our supply at home. Bar iron
                    had been manufactured in England, as on the Continent, with charcoal fuel only,
                    coal being deemed inapplicable to that purpose. Under that impression, the rapid
                    consumption of the wood in the neighbourhood of our different iron-works had
                    necessitated a removal, at a great expense, of materials from one spot to
                    another, and was on the point of causing an alarming decay in the business, when
                    our iron-masters, after long perseverance, succeeded in applying coal to their
                    manufacture. They had to contend with various prejudices, particularly the
                    supposed inferiority of iron so made; but, in the course of years, the
                    manufacture acquired such an extent that there were, in 1805, two hundred and
                    twenty blast-furnaces, making 250,000 tons of pig iron.</p>
                <p>The transition from war to peace did a good deal of injury to some branches of
                    the iron trade; but the effect of the change was not of long duration, and the
                    production of iron has since been astonishingly increased. In 1820 the produce
                    was calculated at 400,000 tons. The excitement and speculation of 1824 and 1825
                    had a wonderful influence on this department. According to careful inquiries
                    made at the time, the furnaces at work in England and Wales in 1827, with their
                    produce, were as under:</p>

                <p>Owing to the failure of various rail-road and other projects set on foot in 1825
                    and 1826, the supply of iron seems to have greatly exceeded the demand; and
                    there was a very heavy fall of prices in 1828, 1829, and 1830. But within the
                    last two years prices have again risen to more than their former level; and the
                    iron trade is at this moment in a state of great activity. The produce of the
                    various furnaces of England and Wales may be estimated at 650,000 tons, worth at
                    an average L.6. 10s. a ton, making a grand total of L.4,225,000. For more ample

                <p>Copper-mines have long been known in England, but they were wrought with very
                    little skill or effect until towards the year 1700. Even at that time the annual
                    produce, after smelting the metal from the ore, was only a few hundred tons of
                    copper; and it hardly exceeded 1000 tons annually down to the middle of last
                    century. From that time forwards the increase became considerable, as well in
                    Cornwall as in Devon, North Wales, and Derbyshire; in all of which copper-mines
                    were discovered and wrought. In North Wales there were two mines, Parys and
                    Mona, which, for some time after the year 1780, yielded annually a large
                    quantity of ore, but they are no longer so productive: the mines of Devon and
                    Derbyshire continue to be wrought, but the great product is from Cornwall, the
                    mines of which yield 145,000 tons of ore annually; the metal obtained, varying
                    from five to fifteen in the hundred parts, may be stated at 12,000 tons of
                    copper. It is the Welsh collieries which afford to Cornwall, as to Devonshire,
                    the means of smelting; and as the ore is less heavy than the coal required for
                    this operation (one ton of ore requiring from two to two and a half tons of
                    coaD, the practice is to convey the ore in vast quantities to Wales,
                    particularly to Swansea. The total quantity of coal consumed for this purpose at
                    Swansea is nearly 350,000 tons a year, exclusive of a further consumption of
                    coal at the copper-mines of Cornwall, in working the ponderous steam-engines
                    used in throwing out the water from the pits. In this, as in other minerals,
                    France is greatly behind England. She has various copper-mines, but her
                    coal-mines, at least those hitherto wrought, are at too great a distance to make
                    such undertakings profitable; and she consequently requires an annual
                    importation from England.</p>
                <p>The entire produce of the copper-mines of England and Wales is at present about
                    14,000 tons a year of pure metal; and taking the price at L.100 a ton, its
                    aggregate value will be L. J,400,000.</p>
                <p>In 1831 there were exported brass and copper manufactures of the value of
                    L.803,124, of which India, China, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193333158"

                    L.169,533, France L.91,580, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Cornwall is also the great seat of the tin-mines of England. A century ago the
                    average produce of our tin mines hardly exceeded 1500 tons.</p>

                <p>The produce of the mines at present does not materially differ from the last of
                    these averages. From abroad we receive tin from one quarter only, viz. the East
                    Indies, in particular from the island of Banca. Of this we imported, in 1831,
                    776 tons, the chief part of which was re-exported to the Continent of Europe. Of
                    our own tin, about the half is used at home, and the other half finds its way to
                    foreign countries, particularly Russia, France, and Italy.</p>
                <p>The lead-mines of England are principally in Cumberland, Northumberland, and
                    Derbyshire; the whole being calculated to produce from 12,000 to 15,000 tons
                    annually. Black lead is found in abundance in Cumberland, in the romantic
                    district of Borrowdale; but the mine is opened only periodically, in order that
                    the market may not be overstocked.</p>
                <p>Salt is already a very important product in England, and is likely to become much
                    more so from the measures urged of late years on the legislature, part of which
                    have been adopted, whilst a further part seems only to wait a season of less
                    financial pressure. <hi rend="italic">(Report of Committee on the Salt
                    Duties,</hi> June 1818.) Salt is obtained in several ways; partly from brine
                    springs, partly from the rock, partly from sea water. In the last manner it is
                    manufactured in various salt-pans along the coast, viz. in Hampshire, Kent, and
                    Essex; also in the northern counties of Durham and Northumberland, where the
                    abundance of coal reduces materially the expense of the process. But the great
                    supply is from the rock salt and brine springs of Cheshire, situated in the
                    southern part of the county, near Northwich. From these springs it is obtained
                    (sec the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Cheshire)</hi> at the rate of one gallon
                    of solid salt from four gallons of liquid, whilst common sea water does not
                    yield above one in twenty-eight. The consumption of salt in this country is
                    immense. Necker estimated its consumption in those provinces of France which had
                    purchased an exemption from the gabelle <hi rend="italic">(pays francs
                    redimees)</hi> at about 19* lbs. (Eng.) for each individual. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Administration des Finances,</hi> tome ii. p. 12.) From all that we have been
                    able to learn on the subject, we believe that the consumption of the people of
                    this country may be estimated a little higher, or at 22 lbs.; the difference in
                    our food and habits, as compared with those of the French, fully accounting for
                    this increased allowance. On this supposition, and taking the population at
                    16,000,000, the entire consumption will amount to 352,000,000, or 144,200
                    tons.</p>
                <p>Exclusive of this immense home consumption, we annually export about 10,000,000
                    bushels, which, at 56 lbs. a bushel, are equivalent to 250,000 tons. The
                    Americans are the largest consumers of British salt, the exports to the United
                    States in 1829 having amounted to 3,515,924 bushels. During the same year we
                    exported to the Netherlands 1,583,517 bushels, to the British North American
                    colonies 1,472,000 ditto, to Russia 1,388,490 ditto, to Prussia 949,834 ditto,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The cheapness of this important necessary of life is not less remarkable than its
                    diffusion. Its present cost may be estimated, at a medium, at from 14s. to 16s.
                    a ton.</p>
                <p>Salt has been at all times a favourite subject of taxation. In this country it
                    was first taxed in the reign of William III. In 1798 the duties amounted to 5s.
                    a bushel, but they were subsequently increased to 15s. a bushel, or about forty
                    times the cost of the salt. So exorbitant a duty was productive of the worst
                    effects, and, in particular, occasioned a great deal of smuggling. The duty
                    having in consequence become exceedingly unpopular, was finally repealed in
                    1823.</p>
                <p>VI.— <hi rend="italic">Fisheries.</hi></p>
                <p>A season of peace is always favourable to the extension of our fisheries; and, if
                    we may judge from the progress lately made, this branch of our national industry
                    is likely to be carried further than at any former period of our history. Of
                    this we shall treat more fully under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fishery.</hi> At present our space allows no more than a brief notice of the
                    principal branches of our fisheries.</p>
                <p>The mackerel fishery is strictly English, and is carried on with great vigour on
                    the coasts of Kent and Sussex, in May, June, and July. Large as the supply is,
                    it would still admit of augmentation; and herrings also might be caught in vast
                    quantities on the coast of Kent in October and November. The desideratum with
                    the fishermen, now that peace has reduced their expense, is not so much a high
                    price as a certain market; and the most effectual way to procure that is, to
                    quicken, by every possible means, the conveyance to London, which has been
                    accomplished by the employment of steam-boats. The conveyance of fish by
                    land-carriage from Brighton, and other parts of the Sussex coast, to London, has
                    also been accomplished by improvements in the roads.</p>
                <p>The pilchard fishery takes place chiefly on the coast of Devonshire and Cornwall,
                    and, though subject to great fluctuations, as well from the seasons as from our
                    political situation relatively to the Continent, forms on the whole an important
                    branch, employing a number of seamen both in catching the fish and in carrying
                    it to foreign markets. Its season is generally from June to September.</p>
                <p>The herring, the most important of all our fisheries, is happily now in a state
                    of rapid extension. It formed, during the seventeenth century, the great
                    employment of the Dutch seamen, and was contemplated by their neighbours with
                    very jealous eyes. Accordingly, in the reign of Charles II., particularly after
                    the rupture with Holland in 1672, several acts were passed for the encouragement
                    of our fishermen, and in a spirit of hostility to the Dutch. The subsequent
                    accession of William to our throne, and the long friendship between the two
                    countries, relaxed the exertions of government; and it was not till after the
                    peace of 1748 that a large bounty was given on the tonnage of the busses, or
                    masted vessels, so employed. Still our fishermen proved unable to compete with
                    the experience and patient perseverance of the Dutch, and it was found necessary
                    to raise the bounty from 30s. to 50s. per ton. This had the desired effect, and
                    the number of busses increased; but the additional 20s. being withdrawn in 1771,
                    the fishery again declined The American war, and, subsequently, the wars of the
                    French revolution, proved extremely adverse to its extension. At last, in 1808,
                    an act was passed carrying the bounty to L.3 a ton on the busses, with a further
                    grant of 2s. per barrel on all herrings caught, whether in busses or boats. This
                    act was further confirmed in 1815, and the bounty per barrel raised to 4s. with
                    the qualification that the herrings should be gutted before curing.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the encouragement thus afforded, the fishery was materially
                    extended; but this was effected a∣ a great expense, and had, besides, several
                    bad consequences. The bounties given by government tempted persons <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193333171" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3171-0770"/> without capital
                    or skill to enter into the business, to the great injury of the regular
                    fishermen; so that notwithstanding the extension of the business, it was found,
                    as is invariably the case with all departments carried on by means of a bounty,
                    to be in a very unhealthy state. In consequence partly of the circumstances now
                    stated, and partly in consideration of the real and substantial relief given to
                    the fishery by the abolition of the duties on salt, it was resolved gradually to
                    withdraw the bounty, which totally ceased in 1830. And we are happy to have to
                    state, that though the fishery fell off whilst the bounty was in the course of
                    being withdrawn, it has since been materially increased, and is now in a better
                    situation than at any former period.</p>
                <p>The curing of herring in Scotland is still subjected to the supervision of a
                    public board; but we are not aware that its interference has been or can be
                    productive of any good effect; and it will, we hope, be dispensed with.</p>

                <p>Greenland was first discovered by the English; but in this, as in other branches
                    of navigation, we long allowed the Dutch to take a lead. It was not till after
                    1750 that, government having granted a bounty of 40s. a ton on every vessel
                    employed in the whale fishery, a considerable increase took place in this
                    branch.</p>
                <p>In 1750, the vessels employed were only nineteen; in 1756 they had increased to
                    sixty-seven. The war soon caused a decrease of one half; but at the return of
                    peace in 1763 this fishery revived, and in 1770 the vessels employed amounted to
                    fifty, in 1773 to fifty-five, in 1775 to ninety-six. The American war again
                    caused a decrease, and in 1782 the vessels so employed were only thirty eight.
                    In 1784 they increased to eighty-nine, and in 1785 to 140. After this they
                    exceeded ⅛00 annually till 1793; but the long continuance of the late wars
                    reduced them below the half, and the advantages of peace have been counteracted
                    by causes which have as yet prevented the English vessels from regaining the
                    number employed previously to 1793. In 1832, the whale fishery employed
                    thirty-nine English and forty-two Scotch ships, of the aggregate burden of
                    26,393 tons.</p>
                <p>The Newfoundland fishery has been considerable for fully a century past. As a
                    nursery for seamen, it is accounted of such consequence as to have formed the
                    object of a specific article in most of our treaties of peace. The fish caught,
                    particularly in time of peace, is sent less to Britain than to the Catholic
                    countries in the south of Europe; a market subject to all the interruptions
                    attendant on a change of political relations. The number of vessels employed in
                    this fishery at different times was as follows:</p>

                <p>At this rate the fishery continued until the war of 1793, after which,
                    particularly after our rupture with Spain in 1797, it fell off greatly; the
                    fishing vessels in 1798 being only 140.</p>
                <p>The continuance of war, and the aggrandisement of the French in Italy, occasioned
                    additional depression; so that in 1810 the number of our vessels employed at
                    Newfoundland did not exceed ninety-two. The peace seemed to promise a revival of
                    this important nursery of seamen; and in the year 1816 the number of vessels
                    which arrived in Newfoundland was 795, manned by 6000 seamen (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Report of Committee</hi> in June 1817, p. 7); but the trade, both then and in
                    1817 and 1818, proved unprofitable, in consequence of indifferent seasons, of
                    the high duty imposed on fish imported in British vessels into Naples, and of
                    the competition of the French fishermen, supported by a high bounty from their
                    government. Of late years very few British ships have gone to the Banks; but we
                    carry on an extensive fishing along the coast of Labrador, and on the shores of
                    Newfoundland. But the more convenient situation of the New Englanders, who are
                    very expert fishermen, give them advantages with which the British find it very
                    difficult to contend; and, partly from this cause, and partly from the forcing
                    system of the French, and the greater duties laid on the importation of salted
                    fish into <pb break="no" facs="nls:193333184" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3184-0771"/>most
                    Catholic countries, the business appears to be rather in a depressed state. Mr
                    M‘Gregor estimates the total produce of the British fisheries in the seas and
                    islands of America, on an average of the five years ending with 1832, at
                    L∙857,2l0 a year.</p>
                <p>It is matter of surprise to foreigners that a maritime nation should not have
                    more effectually cultivated this great means of facilitating the support of our
                    population. The ample supply which might have been afforded by the Nymph Bank,
                    on the south-east coast of Ireland, has been avowedly neglected; and it was only
                    in 1818 that we made the discovery of a bank of almost equal productiveness in
                    the vicinity of Orkney. Fish is little known to the mass of the people in our
                    inland counties. Whilst the value of butcher’s meat annually consumed in England
                    exceeds L.30,000,000 sterling, the value of the fish caught upon our coasts and
                    in our rivers hardly exceeds L.2,000,000. Yet its price, with the economy and
                    improved arrangements attendant on a state of peace, would not exceed 20s. a
                    cwt., whilst other animal food costs more than twice that sum. But the truth is,
                    that fish has never been a favourite article of food with the bulk of the
                    English people; and, notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary, we
                    are by no means satisfied that they would gain materially by a change in this
                    respect.</p>
                <p>VII.— <hi rend="italic">Manufactures.</hi></p>
                <p>In this great department of our productive industry we begin with woollens,
                    which, although no longer the largest of our manufactures in point of
                    exportation, nor even in the value annually made, is entitled to the first place
                    from the priority of its establishment, as well as from the substantial basis on
                    which it rests. England, from the extent of her pastures, abounded in wool from
                    a very remote age, and the inhabitants were doubtless capable of manufacturing
                    it into rude clothing; each weaver working in his separate cottage, and with
                    very little aid from machinery. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries we
                    appear to have had only the most humble fabrics, and to have imported all cloth
                    of finer texture; sending abroad our wool in quantities to Flanders, a country
                    the inhabitants of which were at that period much further advanced than the rest
                    of Europe, with the exception of Italy. It was in the middle of the fourteenth
                    century that a better system was introduced. Flemish manufacturers were invited
                    over to England, and improved greatly the quality of our homemade woollens. The
                    seats of this branch of industry appear at that time to have been Kent and
                    Essex; afterwards Gloucestershire, and subsequently the West Riding of
                    Yorkshire. It occupied at first the southern and more improved districts, and
                    spread afterwards to the northward, on account of the cheapness of labour, the
                    abundance of coal, and the convenience of waterfalls for the machinery. The
                    general character of the woollen manufacture of England has been that of slow
                    progress, but of little fluctuation; the latter evidently a consequence of its
                    depending more on home consumption than on exportation. In the long period from
                    1700 to 1780, the exports experienced a regular but not rapid rise, amounting in
                    the latter years to about L.3,500,000, whilst our home consumption increased in
                    proportion to our augmenting numbers. More recently the manufacture has been
                    materially improved by the adoption of various important mechanical inventions
                    in the spinning, weaving, and dressing departments. On the whole, however,
                    improvement has been much less rapid in it than in the cotton manufacture; so
                    that whilst our exports of cotton stuffs and yarn have increased beyond all
                    precedent, those of woollens have been comparatively stationary.</p>
                <p>As we shall enter fully, in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Woollen
                    Manufacture,</hi> into the details connected with its history, progress, and
                    present state, it would be useless, even if our limits permitted, to anticipate
                    these here. We shall only observe, therefore, that the entire value of the
                    manufacture is estimated by the best authorities at L.18,000,000, which is
                    believed to be distributed nearly as follows:</p>
                <p>Raw material (wooD L.6,000,000</p>
                <p>Oil, dye-stuffs, soap, &amp;c 1,200,000</p>
                <p>Wear and tear of capital and profit....3,500,000 Wages 7,300,000</p>
                <p>Total L.18,000,000</p>
                <p>Now, supposing that each person, young and old, male and female, engaged in the
                    manufacture, earns, at an average, L.20 a year, the total number employed will
                    be 365,000.</p>
                <p>By far the largest proportion of the raw material of the manufacture is the
                    produce of our own flocks; but for many years past, and especially since the
                    peace, we have imported large quantities of wool, principally from Germany. The
                    subjoined accounts give a full view of the state of the foreign woollen trade in

                <p>Our cotton manufacture is entitled to the greatest attention on different
                    accounts. Of all our manufactures, it affords the largest export, and exhibits
                    the most rapid improvements in machinery. Its introduction, though not remote,
                    is less recent than is commonly supposed. It appears to have taken place about
                    two centuries ago, when it was established at Manchester; but it was long
                    conducted upon a very limited scale. The raw material, imported at first only
                    from the Levant, in particular from Smyrna, began, after 1660, to be supplied by
                    our West India colonies. The quantity imported amounted, about the year 1700, to
                    3500 bales; but, increasing with the extended<pb break="no" facs="nls:193333210"

                    the year 1720, something more than 7000 bales. From the colonial conquests of
                    the war of 1756, our import of cotton received a further augmentation; but the
                    manufacture increased very slowly, a great part of our cotton being re-exported
                    to Holland, for the supply of Dutch and German weavers. It was not till after
                    the peace of 1763, and the invention, first of the carding machine, and next of
                    the spinning jenny, that this manufacture became considerably extended. In 1775,
                    the average import of cotton approached to 18,000 bales. A variety of
                    inventions, unequalled in the history of manufacturing industry, were now made
                    (see our article on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cotton Manufacture),</hi> which
                    gave an astonishing stimulus to the business. Fine calicoes and muslins were
                    introduced; the workmen were withdrawn from their detached dwellings, and
                    collected into large factories, and the price of the finished article
                    experienced a reduction, notwithstanding a rise in the raw material, and in the
                    wages of labour. The period which followed the peace of 1783 is perhaps
                    unexampled for the reduction of price and the consequent extension of sale that
                    took place in regard to cotton goods. The commencement of hostilities in 1793
                    gave a pretty severe shock to the business; but the improvements in machinery
                    continuing, the manufacture soon recovered, and has gone on increasing, under
                    many vicissitudes, with a rapidity unparalleled by any other business, either in
                    this or any other country. Neither does there seem to be any ground for fearing
                    that this progress will be speedily checked. On the contrary, our superiority in
                    all that contributes to the advancement of the manufacture is so very decided,
                    that, provided the public tranquillity be preserved unimpaired, we have nothing
                    to fear from the competition of others.</p>

                <p>This annual quantity of 222,596,907 lbs. gives a weekly supply of 4,280,709 lbs.
                    Mr Burns estimates the quantity spun per spindle, per week, at 8į oz. making the
                    total number of spindles employed in England and Wales, in 1832, amount to
                    7,949,208. Those employed in Scotland during the same year are estimated, in the
                    same way, at 881,020. Mr Burns further calculates the number of looms employed
                    in England and Wales at 203,703. The consumption of flour in the manufacture is
                    much greater than any one not pretty well acquainted with it would really
                    suppose. The average quantity required for each loom is estimated at 4 lbs. per
                    week; making the total annual consumption in England and Wales 42,301,584 lbst
                    or 215,824 barrels of 196 lbs. each.</p>

                <p>Such being the vast extent and importance of the cotton manufacture, the
                    probability of our preserving our ascendency in it becomes a very interesting
                    topic of inquiry. But it is obvious that a great deal of conjecture must always
                    insinuate itself into our reasonings with respect to the future state of any
                    branch of manufacturing industry. They are all liable to be affected by so many
                    contingent and unforeseen circumstances, that it is impossible to predicate,
                    with any thing like certainty, what may be their condition a few years hence.
                    But abstracting the effects of national struggles and commotions, which can
                    neither be foreseen nor calculated, we do not think there is any thing in our
                    state, or in that of the different commercial and manufacturing countries of the
                    world, which should lead us to anticipate that the glbomy forebodings of those
                    who contend that the cotton manufacture of England has reached its zenith, and
                    that it must now begin to decline, will be realized. The natural capabilities we
                    possess for carrying on the business of manufacturing are, all things
                    considered, decidedly superior to those of any other people. But the superiority
                    to which we have already arrived is perhaps the greatest advantage in our
                    favour. Our master manufacturers, engineers, and artisans, are more intelligent,
                    skilful, and enterprising, than those of any other country; and the
                    extraordinary inventions they have already made, and their familiarity with all
                    the principles and details of the business, will not only enable them to perfect
                    the processes already in use, but can hardly fail to lead to the discovery of
                    others. Our establishments for spinning, weaving, printing, bleaching, &amp;c.
                    are infinitely more complete and perfect than any that exist elsewhere; the
                    division of labour in these is carried to an extent incomparably greater; the
                    workmen are trained from infancy to industrious habits, and have attained that
                    peculiar dexterity and sleight of hand in the performance of their separate
                    tasks, which can only be acquired by long and unremitting application to the
                    same employment. Why, then, having all these advantages upon our side, should we
                    not keep the start which we have already gained? Every other people who attempt
                    to set up manufactures must obviously labour under the greatest difficulties as
                    compared with us. Their establishments cannot at first be sufficiently large to
                    allow the division of employments to be carried to any considerable extent, at
                    the same time that expertness in manipulation, and in the details of the various
                    processes, can only be attained by slow degrees. It appears, therefore,
                    reasonable to conclude that such new beginners, having to withstand the
                    competition of those who have already arrived at a very high degree of
                    perfection in the art, must be immediately driven out of every market equally
                    accessible to both parties; and that nothing but the aid derived from
                    restrictive regulations and prohibitions will be effectual to prevent the total
                    destruction of their establishments in the countries where these are set up.

                <p>The seats of the cotton manufacture of England are, first, Manchester, which
                    takes decidedly the lead of all other places; and, secondly, Preston, Bolton,
                    Blackburn, and Wigan, all situated in Lancashire. After these come several other
                    places, partly in Lancashire, in Cumberland, and the West Riding of Yorkshire.
                    The introduction of cotton works into the last, the great seat of the woollen
                    manufacture, is owing to the practicability of the same workmen turning, in case
                    of need, from wool to cotton, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already noticed the surprising increase in the produce of our iron mines
                    since 1780. This increase of the raw material, joined in some cases to the
                    command of coal in the vicinity, and in all to a facility of conveyance of coal
                    and iron by canals, has, in the last forty years, given a great extension to our
                    hardware manufacture. In it we take the lead of foreigners as decidedly as in
                    our cottons; and if the ratio of increase has not been altogether so rapid, it
                    is owing, not to inferior ingenuity in the workmen, but to radical differences
                    in the two manufactures. In no department has the subdivision of employment been
                    carried to so great a length; in none are its effects in cheapening production
                    so conspicuous. Birmingham and Sheffield are the two great work-shops for our
                    hardware; the latter is confined to iron and steel; whilst, in the former, not
                    only iron and steel, but copper and brass, constitute the materials of labour.
                    Sheffield fabricates articles which are less for ornament than utility, and
                    which possess, in general, a certain bulk, such as grates, spades, sickles,
                    files, knives, fenders, fire-irons; whilst in Birmingham there is, in addition
                    to articles of solidity, a surprising variety of toys, fancy goods, and petty
                    manufactures; each trifling when considered separately, but the whole forming an
                    aggregate of great value. The most insignificant of these, such as a brass cock
                    or a button shank, passes through a number of hands; and each artisan performs
                    only a single operation. He thus acquires an extraordinary dexterity in his
                    limited department, and, in the course of a day, dispatches several hundred,
                    perhaps even a thousand articles, through his particular stage; the result of
                    all which is, that the price, when sold in quantities, is incredibly low.
                    Another and very interesting feature in the situation of Birmingham, is the
                    populousness of its neighbourhood. Yet in none of our large towns is living less
                    expensive; an advantage owing partly to the abundance of coal, partly to the
                    ready supply of milk and vegetables from the wide space occupied by the
                    population.</p>
                <p>The nail trade is carried on, not in the town of Birmingham, but in a part of the
                    surrounding district: it is computed to employ 30,000 men, women, and children;
                    for even this heavy article admits of a subdivision of employment, which
                    lightens the labour, and enables the workman to avail himself of the aid of his
                    family. Of the two towns, Sheffield is by much the more ancient; the command of
                    coal and iron in the same neighbourhood having rendered it, so far back as the
                    thirteenth or fourteenth century, a place for the fabrication of the homely
                    articles used in these days by our ancestors. It is about a century since its
                    razors, knives, and files began to take a more delicate shape. Birmingham,
                    however, embraced a wider range, and advanced with much greater rapidity; but
                    Sheffield also has its adjacent district inhabited by manufacturers, though to a
                    much less extent than the vicinity of Birmingham. This district, called
                    Hallamshire, extends six or seven miles to the west of Sheffield.</p>
                <p>Hardware is made in several other places, such as Bilston, Wolverhampton, Dudley,
                    and Walsall. Each of these towns is situated in Staffordshire, and, in point of
                    manufacture, is small only in comparison with Birmingham or Sheffield. Articles
                    apparently very trifling are manufactured to a surprising extent in different
                    places, such as pins at Gloucester, needles at Red-ditch in Worcestershire,
                    watch movements and main springs at Prescott in Lancashire. The total value of
                    our articles of iron, steel, brass, and copper, including the manufacture from
                    its earliest to its most finished stage, is necessarily fluctuating, but may be
                    computed at L. 16,000,000 annually; two thirds of which appear to be consumed
                    amongst ourselves, whilst the other third is exported to two great markets, the
                    Continent of Europe and the United States of America. A return during three
                    years of peace, but of unequal mercantile prosperity, will suffice to show the
                    average of annual export.</p>

                <p>The number of persons, young and old, employed in the hardware manufacture, is
                    reckoned at between 300,000 and 400,000. In no branch of industry is the
                    transition front war to peace more sensibly felt; government, the great customer
                    for arms and artillery, withdraws entirely from the market; whilst the
                    stagnation of commerce, the postponement of new buildings and new machinery, in
                    short, the various evils inseparable from a sudden and general change, which
                    have been so cruelly felt throughout Britain since the peace, all operate most
                    materially against the sale of the heavier and more useful articles. Similar
                    causes cast a damp over the purchase of ornamental and fancy goods; so that in
                    no department of our population have the sufferings of the labouring classes or
                    the augmentation of the poor’s rate been greater. But there is happily a point
                    beyond which depression cannot go; the reduced price of a commodity rendering it
                    applicable to more extended uses, and adapting it to the means of humbler
                    customers. Iron has not been found suitable as a substitute for stone in paving
                    the streets of the metropolis; but, if its price continue low, it is likely to
                    supplant timber for a variety of purposes, of which the public at large are not
                    as yet aware. Reduction of price will lead also to a demand from the Continent
                    for our hardware; the article in which of all others the French and Germans are
                    most behind us. Their mines of iron are seldom adjacent to their mines of coal,
                    and, with the exception of a few places, such as Liège in the Netherlands, and
                    St Etienne near Lyons, the hardware workmen are not collected in such large
                    associations as to admit of the necessary subdivision of labour. As improvement
                    advances, and a taste for comfort becomes diffused, the inhabitants of the
                    Continent will extend their purchases; they will see in the keys, the locks, and
                    other neat and convenient articles of English fabric, a substitute for the
                    bolts, the latches, and other coarse contrivances, with which they have hitherto
                    been obliged to content themselves. In the United States, iron and coal are
                    found, it is said (Mellish’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in America,</hi> chap.
                    67), in abundance, in a quarter (Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania) where land and
                    provisions are certainly much cheaper than in Britain; but the scattered state
                    of American population must, during several ages, oppose serious obstacles to
                    the division of employment necessary in all the nicer branches of the hardware
                    manufacture; particularly as the ease with which the .Mississippi and Ohio are
                    navigated by steam opens even the western states to the importation of British
                    goods. Upon the whole, therefore, we look on our hardware manufactures,
                    notwithstanding their present depression, as resting on a solid basis, because
                    in them we combine several advantages ;—the raw material, the command of cheap
                    fuel, and the use of machinery, which, the more it is adopted, will bring a
                    greater proportion of the work within the compass of women and boys, and thus
                    lessen the proportion borne by wages in the cost of the finished article.</p>
                <p>Linen has never formed one of the staple manufactures of England, flax having
                    been less cultivated amongst us than on the opposite shore of the Netherlands; a
                    country' which, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, supplied the rest of
                    Europe with the finest linens and woollens. When England subsequently advanced
                    in manufacturing arts, the abundant supply of wool pointed out the most suitable
                    branch; and we were contented to continue our imports of linen from the
                    Netherlands, from France, and from Germany, or to favour the manufacture of the
                    sister island in a department which did not excite our jealousy. In Ireland, the
                    linen manufacture dates about two centuries ago, and is said to have owed much
                    of its extension to the measures of the unfortunate Wentworth in the reign of
                    Charles 1. The annual consumption of linen in England a century ago was probably
                    not far below that of her double population at present, owing to the very
                    general substitution in our time of cotton articles. Then, as at present, the
                    linen manufacture of England was established chiefly in Lancashire, in
                    Cumberland, and in a county very remote from these, namely, Dorsetshire. In 1745
                    government, apprised of the extension of the manufacture of coarse linen in
                    Silesia and other parts of Germany, and actuated by the fallacious notion of
                    making a monopoly of all kinds of productive industry, granted a bounty of Iģd.
                    per y <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ard on the exportation of all British linen
                    of a value from 6d. to 18d. per yard; in other words, a premium of 20 or 25 per
                    cent, on the prime cost of all inferior qualities exported. So large a grant
                    soon augmented the manufacture of osnaburgs and other coarse cloths,
                    particularly in Scotland, although the ratio of increase was infinitely smaller
                    than in the case of cotton, where there was no premium, but a rapid improvement
                    of machinery. The demand for bounty, in the ten years ending in 1785, was about
                    L.33,000 annually. More recently these impolitic issues were greatly increased;
                    but at length the impolicy of forcing a manufacture in this way having become
                    obvious to every one, the bounties, after being gradually reduced, ceased
                    finally in 1830.</p>
                <p>Ireland and Scotland, particularly Dundee, are both superior to England in the
                    manufacture of linen. But some of the flax mills established at Hull are on a
                    more extensive scale than any other in the empire. The reader will find under
                    the head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Linen,</hi> in this work, an account of the
                    value of the manufacture in each division of the empire, of the amount of
                    capital, and the number of hands employed in it, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the silk manufacture, as in linen, we have had to contend with a formidable
                    opposition in other countries, particularly in France and Italy; and we have
                    also had to import the whole of the raw material. It would therefore hardly have
                    been attempted by our countrymen, but for the great profits expected from an
                    article of general use amongst the higher classes. Its introduction amongst us
                    goes back to the fifteenth century. About the beginning of the seventeenth it
                    seems to have been carried to a considerable extent, owing certainly not to the
                    luxury of the age, nor to any great proportion of affluent persons in the
                    community, but to silk being almost the only article of apparel in which the
                    vanity of dress could display itself. Towards the end of the reign of Charles
                    IL, about the year 1680, raw silk <pb break="no" facs="nls:193333262"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3262-0777"/>began to be imported in quantities from India; and
                    the English manufacture received a substantial addition by the numbers and
                    ingenuity of the Frenchmen who settled in this country after the revocation of
                    the edict of Nantes in 1683. Various circumstances thus contributed to pre- &gt;
                    serve and extend the manufacture, which continued rather upon the increase till
                    the general substitution of cottons for silks about 1790. This gave a serious
                    shock to the manufacture, from which it recovered only by slow degrees. Its
                    situation had not indeed been at any time prosperous; and the continued
                    complaints of the manufacturers occasioned within these few years a fundamental
                    change in the policy under which it had previously been conducted.</p>
                <p>From the first introduction of the manufacture into England down to 1825, foreign
                    silks were either positively or virtually excluded. But the monopoly which was
                    thus secured to the manufacturers produced, what all monopolies invariably do,
                    an indifference to improvement. Instead of trusting to the ingenuity or to the
                    superior skill which they might have called to their aid for preserving their
                    ascendency in the market, the manufacturers depended upon custom-house
                    regulations, and additional penalties on smuggling. In consequence, invention
                    was quite at a stand. Such indeed was the influence of the system in this
                    respect, that in 1826 the member for Coventry (Mr Edward Ellice) affirmed n his
                    place in the House of Commons that the improved silk looms in use in various
                    parts of the Continent enabled the workman to execute <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jive</hi> times as much work as he could do here; whilst in every business not
                    protected by a monopoly the result was precisely opposite. At length, after a
                    great deal of discussion, it was resolved to adopt a more liberal system. In
                    1825 a bill was in consequence passed, allowing the importation of foreign silks
                    on payment of an <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duty of 30 per cent.,
                    accompanied, however, by the effectual reduction of the singularly oppressive
                    duties which had previously been imposed on the imports of raw and thrown silk.
                    This measure, though vehemently opposed at the time, has proved most successful.
                    We are quite sure that we are within the mark when we affirm that the silk trade
                    has made more progress since 1826, when the new system was introduced, than it
                    did during the whole of the preceding century. The following is an account of
                    the raw and thrown silk imported since 1820 :—</p>

                    not only our imports of raw silk, but also our exports of manufactured silk
                    goods, are rapidly increasing. The following table shows this.</p>

                <p>It is plain, therefore, that the manufacture is not increasing merely by reason
                    of an increased demand in the home market, but because we are rapidly gaining on
                    our rivals in the markets of foreign countries. This affords unquestionable
                    evidence of the improvement as well as the extension of the manufacture. In 1832
                    our exports of wrought silks to France itself amounted to about L.75,000∙</p>
                <p>Leather, however little it may figure as an article of export, is necessarily one
                    of extensive home consumption <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in every civilized
                    country, particularly in such a climate <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> as ours,
                    and where there are so many rich and sumptuous equipages. It is matter of regret
                    that we should have so very few <hi rend="italic">data,</hi> official or
                    otherwise, on which to form an estimate of the export or import of hides in
                    former ages. Such an estimate would possess interest, as indicating the extent
                    of our pasturage and the number of our cattle in comparison with our population.
                    Whatever may have been the case at a remote date, the custom-house returns, for
                    many years past, show, by the annual imports, that the demand for leather has
                    greatly exceeded the home supply of hides. For a long time this importation took
                    place from the Continent of Europe, and from the least civilized quarters; from
                    countries, such as Lithuania and Poland, where the quantity of hides furnished
                    by the cattle materially exceeds that of the leather required by the
                    inhabitants. But since the opening of the trade to South America, it has been
                    found more advantageous to import hides from that continent, where the herds of
                    wild cattle are so numerous as to meet the eye of the traveller in almost every
                    point of the horizon.</p>
                <p>On an average of the two years ending with 1832 there were imported 199,033 cwts∙
                    of untanned, and 24,334 cwts. of tanned hides. The quantity of leather annually
                    made in England and Wales may be estimated at about 45,000,000 lbs. The largest
                    tanneries are at Bermondsey in Southwark; but there are also very extensive
                    establishments of the kind in the country, as in Cheshire, Lancashire,
                    Westmoreland, Cumberland; and also in Lincolnshire. The late war, by its long
                    continuance, and the magnitude of our army and navy, produced great orders from
                    government for our leather manufacture. Shoes were and still are made wholesale
                    in several towns of Staffordshire, Cheshire, and Northamptonshire; but those
                    made in London, by the principal dealers, are, though expensive, by far the
                    best.</p>
                <p>Of the annual value of the leather manufactured into shoes, boots, harness,
                    saddlery, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> there are no means of forming a correct
                    estimate; but we have merely to consider the population of England, and the
                    unavoidable extent of their wants, to be satisfied that from ten to twelve
                    millions sterling are rather below than above the mark. But whilst our home
                    consumption is so considerable, our export is comparatively small, and does not
                    exceed half a million sterling. To Ireland, the leather we ship is merely
                    tanned; to other countries our exports are in a manufactured shape. The duty on
                    leather was wholly abolished in 1830.</p>
                <p>Connected with our general manufacture of leather is the glove trade, a branch of
                    no inconsiderable extent, being carried on in several of the midland and western
                    counties, viz. at Woodstock, Worcester, Ludlow, Hereford, Yeovil in
                    Somersetshire, &amp;c. This branch of industry enjoyed for a lengthened period
                    the protection of monopoly, which, however, was abolished in 1825. Many <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193333275" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3275-0778"/> contradictory
                    statements have been made as to the effects of this measure. We believe,
                    however, that the depression so much complained of has not been produced by it,
                    but by the substitution of cotton gloves for those of leather; and we have no
                    doubt that, had it not been for the greater cheapness and improved quality of
                    leather gloves, caused by the abolition of the monopoly, this substitution would
                    have been carried much farther than it has been. The increased imports of the
                    lamb and kid skins used in the manufacture show conclusively that it is not
                    declining.</p>
                <p>We come next to a branch of industry of a very different description, namely, the
                    brewery. The amount of capital and labour invested in brewing establishments in
                    England is very large, and particularly striking to those who have lived on the
                    Continent, and have contrasted our situation with that of the wine countries of
                    the south of Europe. It is only in Flanders and Germany that breweries are
                    numerous; and, in the latter, from the limited capital, and the scattered state
                    of their population, there are hardly any of those large establishments which
                    exist in our metropolis. In London this important branch of business is chiefly
                    in the hands of about a dozen great houses, who, conjunctly with the smaller
                    establishments, brew at an average 1,800,000 barrels of porter.</p>

                    can be desired with respect to the consumption of malt and beer in England, and

                <p>The duty on beer having ceased on the 10th of October 1830, there are no
                    subsequent accounts of the quantities brewed. There can be no doubt, however,
                    from the increased quantity of malt, that the production of beer has been
                    materially increased.</p>
                <p>Spirituous liquors form one of the branches of manufacture in which England is
                    dependent on her neighbours, as she imports an annual supply of corn spirit from
                    Scotland and Ireland, rum from the West Indies, and brandy</p>
                <p>• from France. It has been generally supposed that the consumption of gin has
                    increased materially in England since 1825, when the duties were reduced. We
                    are, however, inclined to doubt whether such be really the case, and are
                    disposed to believe that the effect is more apparent than real; in fact, that it
                    has resulted rather from a diminution of smuggling than from a positive increase
                    of consumption. That such has been the case in Scotland and Ireland is beyond
                    all question; and there seems no reason to conclude that it is otherwise in
                    England. We subjoin a statement of the quantity of the different sorts of
                    spirits entered for home consumption in England in 1832, and of the duties
                    thereon. The consumption of British spirits has declined about 500,000 gallons
                    during the last three years. The annual average consumption of brandy is about
                    1,200,000 gallons. Its increase in 1832 is to be ascribed to the notion then
                    prevalent, but since exploded, that brandy potations formed one of the best
                    antidotes to cholera.</p>

                <p>To the remaining manufactures our limits allow of little space, though several of
                    them would be accounted of great importance in any other country than England.
                    Thel extent to which such articles as soap and paper are made among us is amply
                    shown by the excise returns; but the list of our exports is of more consequence
                    to the political economist, not from the vulgar notion that it is by export only
                    that national profit is realized, but as indicative of those commodities for
                    which we possess, in our soil, our climate, or our colonial possessions,
                    advantages that give us a superiority over our neighbours. Thus, in the case of
                    glass, the abundance and cheapness of our coal outweigh the disadvantages
                    arising from the duty, and enable us to make an annual export of between
                    L.400,000 and L.500,000. In the manufacture of hats, likewise, our command of
                    wool for the coarser kind, and of furs from our North American colonies for
                    beaver hats, enables us to ship <pb break="no" facs="nls:193333288"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3288-0779"/>to an extent of nearly L.200,000 real value a
                    year. In earthenware we have the advantage of clay, of fuel, and of ready
                    communication by canals. These, joined to the taste and ingenuity of individuals
                    engaged in the manufacture, carried it, in the course of the eighteenth century,
                    to an extent which has rendered it a national object; a tract of seven or eight
                    miles in Staffordshire, called the Pottery District, being almost entirely
                    appropriated to it. The population of this tract is about 60,000. The great
                    outlet is Liverpool, and the shipments take place partly to the United States,
                    partly to the continent of Europe. Our exports, comprising porcelain, average
                    from L.400,000 to L.500,000 real value.</p>
                <p>The stocking manufacture is carried on chiefly in the counties of Nottingham,
                    Derby, and Leicester. It formerly employed vast numbers of women in knitting;
                    but in this, as in most other branches, machinery has greatly superseded manual
                    labour. Lace is made in vast quantities in the midland counties; and here also
                    machinery has of late years been extensively applied. And so extraordinary has
                    been the progress of invention in this department, that British lace at present
                    commands a ready sale in all foreign markets, and is largely smuggled even into
                    France.</p>
                <p>We shall give, in a subsequent section, an account of the number of persons
                    supposed to be employed in trade and manufacture, according to the returns
                    obtained under the population act for 1821.</p>
                <p>VIII.— <hi rend="italic">Commerce and Shipping.</hi></p>
                <p>Much of what relates to the commerce of England has been already treated of under
                    the preceding section, and the colonial part of our trade shall be noticed in
                    the next. At present we are to exhibit a brief sketch of our commercial
                    intercourse with Ireland and the continents of Europe and America.</p>
                <p>With Ireland the intercourse of England is very great, that country sending us
                    grain, salted and fresh provisions, live cattle, butter, &amp;c. to the amount
                    of six or seven millions annually, and taking largely in return our
                    manufactures, particularly cotton, woollen, and hardware.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">North of Europe.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> From Russia our
                    chief imports are tallow, hemp, flax, corn, linen, timber, pitch, &amp;c.; from
                    the Swedish dominions, iron and timber; from Poland, wheat, timber, and potash;
                    from Prussia, wheat, timber, and flax. All these countries take our cottons,
                    hardware, and colonial produce.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Central part of Europe.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> From
                    Holland our imports are not foreign merchandise, as in the seventeenth century,
                    when the Dutch were the carriers of Europe, but agricultural produce, as oats,
                    wheat, seeds, hemp, cheese, butter; also gin; the whole to a large amount; in
                    return for which the Dutch take our hardware, cottons, and woollens. From France
                    our imports have long been burdened with heavy duties, but still they are large
                    and increasing; consisting chiefly of wine and brandy, and also of silk, lace,
                    and gloves. With Germany our chief intercourse is through the medium of Holland
                    and Hamburg. Our exports are large, particularly in cottons, hardware, and
                    colonial produce. Our imports are also very various and large, consisting of
                    wool, corn, flax, timber, linen, and wine, from the vicinity of the Rhine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">South of Europe.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Here we enter on
                    countries of much less industry. From Portugal we take wine in very large, and
                    fruit in smaller quantities, in return for our cottons, our woollens, and our
                    hardware. From Spain we receive wool, wine, brandy, oil, fruits, barilla,
                    &amp;c. Italy, without any commercial treaty, takes annually a large quantity of
                    our manufactures, and gives in return silk, oil, and fruit. With the Levant our
                    traffic is similar; consisting of an export of manufactures, particularly
                    printed cottons and hardware, and of an import of silk, fruit, and drugs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">United States</hi> are, notwithstanding their tariff, our
                    best customers, receiving from us manufactures of almost every kind to a great
                    amount, and sending us in return vast quantities of cotton, tobacco, rice, and
                    flour; but the merchandise received from them being far inferior to the value of
                    our exports, the difference is paid by remittances in money from the Continent
                    of Europe, arising from American merchandise sold there. With South America a
                    wide field of commercial intercourse has been opened; at present, however, the
                    chief articles received from that vast region are bullion, hides, skins, indigo,
                    and cochineal. The trade is, and will long be, subject to the various
                    disadvantages of a newly-settled country, bare of capital, deficient in
                    industry, and possessing but a small number of consumers of European commodities
                    in proportion to its extent and fertility.</p>
                <p>From <hi rend="italic">Asia</hi> we import tea, indigo,.cotton, coffee, sugar,
                    piece goods, ivory, drugs, &amp;c. Our principal article of export is cotton
                    goods, for which, how singular soever it may appear, India has, since the
                    opening of the trade in 1814, become one of our very best markets. Besides
                    cotton stuffs and yarn, we send to Asia woollen goods, copper, and a great
                    variety, of ether article^.</p>
                <p>From <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi> we import drugs, ivory, teak wood, hides,
                    &amp;c. Our exports are but inconsiderable, consisting principally of cotton and
                    linen manufactures. The hopes so frequently entertained, of opening an
                    advantageous trade with the interior of Africa, have hitherto been altogether
                    disappointed, and we do not suppose that they are destined to be more successful
                    in future.</p>
                <p>The following accounts refer to the trade of Great Bri√ tain. It appears,
                    however, from the statement of the 1 customs duties collected in the different
                    parts of the empire in 1831, and which are given in a subsequent part of this
                    article, that the foreign trade of Scotland does not, on an average, exceed an
                    eleventh or twelfth part of that of England. The trade of Ireland is about as
                    great as that of Scotland.</p>

                <p>The increase in the official, and the decline in the real <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> or declared value of the exports, since 1815, has given rise to a great
                    deal of irrelevant discussion. It has been looked upon as a proof that our
                    commerce is daily becoming less prosperous, whereas, in point of fact, a
                    precisely opposite conclusion should be drawn from it. We have already stated,
                    that the rates according to which the official values of the exports are
                    determined, were fixed as far back as 1696; so that they have long ceased to be
                    of importance as affording any criterion of the actual value, their only use
                    being to show the fluctuations in the <hi rend="italic">quantities</hi>
                    exported. To remedy this defect, a plan was formed during the early part of Mr
                    Pitt’s administration, for keeping an account of the <hi rend="italic">real</hi>
                    value of the exports, as ascertained by the declarations of the exporters. Those
                    who contend that our trade is getting into a bad condition, argue that the great
                    increase in the official value of the exports since 1815 shows that the <hi
                    rend="italic">quantity</hi> of the articles exported has been proportionally
                    augmented, whilst the fall in their real value shows that we are selling this
                    larger quantity for a smaller price, a result which, they affirm, is most
                    injurious. But the circumstance of a manufacturer or a merchant selling a large
                    or a small quantity of produce at the same price, affords no criterion by which
                    to judge as to the advantage or disadvantage of the sale; for if, in consequence
                    of improvements in the arts or otherwise, a particular article may now be
                    produced for half the expense that its production cost ten or twenty years ago,
                    it is obvious that double the quantity of it may be afforded at the same price
                    without injury to the producers. Now this is the case with some of the most
                    important articles which are exported from England. Cottons and cotton-twist
                    form a full half or more of our entire exports; and since 1814 there has been an
                    extraordinary fall in the price of these articles, occasioned partly by cotton
                    wool having fallen from about Is. 6d. per lb. to about 7d. per lb., but more by
                    improvements in the manufacture. To such an extent have these causes operated,
                    that yarn No. 40, which in 1812 cost 2s. 6d., in 1830 cost Is. 2^d.; in 1812 No.
                    60 cost 3s. 6d., in 1830 it cost Is. 10^d.; in 1812 No. 80 cost 4s. 4d., in 1830
                    it cost 2s. 6∣d., and so on; and in the weaving department the reduction
                    has.been similar. Hence, whilst the official value of the exports of cotton
                    goods and twist has increased from about L.18,000,000 in 1814, to about
                    L.37,000,000 in 1830, their declared value has sunk from about L.20,000,000 at
                    the former period to about L.16,000,000 at the latter. Surely, however, this is,
                    if any thing can be, a proof of increasing prosperity; it shows that we can now
                    export and sell with a profit (for unless such were the case, does any one
                    imagine the exportation would continue ?) nearly double the quantity of cotton
                    goods and yarn which we exported in 1814 for about the same price. In as far,
                    therefore, as an abundant and cheap supply of cottons may be supposed to
                    increase the comforts of society, it is plain that they must be about double,
                    not in this country only, but in all those countries to which we export. (M ’

                    the realm, and all indebted for their appointment to the crown. The bishop of
                    the Isle of Man, formerly appointed by the Duke of Atholl, is now also appointed
                    by the crown, but has no seat in the House of Lords. The province of York
                    comprises four bishoprics, viz. Durham, Carlisle, Chester, and the Isle of Man;
                    all the rest, to the number of twenty-one, are in the province of Canterbury.
                    The clerical dignitary next to the bishop is the archdeacon, whose duty, though
                    very different in different dioceses, may be termed that of a representative of
                    the bishop in several of his less important functions. The number of archdeacons
                    in England is about sixty. The name of Dean <hi rend="italic">(Decanus')</hi>
                    was probably derived from his originally superintending ten canons or
                    prebendaries. Each bishop has a chapter or council appointed to assist him, and
                    each chapter has a dean as its president; but there are in the church of England
                    many deaneries of other descriptions. Rector is, in general, the title of a
                    clergyman holding a living, of which the tithes are entire; vicar is understood
                    of a living where the great tithes have passed into secular hands. The very
                    general name of curate signifies sometimes (as <hi rend="italic">curé</hi> in
                    France) a clergyman in possession of a living, but more frequently one
                    exercising the spiritual office in a parish under the rector or vicar. The
                    latter are temporary curates, their appointment being a matter of arrangement
                    with the rector or vicar; the former, being more permanent, are called perpetual
                    curates, and are appointed by the impropriator of the tithe in a parish which
                    has neither rector nor vicar. The name of priest is, in general, confined to the
                    clergy of the church of Rome; in the church of England the corresponding term is
                    a clerk in orders. A parson <hi rend="italic">(persona ecclesiae)</hi> denotes a
                    clergyman in possession of a parochial church. Deacon is, in England, not a
                    layman, as in Calvinist countries, but a clergyman of limited qualifications,
                    entitled to preach, baptize, marry, and bury, but not to give the sacrament.
                    Readers are not regular clergymen, but laymen of good character, licensed by the
                    bishop to read prayers in churches or chapels where there is no clergyman. (See
                    Adolphus <hi rend="italic">on the British Empire,</hi> vol. i.)</p>
                <p>A clerical education in England is of much less length than in Calvinist
                    countries; in Scotland, Holland, Switzerland, or the north of Germany, after
                    going through a course of classics and philosophy, a second course is required
                    for theology solely; but in England the former is sufficient. The degree of
                    bachelor of arts requires an examination and a university residence of three or
                    four years; but to qualify for the acceptance of a curacy, a certificate of
                    attending a single course of lectures in divinity is all that is necessary.</p>
                <p>The number of church livings in England and Wales is very great, being fully
                    10,500. From this multiplicity of benefices, and from the general smallness of
                    the incomes, have arisen two great irregularities, pluralities and nonresidence,
                    both forbidden by the ancient statutes of the church, but both long sanctioned
                    by usage. Many clergymen hold livings without doing duty at any of them; others
                    do duty in one or in two which are adjacent to each other, and have a curate for
                    the more distant; whilst curates frequently do duty at two and sometimes at
                    three distinct places of worship. To prevent, or at least to lessen, the abuse
                    of non-residence, an act of parliament was passed in 1813, directing that every
                    non-resident incumbent should nominate a curate at a salary of not less than
                    L.80 a year, unless the entire living should be less. The effect of this act was
                    to reduce the number of non-resi dent clergymen by 800 fully; they had
                    previously been about 4700; but in 1815 the official return to parliament of the
                    incumbents in England and Wales was as follows:</p>

                <p>A part, and by no means an inconsiderable one, of the tithes of England, is held
                    by laymen; but as the church has other sources of income, its total revenue is
                    computed at nearly L.3,000,000; but the absorption of large sums by several of
                    the prelates, as the Bishops of Durham, Winchester, and London, and the
                    accumulation of the best livings amongst a few individuals of influence, reduce
                    the annual average income of the curates, or most numerous class, to little more
                    than L.100 a year.</p>
                <p>Tithes necessarily fluctuate with the state of agriculture, and, during the
                    distress of 1815, the deficiency in this respect became alarming. It was then
                    that the clergy felt what they should have felt long before, that tithe was an
                    unsuitable and impolitic source of revenue. Application was made to parliament,
                    and the subject was for some time under serious discussion; but the rise of corn
                    in 1816 and 1817 prevented any other measure than an act founded on a committee
                    report of 18th June 1816, authorizing the possessors of tithes, laymen as well
                    as clergymen, to grant leases of them for a term not exceeding fourteen years.
                    The dissatisfaction with tithes has now, however, become so very general that we
                    have no doubt a commutation of some sort or other must shortly take place.</p>
                <p>A return to parliament, in June 1817, has specified the incomes of those
                    benefices where there is no parsonagehouse, or at least none that forms a
                    suitable residence.</p>

                    during the lives of the contracting parties. The lay impropriators of tithe, so
                    frequent in England, date from the dissolution of the monasteries in the reign
                    of Henry VIII.; patrons were then allowed to retain the tithes and glebe in
                    their own hands, without appointing a clergyman; in cases of such appointment,
                    the clergyman was called <hi rend="italic">vicarius</hi> or representative of
                    the patron.</p>
                <p>The dissenters in England are, first, the Presbyterians, who nearly coincide with
                    the church of England as to doctrine, but differ in church-government, allowing
                    no hierarchy in individuals; next the Independents, who go further, and disclaim
                    hierarchy in synods and other collective assemblies; thirdly, the well-known
                    sect of Quakers, who date from the middle of the seventeenth century; and,
                    lastly, the more numerous Methodists, who date from 1729. Of the Anabaptists,
                    the chief characteristic is their not receiving baptism till they become adults.
                    The Catholics in England are not numerous, but comprise a large proportion of
                    wealthy families.</p>
                <p>In regard to the mode of education in England, there is much .both to commend and
                    to censure. Scotland has for a century past been in possession of a larger
                    proportion of parish schools; but the utility of these is much lessened by an
                    established routine of teaching Latin to almost all youths, whatever be their
                    intended line of life. In England this absurdity is less prevalent, because most
                    of the schools are private undertakings, the managers of which are necessarily
                    guided by considerations of utility. The youth destined for a life of business
                    are thus saved a serious waste of time; their education, if imperfect, is not
                    supererogatory; but, on examining the higher seminaries of England, we find much
                    ground for disappointment, and many marks of a blind adherence to ancient usage.
                    Two universities are evidently inadequate for the education of the nobility, the
                    gentry, and the clergy of so populous a country. Their course of study, also, is
                    quite unsuitable to the future occupations of many of the students. They were
                    originally designed for the education of churchmen; and, to this day, Latin,
                    Greek, and mathematics form the chief objects of instruction. Under a government
                    which has so long borne the representative form, there are no classes for the
                    study of political science and legislation. In the country of Locke there are no
                    classes devoted to the study of the philosophy of the mind. In short, there are
                    scarcely any of those public lectures which, in the rest of Europe, constitute
                    the grand characteristic of a university, and distinguish it from schools; all,
                    or nearly all, is done by private tuition. Again, in point of constitution,
                    whilst in other countries a university forms, in general, one large association,
                    in England each college is a distinct body, having its head, its fellows, and
                    its students, who, as far as education is concerned, have very little connection
                    with the rest of the university. In one point, however, these venerable
                    seminaries redeem their faults, and assert the dignity of their character; we
                    mean in their public examinations. These, since the early part of the present
                    century, have been put on an admirable footing, both at Oxford and Cambridge;
                    distinguishing the relative degrees of proficiency with great accuracy, and
                    converting into a full and impartial trial that which in other universities is
                    almost always a mere matter of form.</p>
                <p>No country rivals England in the magnificence of her academical buildings. Whilst
                    in France, Germany, or Holland, an university possesses only a single pile of
                    building, Oxford and Cambridge can boast for every college a large, commodious,
                    and generally an elegant structure. The endowments appropriated to them are very
                    various, both in their origin and destination, but these arise chiefly from
                    land, and, having increased with the rise of rents, are in many cases very
                    ample. The destination of these funds is regulated by the bequest of the donors
                    and the established usage of the colleges; part going to the students under the
                    name of exhibitions or scholarships; part to the head and fellows; and a further
                    part consisting in livings, which devolve in succession on the fellows, and lead
                    to their removal from the university. A hall is an inferior college; an
                    academical establishment not incorporated or endowed, but possessed of
                    exhibitions or other provisions for students. Oxford has nineteen colleges and
                    five halls; Cambridge has twelve colleges and four halls.</p>
                <p>Within these few years two institutions of a novel kind, the London University
                    and King’s College, have been founded in the metropolis, in the view of
                    obviating the defects complained of at Oxford and Cambridge, and of cheapening
                    and diffusing the advantages of an academical education; but their success has
                    not corresponded with the expectations of their projectors. Their constitution
                    appears ill fitted to attain the objects in view; and it is very questionable,
                    unless they be materially modified, whether they will ever be of any material
                    service. The education which they afford is neither very good nor very
                    cheap.</p>
                <p>Boys in England are taught the classics, either in the lesser schools established
                    at every town of consequence throughout the kingdom, or at the great public
                    schools. Of the latter, the principal are Eton, Westminster, Winchester, and
                    Harrow; also the Charter-house, St Paul’s, and Merchant Tailors’ School. These
                    seminaries, at present so expensive, and attended by youths of the first family,
                    had their origin in a fund or provision set apart for scholars of humbler birth.
                    ' This has served as the basis of a stately superstructure, each school having
                    attracted, by the advantage of situation or the repute of the teachers, a much
                    greater number of pupils in independent circumstances. But in each a proportion
                    of the scholars are still on the foundation. At Eton there are seventy thus
                    provided for; and the same number at Winchester.<note anchored="true"

                <p>A compulsory provision for the support of the poor has existed in England for a
                    lengthened period. Its introduction dates from the reign of Henry VIII., and it
                    was perfected in that of Elizabeth; the famous statute of the 43d Eliz. cap. 2,
                    having embodied all the principles, with many of the regulations, still to be
                    found in the system. The law has, however, been repeatedly modified, and very
                    great alterations have taken place in its administration. These changes will be
                    fully detailed in our article on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Poor-Laws</hi>; and in
                    it also the reader will find an examination of the important and difficult
                    question as to the policy of a compulsory provision for the support of the
                    unemployed poor. Here we have only to state what has been the amount of the
                    rates levied on account of the poor, from what sources they have been derived,
                    and how they have been distributed.</p>

                <p>It is obvious, from the preceding tables, that, allowing for the increase of
                    population, the increase of the rates has not been nearly so great as is
                    commonly supposed. In point of fact, too, more than half the rates really form
                    part of the wages of labour. The pernicious practice of ekeing out wages by
                    means of contributions from the rates began in 1795; and as it forms at this
                    moment one of the principal evils in the state of the English poor, we may be
                    excused, perhaps, for subjoining the following statements illustrative of its
                    tendency.</p>
                <p>“The price of corn, which had, upon an average of the three preceding years,
                    averaged 54s., rose in 1795 to 74s. As wages continued stationary at their
                    former elevation, the distress of the poor was very great; and many ablebodied
                    labourers, who had rarely before applied for parish assistance, became claim <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> hnts for relief. But instead of meeting this
                    emergency as it ought to have been met, by temporary expedients, and by grants
                    of relief proportioned to the exigency of every given ease, one uniform system
                    was adopted. The magistrates of Berks, and some <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193333457" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3457-0792"/>other southern counties,
                    issued tables, showing the wages which, as they affirmed, every labouring man
                    ought to receive, according to the variations in the number of his family, and
                    the price of bread; and they accompanied these tables with an order, directing
                    the parish officers to make up the deficit to the labourer, in the event of the
                    wages paid him by his employers falling short of the tabular allowance. An act
                    was at the same time passed to allow the justices to administer relief out of
                    the workhouse, and also to relieve such poor persons as had property of their
                    own. As might have been expected, this system did not cease with the temporary
                    circumstances which gave it birth, but has ever since been acted upon. It is now
                    almost universally established in the southern half of England, and has been
                    productive of an extent of mischief that could hardly have been conceived
                    possible.</p>
                <p>“It is needless to dwell on the folly of attempting to make the wages of labour
                    vary directly and immediately with every change in the price of bread. Every one
                    must see, that if this system were <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> acted upon,
                    if the poor were always supplied with the power of purchasing an equal quantity
                    of corn, whether it happened to be abundant and cheap, or scarce and dear, they
                    could have no motive to lessen their consumption in seasons when the supply is
                    deficient, so that the whole pressure of the scarcity would, in such cases, be
                    removed from them and thrown entirely upon the other, and chiefly the middle
                    classes. But, not to insist on this point, let us look at the practical
                    operation of this system as it affects the labourer and his employers. The
                    allowance scales now issued frqm time to time by the magistrates are usually
                    framed on the principle that every labourer should have a gallon loaf of
                    standard wheaten bread weekly for every member of his family and one over; that
                    is, four loaves for three persons, five for four, six for five, and so on.
                    Suppose, now, that the gallon loaf costs Is. 6d., and that the average rate of
                    wages in any particular district is 8s. a week, A, an industrious unmarried
                    labourer, will get 8s.; but B has a wife and four children, hence he claims
                    seven gallon loaves, or 10s. 6d. a week; and as wages are only 8s∙, he gets 2s∙
                    6d. a week from the parish. C, again, has a wife and six children; he
                    consequently requires nine gallon loaves, or 13s. 6d. a week, and gets of course
                    a pension, over and above his wages, of 5s. 6d. D is so idle and disorderly that
                    no one will employ him, but he has a wife and five children, and is in
                    consequence entitled to eight gallon loaves for their support, so that he must
                    have a pension of 12s∙ a week to support him in his dissolute mode of life.</p>
                <p>“It is clear that this system, by making the parish allowance to labourers
                    increase with every increase in the number of their children, acts as a bounty
                    on marriage, and that, by increasing the supply of labourers beyond the demand,
                    it necessarily depresses the rate of wages. And it is further clear, that by
                    giving the same allowance to the idle and disorderly as to the industrious and
                    well-behaved workman, it operates as a premium on idleness and profligacy, and
                    takes away some of the most powerful motives to industry and good conduct.
                    These, however, are not the only effects of this system. Under its operation a
                    labourer dares not venture to earn beyond a certain amount; for if he did, his
                    allowance from the parish would either be withheld altogether, or proportionally
                    reduced. In consequence, working by the piece is now comparatively unknown in
                    the southern counties of England; and the whole labouring population are reduced
                    to the condition of paupers, deprived of the means and almost of the desire to
                    emerge from the state of helotism in which they are sunk.</p>
                <p>“It must be obvious to every one, that if we would avert the plague of universal
                    poverty from the land, a vigorous effort must be made to counteract this system;
                    and we have experience to teach us how this may be done. All, in fact, that is
                    necessary, is to revert to the regulations established previously to 1795, to
                    abolish every vestige of the allowance system, and to enact that henceforth no
                    able-bodied labourer shall have a legal claim for relief, unless he consent to
                    accept it in a workhouse. This condition would go far to prevent relief from
                    being claimed by any except the really necessitous; for there is nothing of
                    which the idle and disorderly are so much afraid, as of the strict discipline,
                    scanty fare, and hard labour that ought to be enforced in every workhouse«. It
                    is not, however, meant to recommend that relief should in all cases be refused
                    except to the inmates of such establish-, ments∙ In the great majority of
                    instances, that temporary assistance which the able-bodied poor only require may
                    be more advantageously afforded at their own houses. But to prevent its being
                    abused, it is indispensable that authority to refuse it, except under condition
                    of residence in a workhouse, and of unconditional submission to all its
                    regulations, should be vested in the administrators of the law. The maimed and
                    impotent poor may, in all cases, be more cheaply and better provided for in
                    their own houses than in workhouses.</p>
                <p>“Were the change now proposed effected, most of the inconveniences attached to
                    the poor-laws would be removed, and their salutary and sustaining influence
                    would alone remain.” (M‘Culloch’s <hi rend="italic">Principles of Political
                    Economy,</hi> 2d edit. pp. 418-421.)</p>

                <p>These consist, of course, principally of the army and navy. But as detailed
                    accounts, derived from the very best sources, are given, under the articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Army</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Navy</hi> in this work, of
                    all the most important particulars relating to the history and present state of
                    each of these grand departments of the public force, it would be quite
                    superfluous to enter into any details with respect to them in this place. The
                    subjoined accounts of revenue and expenditure during the three years ended with
                    1831, contain statements of the number of troops and seamen, and of the expense
                    incurred on account of each branch of the service, in each of these years. They
                    seem, there fore, to include every thing to which it is necessary to direct the
                    reader’s attention in this place.</p>
                <p>Exclusively of the army and navy, great numbers of in dividuals in all parts of
                    the country are enrolled as special constables, who may be called upon by the
                    magistrates and other civil authorities to assist in suppressing disorders, and
                    in preserving the public peace. In London and in other great towns strong bodies
                    of police are also employed, constituting, as it were, a half military and half
                    civil force.</p>

                <p>The various taxes, the produce of which forms the public revenue of the kingdom,

                <p>XIII.— <hi rend="italic">National Debt.</hi></p>
                <p>The national debt consists, as every one knows, of sums borrowed to make up
                    deficiencies of revenue. It originated during the wars carried on by William
                    III. against France. Its contraction was then not a matter of choice, but of
                    necessity; for, owing to the numerous adherents the exiled family of Stuart had
                    in the country, it would have been impossible to have imposed such an amount of
                    taxes as would have sufficed to defray the expenses of the war, without
                    inflaming the popular discontent to such a degree as would most probably have
                    been subversive of the new government. At first it was usual to fund the amount
                    of stock equal to the sums borrowed; but since the reign of George II. a
                    different practice has obtained; and it has been judged advisable to fund
                    generally in a stock bearing a low rate of interest, by proportionally
                    increasing its amount. Thus suppose interest were five per cent, and that
                    government wished to borrow in three per cent, stock; in such a case they would
                    give L.166Ş of stock for every L.100 money paid into the exchequer. By
                    affording, in consequence of the increase of the stock, greater scope for
                    speculation, this practice is supposed to have enabled government to borrow on
                    rather lower terms at the time; but, by disabling them from reducing the
                    interest on such loans at the close of a war, when the market rate of interest
                    uniformly falls, it has proved most signally injurious. It is not going too far
                    to say that this blunder costs the public at this moment L.7,000,000 a year.</p>
                <p>Since 1817 a deduction has been made of about sixty-four millions from the
                    principal of the debt, and about 5∣∙ millions from the interest on its account.
                    This diminution has been principally effected by taking advantage of the fall in
                    the rate of interest since the peace, and offering to pay off the holders of the
                    different stocks unless they consented to accept of a reduced payment; and had
                    it not been for the highly objectionable practice already adverted to, of
                    funding large capitals at a low rate of interest, the saving in this way would
                    have been incomparably larger. We subjoin an account of the funded and unfunded
                    debt of Great Britain and Ireland as at 5th January 1833.</p>

                <p>A sinking fund for the extinction of the public debt was established by Sir
                    Robert Walpole as early as 1716; but it was virtually subverted in 1733. It was
                    again instituted by Mr Pitt in 1786; and, singular as it may now appear, it was
                    for a lengthened period supposed, that by means of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >legerdemain</hi> operation of compound interest, the public debt might be
                    reduced by borrowing money to pay it off. Dr Hamilton of Aberdeen has the merit
                    of having dissipated this extraordinary delusion, the grossest, certainly, by
                    which any civilized nation ever suffered itself to be imposed upon. He showed
                    that the excess of revenue over expenditure is the only real sinking fund, —the
                    only means by which any portion of the public debt had ever been, or ever could
                    bc, paid off; and that all sinking funds operating at compound interest, or
                    otherwise, excepting in as far as they happened to be founded on this principle,
                    were mere quackery and delusion. In fact, upon examining into the matter, it was
                    found that the public debt would have been decidedly less had the sinking fund
                    never been heard of. After such an exposition, the existence of the sinking fund
                    was impossible; and having undergone various modifications, it was finally
                    abolished by the 10th Geo. IV. cap. 27, which enacts, that the sum thenceforth
                    annually applicable to the reduction of the public debt shall consist of the <hi
                    rend="italic">actual surplus revenue beyond the expenditure.</hi> In 1832 this
                    surplus amounted to L.614,758. 18s. 8d.</p>
                <p>XIV.— <hi rend="italic">Population.</hi></p>
                <p>The population of England and Wales at periods antecedent to 1801, can only be
                    determined by computations founded on the returns obtained under poll and hearth
                    taxes, and on the registers of births and deaths. Unfortunately, however, none
                    of these affords data from which the amount of population can be accurately
                    deduced. During the latter part of last century the uncertaintyin which this
                    subject was involved afforded materials for a keen controversy, which was
                    carried on by Dr Price on the one hand, and by Mr Howlett, vicar of Dunmow in
                    Essex, and Mr Hales, on the other. The former contended that population had been
                    declining in England from the Revolution downwards, and that it did not in 1777
                    exceed 4,763,000. Mr Howlett, however, showed conclusively that no reliance
                    could be placed on either Dr Price’s facts or arguments; and that there could be
                    no reasonable doubt that the population had materially increased in the interval
                    between-1700 and 1780. The returns obtained under the population acts put an end
                    to this controversy, and proved the general accuracy of Mr Howlett’s
                    conclusions. The population, as deduced from them, after allowing for their
                    defects and inaccuracies, is as follows :—</p>

                <p>The following table contains an account of the houses inhabited; building, and
                    uninhabited, the number of families, the distribution of families according to
                    their occupations, with the number of males and the number of females, in
                    England and Wales in the year 1821. It is necessary, however, to observe that
                    the classification of employments is not ín any degree to be depended upon; but
                    as it has been frequently referred to, we think, it right to lay it before the
                    reader. A much more scientific and elaborate classification of employments was
                    made under the census of 1831; but the results have not hitherto been
                    published.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the defective state of the registers of marriages, births, and
                    deaths, the results deduced fróm^ <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> them are such
                    as to establish beyond all question the fact of an extraordinary improvement
                    having taken place in the healthiness of the mass of the-people. Although about
                    919,000 were added to the population of England and Wales in the intérval
                    between 1780 and 1800, the annual average number of burials did not differ
                    materially <pb break="no" facs="nls:193333561" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3561-0800"
                    />during that period.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Preliminary Remarks to Census of 1821. p. 2G.</p></note> It appears from the
                    returns, that in 1780 the rate of mortality in England and Wales was one in
                    forty; meaning by this, that one fortieth part of the whole population died
                    annually. In 1790 the rate of mortality was reduced to one in forty-five. During
                    the five years ending with 1800, it was one in forty-eight; during the five
                    years ending with 1810, one in fifty-one; and during the five years ending with
                    1820, it had sunk to one in fifty-seven. During the five years ending with 1830,
                    it seems to have slightly increased; having been, at an average of that period,
                    one in fifty-four. See the subjoined table.</p>
                <p>This extraordinary decrease of mortality is no doubt owing to a variety of
                    causes; such as, the greater prevalence of habits of sobriety and cleanliness;
                    the better lodging, feeding, and clothing of the labouring classes; improvements
                    in medical science, &amp;c. But to whatever it may be owing, it affords
                    unquestionable evidence of the signally improved condition of the
                    population.</p>
                <p>The increase of longevity has been particularly conspicuous in London and other
                    great towns. During the first half of last century, the mortality in the
                    metropolis is believed to have been as high as one in twenty-four; and it
                    required, down to the American war, large supplies of recruits from the country
                    to keep up its numbers. But from 1770 the rate of mortality has been gradually
                    diminishing. In 1790 the births for the first time exceeded the burials; and
                    since then the city would have gone on increasing, though it had not been
                    indebted to the country for a single immigrant. In Manchester, Bristol, &amp;c.
                    the improvement has been equally striking.</p>
                <p>The proportion of births and marriages to the population has continued pretty
                    nearly stationary since 1790. We subjoin a table of the annual proportion of
                    baptisms, burials, and marriages, to the population of England; calculated upon
                    an average of the totals of such baptisms, burials, and marriages in the five
                    years preceding the several enumerations of 1801, 1811, 1821, and 1831, and
                    distinguishing the several counties.</p>

                <p>XV.— <hi rend="italic">Crimes in England and Wales.</hi></p>
                <p>Crimes of violence have greatly decreased in England during the last half
                    century. Highway robbery, once so prevalent, is now almost unknown; and though
                    murders are occasionally perpetrated, they are not numerous compared with the
                    amount of population. Latterly, however, the crime of arson has made a great and
                    alarming progress; and, from the facility with which it may be committed, the
                    difficulty of detection, and the destruction of property and life it is almost
                    sure to occasion, no means should be left untried which may tend to arrest its
                    progress. There would seem, from the accounts laid before parlia ment, to be of
                    late years a very great increase in the offences against property. We believe,
                    however, that much of this increase is apparent only, resulting from the
                    establishment of a police force in most great towns, and from the consequent
                    commitment and punishment of numerous culprits who were formerly allowed to
                    escape. The law of England as to capital punishments has recently been much
                    modified; and various opinions are entertained as to what will be the effect of
                    the change. It has, however, been too recently effected, to allow of any
                    inferences being drawn as to its practical operation. The subjoined tables give
                    a very complete view of the state of crime in England and Wales during the seven
                    years ending with 1832.</p>

                <p>GOVERNMENT AND LAWS.</p>
                <p>I.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Government.</hi></p>
                <p>“B<hi rend="smallcaps">y</hi> the constitution of a country, is meant so much of
                    its law as relates to the designation and form of the legislature; the rights
                    and functions of the several parts of the legislative body; the construction,
                    office, and jurisdiction of courts of justice.” This is the definition given by
                    Paley. It seems necessary to add also, “whatever prerogatives are vested in the
                    executive at least, in case any powers and privileges are conferred on it beyond
                    what, from being indispensable to the administration of the public affairs of a
                    community, must be common alike to all executives. Even with this addition, the
                    mere mechanism of a government, in the three principal relations which it bears
                    to its subjects, is all that is here described. Yet something more is generally
                    understood by a constitution, and would seem to be properly comprehended under
                    that name. A government, it is true, may and must be influenced in a hundred
                    ways by independent circumstances, and by manifold considerations, which are no
                    part of it. But when certain specific tendencies and principles are directly and
                    designedly moulded into its original conformation as so many distinct ends and
                    maxims, or when they are subsequently developed by it or incorporated with it,
                    so as to guide and qualify its spirit, they become entitled to the character of
                    constitutional as much as the organization itself. There is no doubt that the
                    mechanism of a government, if left to itself, will mainly determine the nature
                    and direction of its movements; yet this mechanism consists of a moral and
                    intellectual agency. It is accordingly capable of accommodating itself, and of
                    working in subjection to whatever rules and impulses may be impressed upon it by
                    the society whose instrument it is.</p>
                <p>No society can be so stationary but that changes must take place, sooner or
                    later, for the better or for the worse, in some one or other of the conditions,
                    whether of principle or of organization, which make up its constitution. When
                    these happen to take place, hardly any society can have been so judiciously
                    constructed from the first, or be so fortunate in all its future circumstances,
                    that lawyers shall be able at once to call every change which is for the worse,
                    unconstitutional, and which is for the better, constitutional. An approximation
                    to this favourable situation has been one of the great and innumerable
                    advantages of the uniform and gradual progress by which the English constitution
                    has been distinguished. Its history is the history of the internal policy of a
                    people, who at every advance in civilization succeeded in occupying one advanced
                    post after another, fortifying their free position at every remove. The early
                    prospect would have discouraged the most sanguine philosopher. But the evil
                    tendencies were suppressed, and the good ones brought forward, until the process
                    appears to resemble the natural development by which a germ grows up into a
                    plant, with but little occasional help from the pruning hand of man. Precisely
                    the reverse might have happened. It is what takes place during that
                    imperceptible decay, which, by a foolish analogy to vegetable and animal life,
                    it has been supposed that institutions are also destined to undergo. The bulk of
                    mankind more easily perceive that abrupt and extensive changes, the innovations
                    by which new principles, or a new organization, are introduced, amount in fact,
                    as far as they go, to a new constitution. This may be done legally or illegally.
                    If illegally, it is a revolution; a case which by the supposition has nothing to
                    do with law. If legally, the letter of the law and the forms of the constitution
                    may be used for the purpose of substituting a worse as well as a better
                    government to the extent that the ancient constitution is displaced. The
                    question, what name will most properly describe any specific measure of this
                    class? must depend upon the nature and degree of the measure. There is on these
                    occasions another question for a people, prior in time, and far more important
                    than discussions about a name. It is their duty to ascertain whether the
                    proposed change is, under all the circumstances, a practicable improvement, and
                    to fix where the authority for deciding this point can, upon the whole, be most
                    safely lodged. A comparison of the different methods by which the latter problem
                    can be solved will show what little cause there is for maintaining, as some
                    modern writers are disposed to do, that the course adopted in England is too
                    loose and arbitrary to be consistent with the positive character implied in a
                    constitution.</p>
                <p>Three very different systems may prevail in this respect. The two first are
                    alluded to rather than recognised in English history. Its whole tenor proceeds
                    upon the last.</p>
                <p>Every country has at one time or another given more or less countenance, upon
                    some favourite points, to the delusion of fundamental laws and unalienable
                    rights; meaning by these, laws and rights incapable of alteration, except by a
                    violence or decay equivalent to the suspension, if not dissolution, of society.
                    Confounding the principle of moral and of legal obligation, Chief-Justice
                    Hobart, from the bench, and Blackstone, calmly writing in his closet for the
                    instruction of the eighteenth century, concur in stating that the supreme power
                    of every state is necessarily subject to one condition. By this condition, all
                    legislative commands against natural justice must be void in themselves, that
                    is, void in law. With much less latitude than has often been given to the law of
                    nature and to the rights of man, this exception might be made to cover extensive
                    and dangerous ground. Lord Coke, for example, has said, that a statute against
                    Magna Charta, or one to prevent the Irish from coming into England, would be
                    void. In this manner the Stuarts were taught by servile judges to believe that
                    most of the prerogatives anciently affixed to the crown were irrevocable even by
                    act of parliament. A similar opinion, grounded on the doctrine of the three
                    estates of the realm, was formerly propagated concerning the episcopal right of
                    sharing in the legislature. At the Reformation, Bishop Gardiner conceived, that
                    in consequence of the forced absence of himself and his brethren, its
                    proceedings would be of none effect. The example was followed, but equally in
                    vain, when, during the violent re-action provoked by Charles I., who considered
                    himself as so pre-eminently a Church of England king, the bishops protested
                    against all acts passed in their absence by a parliament no longer free. Charles
                    I. held the very act by which the bishops were excluded, although some of them
                    attended and voted against it, to be <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> null. The
                    more intelligent a nation really becomes, the less likely is it thus to presume
                    in favour of the political optimism of its own or of former times. No fiction
                    can be more gratuitously mischievous than the creed that there can be any thing
                    in the force of invading arms in 1066, or in the authority of national wisdom in
                    1688, or in any length of prescription whatsoever, to disable successive
                    generations from exercising their own discretion respecting the propriety of
                    their existing institutions.</p>
                <p>Another plan is to set apart, in a written charter or declaration, certain
                    excepted cases. The high matters which are the chosen objects of this deliberate
                    sanction, are conceived to acquire thereby the privilege of being placed beyond
                    the control of the ordinary legislature, and of being reserved for the direct
                    volition of the body of the people. Locke, in treating of the right of popular
                    resistance, seems to have stated too broadly, that the power of <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> community can never be exercised in this manner under any
                    form of government, because such a proceeding, he says, presumes the government
                    to be dissolved. Blackstone (vol. i. p. 161) expresses himself still more
                    strongly to the same effect, adding, that no government will presuppose its own
                    destruction. The contemplated occasions are neither as extreme in theory nor as
                    impracticable in execution as this language would represent. There is really no
                    question in this case about resistance, nor what can reasonably be called
                    dissolution. Whilst, on the one hand, the law has nothing to do with
                    possibilities belonging to the ultimate and latent right of resistance; on the
                    other, the idea of a supreme power which may be lawfully resisted in points
                    where it is called supreme, is of course a contradiction. Thus in an absolute
                    government society must be remitted to its first principles before the right of
                    popular interposition can be recognised by it. An ordinance of Louis XIV.
                    declared that the extinction of the family of Bourbon would raise a case of this
                    kind, and that on the occurrence of such event the right of electing to the
                    crown of France would revert to the French people. But limited governments stand
                    in an entirely different position. Minor contingencies, far short of the
                    transgressions which justify an appeal to arms, or of the accident which summons
                    a nation to the <hi rend="italic">Champ du Mars</hi> to agree upon a successor
                    to a vacant throne, are part of their necessities. The entire legislature may be
                    Only supreme <hi rend="italic">sub</hi><hi rend="italic">modo.</hi> For under
                    the doctrine both of fundamental laws and constitutional charters, every variety
                    of restriction may be imposed upon the legislature. The prudence of these
                    restrictions is more than problematical. But wherever a government consists of
                    several parts possessing coordinate authority, the demand for some external
                    control necessarily arises; since encroachments of one part on the other must be
                    expected; and means ought to be arranged beforehand for bringing them back
                    peaceably within their proper limits.</p>
                <p>In this manner, wherever the doctrine of fundamental laws is admitted, a
                    sufficient authority, as, for instance, a high court of justice, should be
                    created for the purpose of inquiring into and correcting any violation of them
                    with which the ordinary legislature may happen to be charged. It will be
                    necessary, besides, to chalk out, as in primary assemblies or otherwise, the
                    extraordinary course by which the policy of the fundamental laws themselves may
                    be reviewed, as occasion shall require. Both these precautions have been
                    introduced and satisfactorily applied by the founders of the United States. But
                    they are not wanted for this purpose by the English constitution. For,
                    notwithstanding a few fanciful conjectures, as above, at times incautiously or
                    intemperately hazarded, the English constitution is not established on any
                    strictly fundamental laws, and still less are any specific questions reserved by
                    it for the direct intervention of the people. But there are analogous dilemmas
                    which may arise under it as a limited and a mixed monarchy. Many, indeed most,
                    of these dilemmas appear to be left open to the chances of unnecessary
                    aggravation, by the want of some similar arrangement. A government, composed of
                    several members with distinct powers, can only exist as such on the supposition
                    that they each remain content with their own share, or that, in case one should
                    trespass on the other, the irregularity can be set right by recurring to
                    expedients legally providing for the emergency. Every one of the triple
                    divisions of the English legislature has in its turn made experimental
                    encroachments, against which there exist but imperfect and often very circuitous
                    guards in the constitution. By the law of constructive contempts, once so
                    flagrantly abused, either house of parliament is armed <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193745297" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5297-0003"/>with a despotic weapon. This
                    weapon is beginning to gather a prudential rust in the sheath at present; but
                    the want or the jealousy of a superior court is a poor excuse for allowing it to
                    continue there at all. The mysticism belonging to the maxim that the king can do
                    no wrong, coupled with the recognised absence of any remedy against the crown
                    for any possible amount of misgovernment, proved the ruin of the Stuarts. It
                    encouraged them in the opinion that the supreme power was lodged, not merely in
                    part, but wholly, in the sovereign, and that it might be abused with legal
                    impunity. The 16th Charles IL, as renewed by 6 William and Mary, declares that a
                    new parliament shall be called within three years of the determination of the
                    former; but no measures are taken by either statute for the assembling of a
                    parliament in case the king should not choose to call one. The security is left
                    to the old indirect check, the stoppage of the supplies, and to the new one,
                    which, by means of the annual mutiny act, has been derived from a source where
                    an aid to freedom could hardly have been expected, namely, the innovation of a
                    standing army. There is at present abundance of rectifying principle and of
                    auxiliary appliances in the sounder portions of the English constitution, which
                    will prop up the rest, and hold the feebler part to its work. Otherwise the
                    history of the Habeas Corpus act is a striking proof of the inadequacy of all
                    general declarations. In doubtful times these are merely waste paper, unless
                    accompanied by positive arrangements for carrying them into execution, and
                    subjected to proportionate penalties on their infringement and neglect. The act
                    of l’B Charles I. had provided, that if the king neglected to call a parliament
                    for three years, the peers might assemble and issue writs for choosing one; and,
                    in case of neglect by the peers, the constituents might meet and elect one
                    themselves. This act was repealed with great ignominy at the Restoration. But it
                    seems to have left the crown its due precedence, and to have provided, with as
                    little impatience as possible, for the securing an object which all parties are
                    agreed it is absolutely necessary some way or other to secure. The debates upon
                    the command of the militia previously to the breaking out of the civil war, are
                    a memorable instance of the folly of leaving great constitutional rights in
                    obscurity up to the fatal hour when they can no longer be settled calmly and on
                    reasonable terms. If it be important to define rights in times of tranquillity,
                    it is no less so to provide the particular forms by which, in case of violation,
                    the remedy may be applied. It is true that these collisions approach to the
                    character of revolutions. When a king has so far separated himself from his
                    parliament, there is little chance of their returning to that harmony by which
                    alone a constitutional monarchy subsists. No previous arrangements can
                    completely meet the crisis after it has occurred; but they may mitigate its
                    severity, and, by the mere fact of their known existence, may do the still more
                    acceptable service of preventing its occurrence.</p>
                <p>According to the third and remaining plan, the constitution recognises the
                    existing legislature as supreme for all purposes whatsoever. To this plan the
                    English nation has always stedfastly adhered. From the time when the commons of
                    England were adopted into the legislature (49 Hen. HL), or shortly afterwards,
                    the legislature has, without any deviation worth mentioning, been the
                    parliament; that is, the king, lords, and commons, in parliament assembled. The
                    popularity of parliaments has been so paramount throughout, that the public have
                    never until recent times been tempted to look elsewhere for rules, inclinations,
                    or opinions. The supremacy of parliament kept its hold, like an anchor which
                    nothing could shake, in the most stormy seasons, and under every variety of
                    circumstance. The impossibility of complying with the customary forms was
                    satisfied as often as it occurred, by the nearest approximation which could be
                    obtained. This was no less remarkable in the course taken as far back as the
                    supposed resignations of Edward II. and Richard IL, than on the later occasions
                    of the imperfect convention parliaments. Nobody suggested the propriety of
                    calling together the people to restore Charles IL, or to instal William III.
                    into the vacant throne. Mr Hallam observes, that in the combination of gift,
                    descent, and popular election, which took place on the accession of Henry IV. in
                    the year 1399, there was as great formality as in 1688, making due allowance for
                    times and men. The semblance of election remained with the members of the <hi
                    rend="italic">quasi-</hi> parliament. They had been summoned by the king’s writ,
                    but, from not having his commission, they did not take that solemn name, and
                    only called themselves the estates of the realm. Wherever it was possible to
                    preserve by fictions the appearance of a regular parliament, fictions were
                    called in. Thus, during the infancy of Henry VI. the shadow of the royal infant,
                    then only nine months old, opened his first parliament, and made appointments
                    during pleasure. On the derangement of George III. the regency was appointed
                    under the great seal. To keep up the entireness of the body politic of the
                    state, the cooperation and personal will of the king were necessarily assumed in
                    the very act which was to supply his personal incapacity. It was from the court
                    of parliament that Richard III. obtained a confirmation of his alleged title. He
                    rested upon it as “the known quieter of men’s minds ;” and the Earl of Surrey
                    appealed to it as the one conclusive authority, when taunted afterwards by the
                    successful competitor for the crown upon Bosworth Field. Though Wolsey, “hating
                    parliaments,” which therefore hated him, “had been the means that none was
                    holden in the realm but one for the space of fourteen years yet Henry VIII. told
                    them that he was informed by his judges that he was never so great as when
                    sitting there in his estate royal. The great test of the omnipotence of
                    parliament was its power of altering the succession. This, which was the
                    established doctrine of the prior period, it was by a statute of Elizabeth made
                    treason to deny. At the beginning of the civil wars, Charles I. called the peers
                    together at York; and the cavalier members seceded from the House of Commons.
                    Under these circumstances a metaphysical question might easily have been raised,
                    as to which was the real parliament. But the locality of Westminster was like
                    keeping the field of battle. It decided the direction of that wonderful and
                    superstitious homage, which made Clarendon complain that “an implicit reverence
                    for the name of parliament was the fatal disease of the whole kingdom.” The
                    substance and vitality, however, of the institutions to which the entire
                    authority of national legislation is transferred, are still more important than
                    the name. For this purpose their independence as intelligent deliberative
                    assemblies must be secured. No question can be made concerning open violence.
                    Any attempt by intimidation to force the repeal of a law or a' change of
                    measures, or to overawe either house, is treason. But, further than this, no
                    minority or fraction of the people must be allowed to exercise over the
                    legislature an influence of opinion, which the constitution does not attribute
                    to the people at large, or at least does not provide them with the means of
                    exercising. This is a subject of great delicacy; but still there must be some
                    limits. Accordingly, both in law and practice, limits more or less elastic have
                    been put on the nature and degree even of the moral pressure which may be urged
                    on parliament from without.</p>
                <p>Tumultuous petitions having been carried to a great <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193745310" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5310-0004"/>excess during the long
                    parliament, the statute 13 Charles IL in consequence, imposed several
                    restrictions upon petitions for any alteration in church or state. But
                    notwithstanding the opinion of Mr Dunning, and the present practice, these
                    restraints have been judicially determined not to be affected by the bill of
                    rights. Mr Hallam says that he has traced public meetings for the debate of
                    political questions no higher than the year 1769, and, subject to very few
                    exceptions, petitions simply political not quite so high. Rights of this kind,
                    guaranteed to the body of the people, and liberally construed, appear to be
                    supplemental to a representation which stops short of annual parliaments and
                    universal suffrage. They are the democratical counterpart to addresses of
                    loyalty to the throne, and of confidence in the government, which are said by
                    Evelyn to have come in even in the time of Cromwell. The right will probably not
                    be used, certainly not used frequently, till a want of sympathy between the
                    representative body and the people, or particular classes, begins to be
                    suspected. The sense of the public, so taken, may often be found to clash with
                    the sense of particular constituencies. In this case, two questions necessarily
                    arise for a member’s consideration: first, what weight either one or the other
                    ought to have as mere authority in overruling his own opinion; and, next, which
                    of them, in the event of competition, is entitled to a preference. The same
                    constitutional answer will apply to both difficulties. The inclination on the
                    part of the English constitution appears to have settled down, after some
                    previous oscillation, to one consistent course, as soon as the commons began to
                    feel and act up to their real dignity and strength. A member must necessarily be
                    returned for a particular place. The question is, Are his duties therefore
                    local? The terms of the writ of summons had all along plainly signified that,
                    although chosen by a single district, he was chosen for the wants and service of
                    the realm. Nevertheless many instances formerly occurred of the commons begging
                    for time to consult with their constituents. It may naturally be presumed that
                    this was nothing more than a timid way of evading unreasonable requests. Because
                    their ancestors, afraid of Edward IIĽs designs upon their subsidies and
                    fifteenths, had declined to be made consulting parties to his wars, it was
                    absurd in James I. to imagine that he could altogether call away from politics
                    the English gentry of his day. Yet at so late a period no less a person than
                    Burghley condescended to argue against the propriety of the interference of the
                    House of Commons in matters of war and peace; and to take the distinct ground
                    that its members by its institution had minds only of a compass each for the
                    place which he served. But parliament had already heard the contrary within its
                    walls. The movement of society which had made it impossible to execute the
                    statute requiring the member of a district to be an inhabitant, had brought out,
                    in the reign of Elizabeth, the first parliamentary declaration in behalf of the
                    complete legislative authority of members of the House of Commons, in full
                    accordance with the letter and fconditions of the ancient writ. In the
                    declaration that members were to act not only for their constituents, but for
                    the whole kingdom, it was evident that a great principle was proclaimed. If
                    sycophants then contested it, Mr Hallam, speaking of modern days, says very
                    truly, that it is one which at present “none but the servile worshippers of the
                    populace are ever found to gainsay.” The weightiest arguments in Burke’s letter
                    to the sheriff of Bristol, against particular instructions, are little more than
                    the application and extension of this principle. The necessity of going back to
                    their constituents for a specific assent, was one of the main grounds of that
                    incompetency to the duties of a representative assembly which faci litated the
                    ruin of the states-general of France. A few votes beyond what a question would
                    have obtained upon its general merits may thus be stolen, and a few individuals
                    may thus push themselves forward into temporary notice. But public opinion can
                    never be truly ascertained, any more than the public interest comprehensively
                    promoted, by desultory and individual pledges. For this purpose the public must
                    act in concert. With this view, kings of England have sought to satisfy
                    themselves and the House of Lords with regard to the reality of the public
                    sentiments, by a dissolution addressed to specific points. On the occasion of Mr
                    Fox’s India bill, the new members were expected to bring to the House of Commons
                    an answer concerning the royal choice of particular men as ministers; and on the
                    occasion of the Reform Bill, concerning the policy of a particular measure. This
                    is the utmost advance which the English constitution has made towards admitting
                    the doctrine of the will of the people or the instructions of constituents. So
                    narrowed, it is a proper, and at times an indispensable part of every rational
                    system of representation. It is practically quite consistent with the general
                    rule that the select body of electors are trustees for the entire community; and
                    that their representatives are the only organ by which the public will is on all
                    subjects ultimately and conclusively expressed.</p>
                <p>This then is the English system. It seems to be an extreme and fanciful subtilty
                    to doubt whether the title and character of a constitution can properly belong
                    to it. It is something in its favour that it can appeal to experience as
                    practically embodied in a government, now of ancient standing, at once the most
                    progressive and the most permanent which the world has ever yet seen. Why is it
                    less a constitution because it gives to its ordinary contemporary legislature
                    the most plenary attributes of supreme political power, and because it disclaims
                    the supposition that its early constitutional legislation had or could have the
                    sanction of any higher authority? The assent of any one generation can be of
                    neither greater nor less value than that of another. It is not wonderful that a
                    society, setting up for itself for the first time, or obliged by circumstances
                    to begin anew in an enlightened age, should try to build upon the basis of
                    fundamental laws. But it is fortunate for a constitution, of which the first
                    stone was laid in haste and ignorance, and in the dark, and which nevertheless
                    always kept so far in advance of its contemporaries, as to serve other nations
                    for the model whence the criticisms have been derived by which its
                    irregularities were afterwards to be condemned, that it started with no similar
                    pretensions. If it were to suit the ages through which it was to endure, it
                    could only do so by a plastic mode of conformation. In this manner its people
                    were educated along with it and up to it, the two acting and re-acting upon each
                    other. Hence an instinctive intelligence and conformity, otherwise almost
                    unattainable, appear to have been secured, which political changes have hitherto
                    slightly disturbed. Some bad logic, and a few incidental anomalies, are a small
                    price to pay for conciliating opinions and smoothing over the transitions
                    through which, in the course of centuries, an improving nation has to pass. But
                    the mode in which these alterations have been made is objected to. The body of
                    the people, it is said, ought to have legislated upon them in their own persons.
                    It is surely a sufficient answer that it would be difficult to name a year, when
                    in point of fact more would not have been lost than gained by tying up the hands
                    of parliament, and putting its legislature to the circuity of an appeal to the
                    freeholders of the county courts. The nature of things does not admit of there
                    being any greater security for good government than can be given by a
                    legislature of which a popular representative assembly, properly<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193745323" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5323-0005"/> chosen and seasonably
                    renewed, is a member. To call in the people to council, is to abandon to that
                    extent, under circumstances too of great probable excitement, the advantages of
                    representation; and for no countervailing benefit, unless on the singular
                    supposition that a people incapable of choosing able and honest representatives,
                    will be found capable of being able and honest legislators themselves. The
                    device is much more likely practically to delay improvement than to check
                    encroachments; since, for the latter purpose, the restraints it imposes are
                    either unnecessary or insufficient. There can be no substitute for the spirit of
                    a people. With that spirit, these precautions are not wanted; without it they
                    are vain. The two cases which look most suspicious in English history (one in
                    substance, the other in form) are the proclamation-statute of Henry VIII. and
                    the septennial bill. The parliament of Henry VIII. gave royal proclamations in
                    certain cases the force of law. The extent of the innovation has often been
                    exaggerated. But, with regard to the present question, there can be no doubt,
                    that a generation which by royal order changed its religion four times in twelve
                    years, would, on the subject of royal proclamations, have as readily acceded to
                    his majesty’s desires. A few corporations petitioned against the septennial
                    bill. But an observer of the prior, contemporary, and subsequent conduct of the
                    body of the people on this point, and a reader of Burke’s speech against
                    triennial parliaments, will perhaps see little reason to believe or to wish that
                    the people, if calmly consulted, would have come to a different conclusion. It
                    should be recollected, that the question is one of pure argument only, and not
                    of history. By the common law a parliament, unless dissolved, lasted for the
                    king’s life. In 1694 this duration was first shortened to three years; but in
                    1717 these three years were lengthened to seven. Thus, the law of triennial
                    parliaments, spoken of by some as an almost vital part of the English
                    constitution, was never known in England but for neither more nor less than the
                    space of twenty and three years.</p>
                <p>Every government is characterized by the ends which it proposes as its primary
                    objects, and by the means which it applies for the attainment of its ends. These
                    objects represent what is vaguely called its spirit. The only means properly at
                    its command refer to the making, interpreting, and executing laws. It follows
                    that the most important distinctions in this respect between one government and
                    another, must be found in the specific provisions which determine the formation
                    and distribution of the legislative, judicial, and administrative power. The
                    English constitution is a limited or mixed monarchy; limited, by the maxim that
                    the king has no rights but those which are prescribed and ascertained bylaw;
                    mixed, by the fact that the parliament, in which the sole legislative authority
                    resides, consists of the king and the three estates, the nobility, clergy, and
                    commonalty of the realm, as comprised in the two houses of Lords and Commons.
                    The suppression of partial interests is sought to be attained, and the practical
                    recognition of the great end of government, namely, the happiness of the whole
                    body of the people, has been principally developed and enforced by the share
                    which the people exercise more or less in the government. This takes place in
                    the legislative department, by means of their representatives; in the judicial,
                    by the agency of the jury; in the administrative, by the doctrine of official
                    responsibility, and from the example and control of a great diversity of popular
                    local municipal institutions.</p>
                <p>A more considerate legislation is promoted by a second legislative assembly. A
                    great addition is also made to the political stability of a limited monarchy, by
                    forming the members of this second assembly into an hereditary nobility. A mixed
                    government has, however, a still greater advantage. It naturally leads to and
                    facilitates a division of powers, which is the most important of all the checks
                    that mere arrangement can produce. According to this division, the authority of
                    parliament is strictly confined to the original enactment of the laws. The duty
                    of the judges is as strictly judicial. They have no more to do with the politic
                    administering of the law than with the making of it. The law being thus made,
                    and thus interpreted, the entire charge of carrying it into effect is vested
                    immediately or mediately in the crown. Whilst the several parties who make,
                    interpret, and execute the laws, are kept, in this manner, perfectly distinct,
                    it becomes exceedingly improbable that any confusion, either unintentional or
                    wilful, should arise between the principles properly belonging to their several
                    operations. This is a caution which the cause of public liberty, as well as that
                    of civil justice, alike imperatively require. Blackstone<note anchored="true"

                    sovereignty rest. On the other hand, the citizens of Greece and Rome were fully
                    aware that political society was grounded on the advantage of its members. Their
                    patriotism was not more exalted by the pride of national independence than by
                    the consciousness of being responsible only to the law. Nevertheless, the real
                    condition of these great commonwealths was for the most part in lamentable
                    contradiction to the individual ability and virtue by which their history has
                    been made famous throughout all ages. The glory of free and classical antiquity
                    was frequently clouded, and was brought at last to an abrupt and final
                    termination. This is apparently to be attributed to the defective mechanism of
                    their institutions, more than to any other cause. Their construction and
                    division of the legislative, judicial, and executive authority were all along so
                    imperfect, that their negligence of the means of a better political arrangement
                    can only be accounted for by their ignorance of its necessity. There is nothing
                    to this effect, even in their theoretical works upon government, when carefully
                    examined. Polybius, it is true, gives the preference to a combination of
                    monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, as being in a degree more stable than the
                    simple forms. Cicero also agrees with him in saying, that this was the true
                    Roman constitution; but he most unwisely adds, in compliance with the Roman
                    jealousy of kings, that wherever the executive is placed in a single hand, the
                    government is mixed only, not tempered, and must be ruined by the vices of the
                    individual. Different writers appear to have meant different things by the same
                    word. Aristides denominated the government a mixed one as late as the time of
                    Marcus Aurelius. Tacitus saw through the fictions, and thought that the word
                    implied more, otherwise he would scarcely have said that such a combination may
                    be more easily praised than effected, and that were it effected it <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193745336" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5336-0006"/> could never be
                    lasting. In case, however, the constitution had done nothing further than
                    realize the above combination in the general sense which alone these
                    philosophical statesmen were contemplating, it would have stopped infinitely
                    short of the principal benefits which it has conferred. The separation of the
                    three great branches of political authority into distinct departments, as it is
                    one of the most probable consequences of a mixed monarchy, so is it beyond all
                    comparison the most valuable. Unfortunately it had not taken place under the
                    imperfect Specimens of mixed government with which they were acquainted. It iš
                    not surprising, therefore, that in theory the philosophical truth of such a
                    corollary should never have occurred to them. If that consequencè had been duly
                    presented to his mind, Tacitus must surely' have seen reason to question the
                    cycle of Polybius, and to fėél greater confidence in the political contrivance
                    by which the efficiency and the durability of states have both been found in
                    practice to gather equal strength. No political phenomenon can be more
                    interesting than the circumstances and the method by which a government has thus
                    arrived at the high distinction of first uniting improvement and stability,
                    liberty and order, and has been enabled to combine the greatest of all ends with
                    what, from the failure of the möśt celebrated experiments, it may be well
                    supposed were means very difficult both to discover and to apply. Sanguine
                    spirits often appear to imagine that as good a constitution as can be devised
                    may be struck out and fitted upon at a moment’s notice. The history of the
                    English constitution may teach them greater caution. A distinct examination of
                    its respective parts will show, not only how slowly they have been formed, but
                    to what extreme ’risks at different periods the existence and the principle of
                    each have been, and perhaps must be, severally exipösed.</p>
                <p>The English constitution is more historical than philosophical. It has been the
                    gradual development of national good sense, shown in a spirited and prudent
                    improvement of tendencies and events, without any of the ambition of a regular,
                    preconcerted system. Its object was never stated in a declaration of the
                    abstract rights of man, nor its organization derived from a metaphysical
                    analysis of tlïė elements of human nature. He must have been indeed a prophet,
                    who, at the time of the Norman conquest, could have foreseen the course by which
                    it would outstrip the feudal monarchies which resembled and surrounded it. The
                    difference lay in this: For successive centuries, circumstances played
                    favourably for a people who had the merit or the good fortune to profit by them
                    as they occurred. Μ. Rey is so far right. England has experienced the truth of
                    Aristotle’s observation with regard to Crete. An insular position has great
                    advantages for political experiments. Assistance has also frequently come in
                    from the most unlikely quarters, and the scale has more than once been turned by
                    causes to which, as far as we can observe, no nobler name than that of accident
                    is to be assigned. At one time the very strength and concentration of the
                    monarchy of England, as compared with the weakness of the monarchy of France,
                    brought the barons, the people, and even the church, into a closer union for
                    their defence. At a later period the impoverishment of the crown by foreign
                    wars, and the alienation of the crown lands, brought it into dependence upon,
                    whât was most fortunately, one national parliament instead of several distinct
                    provincial assemblies. The separation of the greater from the lesser bäróńs, the
                    assembling of the commons and the lords íň different chambers, the transit
                    through which the exemptions claimed by the clergy became disqualifications, the
                    cóħversioň of the jury from their original character (whatever that may have
                    been) into a popular tribunal, have turned out to be the hinges on which English
                    freedom has ultimately turned. They are instances of incidents, in themselves at
                    first comparatively trifling, diverted by circumstances into a deeper channel,
                    or transmuted by a noble alchemy into a much higher purpose than what was their
                    original purview and intent. Although the English government was from the first
                    a limited monarchy, it was not for nothing that monks and lawyers lent a hand in
                    the pious frauds of forging tales about Alfred, Kentish privileges, and
                    imaginary Saxon laws, or in encouraging the more recent fiction of the notorious
                    anti-tallage statute. The stoutest antiquarian who ever argued that the title of
                    William the Conqueror represented merely the feudal <hi rend="italic"
                    >conquisitio,</hi> and not the conquest of the nation, nevertheless must admit
                    from time to time great historical distinctions. The nature and degree of the
                    limitations practically needed and applied to the powers and mechanism of the
                    several component parts of the government varied exceedingly at different
                    periods. The importance even of the grand division between the legislative,
                    judicial, and executive authorities, was far from being at once recognised and
                    observed.</p>
                <p>A constitution upon paper and in practice are such very different things, that we
                    must look into the history as well as the laws of a country, in order to know at
                    any given time what was the real contemporary character of its government.
                    English antiquarians have been more or less successful in tracing back the dates
                    of their most popular institutions. But the sense in which the same institutions
                    were in point of fact understood and administered at different periods, and the
                    security which they were capable of affording, are distinct and much more
                    interesting questions. A people and their government, it is true, are always
                    cause and effect to each other; and none more so than those of England. In the
                    present instance, however, there can be no doubt but that the narrative of
                    Englisli parliaments and of English juries establishes their existence, as a
                    matter of pedigree, long before there was spread throughout the community either
                    the spirit, the knowledge, or the means to turn them to their legitimate
                    account. The systematic regularity of modern governments was unknown even to the
                    ancient republics. No wonder, therefore, that it was wholly unthought of either
                    by the feudal chieftains themselves, or by the rude vassals who attended to do
                    suit and service at their courts. Our ancestors were satisfied, we are told,
                    with the rough standard of measurement taken from parts of the human body,
                    though differing in different men, till Henry I. ordered the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ulna</hi> or ell, which answers to our modern yard, to be made the precise
                    length of his own arm. To lay down any thing like a precise standard for civil
                    obedience, was left for later times, and for arms still stronger than those of
                    any king. Even long after the golden rules and metewand of the law were
                    recognised at Westminster, acts of violence were frequent over the kingdom, with
                    more or less remonstrance; so that <hi rend="italic">judicandum est
                    legibus</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic">exemplis</hi> is a maxim
                    which the constitutional inquirer is obliged to keep constantly before him.</p>
                <p>The history of England opens with a society divided into castes. The distinctions
                    taken by the law were onerous and severe. There is a great difference between
                    Glanville and Beaumanoir. Nevertheless, the blot upon Magna Charta itself, in
                    the limitation <hi rend="italic">(liber homo)</hi> cannot be explained away.'
                    The later threat of Richard II. after the unsuccessful insurrection to which the
                    peasantry had been, driven by oppression, is equally intelligible. Their
                    condition, he told them, should be made yet more miserable. The statute of
                    labourers, which was passed in the réign of Edward HL, was in the same spirit.
                    It continued to be a no less absurd than wicked favourite with aftertimes<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193745349" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5349-0007"/>. It is impossible
                    to look over the whole intermediate legislation concerning the lower orders down
                    to the reign of Elizabeth, without perceiving that most of its provisions are as
                    much statutes of police as of trade. They have the air of being expressly
                    directed to the object of preventing the consolidation of the different degrees
                    of society into one people. When we compare the laws of England in this respect
                    with those of the continent, we cannot estimate too highly the comparative
                    equality of ranks, and the absence of exclusive privileges. Nevertheless the
                    laws were bad, and public opinion worse. The dialogue on the Exchequer, written
                    towards the close of the reign of Henry IL, observes, that in all cases of
                    secret slaying, whether of English or Norman, the penalty should be levied on
                    the hundred, “unless there are plain <hi rend="italic">indicia of</hi> the
                    servile condition of the deceased.” The petition of the commons to Richard II.
                    that villeins might not be put to school and so get on in the church, “for the
                    honour of all freemen,” was re-echoed two hundred years later, in the cry
                    against the Lord Cromwell, on account of his “villein blood.” The class was then
                    about to disappear. It is evident that it was only by its extinction that
                    prejudices incompatible with real equality under a free constitution could be
                    removed. The gradual elevation of the entire population into the condition of
                    freemen, put all ultimately in possession of rights which had been wrested from
                    the crown by feudal leaders and independent yeomen with a much more partial
                    object. It took ages to compass this emancipation, and to reverse the
                    proportional shares of the national wealth, as held by the king, the church, the
                    nobility, and the commons. If all the land of the kingdom had continued to be
                    the portion of the church, the king, and the immediate tenants of the crown,
                    who, according to the list in Domesday-book and Brady, did not exceed seven
                    hundred in number, this consummation would never have been accomplished. Civil
                    wars and commerce, by scattering properties and displacing chivalry, broke up
                    the feudal system much more effectually than any positive enactment. The
                    possession of property gave leisure; leisure, especially when the reformation
                    and the press stirred up the human mind with new and more liberal excitements,
                    gave knowledge. Even without the strength of numbers, the combined influence of·
                    property and knowledge must give power. Until the body of a people has obtained
                    the intelligence necessary to understand something of their own interests, and
                    the power of making an attention to their interest and feelings a matter of
                    prudence on the part of the higher classes, it is in vain to expect that just
                    principles of government will be steadily acknowledged, much Jess that they will
                    be steadily put in practice.</p>
                <p>The king appears in the law-books as the source of almost every institution and
                    every right. There is no other independent political existence save his baronial
                    court. Nevertheless, as far at least as concerned the people, the king was
                    originally still more powerful in fact than even in law. There was always a
                    legal control upon him. But it was lodged at the beginning in an assembly where
                    as yet the people bore no part. Bracton, who wrote under Henry HL, probably not
                    long before Leicester’s writs to knights, citizens, and burgesses, appears to
                    have as little anticipated them as he could have anticipated their effect. In
                    his perversion of the imperial law to the purposes of a limited monarchy, he
                    declares that the. will of the prince must be according to his counsellors; that
                    is, of “his court of earls and barons.” He terms them his “associates,” and
                    makes them his superiors; for he adds, “were the king without a bridle from the
                    law, they ought to put one on him.” The court of peers, or royal council of
                    hrance, by the non-attendance of the tenants in chieζ sunk into the great
                    judicial tribunal of the country, and became known by the name of parliament,
                    after the time of St Louis. The peers of England were not so confident of their
                    feudal exemption from supreme legislative control; consequently, when, about the
                    same time, or a little earlier, the <hi rend="italic">aula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >regis</hi> or great council of England assumed a new form, it separated into
                    two compartments; one judicial, or the supreme courts of justice; the other
                    legislative. The last consisted originally of the earls and barons only. By the
                    time that the incipient House of Commons became its colleague, the name of
                    parliament was appropriated, and, from its omnipotence over the feelings of the
                    English nation, has become almost consecrated in their behalf. It was long
                    before the parliament felt its strength, or knew how to use it. In the mean
                    while the constitution, directly or indirectly, within doors and without, kept
                    making head. During the struggles which the crown, reign after reign, was
                    maintaining, sometimes with different members of the royal family, at others
                    with the aristocracy, and at others against the church and papal usurpations,
                    the people became important as allies. The people appear on the whole to have
                    judiciously sided, where, according as the temporary pressure was felt to bear,
                    it was for the interest of the public that they should side. It is difficult,
                    owing partly to the uniformity which prevails at present, to comprehend the
                    sudden turns which this instinctive policy might call upon them to make.</p>
                <p>A sagacious and honest yeoman may have been with King John to-day, and with his
                    barons to-morrow. To look merely at property: the Conqueror retained in his own
                    hands fourteen hundred manors, the reserved rents on which Burke, in his
                    Abridgment of English History, reduces to L.70,000 of the money of that period.
                    The resumption of the grants of Henry VI. was prefaced by a public declaration
                    that his ordinary income did not amount to more than L.5000. In the next reign
                    we find Edward IV., independently of parliamentary supplies, the owner of above
                    a fifth of the lay property of the kingdom. Within half a century the scale had
                    again changed its balance. Wholesale confiscations, succeeded by the minuter and
                    more politic arts of Henry VII. humbled the pride and broke the combinations of
                    the nobility. Although the nominal rental of the royal demesnes was reduced to
                    L.32,000 at the accession of James I., yet the idea of any danger to the
                    monarchy from aristocratical competition was almost a faint tradition at the
                    time of Lord Russell’s trial. He justly exclaimed, in allusion to the
                    apprehension, “We have no great men now.” Previously to this revolution in
                    society, it depended for the most part on the personal capacity and character of
                    the sovereign, whether the contingencies to which a wise constitutional jealousy
                    ought to have been most alive, would come from the turbulent intrigues of the
                    aristocracy, or from monarchical ambition. The royal prerogative attracts the
                    first and the liveliest attention, as its power is always present and most
                    promptly felt. Besides, it was absolute in language, prominent in form, and
                    often irritating in the subject and occasion of its exercise. But all the great
                    points whence a cloud might have arisen over the freedom of the, nation had been
                    soon foreclosed, and, in spite of occasional, indeed numerous violations, were
                    closely watched.. There is no denying that many remaining prerogatives were
                    absurd and even odious. Still the nature and the danger of the grievances to
                    which the people were legally and practically exposed from them are usually
                    overrated. The Stuarts let no prerogative drop willingly; and it is well known
                    that they laboured hard to revive some that were obsolete. Yet Lord Bacon
                    declared, on presenting an address to King James, that there was no grievance in
                    the kingdom “so general, so continual, so sensible, and so bitter, as the
                    prerogative<pb break="no" facs="nls:193745362" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5362-0008"/> of
                    purveyance.” Nevertheless, what did it amount to when represented in money? From
                    one cause or another, the commons receded from their negotiation, rather than
                    buy off this their master grievance, and that of military tenures into the
                    bargain, at the cost of an annuity of L.200,000. In the interval which elapsed
                    between the depression of the nobles and the rise of the commons, the monarch
                    had the "stage comparatively to himself. The crown also at that critical moment
                    passed into a line of able and haughty princes. Mr Hallam observes, that
                    constitutional freedom was consequently retrograde from Henry VI. to VIII.; yet
                    it is evident, from what passed during that period, that the hardy plant was not
                    only alive, but safe. Bills in the form of acts, instead of petitions, which by
                    adding to or diminishing from what the commons had petitioned for, had been for
                    ages scandalously abused, begin with the reign of Henry VI. The first writ of
                    habeas corpus, apparently so simple a result of Magna Charta, was obtained
                    against Henry VII., the wiliest of the Tudors. Elizabeth had her father’s
                    spirit, and can scarcely be suspected of relaxing a hold which she could have
                    decently retained. Yet in 1586 the House of Commons first succeeded in bringing
                    the inquiry into election returns from out of chancery before themselves. By
                    unfairly selecting the arbitrary passages from the reign of Elizabeth, and
                    misrepresenting them as the ordinary course of her government, Hume gave both
                    colour and currency to sophisms, which betrayed a much greater passion for
                    ingenious paradox than for historical truth. The English people are wrong, it
                    seems, in charging the Stuarts personally with the misgovernment which provoked
                    the great rebellion. That misgovernment is represented to be nothing more than a
                    continuance of the ancient English constitution, such alone as their ancestors
                    had known it. According to this statement, the fault of the Stuarts would have
                    consisted in carrying down the prior constitutional misrule into times which
                    would no longer bear it. If such had been the fact, it is a fact which those
                    times must certainly have known. But the understanding of contemporary parties
                    was plainly all the other way. History has preserved the positive admission of
                    Charles I. to the contrary, in a reference too remarkable not to prove that he
                    was himself conscious of, and was aware also that his subjects knew, the whole
                    extent as well as spirit of his innovations. What a satire on his own and on his
                    father’s government, that he should, in 1640,<note anchored="true"

                    frankly delivered himself to the lords and commons, and was resolved to follow
                    their advice in repairing the grievances at home, which he confessed the
                    necessities of the times had brought upon his people. All those, whether in
                    church or state, he was willing should be removed, and desired that all things
                    might be reduced to the good order and practice of Queen Elizabeth; which to the
                    people of England were sure looked upon with the greatest reverence.” (1.
                    Clarendon, 519.) This important passage is printed for the first time in the
                    last edition. It is one of the worst omissions in the former garbled text. The
                    speech is imperfectly given in the parliamentary history, with a rather later
                    date. It is in itself a complete answer to the comparison laboured by Hume. The
                    truth is, that the Stuarts had a dread of English history, for its testimony
                    against them. Bishop Nicholson observes, in his <hi rend="italic">Historical

                    parliament as a boon, that he would return to the precedents of a sovereign whom
                    they had already endeared to the people as “Good Queen Bess whose reign,
                    however, we know, notwithstanding, to have abounded with tyrannical executions,
                    gross and frequent enough, it might have been thought, to have satisfied any of
                    her successors. It is not the less true, that the time had come when the
                    authority as well as the ceremonies of the court must undergo mutations, at
                    which minds, with much larger views of government than that of Clarendon, would
                    be startled, and perhaps annoyed. The state of society required popular changes
                    to be admitted, for which no precise precedent could be found. Under these
                    circumstances, men like Selden, for instance, a little too apt not to look for
                    liberty beyond their law-books, must often have felt embarrassed h*ow to act.
                    The Stuarts, however, did as much as could well be done towards relieving their
                    subjects from difficulties of this description.</p>
                <p>Unluckily for the Stuarts, none of the innovations which they attempted, nay not
                    even the consistent system to which it had been their object to bring the
                    practice of their government, were so new and so outrageous as the principles on
                    which they professed to reign. No country set a higher value than England,
                    whether it was pleaded on behalf of the prerogative royal, or in the much more
                    reasonable case of civil possessions, on the somewhat too stationary title of
                    prescription. The coronation oath on the one hand, and the oath of allegiance on
                    the other, the theory of the feudal system, and many passages in their annals,
                    had accustomed them to look to a rough notion of contract as the criterion of
                    submission. The divinity studies of the early lawyers, and the usages of the
                    puritans, tended to influence the thought and language of modern times by the
                    course of authorities in the Old Testament. But these views were common
                    property. All went there for what they wanted,, and all found it. The partizans
                    of despotism and freedom, Hobbes and Locke, Bossuet and Algernon Sidney,
                    discovered, the two first in Chronicles, the two last in Deute <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> ronomy, arguments for their opposite systems. It was
                    far otherwise with the novelty which the Stuarts took up, and made the creed of
                    their supporters. The new creed was precise and positive, and the whole spirit
                    of English history was in contradiction to it. No later than the 13th Elizabeth,
                    a statute had been passed, declaring it treason to maintain in any wise that the
                    king and parliament had not the power to limit the succession. It was natural to
                    lament that the feeling of feudal attachment was decayed. But the doctrine of a
                    divine hereditary patriarchal right was a strange invention to replace it
                    withal. The cavalier loyalty of Ormond belonged to former days, and had nothing
                    in common with the superstition of Mainwaring and Sancroft. Principles utterly
                    inconsistent with all that had been ever written on the subject, almost with all
                    which had been ever done, became the favourite and insulting theme of speeches,
                    proclamations, sermons. Thence the dread of the convocation sitting after the
                    dissolution of parliament; thence the unanimous resolution that their new canons
                    would not bind even the clergy; thence the protests against the new pulpit law,
                    to make the king more absolute than his predecessors. Roman Catholic
                    ecclesiastics had put their hands to Magna Charta. The Oxford decree was the
                    boast of the Church of England. The latter books of Hooker, on account of their
                    heretical latitude, were to be made out to be fabrications; whilst Jeremy
                    Taylor, the great ornament of his profession, pronounces that there are few
                    cases of conscience in which a man may hope for half as much conviction as on
                    passive obedience and non-resistance. Non-resistance was soon improved into
                    absolute compliance. It became, in other words, the indefeasible legitimacy of
                    modern days. These prodigies of doctrine' defeated themselves. They misled the
                    governors and provoked the governed, and, in James the Second’s expostulation
                    with the seven bishops, returned <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745375"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5375-0009"/>them their poisoned chalice to their own lips. A
                    limited monarchy and unconditional allegiance are a contradiction in terms. The
                    only consequence of allowing to a brave and thinking people rights and
                    privileges in the statute-book, and yet closing up every practicable channel
                    through which, if they are violated, a legal remedy can be obtained, is the
                    generating a spirit which sooner or later must force itself a way by some great
                    convulsion. Another revolution, and the example of a new dynasty, were made
                    necessary to establish the truth of the opinion which Gourville expressed in
                    vain to Charles II.: “A king of England who will be the man of his people, is
                    the greatest king in the world; but if he would be any thing more, he is nothing
                    at all.” So evident, indeed, has it ever been since the Revolution, that no king
                    can long carry on the government upon any other terms than by becoming the man
                    of his people, as represented in parliament, that the royal legislative negative
                    has fallen into abeyance for a century and a half. Elizabeth, at the close of
                    one session, rejected forty-eight bills which had passed both houses. The last
                    exercise of this prerogative was in 1692, when William III. refused his assent
                    to the bill for triennial parliaments. With the modifications, and under the
                    circumstances in which alone the negative of the president of the United States
                    can be interposed, it is easy to see how the head of that republic may prudently
                    venture on the exercise of a power to which it would be the height of imprudence
                    in a king of England so far to put himself in opposition to both houses as to
                    revert. It cannot be said that the change is in the mode of operation only, and
                    that the king does now by influence what he used to do by prerogative. It is
                    notorious that, on several occasions since 1692, influence has failed in doing
                    that which the acknowledged prerogative would have done by its single word. The
                    result is, that the king, who for many centuries was more powerful in fact than
                    in law, is more powerful in law than in fact at the present time.</p>
                <p>If under the same forms the rise of the commons has changed imperceptibly, but
                    entirely, their relative position with regard to the crown, this has happened to
                    a still greater extent between them and the barons. The power of the nobility
                    consisted in their immense possessions, in the clan-devotion of their
                    dependents, in their territorial jurisdictions, and in the original
                    superintending authority of the supreme feudal court. The blow struck at their
                    properties, both by force and artifice, speedily took effect. The shake once
                    given was so certain of spreading further, that the formation of new
                    aristocratical fortunes out of the monastic confiscations has never been made an
                    imputation on the policy of Henry VIII. It was as the favourite of Elizabeth
                    more than as the lord of Kenilworth, that Leicester succeeded in making the
                    gentry of Warwickshire wear his livery. The original relation between lord and
                    tenant implied protection on the one hand, and obedience on the other. If the
                    tenant could not alien without the lord’s license, the lord could not transfer
                    the tenant’s seignorial dependence without the consent of the tenant. The social
                    movement, commencing at the top, naturally occasioned a relaxation in these
                    duties and sympathies on the part of the lord in the first instance. This broke
                    the charm. It soon became evident that king-maker could be the title of no
                    future Warwick. There had been a series of concentric circles, through which the
                    feudal feeling rose from the vassal of the mesne lord up even to the throne. But
                    all gave way at once. It was clear that the mischievous distinction between a
                    king <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> and a king <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi>
                    could not be recalled, nor the allegiance of the subject transferred from the
                    regal office of the sovereign to his natural person and blood royal, when once
                    the feudal feeling lower down the ladder had been so completely destroyed, that,
                    in the words of the age of Selden, an English tenant would be the first person
                    to lay his landlord by the heels. The landlords and the sovereign have been both
                    amply indemnified in increased security, for whatever either may have lost. At
                    the same time the constitution and the country have been infinite gainers by the
                    general adoption of a more rational patriotism. The civil exemptions which the
                    peers possessed in their individual character were all along insignificant. The
                    judicial authority vested in their territorial jurisdictions was superseded by
                    circuit judges, and by justices of the peace in every county. That which had
                    been reserved to them collectively was of a kind more honorary than formidable,
                    and one which there was little temptation to abuse. The small value which they
                    attached to their power as a civil tribunal is proved by the intermission which
                    took place of all writs of error to the lords from the time of Henry IV. til]
                    the accession of James I. Their criminal jurisdiction, except in the case of
                    impeachment, was confined to the members of their own order. From the time that
                    the commons were united with the lords, and their joint assent became equally
                    indispensable to all legislative measures, the sole undivided glory of Bracton’s
                    baronial court was at an end. A statute of Edward II. declares that every
                    legislative measure not sanctioned by the consent of king, lords, and commons,
                    shall be void. It states also that this is according to custom. Nevertheless it
                    was long before the commons had the courage to act upon this supposed equality.
                    Sometimes they stultified themselves by way of policy, to avoid any possible
                    responsibility. On ordinary occasions they felt themselves overshadowed by the
                    neighbouring greatness of the lords. Thus they applied to them on great
                    emergencies, begging that they would send some of their members to instruct them
                    in their duty (as in 1st Richard IL), “on account of the arduousness of their
                    charge, and the feebleness of their own power and understanding.” In the same
                    manner, on the insanity of Henry VI. they left the establishment of the regency
                    with the peerage. “You, the peerage, in whom, by occasion of the infirmity,
                    resteth the exercise of his authority.” In the reign of Charles I. the commons
                    are seen for the first time taking the lead, and carrying the lords along with
                    them. Several of the lords in that crisis gave in their adhesion, and
                    co-operated with the commons. Before this, the spectacle of their concurrence
                    had always been, the commons walking in the train of the lords. New principles
                    must accompany such a change. The House of Peers could no longer claim the
                    privilege of legislating exclusively for the benefit of their order, nor proceed
                    on the distinction that they sit in their own right, answerable only to
                    themselves; whereas the House of Commons, as a representative body, is
                    answerable to the people. The sophistical distinction can hardly serve at
                    present to prop up the privilege of their proxy; a pretension not less
                    incompatible than popular instructions with the first duty of a deliberative
                    assembly. Fifty years ago, when Paley first published his Moral Philosophy, the
                    peers had so far fallen into the back ground, and political reasoners had so far
                    learned to look to reason only, that Paley defends the institution of a House of
                    Lords as a part of the British constitution, on grounds which would have amazed
                    Simon de Montfort, and perhaps somewhat scandalized John earl of Somers. His
                    main argument is founded on the use of a second and totally distinct legislative
                    assembly, in order to protect the state against popular caprice and fury. Ever
                    since the Revolution, the <hi rend="italic">momentum</hi> in English legislation
                    has lain necessarily in the commons. The king and the lords have both sought to
                    keep there a hold, by way of influence, so as to fight their <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193745388" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5388-0010"/>battle in that field always
                    in the first instance, and thus procure an additional guard against the chances
                    of more direct collision. The reform bill has to a certain degree stopped up the
                    communications by which this arrangement had been in substance effected ever
                    since, and, in fact, long previously to, the Revolution. Mr Hume remarks, on the
                    existence of two legislative assemblies, separate from each other, yet each of
                    them supreme, as one of the great anomalies of the Roman institutions. The
                    characteristic danger of such a state of things exists also wherever the consent
                    of two or more men is required in carrying on public business. The only
                    difference is, that the danger in the latter case is often counterbalanced by
                    greater advantages; and that the mischief will probably be less violent from
                    their opposition in the passive shape of refusing to legislate in the same
                    direction, than in the more active, shape which their opposition might have
                    assumed in Rome, that of positively legislating, one against another. It is
                    evident, however, that a society, the elements of which, by the supposition, are
                    not paralysed, and torpid, must soon find out the means of evading the evils of
                    a political stalemate. The necessary unanimity can be only obtained by
                    reciprocal compromises and forbearance. If we will have the benefits peculiar to
                    such institutions, we must be content to pay the price. In the administration of
                    justice, the limits which separate pertinacity and weakness is one of the
                    difficult discretionary questions which judges and jurors have to settle with
                    their respective colleagues. If every member of a jury or a senate were to be as
                    impracticable as Cato is described to have been, institutions of this nature
                    could in no country be allowed to last a week.</p>
                <p>Mr Hume and Mr Bentham appear to agree in thinking, that in the ςase of numerous
                    assemblies called upon to determine the much more extensive and variable
                    questions which arise in the general conduct of political affairs, it would be
                    unwise to rely upon the exercise of a similar discretion, as sufficient security
                    for the analogous compromises which are nevertheless indispensable conditions to
                    an efficient co-operation. For this purpose they both acknowledge the propriety
                    of some species of influence, which shall make the one to a certain degree
                    dependent upon the other. In such a case the only question which remains
                    practically to be argued will be its nature and the mode and degree of its
                    exercise. If Dr Paley gives too much countenance to influences approaching to a
                    sordid bias, Mr Hallam, <hi rend="italic">it may</hi> be feared, is somewhat too
                    confident in the assurance that moral influences will of themselves always
                    secure a just, or at least an adequate, concurrence.</p>
                <p>Polybius, has shown that the simple forms of government, however suited
                    originally to this or that stage of society, necessarily,become in time
                    unsuitable. What he describes as the specific germ of decay, “congenite in each
                    form,” would be more properly described as an alteration in society, itself.
                    This alteration drags the government after it into the requisite modifications
                    of its form. It is one of the great merits of a mixed government, that, without
                    the viôlence of a revolution, it can accommodate itself to these changes in a
                    community, and pass the initiative with comparative facility from one class to
                    another, just as the leading shoot in society may happen to be making head.
                    Under a nominal invariableness in the balance, some variance in the weights,
                    must always be going on. The crown was not easily consent to resign the
                    ascendency if once enjoyed. When the higher classes had to outward appearance
                    codec} the political powers they had formerly possessed, they were enabled
                    afterwards by circumstances to continue in the covert eŋjoyment of it, to a much
                    greater extent and a much longer period than any one could beforehand have
                    presumed. James I. próbably was not aware of the tendency of the proclamation by
                    which, on calling his first parliament, he directed the sheriffs to address the
                    writs upon a principle substantially the same as the late reform bill. There can
                    be no greater proof, on one hand, of the respect of the people of England for
                    ancient forms, and, on the other, of the moderation by which the higher
                    conciliated the jealousy of the middle classes, than the fact that the adoption
                    of this principle was postponed during the next two hundred years. In those
                    classes, including the gentry and independent commonalty of the realm, in whom
                    for some time past the heart’s blood of the country has mainly been formed, the
                    reform bill has at last placed the command of the House of Commons. The power
                    which this portion of the community before exercised indirectly over the whole
                    parliament, and especially over that house, it now exercises directly. The
                    consequence is, that there is a much greater security than before, that no
                    measure detrimental to their interests, and in opposition to their feelings,
                    will be agreed to by a House of Commons of which they are themselves now made
                    the constituents. There need be no fear for the duration of moral frame-works
                    like that of government, on the ground of their supposed analogy to the growth
                    and decay of material forms. There seems also no better foundation for the
                    inference draw n by Polybius, in his comparison between the governments of
                    Carthage and of Rome as they existed at the time of the campaigns of Hannibal,
                    where he says that a mixed government, in which the preponderance has passed
                    from the monarchical and aristocratical to its popular members, has run its
                    course, and is so much nearer to its termination. Difficulties enough remain
                    inherent in the nature of all government, which no possible adjustment of the
                    machinery can reach. But a mixed, though incomparably safer than a simple,
                    government, has some difficulties peculiarly its own. It depends on a nicer
                    balance of proportions, and it calls for a greater degree of temper, patience,
                    and mutual concession from its members. A rational and public-spirited House of
                    Commons must be in constant danger of offending one or other of the extreme
                    parties in the state. Whilst its honest concurrence with the other branches of
                    parliament must frequently incur the displeasure of the demagogue and his mob,
                    the sovereign or the peerage, one or both, are often not unlikely to regard its
                    general or particular opinions with equal jealousy. A constitution thus settled
                    is only safe as long as the more intelligent part of society can take advantage
                    of its intermediate position, and arbitrate between the extremes. A House of
                    Commons, identified with the great arteries of the nation, contains within
                    itself no inherent security for good government, beyond the power of stopping
                    bad measures, and of sending good ones up for their acceptance to the other
                    partners in the firm. If they accept, well; if they reject, a class of cases
                    arises, on which all the good sense and good humour of a country may be wanted,
                    in order to guide a people to discriminate aright on the course which it becomes
                    them to pursue. Unless a power of rejection, according to a liberal construction
                    of independent judgment, be conceded, the whole benefit of a second assembly
                    will be altogether Jost. The power of rejection may, however, be so exercised by
                    a headstrong monarch or by a small hereditary body, especially when, in the case
                    of the latter body, the greater part of the legislature have been recently
                    raised to the peerage from the ranks of one political party only, as to amount
                    to a declaration that they are looking only to themselves, their own
                    interestsand passions. A civil disseverance from the sympathies of the nation,
                    like that of the Roman Catholic clergy, justifies the extreme remedy of removing
                    the obstacle by whatever <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745401"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5401-0011"/>means. The occurrence of such fatal obstinacy in
                    the þerson of the sovereign, would be an exception to every presumption upon
                    which hereditary monarchy is engrafted on â mixed government. The Contingency of
                    so remote and so insane a possibility could only be formally Counteracted by
                    some such expedient as is adopted with respect to the veto of the president of
                    the United States. In the instance of a refractory House of Peers, the
                    constitution has given the king the means of applying this remedy by a creation
                    of additional peers. This course was taken by Queen Anne on a much more
                    questionable occasion, namely, for the sake of a mere ministerial majority. It
                    is not the less clear that a justifiable occasion might occur. If the king took
                    courage to apply the constitutional remedy, all would proceed as usual. If he
                    shrunk from it, the public would be remitted to those ultimate considerations of
                    civil prudence which are always in reserve. They are the very same
                    considerations which justify the sacrifices of natural liberty which men must
                    make upon entering into a commonwealth. They may equally justify the sacrifice
                    of social order which man is called upon to make whenever a commonwealth is
                    overturned. It is to higher authorities than the precedents which are to be
                    found in Rushworth, that freemen have recourse when they are compelled to seek
                    new modes of legislation by forms which announce that the constitution has been
                    destroyed.</p>
                <p>The spirit and effect of institutions and of measures depend, as has been shown,
                    in a great degree upon circumstances beyond themselves. The same institution at
                    different periods produces very different results, whilst the collateral and
                    unforeseen consequences of a measure are frequently much more considerable than
                    the objects which its framers had in view. All that is most important in the
                    present forms of the English constitution, is of a certainty to be traced,
                    however obscurely and imperfectly, from a very early date. At the same time, it
                    has become what it is, only by making the most of a series of fortunate
                    contingencies. The English government may be advantageously compared with the
                    Roman in its best characteristic, the tendency to progressive self-improvement.
                    In the nature of the improvements there can be no comparison.</p>
                <p>According to the process pursued, the substance has been in a course of much more
                    extensive alteration than the forms. With regard to the latter, the change has
                    chiefly consisted in removing partial impediments out of the way of certain
                    movements, in strengthening particular springs to meet particular pressures, and
                    in separating the several parts of the mechanism by more positive divisions,
                    lest they should clash one with another. The manner in which the English clergy
                    overreached themselves, by standing on their claim to exemption from temporal
                    jurisdiction, and on their right to be taxed for temporal purposes, if at all,
                    by themselves only, and in an assembly of their own, is very instructive and
                    curious. They chose to remain apart, a separate estate; and resisted the attempt
                    of Edward I. to incorporate the inferior clergy in the House of Commons, when
                    that house as yet existed mainly for taxation. They procured their convocation
                    about the same time instead of it. Afterwards, in its palmy state of general
                    legislation, they discovered, when it was too late, that their exemption was
                    turned into an exclusion. In 1663 the supreme head of the church of England
                    found it no longer necessary to keep up appearances with a body already but a
                    shadow. Without a law, a struggle, or even a word, convocations have died away.
                    The clergy, on submitting to taxation by a temporal - assembly, have acquired in
                    return the humble privilege of voting for the members of a house in which they
                    cannot sit. A few bishops in the upper house are all that remains in the English
                    institutions, of that third estate which was so necessary a part of the diets
                    and states-general of the continent, and which made so great a figure in our own
                    original constitution. The suspension of the royal negative, and of
                    ecclesiastical convocations, has, almost unobserved, become part of the modern
                    English system. Yet the change which has been thus operated is far more
                    important, though it is short of what it is sometimes represented, than many
                    which have been the subject of fierce contentions, and introduced by the most
                    deliberate enactments.</p>
                <p>The transitions which we have hitherto been considering, are independent of and
                    paramount to legislation. They follow slowly but necessarily the variations in
                    the Condition of society and in public opinion, which must decide nine tenths of
                    the materials and spirit of every government. &gt;We proceed, therefore, to
                    consider the principal alterations which positive legislation has successively
                    effected in the three great divisions of political power.</p>
                <p>The main objects of a government have been mentioned as being the making,
                    interpreting ańd executing the law; the first being the office of the
                    legislature, the second that of the courts of justice, the third that of the
                    Executive administration. It will be proper to examine each Shortly in detail,
                    both as to its duties and its form. The English legislature, acting together as
                    king, lords, and commons, is vastly too cumbersome to take upon itself the
                    detail of the exécutive. This union, therefore, has never been thought of. Its
                    incompetency either as a whole or in its parts to discharge judicial duties is
                    not so sóön perceived; consequently bills of attainder, of pains and penalties,
                    and impeachments, are patt of the legal history of the most recent times. In
                    the,infancy of courts of justice, and when the traditional supremacy of the <hi
                    rend="italic">aula</hi><hi rend="italic">regis,</hi> out of which both they and
                    the legislature had emanated, was yet an active historical recollection,
                    parliament in all extraordinary cases continued to claim an original judicial
                    authority. But this pretension gradually dropped, and the appellate jurisdiction
                    is now evidently near its dosé. Regarding the legislature in its legislative
                    capacity only, it will be seen that its form has remained‘the same as a whole
                    since the first admission of representatives from the commons. The changes which
                    have taken place have been confined to the construction of its constituent
                    parts, and to the view taken of the characteristic rights peculiar to each. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>In considering the several members of the legislature, the king takes
                    constitutionally the precedence. Nothing can be more superficial and incorrect
                    than the view presented by Blackstone of early English history upon this part of
                    the subject. It was not until the accession of Edward 1. that the several titles
                    of election, descent, and testament, on which the claims to the crown were
                    before tested, as best served the occasion, became consolidated in that of
                    hereditary descent. This appears to have <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> taken
                    place in analogy to the descent of land. The rival pretensions of the houses of
                    York and Lancaster' tended *to thròw the law once more into confusion. Being
                    principally tried and determined upon the field of battle, the law had too much
                    the appearance of giving way to force, Or to its hollow consequence, à mere
                    ostensible election. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Yet, even in those times,
                    there was no notion that the crown was left at the personal disposal of the
                    monarch. William the Conqueror, it is true, had set up a donation from Edward
                    the Confessor. But Richard II. on giving his signet to the Duke of Lancaster, as
                    te,stifying his wish that the latter might succeed him, added, “but that did not
                    depend upon his pleasure.” The lords, in a remarkable lecture to the protector,
                    the Duke of Gloucester, whose powers under the will of Henry V. had been limited
                    by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745414" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5414-0012"/>the
                    parliament (for lords and commons are mentioned in the act), say his desire was
                    grounded neither in precedent nor law; “the which the king that dead is, in his
                    life, nor might by his last will, nor otherwise, alter without assent of the
                    three estates, nor commit or grant to any person government or rule of this land
                    longer than his life.” The extraordinary provision of 2S Henry VIII. c. 7, is
                    the first and only instance of putting the crown into settlement, with a
                    remainder “to such persons as the king by letters patent, or last will and
                    testament, should limit and appoint.” It is plain that the testamentary power so
                    granted to her father had puzzled men’s minds in the time of Elizabeth: and that
                    temporary authority to bequeath the crown has to answer for the strange and
                    almost oriental scene by which the death-bed of that princess was disturbed.
                    Since the Revolution, however, the parliamentary title is the one established in
                    fact. Since the reign of Elizabeth it had been the only one recognised in law.
                    The king never had a legislative initiative, but only a simple concurrence. The
                    change of the form from petitions to bills, took away no right, but only an
                    abusive advantage. The real legislative authority of the crown still continues
                    in point of law the same that it has ever been. It was at no time more than at
                    present, at no time less. The right to make law by proclamations, and the right
                    to unmake it, whether by the repealing <hi rend="italic">dissimula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vimus</hi> of Edward HR or by a dispensing and suspending power,
                    were always arbitrary usurpations. For these are utterly inconsistent with the
                    principle, and almost with the letter, of the statute of Edward IL, which had
                    declared the assent of the lords and commons to be as necessary as that of the
                    king; since the maxim that the same solemnity which bound is required also to
                    unbind, is a rule of English law. The disuse of the royal negative since the
                    reign of λVilliam ΠI..i≤ purely matter of discretion; however paramount the
                    political necessity by which that discretion is determined.</p>
                <p>The peerage was formed, under the feudal system, upon the principle of tenure,
                    that is, of land held directly of the king; the mitigated sense in which the
                    soil of the western world was understood to belong to the sovereign having been
                    always very different from the absolute ownership of the sovereigns of the East.
                    At the first, all tenants in chief had a right of summons to parliament, not yet
                    known, however, by that name. During the period which elapsed between the demise
                    of John, the last year of whose reign is remarkable for the division of the
                    greater and lesser barons, and the middle of the reign of Richard II., when
                    peers were first created by letters patent, tenure began to be disregarded. The
                    political principle had so far got the better of the feudal, that in the 49th
                    Edward III. the ancient writ of summons was changed from homage to ligeance. The
                    further difference in the form of this appointment, as whether it was to be made
                    by writ or patent, was of little consequence. But the dispensation from the
                    necessity of holding land in chief was an important innovation. On the one hand,
                    mere territorial possessions, distinct from descent, ceased to confer a title to
                    a writ of summons; on die other, the writ in its general form might easily in
                    time, by multiplying cases of dependent poverty, have turned this august
                    assembly into the lacqueys of a court. It was well that a sense of dignity took
                    the other course; though disfranchisements on account of poverty, as the· act
                    degrading die Duke of Bedford in the reign of Edward 1λ <hi rend="superscript">
                    τ</hi>., and the resolution aŋrainst Lord Ogle in the reign of Edward VR were
                    precedents liable to be abused. The questions, where the power of creating peers
                    should be lodged, and the terms on which it should be exercised, were likely in
                    early times to be determined by other circumstances than reason.</p>
                <p>The mode finally adopted, by which the power is intrusted to the sole discretion
                    of the crown, appears to be, upon the whole, the most desirable. Yet the
                    prerogative was so unsettled in practice, and probably also in law, that down to
                    the reign of Henry VII. the assent of parliament was generally expressed in
                    patents of personal creation. Upon this usage West founded his theory, in
                    opposition to Prynne, that such assent was a necessary condition. M hatever may
                    have been understood to be the law, the practice was liable to all the
                    objections so triumphantly urged against the bill twice proposed by Lord
                    Sunderland in the beginning of the last century, for limiting the number of the
                    peerage. Whilst a restraint upon the royal prerogative of creating additional
                    peers would occasion more evils than it could cure, no similar risk accompanies
                    the withholding from the crown a power of punishing by exclusions or of
                    privileging by exemptions the actual members of that body. Accordingly, Lord
                    Coke holds that even dispensations, answering to the excuses formerly besought
                    by poor boroughs, granted by the king in relief of lords petitioning to be
                    spared the burdensome service of attendance, were contrary to law. The mode in
                    which the prerogative of creation was exercised varied with the times, but never
                    seems to have been felt to be a grievance. The jealousy of the Stuart creations
                    before the breaking out of the civil wars, and the remonstrance against the
                    Scotch and Irish honours, was only a temporary ebullition. The degradation which
                    the decay of families might have brought upon so much of the peerage as was
                    called by a general writ of summons, came to a certain degree within the control
                    of two principles: the one, that a patent without words of inheritance is simply
                    a dignity for life; and the other, that peers might be summoned only to a single
                    parliament. There are instances of ninety-eight laymen who were summoned only
                    once, of fifty others who were summoned two, three, or four times. The present
                    course, however, of descendible nobility, is as old as the reign of Elizabeth.
                    The uniformity of our modern usage would be corroborated, amongst other causes,
                    by the contemporary extinction of a corresponding variation which had previously
                    subsisted in the summons of the ecclesiastical members of the House of Lords.
                    The bishops are said to sit by a usage compounded of a triple title. They are
                    supposed to be the representatives of the church, to have been more learned
                    counsellors than the lay nobility, and to be the life-proprietors of the
                    baronies attached to their sees. The last condition, however, is wanting in the
                    sees erected by Henry VIII. But parliamentary bishops formed a small portion of
                    the spirituality in the upper house. Out of one hundred and twenty-two abbots
                    and forty-one priors, who occasionally sat previously to the dissolution of the
                    monasteries, it appears that only twenty-five abbots and two priors were
                    constantly summoned. There are numerous instances of the allowance of exemptions
                    to abbots and priors after summons, by reason of their holding nothing of the
                    king. This ground of exemption, as insisted on and admitted, shows <hi
                    rend="italic">whence</hi> the duty was derived. It does not follow but that the
                    grounds of <hi rend="italic">right on</hi> their part might be more extensive.
                    It is according to this distinction that the writ requiring the attendance of
                    the temporal nobility by summons, belongs to a period and style when its duties
                    were an <hi rend="italic">obligation,</hi> and were recognised as such; the
                    patent to a period when they had become an <hi rend="italic">honour.</hi> The
                    most important parliamentary change, however, which collaterally resulted from
                    the dissolution of the monasteries, was the subordinate condition to which it
                    reduced the church numerically in the House of Lords. This alteration was likely
                    to diminish the general political influence of the church much more than the
                    subsequent cesser of the convocation in 1663.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745427" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5427-0013"/>
                <p>The authority of the convocation being confined to the clergv, the public at
                    large had little immediate interest in its operations beyond the share which
                    they might therein please to assess themselves by way of ecclesiastical
                    contribution towards the public burdens. In point of fact, the temporalities
                    even of the church seem to have lost nothing from either cause; much less its
                    substantial influence. Few will think, whilst the clergy have been shut out from
                    the commons, and lowered down to the compliment of a single bench amongst the
                    lords, that their friends have not done for them behind their backs quite as
                    much as they could have done for themselves if present. The influence of the
                    church of England in its apparently almost unrepresented and unprotected state,
                    is a great proof how little comparatively depends on the means by which an end
                    is to be produced, when a power, composed of a wealth, an intelligence, and an
                    opinion competent to produce the end, is really in existence out of doors.
                    Although the dignitaries of the Roman Catholic church varied in numbers from
                    time to time, yet they always formed the actual majority of the House of Lords
                    up to the Reformation, which, nevertheless, they could not stop. Here, again,
                    with what prudent reserve did the Roman Catholic clergy husband for ages the
                    political power which mere numbers vested in their hands; and how evident is it
                    that, whatever form, even of superstitious incarnation, the dominant spirit of
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> government may assume, it is only by compromises that
                    it can subsist. The Stuarts, the great examples of every species of political
                    misrule, would have been ruined by this alone; they were bent on acting up to
                    the very extent and margin of their powers. Nobody reading English history
                    previously to the Reformation would have an idea that during all that time the
                    temporal nobility were in a minority; that therefore their legislative
                    importance existed only by permission; and that every act of the House of Lords
                    might be said to be in strictness the will and pleasure of the church.</p>
                <p>The number of the lay nobility has fluctuated considerably. It had advanced from
                    fifty-five in the reign of Henry VΠI. to one hundred and six in that of James I.
                    It is at present three hundred and ninety-one. The aristocratical complaint made
                    by Lord Delamere under James II. that, ever since the time of Henry VII., a
                    systematic project had been pursued to humble the peerage, by means of
                    multiplying its numbers, and by introducing into it persons of mean extraction,
                    was particularly injudicious. Unless something of this kind had taken place, the
                    extreme disproportion between the two houses, in their external as well as in
                    their personal titles to consideration, would have deprived the peerage of a
                    great part of its present strength. If the order was to be more than a pageant,
                    it became most desirable to increase its numbers to the extent of giving them a
                    better chance of bearing some comparison in ability and character with the
                    select representatives of the rest of the nation. It was scarcely less so to
                    recruit into their ranks those members of the commonalty who, whatever might be
                    the obscurity of their pedigree, were most distinguished for their wealth or
                    services. Thus alone could the body have been protected against the narrow sense
                    of corporate pretension which must otherwise have infected it. The long
                    recollections which feudalism has left, and the recent jealousy which has
                    collected around corporations, notwithstanding their former usefulness,
                    demonstrate the depth of the national re-action, which all invidious
                    exclusiveness unavoidably provokes. In fact, no amount of popular opinions has
                    been sufficient to save the combination of the great Whig families from a
                    suspicion of aristocratical tendencies of this descriptión. The popular
                    criticisms on the corn-law legislation of landed proprietors are a proof of the
                    keenness which watches every supposed connection between public policy and
                    partial interests. An evil not quite similar, but equally, indeed in all
                    probability more, destructive in its consequences to the object and safety of
                    the peerage as a branch of the legislature, must follow, whenever its vacancies
                    are too long filled up from a particular party in the state. It is self-evident
                    that the chances of a difference of opinion between a House of Lords partially
                    constructed, and a popular House of Commons, cannot be raised with impunity
                    beyond a certain point. Under the most accurately-balanced government, the
                    question, whether the Lords shall at any time interpose their legislative
                    negative, must of course, as in the case of the king, depend at last on their
                    own discretion. The difference in practice is found in their respective
                    positions. There can scarcely remain a possible presumption in favour of the
                    single opinion of a chief hereditary magistrate, when a majority of the nation,
                    aware of that opinion, is found constitutionally ranged against him. On the
                    other hand, abuse in their original appointments, and ignorance of the duties'
                    and necessities of their station, must have gone to an extravagant length indeed
                    before a body of the nature of the House of Lords îs put in equal peril by the
                    rejection of whatever measures may be sent up to it by a majority of the House
                    of Commons. Take either extreme; a House of Lords in constant collision with the
                    Commons, or a House of Lords only occupied in registering its edicts. In the
                    former case, it cannot exist long; in the latter, it is already existing only in
                    name.</p>
                <p>The popular part of the English constitution is lodged in the House of Commons,
                    which originated in the year 1295; and, in its present extension, consists of
                    the representatives of different interests or sections of the community, by
                    individuals of their choice. It is very singular that the simple expedient of
                    popular representation, an indispensable condition to every form of a free
                    government in a great kingdom, never occurred to the legislators of antiquity.
                    By this device, the experiment of a free government is entirely changed, and
                    becomes, under all circumstances, infinitely more practicable, safe, and
                    beneficial. According to the ordinary theory of the English constitution, the
                    House of Commons is said to represent the whole population, as far as it is
                    supposed to be by its circumstances independent. Of these, the knights, or the
                    members returned by the freeholders of the county, are alleged to represent the
                    interest concerned in agriculture; whilst the citizens and burgesses, or the
                    members returned by certain towns, have been described as representing the
                    interest concerned in trade. The basis of English representation, at first very
                    limited, and Iong extremely fluctuating, was never so extensive as to answer to
                    the first part of this theory; and time rendered it, by the rise of some places
                    and the fall of others, still less so. The reform bill has probably more nearly
                    approximated towards realizing the theory of a representation as universal as
                    the independence and intelligence of the people, at the present than at any
                    former period. The most that can be said of the latter proposition is, that some
                    such division as it assumes between real and personal property, agriculture and
                    trade, probably appeared originally between the two classes of members. This was
                    the natural course as long as the duty of the House of Commons was confined to
                    taxation. The original demarcation would probably continue visible as long as
                    1&gt;arlia-mentary attendance was considered as a burden rather than an honour.
                    Historically, this and any similar distinction gradually fell into disuse soon
                    after the 2^3d Henry VI. That statute required the knights of the shire to be
                    actual knights, or such notable esquires and gentlemen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(generosi a nativitate)</hi> as had estates sufficient to be <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193745440" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5440-0014"/>knights, and by no means of
                    the degree of yeomen. We find that a county member who had,been actually
                    elected, was set aside because he was. not of gentle birth. A great change “must
                    be commencing before the possibility of the wanţ pf puch a precaution could be
                    suggested; and still more, before the precaution, when taken, should not
                    immediately succeed.,,. The change maybe assumed to have begun as far hack as
                    the 19th Edward II. when there were twenty-eight county members who appear not
                    to have been knights. Of course, the arrangements and very elements of society
                    must have been still further broken up, before a manufacturer could have a
                    chance of a successful nomination with the freeholders of a county court. It is
                    but little that positive legislation upon these points either accelerates or
                    retards. It can recall nothing; and, to be effectual, must continue to be in
                    harmony with the wants and character of the times. This was abundantly proved in
                    the failure of the statute of Henry V. the object of which was to compel members
                    to be inhabitants of the places for which they served. The attempt fixes the era
                    when the deviation from the old connection was attracting general attention. Its
                    pertinacious vitality in the statute-book is a striking instance also of the
                    extreme reluctance with which the English people, so far from anticipating
                    needless innovations, have consented to affirm the innovations made by time
                    itself. Prynne shows that Cornish names were formerly returned in the elections
                    for Cornwall, and northern from the north. Clarendon opens his memoirs by
                    stating the little communication which passed between different parts of the
                    country, even with the metropolis, almost to his own time, except in the
                    circuits.of the lawyers. The names of the members for the counties were,
                    aristocratical, those for the boroughs plebeian. A few burgesses begin to be
                    called esquires in the returns of Edward IV. By this time the House of Commons
                    was becoming of sufficient importance to render parliamentary influence with a
                    borough an object of ambition to the nobility and gentry of its neighbourhood.
                    The character of the borough representation opened and extended itself
                    accordingly. It soon embraced every description of person who had a claim to
                    enter into public life. The lawyers, to whom attendance was probably less
                    personally inconvenient than to others, appear to have come in earlier for more
                    than their reasonable share. But this expansion and adaptation beyond its
                    original purpose could alone have made the inequalities and anomalies of the
                    borough representation tolerated so long. The citizens and burgesses, though
                    always more numerous, seem to have felt their social inferiority, and for a long
                    time to have continued more humble minded than the knights. Qf the three hundred
                    members, the average number from the 23d Edward I. to Henry VIII., a third or
                    more were returned by the boroughs. During this long interval the sheriff
                    exercised a discretion, to the use or frequently to the abuse of which the
                    parliamentary existence, by prescription, of many, unincorporated boroughs is to
                    be ascribed. Boroughs by charter, even from mesne lords, and towns, whether the
                    ancient or the actual demesne of the crown, ma¢e up the list. Many boroughs were
                    originally inconsiderable places; and others imperceptibly decayed. This latter
                    cause would take effect from the reign of Henry VIII., the date at which the
                    elective franchise became constitutionally too valuable to be left, when it had
                    been once enjoyed, to the mercy of the sheriff, or to be allowed by its
                    possessors to drop into disuse. The,,royal prerogative of new creations which
                    existed in the House of Lords, existed also over the borough compartment of the
                    House of Commons. Elizabeth indulged herself in the plenary exercise of it in
                    England, as freely as her successor did in Ireland; but, supposing that her
                    subjects had ventured to remonstrate, she was too wise to have ventured, in
                    return, on his indecent answer: “The more the merrier, the fewer the better
                    cheer.” The prerogative of adding to the boroughs, however, is one which could
                    <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> not last in an enlightened age. The same reasoning
                    which pleads against a parliamentary or popular appointment of the peerage,
                    presumes a parliamentary or popular appointment of the commons. It is not so
                    surprising, that after the shaking up of the political Opinions of the nation
                    during the civil wars, one instance only of borough creation (that of Newark)
                    should have occurred, as that Charles II. should have made the experiment even
                    of one. Borough creations were the great reservoir whence the successive
                    accessions to the numbers of the House of Commons had been supplied.
                    Nevertheless, owing to the course pursued previously to the passing of the
                    reform bill, the interests engaged in commerce and manufactures appear,
                    notwithstanding the vast contemporary augmentation of their wealth, to have had
                    less power in parliament, or at least less influence on legislation, than in an
                    earlier age. The House of Commons in the first parliament of James I. consisted
                    of 470 members. The last unreformed and the present reformed representation,
                    reckoning the additions derived from the Scotch and Irish unions, are not much
                    more numerous. They both give a total of 658. The difference between the two
                    lies in the proportions in which these numbers are divided amongst the several
                    classes of the people. It has been calculated that a hundred and fifty-four
                    persons returned a majority of the former house. Counties formed the only large
                    constituencies, whilst scarcely a single large town was represented. At present
                    the franchise is compounded of a ratio of property and numbers. Mere nomination
                    is destroyed; and, on analysing the numbers, it will be seen that the members
                    for counties are 252, the members for towns and the universities 406. This
                    question of proportion, though it has been assumed by critical writers, was
                    evidently never before seriously thought of. The necessity of entering on such
                    comparisons had not yet arrived. The means of securing the impartiality of the
                    sheriff, and the independence of the electors, was formerly a more immediate and
                    important point. It is impossible, from the gross partiality of the sheriffs
                    (officers annually appointed by the crown), to reason upon the old returns. The
                    freeholders of a county court were of course placed comparatively beyond their
                    reach; yet sheriffs contrived to aid in the virtual disfranchisement even of
                    counties. According to Prynne, it appears by the indentures that, as late as the
                    8th of Henry VI. the attorneys of a few great people could dictate or manage on
                    occasion the representation of Yorkshire itself. In the meanwhile political
                    information was spreading. Reformers of all kinds sallied forth. The decayed
                    boroughs, and the consequent flagrant inequality of representation, became the
                    subject of a criticism, founded on theories more or less correctly derived from
                    the practice of earlier times. The very word representation provoked
                    observation, and was in many instances in ridiculous contradiction with the
                    fact. It appeared impossible that this could be what the constitution intended
                    by the name. Even James I. was struck by it on his accession. The charge given
                    by him to the sheriffs, on calling his first parliament, not to direct a writ to
                    any ancient town, being so ruined that there were not such sufficient residents
                    as to make a proper choice, comprehended a most desirable reform. The fault was
                    in the mode which he proposed for carrying it into effect. The supposed
                    prerogative was more than ,could be safely entrusted to a sheriff of James I.
                    The system grew more unreasonable every day, both in reality and in appearance;
                    and, to complete its indefeu-sibleness, the stain of corruption gradually crept
                    in, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745453" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5453-0015"
                    />deepened the offensive spectacle into a scandal and a nuisance. The reform
                    bill has at last brought this long outstanding grievance to a satisfactory
                    conclusion. The elective basis is so enlarged as to comprehend all the elements
                    of sound national self-government, and the independence of the electors is amply
                    secured against all danger but from themselves. The interference of the
                    executive in elections may be more immediately dangerous to freedom; but a
                    constitution undermined by corruption is infinitely more disgraceful to the
                    parties who are guilty of it, and to their fellow-countrymen, who sit still in
                    stupid connivance at their baseness. Lord Coke, mentioning the first case of
                    bribery on record (in the- 13th Elizabeth), denounces it “as poisoning the very
                    fountain itself.” The disease was communicated slowly. It is not yet a hundred
                    years since it had reached the height and notoriety of being a public evil and a
                    national dishonour. Clarendon, in his disdainful notice of the first ministerial
                    intrigue in order to buy over a majority by bargaining and not by reasoning,
                    leads us back to the origin and cause of all. He fastens on ’ the government the
                    first link of the chain, the length and burden of which naturally increased at
                    every remove. Bolingbroke, the distinguished father of the modern Tories, lays
                    the principal blame of it on Clifford. Members who could make money of their own
                    votes, found it was worth while to pay for the votes of their constituents.
                    Evelyn’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> contain frequent ejaculations on the
                    increasing expense and debauchery of elections, before and after the Revolution.
                    In works of the date of Brown’s <hi rend="italic">Estimate</hi> and
                    Chesterfield’s <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi> it is noticed, for the first
                    time, that the franchise of making laws for the English people was disposed of
                    by boroughmongers under private pecuniary contract, or brought openly to market
                    by burgesses and freemen, for the competition of public sale. The expense of
                    elections, to say nothing of bribery, had become so ruinous, even in the earlier
                    days of Burke, that in a speech on one of Mr Sawbridge’s motions, he says, “the
                    expense of the last election has been computed (and I am persuaded that it has
                    not been overrated) at L.1,500,000—three shillings in the pound more than the
                    land tax.”</p>
                <p>The antiquarian question of the origin and progress of the House of Commons is
                    interesting, not merely as the title-deeds to English freedom, but as
                    constituting an important chapter in the history of man and of society. It
                    describes the germ and development of an institution which, in its extensive and
                    permanent application, is an invention of modern times, and the most likely of
                    all, not even excepting the steam-engine and the press, to influence the
                    fortunes of the human race. In this view, the great consideration is not so much
                    the steps by which its component parts were formed, as those by which its
                    authority was obtained. There can be no doubt that the early summons to the
                    commons was not honorary, but onerous. Long after the general right was
                    perceived to be a national advantage, the particular exercise of it was felt to
                    be an individual hardship. The real history of almost every people is in its
                    exchequer. This is emphatically the case with England. Fiscal considerations lie
                    at the bottom of its most celebrated institutions and enactments. Every body
                    worth taxing was to be got at in some form or other. The right of arbitrary
                    tallage upon towns was limited and invidious. It was abolished in the 25th
                    Edward I. by the time that the new experiment was coming fairly into play. In
                    the facilities which representation, afforded to taxation, government soon found
                    a compensation for the slight additional control and inconvenience which the
                    co-optation of the commons into the legislature might by degrees and at times
                    occasion. The yeomen owners of freehold lands w ere to give an account of their
                    pecuniary capabilities in that character. Wherever property had grown up in
                    other shapes, as in towns, it was also to be made amenable. Apparently when this
                    was done by way of deputies, which was the ordinary mode in the estates and
                    diets of the middle ages, no particular directions issued. There is not a word
                    said in the writs concerning the qualifications of the electors, or the numbers
                    to be elected, or the forms to be observed, either in counties or in boroughs.
                    Two was the number fixed upon, probably to prevent subsequent confusion, either
                    by prevarication, mistake, or sickness; and usage would soon turn the practice
                    into law. Whilst taxation was the great object at stake, it was one in which all
                    might equally be trusted for labouring to reduce the subsidy to the lowest
                    point. The franchise in boroughs would easily devolve from the towns’ people at
                    large to a select council, when all that the voter got by insisting on the
                    privilege, was a liability to pay his share towards the parliamentary wages of
                    the member. The election struggles of a later age, indeed ever since the
                    committee of which Serjeant Glanville was the chairman, have been vain efforts
                    to undo the effect of these irregularities and encroachments. But the great
                    objects of a national legislation and the spirit of freedom were of older date.
                    Long before the actual existence of the commons as a third estate in parliament,
                    the barons had extorted from their monarch, and had transcribed into the rude
                    articles of Magna Charta, a principle and a feeling, before which the
                    traditional longings after the laws of Edward the Confessor speedily expired.
                    There was little left for the patriots of after times to add, but the necessary
                    machinery of more adequate forms and institutions. Magna Charta seems to have
                    been looked upon almost as a personal contract, which it was necessary to renew
                    at the commencement of every reign, in order to make it binding upon successive
                    sovereigns. The terms of its successive confirmations (Lord Coke reckons no less
                    than thirty-two) fixed in the minds of men an inseparable connection between the
                    grant of supplies and the redress of grievances. The House of Commons put forth
                    at different periods the claim to its peculiar privileges and its general
                    powers. As early as the reigns of Richard II. and Henry VI., we find it refusing
                    to proceed in the public business without a sufficient answer. For a time the
                    two houses voted separate and unequal aids. The first notice of the maxim that
                    parliamentary aids must be granted by the commons and agreed to by the lords,
                    appears in the 9th Henry IV. As the report expresses it, when bothare of accord,
                    the grant is to be signified to the king by the mouth of the speaker of the
                    House of Commons. This is said to be “in manner and form accustomed, to the end
                    that the lords and commons may have what they desire of the king.” The
                    strictness of this privilege can never have stood on any sufficient reason. It
                    was unimportant whilst the two houses voted their subsidieá singly, and bound
                    each other to different amounts, which continued to be the course with the
                    clergy in convocation to the last. It was still more indifferent which of the
                    two began from the time that supplies were voted by them in concurrence,' since
                    either house, by the use of its negative, could protect itself. Restraints on
                    the initiative aré not worth contending for. The exclusive right of determining
                    all questions connected with the elective Franchise Wóuld have been a more
                    equitable distinction.* Upwards’ of a quarter of a century before the third
                    estate was called to parliament, the barons had paid the subsidy demanded of
                    them*into the hands of four of their own order, with directions to expend it at
                    their discretion for the benefit of the king * and kingdom. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> It was not until after the Restoration that the House
                    of Commons was provoked, by the scandals of the court of Charles II. to adopt
                    the nluch more respectful form in use at present/ for the control and

                    of the national expenditure, although Clarendon declaims against it as an
                    unheard of innovation. Of all their civil rights, immunity from taxation, except
                    through parliament, has been that of which the English people were most tender,
                    and which they first succeeded in thoroughly and irrevocably establishing. After
                    the reign of Edward III. a few attempts, ill concealed under the soft words of
                    loans and benevolences, are slight exceptions to the universal current of
                    precedents. On this, admitted by Clarendon to be the clearest of an points, the
                    Stuarts dragged the judges with them into the abyss-The patience and
                    perseverance of the English people are equally signalized in the steady
                    parliamentary resistance by which the account of ages was closed with the act of
                    the 16th Charles I. c. S, against the imposition of tonnage and poundage,
                    without consent of parliament. It is the last act in the statute-book against
                    arbitrary exactions of revenue. The right to participate equally in general
                    legislation was obtained earlv. but slowly enforced. The lăth Edward II. had
                    recognised the necessity of the concurrence of the commons to all measures
                    whatever in the most positive terms. It is probable, however, that for some time
                    afterwards, its assent for ad purposes except taxation was little more than
                    constructive. The commons, it is true, after the next reign, figure, byname at
                    least, almost always in the enacting clauses: the laws being generally said to
                    be made by the king, with the assent of the lords, at their request. At this
                    period, however, the king, by diminutions and additions to a petition, often so
                    completely changed its nature, as to become himself the real legislator on its
                    contents. They consequently insisted, in the 2d Henry V. ·'· considering they
                    had ever been as well assenters as petitioners," that without their assent it
                    should be no statute. The abuse was only put an end to in the reign of Henry VI.
                    by the slight variation of drawing up the bills in their present form. There is
                    only one instance mentioned during the tyranny of Henry λ III. of the rejection
                    of a bill supported by the cr□w∏. The commons found courage on several occasions
                    to resist the measures of his children. The year 9 Henry IV. above referred to.
                    is also remarkable for the first assertion in behalf of freedom of speech in
                    parliament, by declaring that the king is to take no notice of what passes
                    there. This impunity is confined, however, to the locality of the speech so
                    spoken. A publication of it by the press or otherwise is responsible to the
                    ordinary law. The earliest definition of privilege on arrest is in Larke’s case,
                    in S Henry V I. The case cf Storie in the 4th Edward VI. is the first commitment
                    which has been recorded of one of their own body for contemptin proportion as
                    the House of Commons became gradually more and more mixed up with the general
                    affairs of state, the possession of these powers and privileges rose in
                    importance, as being essential to its independence. Mere assurances of this or
                    that immunity are of no avail, unless the means of realizing them also exist-The
                    necessity to which Sir Thomas More was obliged to yield, of retiring into
                    private life, in order to escape the displeasure of Henrv VII., on account of a
                    speech in the House of Commons, shows that the season for 3 valid parliamentary
                    opposition had not yet arrived. In the attack upon the five members in the house
                    itself, Charles I. cutheroded himself. On other occasions, he had lain in wait
                    for the dissolution of parliament, which was his usual signal for resuming more
                    open hostilities against the liberties of his people. As soon as the speaker’s
                    mace had been disenchanted of its protecting power, the royal warrant was wont
                    to go forth against the most popular of the late members by whom his illegal
                    designs had been principally thwarted. The law and the fact, however, improved
                    together. Both houses have long been in possession of whatever powers can be
                    necessary for the performance of their public duties. Popular members are as
                    safe after as during sessions. Nobody dreams of intimidation. Parliamentary
                    corruption has not merely declined; it has almost disappeared. If a comparison
                    between the pensioners and placemen of ancient parliaments, with the modest list
                    of officers of the crown sitting there at present, be satisfactory, what ought
                    to be felt at the contrast between the unblushing bribery of Walpole’s
                    administration and the purity of modern governments? The compulsory economy
                    introduced into the treasury has co-operated, with other causes, of which the
                    chief is public opinion raised under the sanction of the middle classes, to
                    elevate the standard of public morals amongst public men. The boundary which
                    separates legitimate and undue influence, is that at which practical politicians
                    no less than theoretical reasoners have arrived at last. As corruption began at
                    the top, it has first ceased there. λVhatever remained to be done in improving
                    the public spirit of the elected, as well as of the electors, it is the direct
                    tendency of the reform bill to accomplish. The elective franchise is now
                    thoroughly identified with the nation, and is made, in the eyes both of those
                    who choose and those who are chosen, more visibly and entirely a public trust.
                    The destruction of the nomination boroughs leaves no pretence for the open
                    constituencies which persevere in converting the trust into a sordid personal
                    advantage. The parts which unfortunately appear to continue tainted are as yet
                    inconsiderable. Unless they yield to the alteratives by which the whole body
                    politic has been renewed and strengthened, they must be cut out. History holds
                    out no hope that the inconsistency of incorrupt representatives and of corrupt
                    electors can continue long.</p>
                <p>The supposition of a legislature consisting of three coordinate authorities, does
                    not imply a defined line or logical division to which they must each conform,
                    and which every body can distinguish; on one side of which, the concurrence of
                    the several parts must degenerate into mere dependence; whilst, on the other,
                    their separation must form into impracticable opposition. The experience,
                    however, of all mixed governments, more especially a comparison of the case of
                    England with that of countries subject to the simple forms, establishes the fact
                    that it is not a mere fiction, concealing under nominal distinctions the real
                    servility of the inferior in their subjection to the superior members of the
                    supposed partnership. It is evident that a sort of adjustment does practically
                    take place, sufficient to produce a palpable effect. The nature and temper of a
                    particular society may easily make such a constitution impracticable. But, under
                    fortunate circumstances, it in a great measure accomplishes the ends which it is
                    its professed object to perform. The problem assumes the natural inclination of
                    its respective parts to press unduly on each other. In tracing a constitution
                    which has been formed by time, and has endured through ages, the tendency' of
                    the several biases must be expected to be more apparent, now one way <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, now another, than in a government of entirely new
                    construction. Encroachments at different periods are more likely to take place,
                    from a recurrence to former usages on one side, or from a spirit of re-action to
                    them on the other, in constitutions which have grown up, like those of England
                    and ancient Rome, by the amendments of centuries, than in mechanical
                    contrivances, like the government of Lycurgus and that of America, modelled from
                    die beginning and at once, on an express design. Accordingly, English history
                    presents examples of each branch of the legislature in its turn assuming a
                    legislative power. The king has issued his proclamations to create, not to
                    promulgate law, under the pretence of state expediency. An irregular exercise of
                    the equivalent power of suspending or dispensing with the law, in other words, a
                    claim to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745479" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5479-0017"/>untie
                    by himself the knot which the entire legislature had tied, had prevailed so
                    long, that even at the Revolution it was only partially denounced. Ordinances
                    authorized by both houses, whether for the militia or otherwise, are equally
                    indefensible. The same is the case <hi rend="italic">a fortiori</hi> with
                    resolutions by either house singly against putting in execution such laws as
                    happen to be unacceptable to it, but which the other branches of the legislature
                    are not willing to repeal. Notwithstanding a most unguarded admission by Mr
                    Justice Gould to the contrary, in the conflicting decisions which arose out of
                    Wilkes’s case, there can be no doubt but that the doctrine of Lord Mansfield is
                    correct. Speaking of declarations of law made by either house of parliament, he
                    observed, -that he never thought himself bound in his judicial capacity to
                    honour them with the least regard. The vote of the commons in 1648, that their
                    single enactment was law, called forth on the Restoration the statute of 13
                    Charles II. It subjects to the penalties of <hi rend="italic">prcemumre,</hi>
                    the advised affirmation that both or either of the houses of parliament have any
                    legislative authority without the king. The unconstitutional attempts of both
                    houses, especially of the lords, to extend their jurisdiction as courts of
                    justice, brings us properly to the next consideration.</p>
                <p>The necessity of separating the judicial from both the legislative and the
                    executive power, and of vesting it in independent tribunals, is now universally
                    admitted. But it is a necessity which antiquity never perceived; and it was in
                    direct opposition to the letter and the spirit of the feudal system. Therefore
                    the successive generations which moulded the English constitution into shape,
                    may be excused for having learned it but slowly and by experience. English
                    history providentially is stained with fewer judicial iniquities, which are the
                    greatest of all crimes, than that of almost any other country. But a failure of
                    justice is the worst feature of the long period comprehended in the lines of
                    Plantagenet and Tudor. Perhaps the greater part of the deficiency is to be
                    attributed . to the imperfect division of these powers, especially of the
                    executive and judicial. Lord Clarendon has left a picture, sketched as late as
                    the middle of the reign of Charles I., of what may be expected from a
                    legislature, a court of justice, and a board of administration, all in one.
                    Officers of the crown became “a court of law to determine civil right, and a
                    court of revenue to enrich the treasury; the council table by proclamations
                    enjoining to the people that which was not enjoined by the laws, and prohibiting
                    that which was not prohibited; and the star-chamber, which consisted of the same
                    persons in different rooms, censuring the breach and disobedience of those
                    proclamations by very great fines, imprisonments, and corporal severities; so
                    that any disrespect to any acts of state, or to the persons of statesmen, was in
                    no time more penal, and the foundations of right never more in danger to be
                    destroyed.” The supreme courts at Westminster were originally derived out of the
                    royal court or <hi rend="italic">aula</hi><hi rend="italic">régis,</hi> which
                    consisted of the great household or personal officers and the barons. Ί hey were
                    intended to dispatch the ordinary judicial business, especially during the
                    absence of the household and personal officers in attendance on the kins, or
                    when the barony might not be assembled. The authority of these derivative
                    courts, whatever might be the case with the <hi rend="italic">aula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">régis</hi> as far as concerned the barons, was not in the eye of
                    the law inherent. It was supposed to be delegated to them by the king, as the
                    fountain of justice to his subjects. The judicial power of parliament, however,
                    was not displaced, nor meant to be so, by these auxiliary institutions. Fleta,
                    writing in the reign of Edward I. treats it as still the high court of justice,
                    “where doubtful cases of judgments are resolved.” There can be no doubt but that
                    annual parliaments were first demanded, and their intermission felt to be a much
                    more serious grievance on account of their judicial than of their legislative
                    capacity. It is evident, from the state of the early statute-book, that the
                    meeting of many a parliament might have been saved had they met only for the
                    purpose of legislation. There is a memorable order of IS Edward I-, by which
                    petitioners to parliament are apportioned to the several subordinate courts of
                    justice, both for their own dispatch, and to enable parliament to attend to
                    public business. If the matter happened to be so great or of such grace that
                    these courts could not end it, the chancellor and chief ministers were with
                    theirown hands to brin? it before the king and his council. Coke observes, that
                    wherever the king and council are mentioned judicially, it is to be interpreted
                    to mean the House of Lords. The celebrated treason statute, 25 Edward III.
                    closes its enumeration of the treasons specified therein with the express
                    reservation of “other like cases of treason which may happen in time to come.”
                    In which case “the judge shall tarry without going to judgment of the treason
                    till the cause be showed and declared before the king and his parliament,
                    whether it ought to be judged treason or other felony.” The reservation, however
                    inconsistent with the right of a people that the law shall be defined
                    beforehand, so that they may know what to avoid, and under what penalties, is
                    plainly a reservation of judicial and not of legislative power. In fact, this
                    parliamentary superintendence is recorded, on the authority of Chief Justice
                    Thorpe, to have been at that time the common course in other cases as well as
                    treason. He stated, in the 40th Edward III. “that he and Sir Hugh Green went
                    together to the parliament, when there were present at least twenty-four bishops
                    and earls, and asked the opinion of those who had been the makers of the late
                    statute of jeofail, concerning the alteration of a record.” “At another time,”
                    the same judge says, ∙∙ we were commanded by the council, that when any case of
                    doubt should happen, we should not go to judgment without good advice;
                    therefore,” adds he, in the case then before the court, “go to the parliament,
                    and as they will have us do we will, otherwise not.” The danger from this
                    anomalous tribunal would have been increased a thousand fold, if the lords had
                    succeeded in the unwarrantable claim which they set up in 11 Richard II. to a
                    law of parliament differing from the civil and the common law. The extension of
                    this irregular claim by Coke to the privileges of the lower house was more,
                    certainly, than the imperious barons of Richard II. ever contemplated by their
                    mutinous declaration. But it is still more unwarrantable, and more surprising,
                    that Burke should have renewed the doctrine of a parliamentary supremacy, in
                    judicial proceedings before parliament, over the rules of ordinary law. As the
                    penalty of this grievous error, his admirable Report on the proceedings against
                    Warren Hastings remains comparatively unknown.</p>
                <p>The share which the Houscof Commons took in this judicial jurisdiction was, if
                    any, very inconsiderable. Thorpe in the above passage uses the word parliament,
                    but mentions only earls and barons. The ordinance 6 Henry I∖‰ which has provoked
                    so much legal spleen, from its directing that no apprentice or ther man of the
                    law should be elected a knight of the shire, took its hint from a previous one
                    in the reign of Edward III. against lawyers practising in the king’s court-They
                    were accused of putting forward, as public petitions of the commons, matters
                    which concerned only their own clients. Notwithstanding the expression client,
                    the ground of disqualification here assigned relates probably to what was
                    formally legislative, and not judicial business, something like the private
                    bills of the present day. From the course of the constitution, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193745492" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5492-0018"/>as well as on their own
                    disclaimer, Mr Hallam considers that the intermeddling at all.in judicature by
                    the commons upon the petitions addressed to them, was pure usurpation. He
                    suggests that their intrusion may probably account for the disuse into which,
                    from the time of Henry IV. the lords allowed their appellate authority to fall.
                    It is very difficult to make out the steps by which they could have claimed the
                    right in question. But there is some difficulty in conceiving that the influence
                    of the House of Commons was so commanding at the period in question as the
                    alternative supposition would imply. Could they be strong enough to make good a
                    mere encroachment of this sort, and leave a competitor like the House of I,ords
                    no other method of resisting their invasion of its ancient right than by also
                    abandoning it altogether? Writs of error were resumed by the lords about the
                    accession of James I., renouncing all claim to any original jurisdiction in
                    judicial causes. This is surely anomaly enough. All pretence for the other had
                    disappeared in the equality of persons, in the uniform supremacy of the law, and
                    in the acknowledged excellence of the ordinary tribunals. Notwithstanding this
                    disclaimer, the extent to which the English legislature, under circumstances
                    more or less excusable, perplexes itself with questions properly belonging to
                    courts of justice, is subject to serious objections. It nowhere appears to such
                    disadvantage as in bills of attainder, of pains and penalties, and divorce
                    bills, which are all proceedings of a judicial nature applied to a case of <hi
                    rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">postfacto</hi> law. Injudicial inquiries,
                    carried on as such by either house, its numbers, partialities, habits, and the
                    intrinsic difference between legislative and judicial considerations, make it
                    impossible to convert a legislative assembly into a satisfactory court of
                    justice. This truth has been frequently, and is still, occasionally verified. In
                    its character of a court of ultimate appeal, the House of Lords escapes the
                    disgrace which must otherwise have been heaped upon it long ago, by retaining
                    the jurisdiction only in name, whilst the jurisdiction is in fact abandoned to
                    its legal members. There is more to be said for so peculiar an exception as that
                    of an impeachment. But later precedents, as in the instance of Warren Hastings
                    and Lord Melville, do not warrant the expectation that an impeachment, even
                    before such a body, can easily become an efficient instrument of justice. The
                    only judicial matters which can be brought before the House of Commons are
                    proceedings for contempts. Hurried on under great excitement before the whole
                    house, they are exposed in an aggravated shape to whatever risk proverbially
                    disqualifies an individual from being a judge in his own cause. It is only in
                    comparison with what is recorded of the trial of disputed elections by the house
                    itself, that election committees have acquired a conditional reputation.
                    Committees on private bills are frequently legislative only in form, whilst they
                    are in reality judicial inquests. They consider themselves above even the forms
                    of justice. Nothing is more common than for members to oblige their friends, by
                    stepping in to divide upon the merits of a case, where they have never heard a
                    syllable of either the evidence or the discussion. It is a singular instance of
                    the force of habit, and of the barrier raised by technical distinctions, that
                    this is done by persons who would act nevertheless with perfect honour upon a
                    jury.</p>
                <p>In a simple state of society the judicial and executive authorities are always
                    found united. Eastern kings administered justice at the gate; St Louis under the
                    oak. A confusion between these authorities is therefore, under all governments,
                    in the natural course of things a more probable event. The original theory of
                    the English constitution, as far as theory can be predicated of its rude
                    provisions, saw no incongruity between the duties. The traces of an entirely
                    opposite presumption are still amongst the minor embarrassments of at least the
                    language of the law. The administration of justice in the name of the king was
                    formerly more than an honorary prerogative. It was a feudal truth and necessity.
                    It is now a fiction which can only mislead both kings and people. Blackstone
                    says, that when the law calls the king the fountain of justice, it does not mean
                    that he is the author of it, but the distributor. Yet there are many things
                    contrary to this distinction, and the contradictions show most strongly the
                    mischief of these metaphorical compliments. The payment of fees on original
                    writs, the unjust rules in the exchequer in behalf of the prerogative, the
                    flagrant fines in the olden time as the only means of obtaining common justice,
                    presuppose that the king was so far its author that he could only be asked to
                    grant it upon his own terms. Judicial extortions became less frequent after
                    Magna Charta; but they prove the grievous necessity which existed for its
                    assurance that the subject should have remedial justice, “freely without sale,
                    fully without any denial, and speedily without delay.” A tax on justice is one
                    of the worst sources of royal revenue, under whatever title it be imposed. At
                    the present day the propriety of completely separating executive and judicial
                    duties is the tritest truism. It is next to impossible that a sovereign should
                    have the leisure, the attainment, or, in the most important cases, the
                    impartiality, to administer justice in his own person. The guilt of tampering or
                    of intimidation addressed to the judges, to whom the king has on the part of
                    society committed his judicial trust, is a heinous offence in the meanest
                    subject. When it proceeds from the king it is aggravated a thousand fold. But it
                    is not enough that the hands of justice should be pure. Their purity should be
                    beyond suspicion. For this purpose the independence of the bench ought to be
                    maintained above all possibility of fear or favour. Perhaps there is no better
                    evidence of what had long been only tradition concerning the personal attendance
                    of the king in his courts of justice, and on the limits within which he was
                    confined, than is contained in the case of jurisdiction of the House of Peers in
                    the year 1666. It is there said, that “when the king attends in the House of
                    Lords in his judicial capacity, he sits but as chief justice, doing nothing
                    singly, but by plurality of opinions, as when the kings would in person sit in
                    the king’s bench, which they have in former time done, where all is said to be
                    <hi rend="italic">coram</hi><hi rend="italic">rege,</hi> though now he never
                    come there; and in our memory King James hath sate in the star-chamber.” It is
                    natural that the king’s presence should be last seen in the courts, which were
                    not made unintelligible to common understandings by the forms of the common law,
                    and which, by retaining the longest the name and the character of his council,
                    seemed to keep the nearest to his person. Serjeant, when elected speaker in
                    1640, tells Charles I. “My disabilities are best known to myself; and to your
                    majesty, I suppose, not altogether unknown; before whom, in the course of my
                    practice and profession, it hath been your goodness towards the meanest of your
                    subjects divers times to do me the honour and favour to appear and bear a part
                    as an ordinary pleader.” So little did the Plantagenet generation know what they
                    ought to have prayed for on this subject, that in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> list
                    of very bold articles presented by parliament, to which Henry IV. consented in
                    the eighth year of his reign, there is found the following request. It was
                    prayed his majesty, that, “considering the wise government of other Christian
                    princes, and conforming himself thereto, he would assign two days in the week
                    for petitions, it being an honourable and necessary thing that his lieges who
                    desired to petition him should be heard.” James I. had a great longing to
                    exhibit every phasis of his learning to his subjects. After having been told in
                    Wraynham’s case by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745505"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5505-0019"/> the judges, <hi rend="italic">cessat regnare qui
                    cessat judicare,</hi> it is not surprising that he should think the opinion of
                    Lord Coke, that kings of England were incapacitated from the exercise of any
                    judicial functions, little short of treason. Nothing, however, is more fully
                    settled than that, as on one hand, the House of Lords, the Privy Council, and
                    the ordinary tribunals of the common law, derive all their judicial authority in
                    the first instance from the crown; so, on the other, whatever judicial authority
                    the king originally possessed, it was possessed as in a reservoir, and has since
                    all passed out of him into the appointed channels of his courts.</p>
                <p>Direct interference on the part of the crown with the integrity of the judges was
                    unfortunately not peculiar to the Stuarts; but it ended with them. It was
                    carried by them also to such extravagant and unheard of lengths, as to throw all
                    previous outrages of this description into the shade. The ignominy of the
                    imputation has rested therefore principally on their name. Elizabeth had the
                    sense to respect the honour of the interpreters of her laws; so that Coke felt
                    what he called the taking of auricular confessions by James to be a novelty and
                    a disgrace. The course, however, of the whole judicial history of England
                    teaches a great lesson: the extreme difficulty of maintaining freedom with
                    dependent judges. The struggle began at Nottingham, with the treasonable
                    surrender of the infant constitution of their country by Tresilian and Belknap,
                    in their discretionary expositions of law to Richard II. The impunity of
                    intervening centuries tempted the colleagues of Finch and Crawley to believe
                    that, supported by a sovereign at least as arbitrary, they might in their day
                    set parliament at defiance. Although their virtue often failed, yet, in the
                    main, the judges of the supreme courts of Westminster did their duty beyond what
                    could have been expected. Fortunately for their characters, special commissions,
                    composed chiefly of courtiers, were issued on most occasions of jealousy and
                    alarm. In consequence, they'Seem to have kept their ground in the confidence of
                    the public much better than the subordinate magistrates, who were subject, but
                    in a less degree, to the same influence. These latter never gave much
                    satisfaction. The ancient conservators of the peace, instead of continuing to be
                    elected by the freeholders, were turned, in the first year of Edward III. into
                    nominees of the crown. The necessity of suppressing the malefactors, who appear
                    in those days to have been at times encouraged by members of the nobility, could
                    not prevent the justices so appointed, on the extension of their jurisdiction,
                    from becoming speedily unpopular. A petition from the House of Commons, in the
                    11th Richard IL, declares that “every freeman in the land would be in bondage to
                    these justices.” Even in the retrograde years between Henry VI. and VIII., the
                    difference between the independent tribunal of a jury, and that of perpetual
                    officers connected with the executive, was well established. The right that
                    criminal proceedings should follow the course of indictment and of the common
                    law, is repeatedly and earnestly urged. Juries had so far begun to do their
                    duty, that the fiscal purposes of Henry VII. could only be carried into effect
                    by enabling these creatures of his power, removeable at his pleasure, to try all
                    offences except treason and felony by themselves. The restoration of a jury to
                    its pristine rights was one of the measures by which Henry VΠI. won, on his
                    accession, the popularity which he afterwards so cruelly abused. This
                    affectation of a return to the old constitutional character of the English
                    courts of justice, was soon overthrown by terrible innovations, like the
                    creation of the president and council of the north, and of the Welsh marches.
                    The worst part of these novelties consisted in their in reality placing the
                    judicial and executive authority in the same hands. What could the subject
                    expect from a tribunal of which Wentworth was the president? Mr Hallam says that
                    these and other irregular tribunals, when abolished by 16 Charles I., had
                    usurped so extensive a cognizance as to deprive one third of England of the
                    privileges of the common law. It was nevertheless reserved for the high
                    churchmen of Charles II. in the year 1664, to return to the charge. Legislating
                    against what they unjustly called seditious conventicles, they ventured to arm a
                    single justice (it is necessary to remember only what were the dependent
                    justices of those days) with the power of inflicting seven years transportation
                    on a third conviction of the offence of worshipping God contrary to act of
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>The objection applies still more strongly to the original authority of the
                    sheriff. The shrievalty was generally sold by the Norman kings, and was an
                    office of great emolument, and still greater influence. The coroner, with his
                    limited inquest of criminal police, was left to popular election. But the
                    sheriff, from the conquest downwards, except during the sixteen years which
                    intervened from the 28th Edward I. to the 9th Edward IL, was nothing but the
                    annually nominated servant of the crown. Great judicial authority was
                    intertwined with his civil superintendence over his county; the more so, because
                    the law has never sufficiently distinguished between acts which are judicial,
                    and acts which are ministerial only. Although in the hundred and the county, as
                    well as in the baronial court (not being courts of record), the freeholders were
                    the real judges, both of law and of fact, the sheriff’s authority was the
                    subject of great alarm. The principal sources of this jurisdiction were by
                    degrees turned into other channels. Criminal pleas were taken from him entirely
                    as far back as Magna Charta. The complaint upon which that clause was founded
                    had only sought that he should be restrained from hearing them except when
                    assisted by the coroner. The confidence felt in the popular presence of that
                    officer for decompounding and breaking up this dangerous identity of powers,
                    appears by several other writs in Rymer. The justices-in-eyre, not being the
                    same always as the judges of Westminster, were probably often but partial
                    improvements on the local administration of the sheriff. Their circuits,
                    however, facilitated the transfer of most of the civil as well as the whole
                    criminal business into a more strictly and purely judicial court. The civil
                    cases still cognizable in the county court, in which the sheriff is both
                    presiding officer and executioner of justice, are the inconsiderable and almost
                    obsolete remains of former usage.</p>
                <p>From this brief review, it appears that formerly the judicial power was often
                    placed in the same hands with the legislative and the executive. This probably
                    never took place without the people suffering severely from it. The small
                    territorial jurisdictions, civil or criminal, must have been the worst of all.
                    The existence of other checks at present, and the vigilant rapidity with which
                    public opinion keeps hovering over and bearing down'upon all official
                    misconduct, may blind us as to the importance of the principle itself. A hazard,
                    of which the only actual mischief is in the precedent, may seem not too much to
                    incur for the convenience of this or that exception. At the same time, no nation
                    is wise which in such a case presumes too far upon its security. A judge, when
                    member of the legislature or of the cabinet, is in a position which ought to
                    create, both with himself and with the people, a degree of watchfulness, not to
                    say jealousy, far beyond the case of other men. It is to be remarked, that the
                    greatest of all exceptions which occurs in this respect in English practice,
                    that of the Lord Chancellor, occurs in the very instance where the existence of
                    the judge depends on the casualties of the ministry of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193745518" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5518-0020"/>which he is a leading member.
                    An examination of the judicial removals during the Stuarts shows the extent to
                    which the hopes and fears of the bench were constantly played with. It was a
                    system, and not an accident. Nothing short of the 13th William III. could have
                    put it down. That statute altered the patents of the common law judges, from
                    patents during the king’s pleasure, to patents during their own good behaviour.
                    The little that was left to be done, was done at the accession of George III.
                    This last amendment consisted in excepting their'commissions from the fate of
                    all other crown appointments, that of being vacated on its demise. It was a very
                    prudent waiver of the little remnant of arbitrary power which, strange to say,
                    had in the interval been misused. But the waiver could of necessity be made by
                    any actual sovereign, solely at the expense of his successor. If a stop had been
                    put to the analogous suspicions connected with the promotions of judges and the
                    translations of bishops, it would have obviated an evil of more frequent
                    recurrence. On considering the elements of the character and of the happiness of
                    the nation, the English people are perhaps not more indebted to their
                    participation Tn legislation by means of the House of Commons, than to their
                    share in the administration of justice in the capacity of jurors. Not only has
                    the executive beèn kept at bay by their interposition, for the legal
                    verification of the fact at issue, but the legislature has received more than
                    one useful warning from their collateral influence on the law itself. For both
                    these purposes it was indispensable that intimidation should be removed from a
                    juror as thoroughly as corruption; and that offences imputed to him in the
                    discharge of his duty should be investigated and punished as cautiously, as
                    reverently, and before as impartial, if not as solemn a tribunal, as similar
                    offences imputed to a judge. The day when, in Bushell’s case, the court
                    relinquished the pretension of fining or imprisoning a jury for its verdict,
                    ought to be as memorable as any in the annals of the victories of justice. It
                    heralded in, and was in no degree less important than, the day which made it
                    impossible that any successor of Pemberton (for even the chief-justice who tried
                    Russell had paid too much respect to freedom) should be arbitrarily displaced.
                    In this point of view the dissatisfaction expressed by Jefferson with the
                    corresponding rule in the constitution of the United States, that the judges are
                    irremoveable, except by a resolution of two thirds of congress, is very
                    surprising. The exception would seem amply sufficient to secure the legislature
                    the necessary discretionary control. Considering the position occupied by the
                    ordinary courts of justice in the United States and in England, it is impossible
                    that they can make any serious encroachment on the other departments of the
                    state, without a degree of negligence or connivance on the part of the
                    legislature utterly inconceivable. The cry against judge-made law, on the ground
                    of its being an unwarranted encroachment, appears also, to the extent to which
                    the common law courts have carried their incidental legislation, to be quite
                    unfounded; and most of all in England, where the commonlaw judges are much more
                    justly liable to the inconsistent accusation of standing too stoutly upon the
                    letter and strictness of the law, and of having brought on the necessity of an
                    equitable jurisdiction and of irregular tribunals, from their narrow adherence
                    to precedents and forms. They are’not answerable for the main defects of the
                    English system, whether in the body of the law itself, in the centralization of
                    the metropolitan courts, or in the inadequacy of the local jürisdictiohs.'</p>

                    certain to bavé placed its executive power solely in the king. Long after the
                    two former authorities have succeeded in gradually emancipating themselves from
                    every thing but the antiquarian recollection of their original subordination,
                    the latter arrangement will in all probability retain its pristine vigour. This
                    is the consequence of the substantial advantages which belong to a single and *
                    permanent executive. Such, at least, has been the course pursued in England. The
                    founders of the republic of the United States, from their near observations upon
                    the French Directory, and from their personal experience of the disunion of
                    executive committees during the war of independence, admitted the propriety of
                    placing the necessary powers of the general administration in the hands of a
                    single individual. The name, whether king or president, is hardly worth
                    discussing. The great questions are, the mode by which this supreme magistrate
                    shall be appointed, and the powers with which he shall be invested. In comparing
                    with this view the English and the American systems, the principal difference
                    between them is in the mode by which the executive is appointed, and not in the
                    amount or nature of its powers. In their jealousy of the concentrating effect of
                    power, the Americans have subjected all the members of congress, the senate as
                    well as the bouse of representatives, and the office of president equally with
                    the senate, to the principle of rotation; only differing in the degree of
                    rapidity with which the elective wheel in the several cases performs its circle.
                    By this specific the evil tendencies of political power are supposed to be
                    reduced within manageable limits. Impartial spectators, on comparing the risks
                    of hereditary descent as experienced in England, with the risks already
                    manifested in the quadriennial presidential elections of America, may perhaps be
                    disposed to decide in favour of an hereditary parliamentary title, with
                    reference to the actual passions and prospects of society. A four years’ lease
                    of the president’s chair may be too exciting a prize to be safely left to
                    popular competition. Besides, the very character and abilities most likely to be
                    admired, are those on which the temptations of such an elevation must act with
                    the greatest force. It is one of the advantages of the English system, that
                    whilst the doctrine of descent greatly limits the probability of dangerous
                    talents in a sovereign, the mechanism of the constitution is so well arranged
                    and uuderstood as to do its work without them. The powers vested in the royal
                    executive are not extreme; for they are nearly the same as those which it has
                    been found necessary to maintain in the United States, notwithstanding all the
                    advantages of a new country.</p>
                <p>Under an ancient but progressive government, the executive authorities of the
                    chief magistrate, like all the other authorities of the state, must be capable
                    of being considered in three different points of view. These are,
                    the'historical, the actual, and the philosophical. Its constitutional history
                    will vary, both in the facts which it exemplifies, and in the reasoning by which
                    it is explained, at different periods. The correct legal description of it at
                    any given moment,' for instance the present, can represent at most only the law
                    and practice of the age. The philosophical conclusion, how far it ought to
                    extend in reason, may be, and probably will be, only obscurely signified in
                    either of those inquiries. Mr Allen, in his inquiry into the rise and growth of
                    the royal prerogative in England, and Mr Hallam, in different parts of his
                    constitutional history, have left little to be added upon the first division. Mr
                    Bentham, in his treatise upon legislation, has generalized upon the last. The
                    legal exposition of the second is all that Blackstone properly undertook.
                    Nothing certainly can be more absurd than the language which he has copied, in
                    Order to express the paradoxical fictions of the supposed attributes of
                    sovereignty, perfection and perpetuity<pb break="no" facs="nls:193745531"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5531-0021"/>. The parliament which consented to describe the
                    forfeiture of the crown by James IL, under the eupho-nism of an abdication,
                    proceeded in the selection of the word on many precedents. Their ancestors, at
                    every compromise with royalty, had demonstrated much indifference to words,
                    provided that the end and consummation were substantially achieved. In English
                    constitutional law, an unlimited and almost oriental deification of expression
                    is found alongside of rights strictly limited and specifically defined. The
                    Plantagenets, however, were much more cautious than the Tudors in bringing this
                    inconsistency to the test of a collision. Unluckily for the Stuarts, they were
                    mystified by the welcome homage of servile civilians and meddling churchmen. By
                    forcing on the solution of the problem, they learned too late, that from the
                    fact of the prerogative being incorporated with the law, whatever was not found
                    there could not possibly be within it. Even Locke’s definition of prerogative,
                    which Blackstone has thought fit to praise, is too liberal, not only for the
                    rights of reason, but for the rule of law. “The discretionary power of acting
                    for the public good” does not extend to all cases “where the positive laws are
                    silent but to such points only as the constitution has expressly reserved for
                    this discretion. Otherwise we come to the intermediate inherent power on which
                    James I., in his Flowers of Grace, claimed for royal proclamations the force of
                    temporary laws. The proper course on such extraordinary occasions is for
                    ministers to act on their responsibility, and trust to parliament for an
                    indemnity. The Stuarts were doomed to make the additional discovery that, among
                    prerogatives strictly legal, there were some, both prerogatives of authority and
                    prerogatives of revenue, which, being false in principle and mischievous in
                    effect, the public had become sufficiently intelligent and powerful to recall.
                    Our early kings, in the insidious reservations <hi rend="italic">(salvo jure
                    coronoe nostra·)</hi> by which they narrowed many of their most popular
                    concessions, had succeeded in a great measure in rendering that part of the
                    constitution unimproveable and fixed. This was the course, before notions of an
                    abstract <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">regium</hi> by consent of
                    nations, or the doctrine of a native immortality in the prerogative, which acts
                    of parliament even could not reach, had been yet imported into courts of law. A
                    struggle which could only be kept up by these new and desperate assertions, was
                    evidently near its close. These novelties were in.part the penalties of the
                    Reformation, at least as applied to England. Henry VIII. obtained for the crown
                    a new prerogative on that occasion. It was a more dangerous one than perhaps all
                    before it, in consequence of the greatness of the subject which it concerned.
                    The act of. supremacy was the corner stone, of the high commission court. Mr
                    Hallam truly observes, that “the real aim of the clergy, in enormously enhancing
                    the pretensions of the crown, was to gain its sanction for their own.” They
                    played into each other’s hands. If, as Mr Hallam affirms, the nation might be
                    considered, up to 1640, as having been, “in regard to spiritual dominion, a
                    great loser by the Reformation,” it would have lost every thing in regard to the
                    crown, had civil liberty depended on the loyal sophistries of the church. <hi

                    adoption of the language and sentiments of Laud· From the example of foriper

                    abolished, or, in case the law of England allowed of desuetude, are obsolete.
                    Some few <hi rend="italic">incidental</hi> ones remain, which appear to be in
                    the course of removal; since recent legislation has happily shown a desire to
                    look towards a reformation of the law. It is unfortunate that the direct
                    prerogative, which is. on the face of it the ŗnost revolting, nevertheless, from
                    its having so long principally supplied the king’s service with seamen, demands,
                    .in the immediate modification of it, considerable caution. Ma? rine
                    impressment, it must be remembered, came in,.however, upon no supposed necessity
                    of this nature.&gt; It is the remnant only of a doctrine and a practice which at
                    qne time included soldiers, and many classes of civilians. Like most other
                    prerogatives, it was abused under Charles I. for the purpose of extortion.

                    1743, in support of the legality of impressment, was wanted to recall the
                    attention of English lawyers to the several conditions which the law requires as
                    evidence of a subsisting prerogative. The debates on the alien act revived these
                    discussions for a season. The lawyer and the statesman look at questions of this
                    kind from different points of view. The first regards what is; the second, what
                    ought to be. For whether the particular, powers are wanted, and where they
                    should be placed, are further questions. In case these questions are settled in
                    the affirmative, it is unwise, by division, rotation, or a multiplicity of
                    checks, to reduce their efficiency below a certain point. Society loses more
                    than it gains by such expedients, as often as necessary powers are thus
                    incapacitated for the. due performance of their functions. This was frer quently
                    attempted in ancient times. On the other hand, governments cannot be too
                    cautious against the abuses which constitute the provocations to such
                    restraints. Unjust interpositions of the <hi rend="italic">nolle prosequi,</hi>
                    and of pardon by the crown, gave popularity to the appeal of murder. Lord Holt,
                    looking back rather than around him, called the anomaly “a noble remedy.”
                    Several petitions were vehemently urged by the commons of former ,days against
                    the generous prerogative of mercy. The degradation by, James I. of the
                    prerogative of honours, by bartering them, for the first time in English
                    history, for money, and the subjecting the peerage by Queen Anne to the personal
                    ambition of a minister, have the same tendency., They bring the prerogative
                    itself, as well as the subjects of it, into disrepute. The prerogative of making
                    peace and war was tarnished by the&lt;base negotiations of Charles II. It was
                    damaged later still, when Chatham himself was not able to withstand the
                    electoral prejudices of, his sovet reign in behalf of a campaign in Germany. The
                    observation maybe extended through every department of administration. It
                    applies especially to the formation and the government of so jealous and
                    delicate an engine as that of a standing army. The .moderation which, the
                    executive had displayed in the exercise of more qualified .powers, could-alone
                    have introduced <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> intd and kept in .the &lt; mu«</p>

                <p>tiny act the clause by which courts-martial are enabled to punish mutiny and
                    desertion with death. It was inserted for the first time in 1718; and it was
                    only carried at the time by small majorities. Of the impolicy of creating an
                    atom of waste power there can be no dispute. But if the power is really wanted,
                    they are sorry horsemen who are obliged to keep the strength and courage of
                    their horse permanently below his work, as their only means of riding him. On
                    the supposition that the powers are fitting powers for the executive magistrate
                    to possess, the appropriate remedy is to apply ministerial responsibility to
                    such cases, and to take care that the responsibility shall be a reality and not
                    a name. The healthiness and <hi rend="italic">vis medicatrix</hi> of the general
                    system must do the rest.</p>
                <p>The prerogatives of revenue depend on a different class of considerations. The
                    financial purchase of tenure by chivalry from Charles II. and the subsequent
                    arrangements entered into on granting successive civil lists, have not gone so
                    far towards completely sweeping out the holes and corners of the exchequer as
                    might have been wished. The last fibres of the barbarous fiscal pretensions
                    which flourished there in former days have still to be rooted up. The national
                    revenue, properly considered, consists of the portion of his property which each
                    subject contributes to the state, in order to secure the remainder. That being
                    the just principle, its demands should be limited in amount to what is necessary
                    for the proposed object, instead of setting a fiscal net to catch an irregular
                    and indefinite number of certain matters. Further, by an accurate calculation
                    and repartition, the necessary taxation ought to be equally borne, in respect of
                    their means, by all the king’s subjects, instead of falling upon particular
                    individuals on the happening of particular contingencies. In its original state
                    most of the ordinary or prerogative revenue raised the least possible sum with
                    the greatest possible inequality and inconvenience. The greater part of what
                    remains is only remarkable for its picturesque absurdity. There is, however, one
                    terrible exception, far too monstrous to be left for mitigation to the humanity
                    of the treasury. Nothing can be worse than the wholesale forfeitures and
                    confiscations which still sweep in the train of our criminal proceedings. In
                    spite of the praises bestowed by Blackstone on Mr Yorke’s essay in defence of
                    the law of forfeiture, and although the people owe the 25th Edward HL, which has
                    been called the magna charta of treason, almost solely to a squabble between the
                    king and his grantees the barons, for their several portions of the spoil,
                    according as the late owner had been found guilty of treason or of felony, it is
                    impossible that the reason and humanity of a great country can much longer
                    permit cruel iniquity, abandoned by the most civilized part of Europe, to be
                    justified upon antiquarian learning or by metaphysical refinements.</p>
                <p>Blackstone’s declaration at the commeneement of his chapter on prerogative, that
                    the powers which are vested in the crown by the laws, are necessary for the
                    purpose of society, maybe thought even now, if their whole detail is minutely
                    examined into, to go something beyond the truth. The exceptions, however, can be
                    in practice of no great consequence. The most obscure member of parliament would
                    have nothing to do at the present day but to attack any indefensible exception,
                    by a motion for its repeal. From the era that a general control over the
                    government passed into the House of Commons, influence has so much superseded
                    force, that questions of pure prerogative have lost much of their importance.
                    According to present usage, any transaction arising out of its exercise, if it
                    is at all interesting or doubtful, must be brought sooner or later before the
                    House of Commons. The difference in the three modes of proceeding, between which
                    alone a minister has to choose, ċomes to little more than the option at which of
                    its stages the transaction shall be brought there. This will depend on
                    circumstances. It may be a case in which there is no pretence of a prerogative,
                    as on a suspension of the habeas corpus act. Or the principle of a prerogative
                    may be pretended; but it may be suggested that the means for carrying it into
                    effect are defective, as was suggested in the alien act. If there be time to
                    apply to parliament to strengthen the executive, a prudent adviser would
                    recommend, especially wherever a continuous measure is required, of necessity,
                    on the first of these supposed occasions, but on both of them would he equally
                    recommend, that the authority of parliament should be called in. In case a
                    temporary emergency arises, more especially one which will not wait for
                    parliament, as in the instance of the embargo laid by proclamation upon vessels
                    laden with wheat in the scarcity of 1766, every administration is bound to take
                    the responsibility of the measures demanded by the emergency; and parliament is
                    bound to indemnify the authors of them for venturing upon a discretionary rigour
                    beyond the letter of every day’s law. The third supposition yet remains to be
                    mentioned. When a minister is confident of the existence of the prerogative, and
                    that the necessity for exercising it has arrived, there can be no occasion that
                    the immediate representative of the executive should advertise for a
                    parliamentary discussion. Let him use the instrument in the manner in which it
                    was left by the constitution to be used. The opposition for the time being have
                    it always in their power (and may be usually trusted for the inclination, as in
                    the late Dutch embargo) to press the question to issue, and obtain the opinion
                    of parliament upon both the point of right and the point of policy. For, on
                    state-questions of this description, the members of a government are as
                    answerable to the community which they serve, for mistakes in policy, as for
                    mistakes in right. The distinctions were only of use before the House of Commons
                    ventured upon the general superintendence which it exerts at present. Blackstone
                    observes, that “the king, in the exertion of lawful prerogative, is and ought to
                    be absolute,” subject to the responsibility of ministers. Yet, from the nature
                    of the case, as it is now understood, the king cannot be more or less absolute,
                    nor his ministers more or less responsible, within than without these bounds. An
                    unlawful prerogative may be assumed, a lawful one may be abused. As long as the
                    constitution lasts, the king is in both cases alike personally secure. The
                    unconstitutional adviser is in both cases equally answerable upon impeachment,
                    and to the same degree. The decision against general warrants, whén the official
                    practice of three quarters of a century was at last brought into a court of
                    justice, exemplifies the jealousy of the law in its own defence. The truth is,
                    that the most satisfactory account of the mysterious maxim, that the king can do
                    no wrong, since for every act done by him there must be responsibility
                    somewhere, is an innovation which even the Revolution itself did not immediately
                    introduce. The earliest strong assertion of it which Mr Hallam has perceived, is
                    in a speech by the Duke of Argyll in the year 1739. Public opinion must have
                    stopped short indeed, when a Whig, like Burnet, thought ministers were liable
                    for advice given at the council, but not for the resolutions taken there; that
                    is, they were to be liable for their own words, but not for the act, which might
                    be the act of the sovereign himself. Whilst this distinction remained in force,
                    it was possible that the whole question in these cases might turn on the limits
                    of prerogative, and on the fact, whether the necessity of coming to parliament
                    for fresh poŵer could be evaded. This distinction, or something not
                    distinguishable from it, was the shield behind which, strange as it now appears,
                    both Whig and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745557" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5557-0023"
                    />Tory ministers, Somers as well as Harley, alike retreated, since the
                    Revolution.</p>
                <p>Prerogative, as above treated of, regards solely the remnant of those powers and
                    privileges which had been vested in the crown from time immemorial by the common
                    law. What is left is a small portion of a heterogeneous sovereignty, which had
                    been originally wrested from a weak community by mere force, or which pertains
                    to principles and circumstances long since decayed. From a sort of obscure
                    traditional feeling, the word prerogative is more associated in men’s minds with
                    the personal will and pleasure of the sovereign, than with his political and
                    strictly legal duties. The thing itself has, however, gradually fallen into the
                    general mass of executive authority. Considered in this point of view, great
                    additions have in later times been made to it. These additions consist of powers
                    derived directly from parliament, and transferred to the supreme magistrate on
                    the simple supposition that they are necessary for the public welfare. The
                    preliminary question, Are they indeed necessary? occurs still more naturally on
                    a demand that new powers should be granted, than on the suggestion that ancient
                    powers might properly be retained. It is only when that point has been made out,
                    that a prudent legislature will enter on the consideration of the precautions by
                    which their abuse may be prevented, whilst their efficiency is maintained. To
                    mention only one or two examples: The patronage of office has its risks in a
                    free government. Yet it must be remembered that Polybius saw, in the ip-fluence
                    which the contracts and public works gave to the Roman senate, the necessary
                    link by which its connection with the Roman people was held together. At all
                    events, the disadvantages of the actual extent, of ministerial patronage belongs
                    to the greatness of the British empire, and to the nature of its colonial
                    possessions. The most rigid economy can alone reduce it within certain limits.
                    An enormous national debt must still leave the public burdened with the
                    additional evil of a proportionately enormous fiscal law; more equal in its
                    assessment than, but perhaps almost as harassing as, the ruder aids and
                    incidents of feudal jurisprudence. It is made both more costly and more
                    pernicious, from the childish weakness of insisting that the bitter pill, if it
                    must be taken, shall be concealed under the form of indirect taxation. The
                    difference in the powers, as given by the common law and by the riot act, to
                    public officers over unlawful assemblies, is scarcely so great as to be
                    considered a dangerous augmentation to the force of any government. At the same
                    time, whatever it may be, the same authority, or something very like it, may
                    have become necessary for the preservation of the peace, when a vast
                    manufacturing population is collected together on one spot; liable to be thrown
                    put of employment at every moment by the oscillations of trade; accessible,
                    besides, and accustomed almost daily to the most inflammatory appeals. This is
                    the case also with regard to the extensidn of a regular police, and to the
                    employment of the military in subordination to a civil magistrate. The change,
                    however, which would most surprise Whitelocke and the patriotic parliamentmen
                    who argued the militia question under Charles I., would be the mutiny act and
                    the army list of the present day. They would think that the king might well
                    consent to the concession of coming to parliament for its sanction, as his
                    portion of the compromise. The balance of power in Europe was the only cause at
                    first assigned in justification of a standing army; and it is still the burden
                    of the mutiny act preamble. Our immense provincial dependencies have also to
                    answer for it in part. However, another and a domestic necessity must have been
                    silently making prodigious way, when so cautious a statesman as the late Lord
                    Liverpool defended in parliament the numerical increase of the army, not by a
                    reference to the state of Europe or the colonies, but by a comparison between
                    the amount of the population now and in former times. It would be impossible to
                    govern with so slight a pressure as society is at present used to, without a
                    strong executive. It is fortunate, therefore, that, from the systematic
                    regularity which prosperous civilization has favoured, the actual powers of the
                    executive government have become more consolidated, and their operation more
                    uniform. The effect of the whole is, that in Mr Hallam’è opinion at the time of
                    writing his invaluable work on the constitutional history of England, the
                    English executive, “though shorn of its lustre, has not lost so much of its real
                    efficacy, by the consequences of the Revolution, as is often supposed; at least,
                    that with a regular army to put down insurrection, and an influence sufficient
                    to obtain fresh statutes of restriction, if such should ever be deemed
                    necessary, it is not exposed, in the ordinary course of affairs, to any serious
                    hazard.”</p>
                <p>On the supposition that this opinion was correct at the recent period when it was
                    delivered, experience alone can determine how far the supposed influence alluded
                    to in it has been affected by the subsequent change in the constituency of the
                    House of Commons. The supposed euthanasia of the English constitution, namely,
                    the establishment of that simple monarchy which Hume and other writers have
                    predicted as its natural fate, has been thrown back to an indefinite distance by
                    parliamentary reform. If any thing like the same good sense and good fortune
                    which have hitherto prevailed in the history of the people and their government
                    shall be continued, there seems little reason why they should be thought to be
                    hurried, by a measure of that principle and extent, within the perils of the
                    opposite extreme.</p>
                <p>Neither the principle nor mechanism of the reform bill has so changed the nature
                    of the account. The difference of opinion entertained by different persons on a
                    general comparison of the forces at work in the English constitution, seems of
                    itself positive proof that the variance, whether before or since, has been only
                    in the inclination, but that the constitution is on its balance still. At the
                    same time it must be admitted, that the interest which was strong enough to
                    carry the reform bill, is tolerably secure. It is not difficult to prognosticate
                    what would have been the issue of opeň resistance to the new political
                    adjustment which has been settled upon its terms. It was impossible, also, from
                    the causes which urged it forward, that the adjustment could have been much
                    longer peaceably delayed. The impoverishment of the crown by the alienation of
                    the royal demesnes; its abandonment of claims and maxims become odious or
                    ridiculous; its political incapacity to act on the House of Commons by the
                    disfranchisement of old or by the creation of new boroughs; the scandal of
                    private nominations, the still greater scandal of corrupt corporators and bribed
                    freemen; the doors of parliament thrown open to the people through the
                    publication of the debates by means of a daily, almost an hourly press; the
                    increase of dissenters, displacing the monopoly of the clergy; a liberty, nay
                    license, of discussion, popularising crude analogies to a new and kindred
                    democracy in the United States, and reaching over every question and up to every
                    individual in the land; public opinion circulating from one end of the kingdom
                    to the other, and brought concentrated with electrical rapidity at any moment to
                    any point; the rights of conscience, of free opinion, and of political equality,
                    so proudly recognised that they overcame at last even all the recollections
                    arrayed against the Roman Catholic persecution of Protestant reformers; the
                    universal responsibility of ministers <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745570"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5570-0024"/>for every act of government now as universally
                    acknowledged; the rise of immense towns, swarming with active artisans easily
                    excited and easily combining; the constant accumulation of numbers, competence,
                    and intelligence in the great and powerful body of the middling classes; the
                    disappearance of the last relics of feudal castes and prejudices; the swamping
                    of the ancient historical nobility by a modern aristocracy of wealth,
                    favouritism, and corruption; the final breaking up even of the court and country
                    party, whilst in their stead had risen up and found themselves face to .face,
                    those two parties which must always exist in open commonwealths—on one hand, the
                    honest and also the servile partisans of power— on the other, the seditious and
                    also the constitutional friends of the people ;—these are but a part of the
                    alterations which had changed not only the face but the core of England. A new
                    soil, so to speak, had been turned up. A revolution in society had outstripped
                    the Revolution of 1688. The rights of Englishmen, as Blackstone calls them (but
                    what are in truth the rights of man, wherever man is civilized enough to
                    understand and to preserve them) had grown into fuller consistency and bulk. The
                    national system, now in its manhood, made, as it were, more blood, and required
                    that the arteries should be enlarged which were to carry it to the heart.</p>
                <p>A political student, after looking at the points to which all governments should
                    strive, at the imaginary commonwealths of theory, and at the degree of
                    approximation which, from amongst their thousand experiments, mankind appears to
                    have ever realized, may think that there is good reason to be content both with
                    the end and with the means which the English constitution recognises and
                    secures. He will perceive that English liberty was long heavily mortgaged, but
                    that the mortgage was never foreclosed. Its standard-bearers were sometimes
                    down, but the pennon itself was always flying. Nations who regard England as a
                    model, whether to be copied or to be surpassed, should remember that no nation
                    can hope to buy a suitable constitution ready made. The end ought to be one all
                    the world over, namely, the happiness of the people. But the condition of the
                    people may be so different, as necessarily to demand the greatest différence in
                    the means. The quantities with which moral and political problems have to deal,
                    so far from being fixed, are in constant fluctuation; and the truths which they
                    have to establish can never be tried by taking extreme cases. An assimilation
                    and correspondence between that which acts and that which is acted upon, are
                    conditions grounded on the nature of the human mind. In no case is strict
                    attention to them more indispensable than in the relation between a people and
                    its institutions. The best security for this is gradual adaptation. The
                    Americans take English experience and English character into new circumstances,
                    with the woods to back them. They may ride with a looser rein, and may try
                    bolder tricks in legislation, than, in an old, densely-peopled, and overwrought
                    community, any person, at least any reasonable person, acquainted with human
                    nature and the difficulties of the case, could venture to recommend. They will
                    not undervalue the necessity of such compromises with the nature of things and
                    of events; since, in truth, no country ever made a greater sacrifice to the
                    predominance of circumstances over principles than America has made, and is
                    still making, over half her empire, in the most fatal of all exceptions. It is a
                    worse one than the barbarism of the barbarous age of Magna Charta; an exception
                    limited not even by the test of freedom, but that of the colour of the skin. It
                    may be doubted whether the English experiment would not have failed, as the same
                    experiment failed elsewhere, if its authors had rushed in the first instance to
                    the point where their posterity at present stand. Light things may hurry
                    forward, but the elephant must make sure of every step he takes.</p>
                <p>A free government must be complicated in its parts. The checks introduced by
                    circumstances, habits, and opinions, and which have been subjected to gradual
                    amendments, remain a hundred times more effectual than any mere appeal to
                    reason, which is all indeed that a totally new system has to make. The latter,
                    however theoretically superior, must trust to its argumentative merits for its
                    hold on the minds and affections of mankind. Montaigne expresses great contempt
                    for long philosophical discussions concerning the comparative advantages of
                    different forms of government. When he refers not only in opinion, but in
                    reality, to usage as the sole criterion in every case, he is guilty of a gross
                    exaggeration. This however ought not to prevent due respect being paid to the
                    truth on which the very exaggeration is grounded. The whole history of England
                    is the narrative of a long preparatory schooling to fit its people for their
                    actual institutions. Institutions certainly are faulty which cannot stand the
                    more summary test of Pope, when he disposes of these questions by a single line,
                    “whate’er is best administered is best.” For this in sensible prose must be
                    understood to mean that the government is best which contains the best
                    provisions for securing a good administration of all public affairs which depend
                    on the relation of the governors and the governed. This security, it will appear
                    by the description which has been given, it is the great object of the English
                    constitution to establish by the proper formation and distribution of the
                    legislative, judicial, and executive power. ’</p>
                <p>II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Laws.</hi></p>
                <p>The civil law approached to the character of a universal language. The breaking
                    it into fragments on the fall of the Roman empire, and the substitution in its
                    stead of the coarse and mixed materials of the barbarian and feudal codes, had
                    the effect of the confusion of tongues. Each code was nothing more than a
                    partial dialect. Whilst the rest of Europe fell back more or less under the
                    legal dominion of its ancient master, England alone stood out. It was
                    impossible, however, that it could altogether resist an influence so universal;
                    and it is probable that a greater impression was incidentally received than
                    contemporaries were aware of, or than antiquarians have since been at the
                    trouble to retrace. Mr Hallam observes that a good work, pointing out the extent
                    to which the Roman law affected Bracton and his successors, is a desideratum in
                    our legal literature. Nobody has yet felt a sufficient interest in, or been
                    sufficiently conversant with, both systems to supply it. The distance to which
                    England was thrown from the common orbit of classical jurisprudence, appears to
                    have been even something more than the difference which separated the northern
                    and southern divisions of France, where the one was subject to a customary,* and
                    the other to the Roman law.</p>
                <p>English civilians and foreign scholars always treated the vernacular common law
                    with the greatest possible contempt. John of Salisbury, in the reign of Henry
                    II. calls it <hi rend="italic">aucupatio verborum.</hi> Whitgift derides the
                    learning which is learning nowhere but in England. Erasmus must have seen it to
                    great advantage in the person of Sir Thomas More; nevertheless he mentions its
                    professors in terms scarcely more respectful than the scurrilities of the
                    college-play of Ignoramus, got up in its ridicule for the entertainment of James
                    I. Evelyn is content so that he escaped from it with no harder word than “that
                    im-polished study.” The provocation given by Law-Latin and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193745583" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5583-0025"/>Law-French has since been got
                    rid of; that of tenures and their commentators still remains. Any insular
                    jurisprudence, growing up during the middle ages, must have certainly suffered
                    in its philosophy and its symmetry by excluding the written-wisdom of the
                    Pandects. By way of compensation, it is suggested that the alienation was of
                    great advantage to English freedom. Whatever was gained in this direction is
                    probably to be attributed more to the class to which the professors of the two
                    systems respectively belonged, than to the supposed exemption of black-letter
                    precedents from the arbitrary spirit of the imperial constitutions. The Inns of
                    Court were long the principal seminaries in which the gentry of England
                    completed their education; whilst, in the universities, the foundations for the
                    study of civil law rivalled those for the study of divinity. The civilians and
                    canonists, cousins-german by descent, thus became twin-brothers in feeling. In
                    fact, civilians were formerly almost always churchmen. The difference of
                    pedigree between them and the common lawyers was visible down to the time of
                    Laud. The civil law, in any comprehensive sense of it, may be said to be extinct
                    in England. To the degree, however, in which it exists, the English constitution
                    is likely to find as warm supporters at present in Doctors Commons as in
                    Westminster Hall.</p>
                <p>The first point, on inquiring into the laws of a country, is to ascertain where
                    the power of making them is lodged. It is very desirable that, as far as
                    possible, the power should rest exclusively with the distinct and supreme
                    authority of a recognised legislature. In this manner, laws adequately and
                    publicly discussed will receive perhaps as general and as efficient a
                    promulgation as the subject admits of. Certainly no better security can be
                    devised against the possibility of constructive and <hi rend="italic">ex post
                    facto</hi> liabilities, than the practice of open debates, and the rule that
                    legislative measures shall be strictly prospective. The connection between
                    legislation and legislature is the doctrine of the English law. It can nowhere
                    be expressed more strongly. But the history of what is called the common law
                    shows the difficulty of acting upon it throughout. Popular customs will have
                    already taken root before a steady government is formed, or, at least, before it
                    is so far universally established, as to take under its cognizance the whole
                    field of legislation. With regard, therefore, to this class of self-sown
                    customs, the best thing probably that the legislature can do, when it becomes
                    adult, is to acquiesce in them. Certain divisions of the law, and those not the
                    least intricate and important, will from time to time be elaborately commented
                    upon in text-books. Particular rules will also be adopted by the profession; and
                    these soon become the grounds on which properties and expectations rest. For
                    instance, “the practice of conveyancers” easily goes the length of making by
                    necessity the law in that department. Much more is this the case with the
                    opinions and the practice of the regular tribunals. For this purpose it. is by
                    no means necessary that the statute-book should contain an intimation
                    corresponding to the threat of the <hi rend="italic">Code Napoleon.</hi> “Le
                    juge qui refusera de juger sous prétexte du silence, de l’obscurité, ou de
                    l’insuffisance de la loi, pourra être poursuivi comme coupable de déni de
                    justice.” Direct legislation must be infinitely more active, and must complete
                    its work in a far more workmanlike way, than the parliaments of the
                    Plantagenets, and even than the parliaments of to-day, not to leave vast chasms
                    for judicial construction to fill up. The English law at different periods has
                    been indebted to all these collateral sources in different degrees for
                    accessions to its wealth. Nobody can now determine how far Alfred and our other
                    supposed lawgivers collected or composed the documents transmitted in their
                    names.</p>
                <p>It is not the less unreasonable to assume on that account, with Chief-Justice
                    Wilmot and others, that the “common law is nothing else but statutes worn out by
                    time.” Madox has observed that the laws of the Anglo-Saxon kings are as
                    different from the writings of Glanville as the laws of two different nations.
                    Some of the points are brought out in contrast in the second volume of Mr
                    Hallam’s <hi rend="italic">Middle Ages,</hi> p. 466. Yet, if we are .driven to
                    any particular date for the origin of the present common law, it must be a
                    moment not much anterior to the age of Glanville. He wrote as early as the year
                    1180; and the laws called by the name of Henry I., which are in their spirit
                    thoroughly Anglo-Saxon, must, by their mention of Gratian’s decree, be as late
                    as the very end of the reign of Stephen. Mr Hallam makes a very judicious
                    suggestion. He supposes that these laws, like the water ordeal for the common
                    people, contain the ancient usages of inferior jurisdictions, whilst the
                    treatise of Glanville, he conjectures, comprehends only the rules of the Norman
                    lawyers, by which, through the influence of the circuits, and by other means,
                    the former were gradually superseded. The unwritten usages were become
                    completely fixed by the time of Bracton’s compilation, towards the end of the
                    reign of Henry III. There are no grounds whatever for conjecturing that these
                    fluctuations were preceded or ratified by any direct legislative notice.</p>
                <p>At a later period, namely, in the year 1322, it was explicitly enacted that all
                    matters to be established for the estate and welfare of the realm should be
                    treated in parliament. After so solemn and public a declaration, it might much
                    more plausibly have been supposed that every subsequent alteration, whether in
                    the civil or in the criminal law, would be accompanied by a parliamentary
                    sanction in evidence of its title. What a change, however, took place both in
                    one and the other; yet no “statutes worn out by time” can here be pretended. It
                    is indeed remarkable that the statutory changes long bear but a small proportion
                    to those which were obtained from other quarters. Although usage after this
                    period can have crept in only now and then imperceptibly, undoubtedly the sages
                    of the law kept insinuating their opinions, even extrajudici-ally, from time to
                    time into the system. But by far the greater part of the innovations, real and
                    apparent, were derived through the means of judicial decisions preserved in
                    reported cases, and argued out by help of what has been quaintly called the
                    “logical deduceableness” of the principles of the common law. The grounds of
                    every judgment were set out on the record till the reign of Edward III.;
                    afterwards they were taken down by certain grave and sad men in the year-books;
                    and latterly, they have been left to reportersofa less accredited description.
                    These precedents constitute an immense repertory of case law. If regard is paid
                    to the smallness eſ the basis compared with the vastness of the superstructure,
                    the ordinary course will appear to have been the, synthetical formation of
                    general rules out of the application and extension of individual instances. The
                    portion, however, is far from being inconsiderable, in which the judicial
                    classification of particular facts has proceeded according to the <hi
                    rend="italic">allegata</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >probata,</hi> under certain established principles. Looking at the history of
                    the science, Burke was justified in sa; ing, in the report of the committee upon
                    the impeachment of Warren Hastings, that “to give judgment privately, is to put
                    an end to reports; to put an end to reports, is to put an end to the law of
                    England.” Reports of the leading cases are especially valuable where society and
                    the law are in a state of transition. Without them, the law in such periods soon
                    becomes what Lord Bacon says the law of his time would have become without the
                    reports of Lord Coke, a ship without bal<pb break="no" facs="nls:193745596"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5596-0026"/>last. The whole equitable làŵ of the ćòúrt’ of
                    chancery, now tied up as strictly as the common law itself, has been spun, with
                    but very slight exceptions, out of maxims of conscience and limits upon
                    discretion, laid down judicially at as late a day as that of Lord Nottingham and
                    the Restoration. That part of the English system where at present the
                    lucubrations of twenty years are more wanted than in any Other, was still in its
                    infancy little more than a hundred years ago. Sir Mathew Hale said, in 1672, “a
                    little law , à good tongue, and a good memory, would fit a man for’the
                    chancery.” Evelyn, noticing the death of Chief-Justice Treby, in the year 1700,
                    adds, “The chancery requires so little skill in deep law learning, if the
                    practise? can talk eloquently in that court, that probably few care to study the
                    law to any purpose.” Lord Nottingham cotud not have desired a successor more
                    admirably qualified than Lord Eldon, to remove from his court the last traces of
                    this reproach. His ingenuity and erudition, however, only added still further to
                    “the mass oflearning which no industry can acquire, nor any intellect digest.”
                    Vesey junior, and his voluminous successors, have accelerated the predicted
                    “crisis of a necessary Reformation, when our laws, like those of Rome, must be
                    cast into the crucible. It would he a disgrace to the nineteenth century, if
                    England could not find her Tribonian.” (Hallam.) Mr Bentham admits that this
                    legislative crisis will find, in the store-books of our reports, materials of a
                    higher and more authentic character than were ever in the possession of any
                    other country. Although the amendments of the lav/ in the last session of
                    parliament were more extensive .than those of any single reign since Edward I.,
                    they nevertheless do not affect to have been of a nature to ascertain the
                    existence or non-existence of a present Tribonian amongst our reformers. The
                    extent of the alterations which have been begun or arc anticipated, niay be
                    understood by the complaint of a member of the profession, who has particular
                    means of information. “I regret to find (says Mr Chitty, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Concise View,</hi> 1834) that <hi rend="italic">students,</hi>
                    whether for the bar, or as spècial pleaders, or as attomics, have of late nearly
                    suspended all study, upon the-supposition that, whilst innovations in the law
                    are so frequent, it would be useless one day to learn what must perhaps the next
                    day be forgotten or effaced.”</p>
                <p>&gt; A wise legislature will establish municipal rights in all cases, when by soi
                    doing it increases the sum of human happiness. These rights must be derived from
                    the several sources of human pleasure. They therefore necessarily regard
                    property, person, station, character, or opinions. Rights are public or private.
                    Out of the first arise questions between the, governors and the governed; to the
                    second belong the disputes of individuals. The classification of these two
                    descriptions of rights, and the specification of the circumstances which are the
                    occasions upon which they vest, constitute/the constitutional and the civil
                    code. But rights fire delusive unless protected by adequate guarantees. It is
                    the first object of the remedial law, therefore, to define the
                    circumstances-which amount to a legal violation of whatever rights the
                    substantive law. has conferred. If the injury .is considered to affect the
                    public, its recurrence is sought to be prevented by subjecting the wrong-doer to
                    the penalties of the criminal code provided on behalf of. society at large. If
                    the injury is of a private nature, the party injured,is entitled to recover
                    damages in the civil court for· his own personal satisfaction. The mode by which
                    the appropriate legal remedies for an alleged injury are ascertained, is called
                    the trial. , Since every case may involve disputed points of law and fact, it is
                    requisite to make complete arrangements for deciding both. The efficiency of a
                    trial will depend upon the constitution of the several courts, and the rules for
                    regulating their proceedings. The first part of this problem concerns the number
                    and locality of the tribunals, the principle upon which each of them shall , be
                    formed (as whether of a single judge or more, and with or without a jury), and
                    lastly, the scale of appellate jurisdictions. The chief considerations relating
                    to the proceedings concern the rules of pleading and of evidence, or the method
                    by which a party is required first to make his statement, and afterwards to
                    prove it. When the trial has established the merits of the case, and fixed the
                    nature of the remedy, nothing remains but that proper means should be provided
                    for carrying the judgment of the court into effect. This can be only done by
                    “making the property, and, on just occasion; the person; of the defendant duly
                    available to the requisition of the law.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Constitutional Law.-</hi> This has been treated of in the
                    former section. The shape in which the Roman civil law has come down to us, as
                    recast at Constantinople by the imperial jurists, contains not a syllable which
                    can be referred to the supposed resemblance between the mixed forms of
                    government of ancient Rome and modern England. Excepting a few slight privileges
                    belonging to the peerage as members of a second legislative assembly,
                    English-equality recognises no distinction but. that of aliens and natives. Our
                    doctrine of the unalienability of birth allegiance, and our restraints on
                    naturalization, are pushed to an illiberal extreme. But it is a great blessing
                    to have escaped the useless and onerous diversity of castes by which Roman
                    policy was embarrassed, and American freedom is disgraced. England is safe from
                    the interminable questions of political rights and civil condition arising among

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Relations of Private Life.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    Under the English law these relations were for the most part either settled
                    upon, or have been since gradually brought within, the true principle, namely,
                    that of deriving from the connection the greatest advantage to both parties,
                    which, on a comprehensive view of their interests, the particular relation seems
                    qualified to produce. On legislating upon this subject, our law-makers have not
                    overlooked the painful fact, that there is no occasion where it is more
                    necessary to kccp constantly present to the mind the line which separates morals
                    from law. The poor-laws and the factory bill are doubtful exceptions, in which
                    the feelings of society may be suspected of having got the better of its
                    judgment. Otherwise, the law has generally forborne from becoming responsible
                    for those private virtues which no law can possibly secure, and has shrunk from
                    an interference far too powerful not to tend to defeat the and it is desirous of
                    accomplishing. In the service of adults, the contract between master and servant
                    is the only criterion both of their claims and of their liabilities. The maxim
                    that slaves cannot breathe the air of England, has at length comprehended our
                    distant colonies within its blessing. The extension of a haughty local privilege
                    into a national truth is the proudest triumph of the humanity and justice of
                    modern times. The relation of parent and child is placed upon proper grounds.
                    Parental authority is reasonably limited to the degree of power necessary for
                    the adequate performance of the duties which every parent is understood to
                    undertake. The most faulty part of the legal distinction between legitimate and
                    illegitimate children, is not in the degree by which the. parental obligation
                    towards them is distinguished. The feelings of society must first alter, and the
                    policy of our rules, and the most effectual method of attaining our object, must
                    be carefully reviewed, or very <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745609"

                    the East, in Greece, and in Rome, in a permanent tutelary condition. Their
                    disabilities were doubtless represented, as in the case of minors amongst
                    ourselves, to be in reality privileges of protection. Modern civilization has
                    transferred this state of imbecility from women generally, to women who consent
                    to assume the character and <hi rend="italic">status</hi> of wives. The marriage
                    contract cannot be regarded as an ordinary partnership. Women are certainly the
                    half of the species much the most interested in the rule, that a-contract, more
                    or less resembling the marriage contract as it is actually established, should
                    subsist. The only question which their advocates can raise must be upon its
                    terms. It is admitted that the ternis are partial. The question still remains,
                    Can they be improved? Nothing is more imprudent than to volunteer speculative
                    changes in an engagement of this domestic nature, without infinite caution in
                    examining into the capabilities of the case. It is impossible to equalize its
                    effects and condition to the two parties. There is an extreme risk of injuring
                    the female by the very precautions and facilities which it has been proposed to
                    interpose in her favour. The interest which other parties (the children and
                    society) have to keep families together, the first of those concentric circles
                    by which a weìl-ordered community is formed, introduces a new and paramount
                    consideration. The more the subject is refleoted upon, the more will it appear
                    that the English law of husband and wife requires only very incidental
                    modifications. By the late amended marriage act (3 George IV.), the reluctant
                    successors of Lord Hardwicke were compelled to retrace his steps, and to submit,
                    on the marriage of minors, to the compromise of <hi rend="italic">factum valet,
                    quod fieri non debet.</hi> The debates on that occasion affirmed in the most
                    striking manner the necessity of recognising the least of two evils in this
                    delicate chapter of jurisprudence. No necessity, however, exists at all for
                    making parliament the sole tribunal where a marriage can be dissolved. It is a
                    singular anomaly, that this particular contract should become the subject of
                    individual and <hi rend="italic">ex post facto</hi> legislation in every case
                    where parliamentary divorces for adultery are allowed to break in upon the
                    ordinary law. Our practice does not leave a doubt that the contract should be
                    legally voidable for adultery. But it is very questionable whether, on
                    transferring this jurisdiction to courts of justice, the interests of society in
                    general, and of females in particular, would be promoted by the admission of any
                    other grounds of divorce whatsoever. Nevertheless Cranmer, in the proposed
                    reformation of the ecclesiastical law at the Reformation, was prepared to give
                    to many of the causes on which a separation takes place at present, the effect
                    of a complete dissolution of the marriage. The rule which, subject to a few
                    exceptions, prevents a husband and wife from giving evidence either for or
                    against each other, seems very unreasonable. The legal consequences of marriage
                    do not depend, as Blackstone states, upon any canonical union of persons, which
                    can be supposed to suspend or merge, during coverture, the legal existence of
                    the wife. These consequences are much better accounted for by the rustic
                    simplicity of ancient times, which regarded the wife as only a servant of a
                    better fashion. It is evident that a'family partnership, which, when it has once
                    been formed, can be determined’only by death or by criminal conduct of a serious
                    nature, requires a conjugal Superiority on one side or the other. In this-view
                    the law is censurable rather from the discourtesy of the occasional language of
                    some of its authors, than the substance of its provisions. The superiority is
                    certainly evident enough.</p>
                <p>Therejs the spiritual promise at the-altar to obey, and the légal solemnity which
                    makes iţ petty treason to kill her lord and,husband. Marital restraint and
                    correction carry the power of domestic discipline, jn the case of a wife, a
                    greater length than in that of any, other servant, except an apprentice. I
                    The;principle ef considering the wife incapable, of committing certain,crimes in
                    the presence of her husband, owing to her supposed submission to, his orders, is
                    made additionally absurd by the inconsistency with which the supposition js
                    applied. It is time that on one or two of these points the law should be put
                    into harmony with the fact. There might also be a wholesome relaxation of the
                    rule by which a married woman is prevented, under all circumstances except the
                    civil death of her husband, from being sued as a single woman., The landed,
                    property.of a wife could formerly be alienated only, by a fine. It was
                    imperfectly protected against the -exercise of undue influence, on the part of a
                    grasping husband, by her separate examination. Her real and also personal.estate
                    may be made safe enough at present. As far as property is concerned, the devices
                    of a marriage settlement, and the interposition of trustees, seem to accomplish
                    every thing which can possibly be accomplished by law. ∙ r . ∙</p>
                <p>• 3. <hi rend="italic">Peal Property.-.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The lawyers
                    of Greece and Rome had no idea of the necessity of two systems; one for land,
                    and the other for goods. In England the systems are entirely distinct. The civil
                    law of England during a very considerable period seems to have had little else
                    but land to treat of. It characterized land by the expressive denomination of
                    realty; and distinguished it still further by establishing its legal title and
                    qualities on exclusively feudal principles. Hypothesis and research will be
                    equally at a loss to make out any analogy between the Roman Institutesand
                    Littleton’s Tenures. The language of Craig Would have been unintelligible to
                    Papinian. i Where the same word happens to be used, it only deepens the
                    contradiction by the difference in its meaning. Dower, for example, by which the
                    Romans described the property which a wońian brought with her on her marriage,
                    signifies, in our modern application of it, the life-interest which, on the
                    death of her husband, the widow acquires to a third of his land. The changes in
                    society gradually made it impossible to retain the strictness and also the
                    peculiarities of feudal learning. The “old books” were already antiquated, and
                    several of their cases seldom came into practice in the time of Sir Mathew
                    Fiale. The new reports, such as those of Coke, Plowden, and Dyer, the exact
                    perusal of which he pressed upon his student, are now become “old books”
                    themselves, and are approaching towards a similar fate; partly by statutory
                    repeals, partly from desuetude or ignorance, under a still greater revolution in
                    the law. The wave from the commonwealth which, during the reign of Charles the
                    Second, carried off part of the rubbish of former times, did little in
                    comparison with what has been done in the first session of a reformed
                    parliament. The abolition of fines and recoveries; the amendments in the law of
                    inheritance and dower; the limitation of actions, by which writs and formulas of
                    complicated absurdity, hazard, and expense, are gone for ever; hold out
                    substantial encouragement to expect that the labours of the different
                    law-commissions Will in course of tima be brought to a Satisfactory legislative
                    conclusion. In a practical point of view, the registry bill is by far the most
                    important of their present recommendations. An undertaking of much greater
                    difficulty, but fortunately much less urgent, remains behind. The principles,
                    the reasonings, and the language of the law of real property, will not bear an
                    enlightened examination at the present day. Nothing indeed can be more
                    indefensible in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745622"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5622-0028"/>nineteenth century than a legal system, of which
                    such a book as Coke upon Littleton is the classic. ’ It is a very imperfect
                    ariswer to say that the opinion which Lord Mansfield once?gave to a West India
                    governor upon the law generally, applies especially to this par't’of it:
                    “Decide-according to your judgment, but give rio reasons; Your.decision
                    generally will be right: your reasons always-will be wrong.*” ' A code itself
                    would be only-a partial remedy, unless it superseded the necessity of looking
                    back into the volumes which preceded it. Feudal <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> doG
                    trines are * too completely woven into, them ever'to be worked out. of their
                    'text. During centurieswhen the legislature either could not or would not act,
                    judge-made law.was by far the least of the two evils to which the country was
                    reduced. <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> The judges certainly did their best
                    towards accommodating the law to the altered condition of society, by means of
                    the only instrument in their power. But the course taken led naturally into a
                    labyrinth of fictions and refinements; which it will now require pretty
                    muchathe"same astuteness to unmake, as was originally employcrbin’the making of
                    them. 'The complaint is not that the law. is difficult, to be understood. .∣That
                    might be expected.' What shocks a reasonable person at the present day, is the
                    finding that so many*of its rules, when they come to be understood, are
                    irreconcilable with either common sense or with* the usages of the community
                    which they?govern. <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> iι∣iti - fiι &gt; '∙∙*m∙ ∣ri .
                    √</p>
                <p>.&gt;Thus, in descent, instead of regarding the just expectations of near
                    relations, the law is occupied in tracing theiblood of the first purchaser. In
                    forfeiture, instead of balancing the claims of the family on one side, and the
                    claims ofi injured society on the other, the law can see nobody but the original
                    feudal donor. In questions of the lawfulness of a distress, the difficulties do
                    not turn on the point; whether the goods which have been seized represent under
                    the circumstances the fair and natural security for the benefit which the owner
                    of the goods has derived from the premises where they were found, but whether
                    the· landlord, on putting an occupier in possession of the premises, had taken
                    care that the terms of the occupation were so expressed as to be sufficient
                    technically to raise a tenure. Independently of judicial construction,
                    successive innovations have materially broken in upon the feudalism of the
                    common law. This is the case, particularly in,the restraints imposed upon
                    entails and remainders, in the free exercise of the testamentary power, and in
                    the frequency of terms of years which are regarded by the lawyers as personalty.
                    The most important of all innovations is, however, the extent to which the
                    doctrine of trust⅛ and uses has brought the principal questions concerning land
                    into a court, where forms and. principles in many respects essentially differing
                    from those of the old common law prevail. The intermediate legislation
                    respecting uses, from 50 Edward III. c. 6, to 27 Henry VIII. c. 10, is a
                    characteristic specimen of the English method of creeping on step by step, after
                    the mischief has run, like the dry rot, into the frame of society, instead of
                    taking a corpprehensive∙view of the necessary consequences of the new
                    system,:and anticipating the confusion by such a conclusive. statute as, after
                    all its previous minute enactments, it-was .ultimately obliged to pass. It
                    answers in civil to the cautious manner with which in criminal jurisprudence
                    thaflaw of <hi rend="italic">mayhem</hi> advanced, taking successively the
                    different parts of ,the human bod; <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> under its
                    protection, one after another, until at last came a general measure known by
                    the.ņame of Lord Ellenborough’s act. Blackstone, writing in 1765, observes that
                    the Chancellors, “by a long series of ^uniform determinations <hi rend="italic"
                    >for now near a century past</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi

                    Considering the strictness of the doctrinal division between legislative and
                    judicial authority, and the traditional attachment to juries, the national
                    submission to this legal revolution, consummated by the great seal, is a
                    remarkable proof of the impossibility of working the system of· the common law
                    -in the present state of society. It may be questioned whether any country ever
                    adopted, at so comparatively an advanced stage of civilization, so complete a
                    change; with little notice beyond an occasional murmur in some quarters at what
                    was going forward, and that general ratification on the part of the public in
                    the consent that comes from silence. The nature of a jurisdiction· like that of
                    Chancery, must be to enlarge, and not contract, its circle. It is now some time
                    since Mr Butler was of opinion that half the estates in the kingdom were held in
                    trust. But there are further changes than those of form. The very substance of
                    certain titles which make a great figure in the law-books is wearing out. Two
                    species of incorporeal hereditaments, common and tithe, to which an extravagant
                    and superstitious importance was formerly attached, seem shortly destined to
                    disappear; and they will carry with them into oblivion a mass’of favoured
                    learning. Common of pasture and of estovers was supposed to be so necessary to
                    the advancement of agriculture, and to the maintenance of tenantry and yeomen,
                    that a case connected with it drew forth'from Lord Coke the passionate
                    exclamation, “God forbid that the law should not be so, for otherwise many
                    commons in England would be avoided and lost.” Long after the Reformation, a
                    still deeper horror continued to be expressed by Spelman and the clergy, at the
                    sacrilegious spectacle of tithe in lay hands, or of land discharged from the
                    payment of tithe. When the necessity of statutes of limitation has been
                    recognised in all other cases, and when even the crown has submitted to be
                    barred by prescriptions of a reasonable extent, the ecclesiastical rule which
                    sent back the proof of a <hi rend="italic">modus</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> time beyond legal memory, was no less impolitic than absurd. The tithe
                    owner has to contend at present against passion and prejudice, as well as
                    against reason. A violent re-action has taken place. The discouragement to
                    agricultural improvements, from a surrender of a fixed portion of the gross
                    produce, is a ground of objection in which the public at large are interested.
                    The result is, a demand for a general commutation of tithe, which cannot be much
                    longer delayed.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Personalty.</hi> —It is agreed that Bracton borrowed the
                    chief part of what he has said concerning personal property from the civilians.
                    But the reader of the yearbooks finds himself at the reign of Henry VI. before
                    goods and chattels have become of sufficient importance to make their way as the
                    grounds of litigation into their records. The laws upon property of this
                    description, and on personal contracts generally, arc very much the same all the
                    world over. This is probably to be accounted for, not by the supposition that
                    similar laws must have had some common origin; but because these things are too
                    perishable in their nature, and too much the subject of daily wants and traffic,
                    to admit conveniently, under any circumstances, of any great deviation from a
                    common line. The consequence is, that on this point, beyond some occasional
                    quaint distinctions between what is realty and what is personalty, and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> little absurdity concerning things which are merely the
                    subject of base property and <hi rend="italic">ηuUius in bonis,</hi> there is
                    very little which can be noticed as peculiar in the English law. Where goods
                    have been lost or stolen, the effect which, according to circumstances,
                    prescription and sale ought to have in discussions between the original and the
                    derivative owner, has been settled upon no discriminating<pb break="no"

                    principle. The rights belonging to an owner when he is out of possession have
                    been slowly recognised in most countries. Blackstone hastily states, that unless
                    a right of property were to be transferred by the sale even of stolen goods, in
                    market overt, “all commerce between man and man must soon be at an end.’ He
                    should have recollected that England offers the only exception in civilized
                    Europe to the rule, “<hi rend="italic">nemo plus juris in alum transferre potest
                    quam quod ipse habet.</hi> In the new questions which have arisen out of the
                    extended intercourse and complicated interests of recent times, it is fortunate
                    for the legal reputation of the country, that the demand for the development and
                    application of the great principles of commercial and maritime law should have
                    taken place at a time when Lord Mansfield and Lord Stowell presided in their
                    respective courts.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Private Wrongs.—Every</hi> right must have its remedy,
                    otherwise it is a right only in name. Verdicts with a farthing damages are
                    sufficient evidence that the expressions <hi rend="italic">damnum absque
                    ιnjund,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">de minimis non curat lex,</hi> are confined
                    in practice within narrow bounds. The forms of actions are, in other words, a
                    list of the cases which the law recognises as civil injuries, and which it
                    accordingly promises to redress in that character. One of the great boasts of
                    the English law is the means which it has taken to render illegal imprisonment
                    almost impossible. This was at last obtained, but with infinite difficulty,
                    under the final guarantee of the habeas corpus act. There is nothing otherwise
                    remarkable in its estimate of the wrongs either to the persons or to the
                    personal property of individuals, or in the general quality of the remedies
                    provided by it. The injuries to real property, and the peculiar remedies
                    applicable in the several cases, partake strongly, at least in shape and in
                    language, of the characteristic subtlety and jargon in which the law of real
                    property itself is framed. There are instances, however, with respect to
                    personal property as well as real, where the strictness of the rules at common
                    law had the effect of a denial of right, and drove the parties into a court
                    which undertook to adjust the remedy to the wants and feelings of society.
                    Chancery would never have obtained a tenth part of its present jurisdiction, but
                    that the common-law judges contented themselves with damages, instead of
                    insisting that a contract should be specifically performed and goods
                    specifically restored; and unless they had obstinately refused, since the
                    introduction of uses, to notice the existence of a trust. The bankrupt law has
                    lately been put upon a footing which appears likely to give, in its text and its
                    administration, as much satisfaction as can be imparted to so untoward a
                    subject. Nor does it follow that tradesmen who complain of the million that is
                    discharged by a penny in the pound, are entitled to lay the blame upon either
                    the policy or the execution of insolvent acts. I lie only effectual protection,
                    that of more cautious credit, is in their own bands. The Roman system placed the
                    debtor at the mercy of the creditor. The American system, according to
                    Chancellor Kent, throws the creditor at the feet of the debtor. The experience
                    of all countries seems to show, that in legislating upon insolvency, it is
                    impossible to reconcile the claims of humanity and of justice by the positive
                    declarations of a universal rule.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Criminal Law.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Whenever the
                    circumstances and motive under which a legal right is violated imply an injury
                    to the public, it is reasonable that the remedy should cease to be solely of a
                    private nature. The English law is defective in not endeavouring to combine
                    reparation to the party directly injured, as a subordinate object. But it
                    properly considers the mischief to the public, and the remedy for the public, as
                    the paramount concern of criminal justice. The comparative alarm spread
                    throughout society by different offences is the test of their several degrees of
                    responsibility; nor is society entitled to take a criminal cognizance of them at
                    all, save with the single aim of preventing their recurrence. The original point
                    in this respect, from which the common law started, and the mode in which its
                    circle w <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> dened, were too coarse and vague to admit
                    of much discretion in the selection of the prmmple adopted, or of any very
                    uniform correctness in its application. Civilization has tended gradually to
                    exclude from the purview of human punishment the spiritual doctrine of expiation
                    and the savage instinct of resentment. Proceedings <hi rend="italic">pro salute
                    animoe</hi> are left to the ecclesiastical courts; and the abolition, by 59
                    George III. c. 46, of appeals at the suit of the party in all offences, has
                    removed from criminal proceedings the last symptom of private vengeance. Up to a
                    very recent period felony was heaped upon felony as a matter of course, whenever
                    a new or temporary provocation happened to arise. No wonder, where it was
                    impossible that due attention could have been paid to the nature even of the
                    specific evil and the proposed remedy, that the just proportion between the new
                    offences and the great body of the criminal law should have also been neglected.
                    In fact, they often seem to have taken their place by chance upon the penal
                    scale. Dring the last few years the consolidation of great part of the criminal
                    statute-law has been performed in a very workmanlike manner. The repeal of a
                    multitude of obscure and almost conflicting enactments has been of great service
                    to the public, and still more to practitioners. It has simplified the labours of
                    future reformers. But a comprehensive view, a consistent direction, and a
                    rational arrangement of the whole subject, is a task reserved for the commission
                    now engaged upon it. The interests of society, as protected by the criminal law,
                    are technically called the king’s peace; and all offences against these
                    interests are prosecuted in the king s name. But it is singular that,
                    nevertheless, the burden and the management of criminal prosecutions, and, in
                    popular language, the name even of prosecutor, should, contrary to the practice
                    of many countries, be thrown upon the party injured. The principal legal
                    consequence which has followed from taking the prosecution formally into the
                    hands of the state is, that society obtains the evidence of the party injured,
                    who would otherwise be excluded as being a party to the suit, the original
                    object of using the kings name in this formal manner was probably to entitle the
                    king, as a matter of course, to the penalties and compensations. A barbarous and
                    fiscal rapacity was thus tempted to scatter wholesale forfeiture with
                    indiscriminate profusion over the field of crime. The 25th Edward III., called
                    the magna charta of treason, had no nobler origin than a contest between the
                    king and the barons, which of the two should appropriate the confiscations upon
                    conviction. They belonged to one or the other, according as the offence was
                    treason or ordinary felony. It may easily be understood, therefore, what little
                    principle exists in the rude classification of offences into felonies and
                    misdemeanors, distinguished only by the nature of the punishment; the one being
                    subjected to general forfeiture, and the other to special fine. Under these
                    circumstances, a strict revision of the entire department of the criminal law,
                    keeping steadily in view the one principle of the good of society, must bring to
                    light anomalies and divergencies which it will be no less desirable than
                    practicable to remove. This is likely to be the case much more in some questions
                    than in others. For instance, the purely religious sentiment was formerly mixed
                    up with the only consideration which can justify human laws in inquiring into
                    offences against God; and it still partially remains so. Judicial perjury is
                    punishable simply <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745648"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5648-0030"/>under the general description of being the
                    .violation of an oath. If the religious obligation is alone regarded, it may be
                    contended with some, plausibility that, the breach and the offence must in all
                    cases be the same. But if the danger to society be the point in question, it is
                    clear that the:danger must <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> materially affected by the nature of the case in
                    which the perjury takes place. In some instances zeal without knowledge has been
                    induced to pass the line by which morals ought to be always kept separate from
                    law. The political: economy of modern days has overturned many of the most
                    sacred rules of policy and trade invented by the common-law wisdom of our
                    ancestors. It· is in vain that the corresponding statutes have been repealed,
                    whilst narrow-minded judges feel, a ,pride in proclaiming that unitarianism,
                    forestalling, and engross-ing].are still indictable misdemeanors. The same
                    reasoning which annulled the statutory-policy of the intermediate generations,
                    ought to avail for abrogating equivalent absurdities, supposed to have been
                    embodied at an earlier period in the original structure of the common law. In
                    many cases legal definitions, as formerly in larceny, or the specific
                    enumerations contained in an act of parliament, or the purview of a preamble, or
                    the recognised jurisdiction of our actual courts, may be found to fall short of
                    their proper object. It is plain to the understanding of the present day, that
                    the terms of the statutes of treason, which left even Strafford’s case to forced
                    constructions, were too monarchical. The decay.of the ecclesiastical courts, of
                    the court of honour, and the abolition of the star-chamber, threw loose many
                    offences which have never been examined and arranged on'system. It may be
                    doubtful whether seduction and adultery are properly left to a civil remedy
                    only. A doubt however can scarcely bo entertained .but that the indictable
                    character of words spoken, as distinguished from words written, ought not to be
                    derived solely from their containing a consequent breach of the peace in their
                    tendency to lead to a challenge. There is little foundation in reason for the
                    general rule, which, in slander or libel, admits the truth to be pleaded as a
                    justification always in an action, but never in a prosecution. A careful
                    investigation of the true principles, which, in a compromise of difficulties,
                    may be the best guides on many subjects, will lead to another very important
                    consideration. A great deal of needless, and, what is worse, pernicious pains,
                    appears to have been employed in turning into fixed rules of Jaw what it would
                    be much more satisfactory to the ends of justice to have left as questions of
                    fact. This must happen in all subjects and occasions where the nature and
                    tendency of the act depends on circumstances which it is almost impossible to
                    define beforehand. Supposing, what we see no reason to suppose, that a common
                    jury is incompetent to decide questions of fact of this description, itbecomes
                    the ’ duty of society to create a competent tribunal. All offences of opinion
                    are of this nature. But there are numerous others. Notwithstanding the complaint
                    of Sir Thomas More against the judges of his day, that, in order to escape
                    personal responsibility, they threw every, thing on the jury, it is evident
                    that, honestly and dishonestly, English judges have brought many points, as
                    légal conclusions of the science, under their own judicial authority, which, as
                    questions of fact, would have fallen, and much more properly belonged, to the
                    province of a jurý. National character is involved in the history of the public
                    institutions and policy of a country. England, both at home and 'abroad, labours
                    under the imputation that the letter’, áħd even the execution, of its Criminal
                    law, are severe bet yöńd' the example of other states scarcely its equals∙in
                    general civilization. ∙The difference <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> Would
                    appear .by comparing a scale of offences and þunishménts'ühder the English law
                    with a similar table, drawn up according to the progressive mitigations which
                    have, been attempted by America' and France. It need not be feared but that ,
                    the experience of opposite systems, and a patient discussion of the
                    peculiarities of England, of the nature and circumstances of its population, the
                    distribution-of its. wealth, and the free character of its legislation, are
                    sufficient securities against vague and theoretical innovation. The result would
                    ascertain what degree of .success has attended the humane endeavours of the
                    enlightened statesmen of other countries towards the amendment of their penal
                    codes, and whether any just cause can be assigned ;vhy England may not safely
                    venture upon imitating,their example. The comparison of the nature· of
                    comparative anatomy between the laws of different nations may be very useful. In
                    this instance it would be most satisfactory, were it to terminate, as some
                    confidently insist, in proving that England has already redeemed its right to
                    the distinction which it lost in and after the reign of Henry VII.— <hi

                    reign of Henry VIII. are reckoned by Hollinshed to have averaged two thousand a
                    year. Towards the close of the, reign of Elizabeth they averaged annually about
                    four hundred. Notwithstanding the vast increase of our population, and the
                    supposed increase of .crime, the criminal return for 1830 gives, on 12,805
                    convictions, the sentences to death 1397, and actual executions only forty-six.
                    In France the criminal return for the same'year (1830) gives, on 4130
                    convictions, the sentences to death ninety-two, and actual executions
                    thirty-eight.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Courts of Justice.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    occasions are few and strictly limited, in which the English law allows the
                    party injured, or his immediate relations, to right themselves. A third person
                    cannot justify interfering on behalf of the private interest of even his dearest
                    friend. It is only as a member of society that he can step forward on the public
                    grounds of preserving the public peace. The great singularity of the chapter on
                    preventive justice in the English system, is not, as Blackstone states, that
                    there should be one at all, but that it is so short. There is nothing, however,
                    which a stranger is not privileged in doing, in order to prevent the commission
                    of a felony. In other respects, every one is understood to have transferred the
                    redress of whatever wrongs he may sustain, as well of a private as of a public
                    nature, to the collective justice of the community. Under these circumstances,
                    it is the duty of the community to establish tribunals for a prompt, cheap, and
                    efficient adjudication of the differences which must necessarily occur. The
                    necessity of reconsidering the constitution and distribution of courts, both of
                    original and of appellate jurisdiction, has been at last forced upon the English
                    legislature. Original tribunals may be separated or combined upön four
                    principles: <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> by the nature of the causes, whether
                    civil, criminal, or ecclesiastical: <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> By the
                    importance of the proceedings; that is, according to the value of the matter in
                    dispute, or according to the amount of punishment to be inflicted: <hi
                    rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> By territorial extent: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lastlļj,</hi> By the number and description -of the judges, and by the
                    different forms in which justice may be admińistered in each. The English system
                    admits all these principles.</p>
                <p>The supreme courts are classed on the first principle. They were originally

                    trespasses winch savoured of a criminal nature, in right of its transcendent
                    authority for the correction of crimes and misdemeanors. By means of rival
                    measures of ludicrous trickery, hardly worthy to be called astuteness, these
                    courts gradually obtained in most civil actions a concurrent jurisdiction. But
                    this jurisdiction unfortunately remained stationary while society advanced. In
                    course of time Chancery took under its charge the vast civil interests with
                    which the common law refused to interfere. Common lawyers were for a time
                    indignant; but they seem, after the first unsuccessful struggle, to have shrunk
                    from entering into competition with the political ascendency of the Chancellors.
                    Consequently, the greater part of this equitable jurisdiction is what no fiction
                    or rule of court has since been ingenious or venturesome enough to reach. Soon
                    after the Norman conquest, it was the policy, perhaps, of the government, but
                    still more of the church, to separate judicially the civil from the
                    ecclesiastical authority. The Kings Bench has revenged itself on Doctors’
                    Commons for the encroachments of Chancery, and has always taken jealous care, by
                    its prohibitions, to keep the ecclesiastical courts within their peculiar
                    province. The province is still however considerably larger than present opinion
                    would have made it; for it would be difficult to make out how matrimonial and
                    testamentary questions are properly matters of spiritual concern. The suspicion
                    entertained by Mr Bentham, that the metaphysical classification of courts must
                    have been the result of a scramble between competitors, is not confirmed by our
                    legal history. The scramble began with and brought about the consolidation.
                    Nevertheless, although at first a deliberate arrangement, itseems to have been
                    an injudicious one; and as such, it has been in a great degree abandoned. Every
                    classification of the kind multiplies the chances of clashing jurisdictions. It
                    creates also an additional risk of a failure of justice; since there is a chance
                    the more of a formal error, by mistaking the appropriate tribunal. Each court,
                    having less to do as the business is more minutely subdivided, can supply the
                    judicial demands of a wider area. Thus is superinduced the further disadvantage
                    of extreme centralization. Circuits by the supreme judges at stated periods only
                    partially mitigate a portion of these evils. They have been in use for many
                    ages, and have the very desirable effect of bringing the metropolitan courts
                    nearer to the great majority of the suitors of the kingdom; but it is difficult
                    beforehand to make the calculation of the probable business at the several
                    places of a circuit, with so much accuracy as not to become the occasion of one
                    or other of opposite inconveniences. Causes are often hurried through with
                    indecent haste, or are got nd of by an almost compulsory arbitration; or great
                    vexation and expense are incurred in waiting for a trial, which, after all, is
                    obliged to be put off until the next assizes. The expense of our actual courts
                    is a fatal objection to the exclusive authority which they practically at least
                    enjoy. When it is at once universally admitted that it is cheaper to lose a debt
                    of L.20, rather than to recover it by law, nothing further need be _said In the
                    main examples under the English system for distinguishing courts, either
                    according to the importance of the question, whether civil or criminal, or
                    according to the extent of territory subject to their jurisdiction, both
                    principles are generally combined. This is the case with the baronial, the
                    hundred, and the county courts of the common law. The same combination was
                    observed in the County Court for Middlesex, as settled by the 23d George II. c.
                    33. It applies also to the Courts of Requests or Conscience, and to the judicial
                    authority given to corporations and to justices of the peace. The subjects which
                    exceed the scale set to these limited jurisdictions, of course lose the benefit
                    of being decided by a local court. By the supposition, a better court is
                    understood to be provided elsewhere. The excluded cases are remitted to it,
                    because either the difficulty of a cause, or the mischief of an erroneous
                    judgment, rises with the amount of the property, and of the penalty which it
                    involves. This is true to a certain degree, but to nothing like the degree
                    necessary to warrant the universality of the rule; and least of all does it
                    justify the distinction at the peremptory point where it is at present taken.
                    Local courts of every description are now scattered up and down the country most
                    irregularly. There are as many as sixty courts of conscience for the recovery of
                    small debts, established among very unequal populations and at uncertain
                    distances. They easily admit of being parcelled out on an improved system. On
                    any reformation of them, the standard of value in civil questions ought to be
                    materially raised. The judicial talent and legal knowledge of the profession, if
                    properly selected, are fully capable of supplying the demand which the
                    alteration would create. The necessity of local courts is a matter of
                    contemporary fact and reason rather than of authority; but if great names are
                    wanted, the plan drawn by Sir Mathew Hale is ample authority for the
                    propositions of Lord Brougham. Ι here can be no doubt but that the confidence of
                    the public would soon be attracted to tribunals which, by their comparative
                    accessibility, would reduce the delay, the vexation, and the expense, within
                    very moderate compass. In this manner the most crying grievance might be
                    removed, and the administration of justice universally facilitated, without
                    giving to our permanent local courts an exclusive original jurisdiction of all
                    cases whatsoever arising within their limit. The circuit system, though open to
                    serious objections, might probably, in a balance of advantages and
                    disadvantages, be the best practical compromise for the remaining difficulties.
                    The periodical visits of the supreme judges, and the presence and example of the
                    powerful metropolitan bar, have doubtless a very wholesome influence in the
                    provinces. They constitute moveable local courts for the time being. In the
                    great majority of cases, trials at bar must have been always out of the
                    question; and much more so, while the metropolis was a place talked of rather
                    than known in remote counties, than at present. From the earliest times,
                    therefore, the courts at Westminster could not dispense with justices in eyre
                    travelling to the spot. These deputations of the supreme judicial power are
                    necessary consequences of the strict doctrine of venue, and of the most
                    latitudinarian extension which has yet been given to the original necessity of
                    summoning a jury from the scene of action. The size of France more naturally led
                    to great provincial institutions, like the old trench parliaments, or the actual
                    <hi rend="italic">Cours</hi><hi rend="italic">Royales,</hi> with their divers
                    subordinate jurisdictions. The different courts existing in England for
                    different purposes, vary considerably in the number of their judges, and in the
                    forms by which justice is administered. Mr Bentham praises single-seated
                    judicature. Aristotle, on the contrary, insists that one or more colleagues are
                    wise precautions against the moral or intellectual obliquities of a single
                    individual. The practice of England offers a choice of every kind The varieties
                    are varieties of accident apparently, not of principle. Courts of equity, and
                    most of the courts which do not proceed according to the common law, have always
                    afforded, and still afford, only a single judge. But the number in the supreme
                    common-law courts fluctuated considerably in former times. That of the Common
                    Pleas, for instance, has been nine, seven, six, four, and five; of which latter
                    number the three principal courts of common law consist at present. On the
                    circuit the number drops down to one, both in civil and criminal cases. The
                    trial of a peer for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=42" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0042-0032"/>
                    felony takes place before the whole body of the nobility. The inferior courts
                    vary equally. There are the manor , and sheriffs court, with the crowd owing
                    suit and service; the mayor and aldermen of corporations, assisted, or not, by
                    their recorder; magistrates with summary jurisdiction, one or two in certain
                    cases, up to the indefinite scramble of the bench at quarter-sess <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ons. When members of a corporate body, and justices of
                    the peace, render their judicial services gratuitously, the financial objection
                    of a numerous judicature is removed. But it is only the financial objection; and
                    a remuneration, more than adequate to the services performed, is likely to be
                    often got in local influence, or some more objectionable shape. When the
                    aggregate numbers stop short of letting in the passions which seize upon all
                    large assemblies, even the majority may be yet likely enough to want the
                    requisite character and knowledge. It is absolutely necessary to keep down this
                    risk within certain limits. But the importance of interesting the higher and
                    middling classes in the administration of justice may counterbalance in this
                    instance, as in that of a jury, a small per-centage of errors.</p>
                <p>If no very good cause can be assigned for the numerical varieties which appear
                    upon the English bench on different occasions, it is perhaps still more
                    difficult to give a rational account and justification of the distinctions by
                    which the presence or absence of a jury is determmed. The precise history of the
                    institution, of its original object, and of the transitions through which it has
                    passed to its present state, appears to be irrecoverably lost. But enough is
                    left to show that it was a trial by neighbours, acting in the mixed capacity of
                    witnesses, sometimes to facts, sometimes to character, as well as in that of
                    judges ultimately determining the truth of the fact upon the result of the
                    evidence. They were always the <hi rend="italic">patrm,</hi> but only in certain
                    cases the <hi rend="italic">pares,</hi> of the parties. As the law advanced to
                    the dignity of a cultivated science, the line of demarcation between the facts
                    which were to be proved, and the law which was to be applied to them, became
                    strongly (occasionally too strongly) marked. If the temporary and casual inquest
                    returned by the sheriff was recognised as the proper judicature for solving the
                    question of fact, the permanent professional representative of the sovereign was
                    alone competent to answer the question of law. The jury, growing up with, and
                    itself a part of, the common law, was thus made the constant adjunct to its
                    courts. It insured at all events publicity, without which every other excellence
                    can give little security for real, and none for apparent, justice. ìet apparent
                    justice is the source of the general confidence and satisfaction which forms one
                    of the principal objects of government in all its branches. In their own limited
                    departments, courts of equity, admiralty, and chivalry, arose under the civil
                    law, and ecclesiastical courts under the canon law. Knowing nothing of a jury,
                    they knew nothing of the above distinction; and the professional judge was of
                    course entrusted with the decision both of fact and law. Cases in Chancery,
                    where an issue is directed, are the mere exceptions of practice. There is
                    nothing in the great majority of the questions which come before any of these
                    courts, as compared with the civil questions which are tried at the assizes, to
                    warrant a difference of this description. The interposition of a jury is matter
                    of command in the one case, and of prohibitιon in the other; yet the rule rests
                    only upon prescriptive usage, and not on reason. The legislature has often
                    dispensed with juries, for obvious reasons. It is easy to understand how a jury
                    is too popular an institution to be trusted with the administration of unpopular
                    laws; such as laws enforcing rates, excise, and customs, must unfortunately
                    always be. A more agreeable reason will justify the absence of a jury in some,
                    but in some only, of the questions left to justices of the peace. Many causes
                    are too free from difficulties, and at the same time too frequently recurring,
                    to render it necessary or prudent to fill a jury box by means of a legal
                    conscription on their account. Twelve citizens need not be summoned from the
                    farm-yard or the counter to superintend the prosecution of all minor offences,
                    and on every affair of correctional police. Whilst accidental circumstances have
                    had the greatest share in establishing the distinctions by which in the higher
                    courts juries are admitted or excluded, it would be as well to see in what cases
                    some better criterion can be found. This would be wiser than the opposite
                    courses which have been recommended by the extreme advocates of reform; an
                    mdiscnminate reception, or an almost indiscriminate refusal. A jury <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> s an excellent tribunal for solving and appreciating
                    ninety-nine out of one hundred of the combination of facts with which criminal
                    justice has to deal. It is thoroughly qualified to determine all cases of
                    intention, and assess almost all questions of uncertain damage, as in actions of
                    libel and of trespass. Whatever abuses may stain certain periods of our h <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> story, the institution has well earned the traditional
                    reverence with which it is regarded. It is entitled, on collateral accounts, to
                    the respect of the lawyer and to the gratitude of the people. The distinction by
                    which a question belonged to the judge or to the jury, according as it was a
                    question of law or of fact, impressed a peculiar character upon our legal
                    proceedings. It was the occasion of the remarkable smiplicιty and precision with
                    which these separate questions were early discriminated in the English law. The
                    national character of Englishmen has become remarkable for its almost judicial
                    sobriety, and for the degree in which a deep sense of justiceandan invincible
                    respect for property are singularly combined with popular public spirit. How
                    much of these, one or all, may be owing to the immemorial co-operation of the
                    people in the administration of the law, is more than any one can presume to
                    say. The impression left by English history on Jefferson is recorded in his
                    declaration, that he would rather live without parliaments than without
                    juries.</p>
                <p>It is for the interest of the parties as well as of the public that a suit should
                    be brought to a final termination as soon as a reasonable certainty for a
                    correct decision has been secured. A government is bound to make its courts of
                    original jurisdiction as good as, with reference to the circumstances of the
                    case, it has the means of making them. That is the first and indispensable
                    security. Supposing, nevertheless, that there are grounds for suspecting a
                    failure of justice in any instance, on account of misdecision either upon the
                    fact or the law, the course to be pursued depends on the stage which the
                    proceedings have reached. There can be no reason for withholding from the
                    original court, if it has still charge of the proceedings, the power of doing
                    justice. This is done in civil cases, in a court of common law, by means of a
                    new trial. On the return of the record by the judges who were commissioned to
                    take the trial at Nisi Prius, the court from which the record was sent can
                    revise the law laid down at the trial by the presiding judge, and can also
                    exercise a d&gt;scretionary criticism on the verdict of the jury. In the event
                    of the question being transmitted to a second jury, the judge commissioned to
                    superintend, and the jurors summoned to rehear the facts, may be different
                    individuals from those concerned in the former investigation; but the class
                    which the inquest represents continues the same. It is not a superior court, but
                    only another edition of the former. The judges on this occasion have frequently
                    an opportunity of putting the parties to such terms as may appear to be
                    advantageous to the ends of justice, especially with regard to the new evidence
                    to be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745687" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5687-0033"
                    />produced. It is a peculiarity belonging to the form of the action of
                    ejectment, that a party may give himself the benefit of a new trial without the
                    assistance of the court. In Lord Bath’s case there had been five successive
                    verdicts for Lord Bath before the House of Lords decreed a perpetual injunction.
                    Justice Powell, in the year 1712 (1. Peere .Williams, p. 212), observes that new
                    trials from Nisi Prius are thingsof which he did not well know the foundation,
                    but of which he had found the courts in possession. Judges of equity, possessing
                    the whole case in their own hands, have, allowed themselves a somewhat greater
                    latitude of reconsidering and recalling their decrees, under the analogous forms
                    of a rehearing and a bill of review. When an original court has once pronounced
                    its final judgment, such,a judgment is rightly made conclusive ever after,
                    unless reversed by a higher court. There is sometimes the reality, and always
                    the appearance, of hardship in binding the losing party to the possibly hasty or
                    prejudiced opinion of a single tribunal. He will often be desirous of appealing
                    elsewhere for the chance of its reversal. One chance of this kind, if the
                    superior tribunal to which it is carried up is at all properly constituted, will
                    be enough. This part of any possible judicial arrangement contains a choice of
                    evils. Unless a power of removal or of appeal be given, one act of ignorance or
                    of injustice will be fatal to the unlucky suitor. The other side,of the risk is
                    exemplified in the skeletons presented by the inferior courts for counties,
                    hundreds, and baronies; or in a still more mischievous vitality. If. the power
                    is given, either both courts are really kept alive, in which case the temptation
                    to run the gauntlet of both will often take a party through two proceedings,
                    where he had much better have rested satisfied with one; or society and the
                    law-books will be taxed with keeping up the cumbersome representation of a first
                    court long after,it has fallen into disuse. The differences between a writ of
                    error from a court of common law and an appeal from the Court of Chancery are
                    unimportant. They are the respective names by which the two systems mean the
                    same thing. It is only upon appeals, in the spiritual court, that new evidence
                    is received. The absurdity of the English practice, in marshalling appeals,
                    consists not so much in its usually allowing an intermediate stage, as in its
                    converting the whole nobility of the empire into the supreme appellate court.
                    The barbarous incompetency of a,tribunal of this nature is flagrant enough to
                    satisfy the condition of raising an exclamation whenever it is mentioned; and it
                    is neither removed nor concealed by the additional absurdity which, by way of a
                    great constitutional improvement, imperatively requires at present, besides the,
                    one law lord who.is to do the work, the ceremonial attendance of two suffragan
                    peers in rotation for the purpose of looking on. A well considered reform has
                    given the colonies and the spiritual courts an excellent court of appeal in the
                    late judicial modification of the privy council, It is out of the question to
                    suppose that suitors from the ordinary courts of the three kingdoms will rest
                    contented without the benefit of some similar amendment in the, character of the
                    House of Lords as a court of justice. The scale of original and of appellate
                    courts must be so constructed as to raise the presumption in favour of the
                    latter. At present the appeal is carried from the most learned judicatures in
                    the kingdom to one which necessarily knows nothing at all about the matter.</p>
                <p>Criminal proceedings are carried on with or without a jury. The latter are called
                    summary convictions. They were unknown to the common law. At present they take
                    place in frauds on the revenue, and in many minor offences, before the
                    particular persons appointed by the several statutes which have created these
                    extraordinary jurisdictions. When the commissioner or magistrate has once
                    pronounced his decision on the case as brought before him, he is <hi
                    rend="italic">functus officio.</hi> The privilege of appeal from his decision,
                    in order to obtain a second inquiry into the merits, is not of common right; it
                    only lies wheré'it has been expressly given by act of parliament. The word is
                    connected with the comparative novelty of the proceeding. For the word appeals
                    had not passed beyond the spiritual courts until the time of James I. The
                    earliest mention of appeals to the quarter-sessions is in the beginning of the
                    reign of Charles II.; and towards the latter part of his reign they had come'
                    into general use. On the other hand, the writ of <hi rend="italic"
                    >certiorari,</hi> by which the King’s ‘Bench removes before itself the
                    proceedings of all inferior criminal jurisdictions, existed at common law. A
                    certiorari has the object and effect of a writ of err&lt;n∙, in an instance
                    where, from want of learning, error was most likely to θbcur. For this purpose,
                    whenever it is granted, the determination ’ of the justices, like that of a jury
                    in the case of jury-trial, is final as to the'matter of fact'; and the superior
                    court, in reviewing their judgment, notices nothing but what appears upon the
                    face of the conviction. The power of granting certioraris has been taken away by
                    express statutory prohibition upon many occasions since the Revolution.
                    Nevertheless the power is considered by the King’s Bench as so beneficial to the
                    subject, that the extent of these prohibitions is as much as possible restrained
                    by the utmost jèaloüsy of construction. A knowledge of law travels down to the
                    quarter-sessions in the shape of opinions obtained from the metropolis, and in
                    the persons of an attendant bar. If one or other must be dispensed with, it may
                    perhaps therefore be fairly questioned whether the limited argument on a
                    certiorari is not both more expensive, and at the saine time less beneficial to
                    the subject, than the more comprehensive re-investigation admitted upon an
                    appeal. The conclusive nature of criminal proceedings before a jury depends on
                    an absolute rule which the common law introduced, and which it has been able to
                    preserve up to the present day in its own favourite tribunal. No man can be put
                    in jeopardy twice ſòr the same offence. As long as appeals for felony were in
                    practice, this maxim might have been easily evaded. One precedent in direct
                    contradiction to it is reported by Foster in the trials of the Jacobites. But
                    when the jury has once been sworn on a charge within its jurisdiction, and upon
                    a sufficient indictment, it is undisputed law that the prosecutor cannot elect
                    to be nonsuited, and that there can be no second trial. The points on which a
                    criminal judgment may be falsified or reversed by the King’s Bench, or by the
                    House of Lords, either with or without a writ of error, are all independent of
                    the merits. Wherever the proceedings below are annulled on the supposition that
                    the party prosecuted has never been tried at all, of course he still continues
                    liable to prosecution in the same manner as if the former nominal trial had
                    never taken place. The doctrine of attaints in criminal cases was at no time
                    held in terror over a jury. At moments of violence, arbitrary judges,
                    dissatisfied with a criminal verdict, formerly imposed fine and imprisonment
                    instead. This was equally unjust, and was illegal into the bargain. In the
                    nature of things, however, there can be no reason why the presumption in favour
                    of the correctness of a verdict should be placed higher in criminal cases than
                    in civil. Yet the one is left carefully open to revision, while the other is as
                    carefully closed. The distinction is partly the result of accident, partly of
                    indifference. But it is probably in some degree to be attributed to the fact
                    that it was an object to bring litigation sooner to a close, where, owing to the
                    poverty of the parties, and to the rules concerning the costs of an indictment,
                    the litigation would be prolonged at the expense of the public.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745700" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5700-0034"/>
                <p>The present popularity of the distinction is undoubtedly for the most part matter
                    of tradition. The cause of it is to be found in the despotic practices of former
                    times. The people gladly acquiesced in any rule which lessened the number of
                    criminal prosecutions, and secured to a defendant the whole advantage which had
                    been hardly earned for him by the rare contingency of a courageous jury. It is
                    impossible that even the violent condition of unanimity can make the first
                    impression of any court, especially of a court constituted like a jury, so
                    completely satisfactory that the concļusiveness of a single verdict can be
                    consistent in all criminal trials with the ends of justice. The rule in the
                    present state of society operates entirely in favour of the prisoner. It must do
                    so as soon as the crown has learned to exercise the' prerogative of pardon on
                    purely public considerations. Amongst these, and in the first rank, stands the
                    necessity of protecting the conscience of mankind against the possible suspicion
                    of punishing the innocent. If there has been any mistake in fact or in law, or
                    if any fresh evidence has come to light, the prisoner is certain of receiving
                    from the executive the lull benefit of the discovery, in mitigation or pardon.
                    On the other hand, unfounded acquittals are very injurious to the best interests
                    of a community. They turn back on society offenders whom impunity has hardened.
                    They embolden all who are tempted by vicious propensities to prey upon the
                    public. They bear down the innocent man’s appeal to a verdict in vindication of
                    his character, by the cry of acquitted felons. They destroy the confidence of
                    the people in the truth and efficiency of the law. The ancient scruples, by
                    which the statutes of <hi rend="italic">jeofails</hi> were not allowed to amend
                    errors in indictments, had no connection with truth, justice, or sound humanity.
                    As little can be said in behalf of any seruple which refuses society, for the
                    punishment of a wrong-doer, the same assistance as it affords a private
                    individual in satisfaction of his private injury. It will not be to the credit
                    of the reason and the temper of the English public of the present day, if they
                    are not able to remove this inconsistency between the two systems, by the
                    interposition of checks and precautions, which, whilst they give a proper chance
                    of justice to the public, shall secure a prisoner against any further hardship
                    than that of having his case properly decided.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Judicial Proceedings.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> On these
                    points the English practice bears a remarkable resemblance to the Roman in some
                    particulars, which have been comparatively abandoned in countries where
                    otherwise the civil law is the principal authority. It is the more curious to
                    find these coincidences between two systems, which are otherwise so different,
                    that Selden observes they have not a term in common. The original writs of the
                    common law, by being the tests.whether a party has or has not a right, are rude
                    approximations to a code. Their analogy to the set forms for actions adopted by
                    the Romans is so Striking, that Duck and Ņoy agreed that the writs in the <hi
                    rend="italic">registrum</hi><hi rend="italic">brevium</hi> must have been
                    settled by great civil lawyers. Blackstone (vol. i∣i. p. 117) speaks as if some
                    similar standard was in itself undoubtedly necessary to fix the true state of a
                    question,of right; and he even subjoins, that an equivalent method is recognised
                    by all the modern legislatures of Europe. This is. surely a proposition very
                    difficult to be maintained in the presence of the contrary experience, both of
                    Scotland, and of .the English courts of equity and of Doctors’ Commons. In the
                    subsequent proceedings, most judicatures leave the parties to tell their story
                    in their own fashion. But Mr Stephen, in his excellent work on pleading, shows,
                    by reference to Quinct’ĩlian’s account of the method of oratorical analysis,
                    which he himself used in forensie controversies (B. vii. c. 1), how artificially
                    the logic of a Roman advocate was directed to the object of bringing out'the
                    point in issue. Looking at the different ways in which the testimony of
                    witnesses may be extract- <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ed, Mr Bentham says that
                    cross-examination is, both in the thing and in the name, peculiarly English; for
                    every thing of the sort is excluded by the interchange of written
                    interrogatories from the present usage and vocabulary of the civil law. However,
                    in the seventh chapter of the fifth book of his Institutes, Quinctilian has
                    again sketched as accurate a picture of examination and cross-examination aè a
                    Nisi Prius leader could desire. Every rule of positive law is necessarily
                    founded on a balance of advantages and disadvantages. In many cases the line of
                    prudent compromise between opposite mischiefs is extremely difficult to draw and
                    to preserve. Wherever the line is taken, nothing is so easy or so unreasonable
                    as to caricature it, by representing only the inconveniences which every
                    compromise assumes. This is particularly true with regard to judicial pleadings.
                    They are merely the statement made by both sides of their case; nevertheless
                    they are a subject which, on account of the opposite mischiefs of the Scottish
                    and English systems, has lately been the occasion in both countries of elaborate
                    debate and judicious propositions for their reform. The nature of the mischiefs
                    in these two instances is just the reverse of what might have been expected.
                    Scotch pleadings, which were carried on under the superintendence of the judge,
                    erred by extreme looseness; whilst English pleadings, which, except in extreme
                    cases, had been for ages left to the discretion of counsel, became celebrated
                    for the characteristic error of an extreme strictness and technicality. The
                    intermediate course taken by the Court of Chancery appears upon the whole to be
                    the most rational; though equity drawing has quite reproach enough in its
                    verbosity and repetitions, where every word has a pecuniary value. As soon as
                    the new rules relating to pleadings, which have been lately framed by the judges
                    of the superior courts of common law, shall have cóme into practice, it may be
                    confidently trusted that the common law will no longer labour under the evil of
                    voluminousness, in addition to that of technicality. Originally, parties made
                    their statements to the judge by word of mouth, with as little form as a
                    complainant tells his story to a magistrate, or as counsel at present open the
                    case orally at the bar. During this period a great deal would depend on the
                    talents of the judge for abridging irrelevant details·, and clearing up
                    ambiguous expressions. Afterwards, towards the middle of the reign of Edward
                    III. when writing became common, the substance of the altercation, to which the
                    evidence and the argument were to be applied, was required (and very properly)
                    to be put down in writing in the first instance. The moment of this transition
                    was the golden age of English pleadings. Serjeants drew them, and judges settled
                    them. The judges ceased by degrees to interpose at this early stage of the suit.
                    But, according to the scholastic subtilties of that'age, the science of special
                    pleading was encouraged to become more minute and complicated. A proportionate
                    degree of technical knowledge was rendered necessary for the judge, since he had
                    ultimately to award the prize to the professional combatant who had manoeuvred
                    on behalf of his client with most success on this preliminary arena.
                    Fitzherbert, Littleton, and Coke expatiate on the learning, the lucrativeness,
                    the honour, and delights of pleading. The reports of Chief-Justice Saunders are
                    the glory of this art; and his mind is a model of the sort or astuteness which
                    it cultivates. The department calls for but a small, and that far from the
                    highest,* portion of real judicial ability. It becomes only prejudicial
                    craftiness the moment that it passes the boundaries within which a strong and
                    logical understanding would confine <pb break="no" facs="nls:193745713"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-5713-0035"/>the speeches of advocates at the bar. The degree
                    at which an intimate acquaintance with special pleading still ranks in the list
                    of qualifications for the bench, is a proof how much that boundary has been
                    overpassed.</p>
                <p>Besides mastering the merits of his case, formal difficulties of great magnitude
                    are in this early stage, of the inquiry thrown upon an English lawyer. In the
                    first place, he has to select the appropriate form of action; and having done·
                    that, he must comply with the established principjes on which the forensic
                    argument is to be conducted, and which, <hi rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> are equally applicable to all forms. Our historical
                    sketch of the transitions of English pleadings shows what alone they ought .to
                    be when they are properly considered. If they are nothing but the statement made
                    by the parties, of their respective cases, What is the only object of an
                    intelligent and honest statement? It can be nothing else than to keep clear of
                    extraneous topics, and to get to the point in dispute as soon as possible. As
                    every legal question consists of the application of a supposed principle of law
                    to some one or other supposed fact, the first thing to ascertain is, About what
                    are the parties quarrelling? .Do they differ in their view of the law or of the,
                    facts, or both? The alternative cases present no difficulty. When there is no
                    dispute about the facts, there is a simple point of law for the opinion of the
                    judges. It is at once raised upon what is called a demurrer. On the other hand,
                    when the dispute turns entirely on the facts, what.is wanted, is, that they be
                    brought out to the jury in so precise and definite a shape, that it is
                    impossible to mistake the point or points in issue. If the party is prepared to
                    dispute the correctness of the law as applied to the supposed facts, and
                    further, also the correctness of the facts as stated, questions of considerable
                    difficulty and difference of opinion open on him. Must he enter upon both issues
                    simultaneously? or may he take first one, and then the other? and, in the latter
                    case, with which of the two issues, that of fact or that of law, ought he to
                    begin? The English common law disposes of these considerations by summarily
                    making an admission of the facts a condition of a demurrer. A legal proposition
                    can seldom be put forward so manifestly erroneous that a defendant will not
                    think it advisable to retain both chances in his hands. It is on the facts,
                    namely, what he should prove, concede, deny, that he must be careful to watch
                    over his own interests. Points of law will comparatively take care of
                    themselves, and the benefit of these is also secured at all stages. Demurrers
                    are freed in courts of equity from the above condition. The experience in equity
                    by no means justifies the apprehension entertained by the common-law pleaders,
                    that on the removal of the condition every cause at common law would be
                    forthwith burdened with a tentative demurrer. The discretionary application of
                    costs might easily be made a most effectual instrument for the suppression of
                    such unwarrantable speculations as might at first, arise upon a relaxation of
                    the former rule. The abuses of special pleading have on many occasions induced
                    the legislature to interpose. Particular defendants, as magistrates, fqr
                    instance, have been favoured, by way of exception, with the privilege of
                    pleading the general issue; that is, they are allowed to deny generally the
                    wrongful act imputed to them, without being called upon to state whether they
                    mean to deny the law or, the fact, or to mention a single item of the hundred
                    possible special grounds of their defence. The English system prides itself on
                    its peculiar mechanism, every movement of which necessarily tends to a clear and
                    single point. <hi rend="subscript"> 11</hi> The plea of the general issue does
                    much more than lςφe the advantage for which so much is sacrificed. It cqver <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> s every thing with a cloud. It gives the defendant the
                    privilege of evading the' duty of speaking out, by adopting a common form, which
                    tells tfie opposite party absolutely nothing. The regulation which refuses a
                    prisoner a copy of his indictment till Tie holds' up his hand to take his trial,
                    is scarcely ip principle more unjust. Fraud lies in generalities. On the on'e
                    hand, a defendant or a prisoner has a ríġht to know the particulars of the
                    demand or of the accusation brought against him; something more than the mere
                    assertion, that he is liable to, a demand or charge of some sort; what it is
                    being' left to appear on the day of trial. On the other hand, plaintiffs and
                    prosecutors are equally entitled to know beforehand the particulars ’of the
                    defence on which their claim is to be resisted; something beyofld a direct
                    negation. At all events, when the power of pleading the general issue is thrown
                    over a party as a shield, the exception should rest on the nature of the case,
                    and not on the authority of the person. A better distinction might be found than
                    that of official station. Pleadings drawn' up and communicated by the
                    professional representative of the parties ought to contain a correct narrative
                    of the transaction in writing. Thus’ prepared, they might be expected to be more
                    complete, and at the same time more relevant and more concise, than any judge
                    could have obtained from their own mouths if present. Yet what would be thought
                    of parties in open court who were to ramble into the jargon and exaggeration of
                    a declaration; or who should indulge themselves <hi rend="italic">viva voce</hi>
                    in the fiction of alleging, the utmost preciseness of time and place, whilst
                    every syllable of the allegations was perhaps notoriously and ridicułously
                    untrue. It is difficult to account for the origin of such extravagant
                    falsehoods. They are as indefensible in point of reason, coming from the pen of
                    a pleader, as if they came from the principal himself, preferring his claim and
                    conducting his cause in person.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Evidence.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> What the pleadings
                    have stated, it is the object of evidence to establish. One of the most
                    difficult things to account for, is the absurdity of the rules of judicial
                    evidence, which have prevailed in all ages and over all countries. Sir William
                    Jones observes, in his preface to Isaeus, that “we may triumph in our elegant
                    and philosophical theory of evidence, which Aristotle and Plato must have
                    admired, and by the strict rules of which all trials in the world ought to be
                    directed.” No panegyric was ever less deserved. It is perhaps true that the
                    English theory on this subject is less objectionable than the theory of almost
                    any other country, inasmuch as its exclusions appear upon the whole to be fewer
                    and more strictly limited. But it is faulty enough even in this respect; whilst
                    whatever other defects may be found incorporated in its principles, they are
                    likely to be felt more severely in practice, in consequence of the unbending
                    rigidity with which every rule is enforced by English lawyers. Our judicial
                    system is too careless in requiring or preserving preconstituted written
                    evidence, even in the case of recurring events and deliberate transactions. The
                    registries of baptisms, deaths, and marriages, are still left as a part rather
                    of ecclesiastical discipline tltan of civil obligation. They are exposed to
                    great irregularities and losses, whilst a general registry of deeds remains yet
                    to be established. In criminal· proceedings, the attendance of witnesses on both
                    sides is secured by summary methods. The duty of appearing for a prisoner as
                    well as against him is equally a debt due to society by its members'; although
                    it is oiie which the law was disgracefully slow in recognising. In civil cases
                    witnesses are obliged also' to attend; nor can they insist upon more favourable
                    terms than the tender of their expenses. The English law admits of four heads of
                    personal incompetency in a witness: one intellectual, as want of sufficient
                    reason; and three moral. Of these, the first is a want of religious'belief,
                    extending as far as to disbelieve<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=46" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0046-0036"/>
                    the existence of a God and of a future state of rewards and punishments. The
                    second is infamy of character, evidenced by a judgment of felony, or for some
                    offence considered by the law as infamous. The last is, a direct legal interest
                    in the cause at issue, or in the question asked. The objection that the witness
                    might use the verdict upon some future occasion, has recently been removed. The
                    only head of incompetency from family relationship, is the case of husband and
                    wife. It applies to both, and to evidence offered either for or against each
                    other. The only instance of incompetency from professional relationship, is the
                    rule by which a lawyer is prohibited from giving evidence against his client
                    concerning any facts with which he has become acquainted under the sanction of
                    that relation.</p>
                <p>The objections are equally fatal, whether the acts to which the testimony applies
                    are sudden or deliberate. It would be as difficult to justify the want of
                    distinguishing between these two classes, as to prove the propraety of the
                    distinctions which, in some instances, prevail between the admissibility of the
                    same evidence in criminal as in civil proceedings. The rejection of hearsay is
                    also too extensive. It may be doubted whether the rejection should ever be
                    carried further than to declarations made by a person whom it was possible to
                    have produced as a witness, and who might have been compelled in the character
                    of a witness to repeat his supposed statement under the sanction of an oath or
                    other solemnity, and subject to cross-examination. It does not apply to
                    declarations, themselves a part of the transaction. The tendency of the judges
                    of latter days has strongly run in the direction of letting in evidence. But
                    more extensive innovations upon the former exclusions than the judges feel at
                    liberty to authorize are probably near at hand. Amongst these, the taking away
                    the exclus.on on the ground of interest in a civil suit, is the most <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> mportant. There can be no doubt but that the
                    examination of a prisoner, humanely conducted, would be very favourable to
                    truth. But there is much doubt whether even an open court could be trusted with
                    the authority, and still more whether the public would be satisfied with the
                    change. All the objections above enumerated go to the competency of a witness,
                    and, where they apply, are fatal. All other objections are of minor consequence.
                    They go only to the credit, and as such, they are questions, not of total
                    exclusion, to be determined by the judge; but matter for observation, turning on
                    degrees of credit, more or less, to be weighed by the jury. Two witnesses, or an
                    equivalent, are universally required by the civil law. With us, one witness, if
                    believed, was sufficient for all purposes, until parliament made two necessary
                    in treason, and until a rough sort of comparative arithmetic established the
                    demand for something more than a single witness upon a charge of perjury.
                    Parliament has insisted upon the aid of three witnesses to a will devising an
                    acre of land, though a million in the three per cents, may be bequeathed by an
                    unwitnessed testamentary paper. Courts of equity have imposed a limit on their
                    encroaching jurisdiction, by allowing the positive oath of a defendant to be
                    conclusive against the unsupported testimony of a single witness. The hmit has
                    probably a reference to the double origin of Chancery; first as a court of
                    conscience, and next as more closely connected with the civil law. There are but
                    few instances, and those introduced by act of parliament, where written evidence
                    is of absolute necessity. The policy of the celebrated statute of frauds was
                    adopted from the French ordonnance of Moulins; and it admits of no exceptions
                    where it applies. But writing is often used by the parties in transactions which
                    are without the statute. The common law is equally strict in both cases, in
                    preventing written instruments from being varied, added to, or explained by <hi
                    rend="italic">parole.</hi> The rule has been broken in upon to a certain extent,
                    by a distinction between <hi rend="italic">ambigmtas patens</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et latens,</hi> of which Lord Bacon has the credit. The best
                    justification to be made for the exception which allows an ambiguity raised by
                    external evidence to be also removed by external evidence, appears to stand on
                    the following considerations. It restrains the fear of perjury within a much
                    narrower circle. In the next place, the author of the writing had not equal
                    means of protecting bis intentions against an ambiguity uf this description. The
                    admissibility of copies is tried by the paramount rule, that the best evidence
                    in existence must be produced. Mere declarations acquire no further validity by
                    being committed to writing. They thus become only written hearsay. The mode of
                    extracting oral testimony varies according to the courts in which it takes
                    place. Very little can be added to the excellence of the system in the courts of
                    common law. A witness there delivers his evidence <hi rend="italic">viva
                    voce,</hi> in the presence of the public, of the parties, and of the deciding
                    judge. There is scarcely a limit to the range of examination and
                    cross-examination, but the discretion of the court. The practice in courts of
                    equity is much more imperfect. The examination being conducted on written
                    interrogatories, and by examiners out of court, loses all the advantages of <hi
                    rend="italic">viva voce</hi> suggestions on the spot, of cross-examination, and
                    of publicity. The very demeanour of the witnessess is removed from the
                    observation of the judge who has finally to determine on their credit. The proof
                    of writings depends on the nature of the instrument, or on the mode of its
                    execution. The English law does not affect to create a scale by which the value
                    of particular evidence may be determined. With the same forbearance, it has
                    refrained from establishing any judicial standard concerning the amount of
                    evidence which is or is not adequate grounds for a judicial determination m any
                    cause. These are questions of fact, on which (beyond a few hints, more valuable
                    to a committing magistrate than to the deciding judge) the less that is said in
                    law-books the better. The only security for correct decisions is the founding
                    competent tribunals, and binding them to no other criterion than that of their
                    own personal conviction. Mr Bentham’s work on evidence, and his criticism on
                    this branch of the English law, are perhaps the most original, and at the same
                    time most useful, of all his writings.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Judgment and Execution.—The</hi> object of a civil action
                    is either the recovery of a right certain, for instance, particular lands,
                    specific goods, a fixed sum as settled by the agreement of the parties; or the
                    recovery of uncertain damages, more or less, according to the extent of the
                    injury which the plaintiff shall be able to prove that he has sustained. The
                    hrst class of cases, by the nature of the demand comprehended in it, relieves
                    the tribunal from the vague and discretionary inquiries arising under the
                    second. The amount of damage is a fact which a few impartial individuals taken
                    from the body of society are in the great majority of cases peculiarly qualified
                    to assess. This in civil actions is accordingly the province of the jury. They
                    are likely to be far better acquainted than learned judges with the real
                    elements on which the calculation ought to proceed. Damages evidently so
                    excessive as to be explained only by the imputation of gross ignorance or
                    corruption, are, however, one of the admitted grounds for sending back the case
                    to a second inquest. The judgment against Titus Oates, for <hi rend="italic"
                    >scandalum magnatum,</hi> at the suit of the Duke of York, where one of the
                    juries of those days had assessed the damages at L. 100,000, was reversed after
                    the Revolution. The costs of a trial were never given at common law. In most
                    cases, however, <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=47"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0047-0037"/>they have for a long time followed as the ordinary
                    incident to judgment. Since the preliminary oaths and pledges of former days
                    have fallen into oblivion, they constitute the only security of the defendant
                    against frivolous and vexatious actions. Costs are too material an item in
                    litigation to be properly bound in any court by one uniform rule. We are not
                    disposed to recommend, for the sake of consistency, that courts of equity should
                    be brought under the strictness. It would be a better approximation that the
                    discretion of the courts of common law should be assimilated to the latitude
                    which courts of equity have assumed. It is easy to enlarge the statutory power
                    given in some instances to judges' certificates, or to grant an analogous
                    authority to the jury. Certificates for costs might be made a sufficient
                    restraint on fraudulent attempts against the credit of the law and the interests
                    of society. There are occasmns when personal vindictiveness combines unnecessary
                    an indictment and an action in misdemeanors, or when base practitioners multiply
                    actions for the sake of costs against several parties who happen to be all
                    legally liable. In ejectments, trespasses, libels, jointstock companies, and all
                    cases where many rights depend upon a single title, or the ends of justice may
                    be satisfied by a single verdict, the law in its present state may be far too
                    easily and too profitably abused.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the feudal restraints on the alienation of land during a great
                    period of English history, it continued to be only partially liable for its
                    owner’s debts of any description, and was not liable at all for ordinary debts
                    by simple contract. The restraint went far beyond the policy of entads. To the
                    extent that entails were permitted, a tenant for life might, as far as the
                    principle was concerned, have bound the life estate, but nothing more; since
                    that only is his own. This invidious protection of land, even when owned in fee
                    against simple contract creditors, has been completely removed during the last
                    session. Ever since the 29th Charles II., whenever land was at all liable, it
                    was equally so although held in trust for the debtor, as when it was held in his
                    own name. No feudal principle interfered to protect personalty from a creditor.
                    Nevertheless, the absurd expression, that money cannot be sold, and the maxim,
                    so inconsistently evaded in many cases, that a debt or a right to sue another
                    was not transferable, had an equally mischievous effect. No sensible reason ςan
                    be assigned why the principle of foreign attachment should exist for the benefit
                    of the citizens of London only, and not for the benefit of every creditor in
                    England. There is even still less reason why funded property should be placed
                    beyond the reach of the law on the technical distinction arising from its
                    subsisting in the form of an annuity payable by the nation to the holder of the
                    stock. The bank, in the management of this property, is a parliamentary trustee
                    for the owners of it. And the judgment of a court of law, duly certified on a
                    recovery against a stockholder, ought to have the same effect as the signature
                    of the accountant-general of the Court of Chancery for authorizing a transfer of
                    the stock. There is a dangerous tendency in facilities for credit to run to too
                    unlimited an extent. The power of imprisoning the person encourages this
                    tendency; and, what is worse, it is frequently resorted to in the hopes of
                    laying the innocent relations of a spendthrift under contribution. The humanity
                    of modern times has thrown open the doors of the debtors gaol, by discharges
                    under the ιnso vent act. The security contingent on the person of a debtor was
                    good for much at no time. In its actual state, it is of far too little value to
                    be worth contending for. It is likely to be soon reduced to nothing, since it is
                    seriously proposed, on grounds of public policy, to prohibit altogether
                    imprisonment for debt.</p>
                <p>For the prevention of crimes, the law seeks to obtain a counteracting influence
                    in all directions; in its command over property, character, liberty, and life.
                    The jury find merely the fact of guilt. The legislature has to most offences
                    affixed a <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> of punishment, according to a rude
                    calculation of the nature of the offence and the interests of society. In a very
                    few a <hi rend="italic">minimurn</hi> also is enacted. The power of arbitrating
                    between these extreme limits, and of mitigating the penalties where no limit has
                    been prescribed at the bottom of the scale, rests entirely with the judge. The
                    gradation of punishments seems to call for further revision, with the object of
                    proportion, mitigation, and precision. The calculation of public damage proceeds
                    on the principle of prevention, and is set apart for the judge; that of private
                    damage looks only to the satisfaction of the party, and belongs to the jury. The
                    distinction arose probably on totally different grounds. It may be justified,
                    however, by the observation, that the calculation in the instance of crimes does
                    not depend on the individual case, but on a more comprehensive and general view
                    of the bearings of the whole criminal law than a jury can well be qualified to
                    take; and that a greater chance is thus afforded of an approach to that
                    uniformity or average which it is so desirable to obtain. Pardon is a
                    prerogative properly left with the executive. _ This is so in Amenca,
                    notwithstanding the foolish demal of the possibility by theoretical writers
                    against republics, equally as in England. The exercise of the prerogative is of
                    course greatly influenced by the recommendation of either the judge or jury. I
                    he abuse of it in favour of particular criminals was one of the scandals of many
                    reigns. This had reached so extravagant a pitch, that Sir Thomas More praises
                    Henry VIII. on the ground that never king granted so few. Nevertheless, such was
                    the complication and severity of the law, that to execute it according to its
                    letter would have been not only unpopular, but impossible. At the very period
                    when particular pardons were a national grievance, general pardons were looked
                    forward to as public blessings. It is observed by Sir Bartholomew Shower, that
                    there were never five years without a parliament pardon and that eleven were
                    published by Elizabeth. “1 hese, he says, “it was which made parliaments and
                    crowns the dar mgs and the desire of the people. The dispute whether the crown
                    can pardon on impeachments, was one of the remains of the jealousies of former
                    days. It was raging, as a great political question, as late as the Revolution;
                    and it is still open to argument as a point of law. The dissolving parliaments
                    to save his favourites from impeachment, is charged even by Clarendon upon
                    Charles I. as a denial of justice to the nation. There is a vast variety of
                    writs of execution in civil suits of the most trifling moment. By way of
                    contrast, Blackstone notices the slightness of the form by which a marginal note
                    put by the judge upon the calendar, is the sole authority for the sheriff, even
                    in a capital conviction. It is one only of many instances of the comparative
                    value set by our ancestors on the formal administration of civil and criminal
                    jurisprudence. The execution of the law in all cases, of whatever description,
                    is intrusted to the official representatives of the executive. Special
                    jurisdictions have their special officers; but, by the common law, the sheriff
                    is in all judicial matters the proper minister of the crown.</p>
