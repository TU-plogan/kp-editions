                    rend="smallcaps">Mid Lothian,</hi> is the seat of the metropolis of North
                    Britain. It is situated between 55° 39 ’ and 55° 59 ’ north latitude, and
                    between 2° 36' and 3° 33’ longitude west from Greenwich. Its boundaries are the
                    Frith of Forth on the north; Linlithgowshire or West Lothian on the west; the
                    counties of Haddington or East Lothian, Berwick, and Roxburgh on the east; and
                    those of Selkirk, Peebles, and Lanark on the south; the length of the whole
                    line, which is very irregular, and longest on the south, being about ninety
                    miles. The medium length of the county may be taken at twenty-four miles, and
                    the breadth at fifteen; the area thus comprising 360 square miles, or, by the
                    latest computation, 354 square miles, or 226,560 English acres, of which
                    145,000, or sixty-four acres in a hundred, are in cultivation, and the
                    remainder, or more than a third, hilly, or otherwise comparatively
                    unproductive.</p>
                <p>The surface of this county exhibits a great variety of natural scenery, almost
                    everywhere blended and embellished with the labours of taste and opulence. The
                    lower and richer part of it is of a semicircular form, inclining towards the
                    Frith of Forth on the north, and terminating near Mid Calderon the west, and
                    Falaon the south-east, but interrupted by the Pentland Hills, which, rising in
                    the south-west, approach to within five miles of the frith, and thus divide the
                    southern part of this tract into two large plains. These hills cover about forty
                    square miles; and though none of them rise to the height of more than 1700 feet,
                    yet their situation in a flat country, and their bleak and barren aspect, render
                    them very prominent objects in the landscape. On the south-east, where the
                    county terminates almost in a point, between the counties of Roxburgh and
                    Selkirk, and about fifteen miles from the sea, there is another mountainous
                    tract, called the Moreſoot Hills, the highest of which rise to upwards of 1800
                    feet, and extend over fifty square miles. From the rivulet Gala, which flows
                    through it, this is commonly known by the name of the Gala Water district.
                    Fertile valleys are found amongst these hills, and many of the hills themselves
                    have been cultivated. With the exception of these two hilly tracts,
                    Edinburghshire may be considered as a low-lying country, though not level or
                    flat, the surface being varied by ridges and gentle acclivities, and
                    occasionally by detached hills of moderate elevation, amongst which Arthur’s
                    Seat, in the vicinity of Edinburgh, and the Corstorphine Hills, are the most
                    considerable. The view from these eminences is singularly rich and beautiful;
                    embracing, besides the city itself, a great many gentlemen’s seats, with their
                    pleasure grounds, and elegant villas thickly planted in every direction, with
                    the town and shipping of Leith, and the estuary of the Forth expanding into the
                    ocean on the north and north-east, and the plains and high grounds of Fife
                    beyond; whilst the naked and rugged hills to the south form a striking contrast
                    with the highly-ornamented landscape into which they protrude.</p>
                <p>The climate is exceedingly variable, but not subject to extremes. Snow seldom
                    falls before December. From March to June cold east winds often prevail,
                    sometimes attended by great falls of rain. July and August are warm and
                    pleasant. Partly from the nature of the soil, as well as the climate, the corn
                    crops, with a few exceptions, do not come to maturity so soon as in the south of
                    Scotland by three weeks or a month. The fields, in late seasons, are not all
                    cleared, even near the city, till the end of October. According to a register
                    kept in its immediate vicinity for eight years, from 1785 to 1792 inclusive, the
                    average number of rainy days was 175, and the quantity of rain 25∙75 inches. The
                    thermometer once in the same period was at 89°, and twice besides above 80°; the
                    lowest point was 1 l <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, and the average of the
                    whole period 46∙570.</p>
                <p>The streams of this county are so inconsiderable as not to be called rivers, but
                    <hi rend="italic">walers</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a term wdiich in Scotland
                    is 1 employed to denote a stream somewhat larger than a brook or <hi
                    rend="italic">burn,</hi> and whose bed is never in ordinary seasons altogether
                    dry. Almond Water, which rises in the borders of Lanarkshire, separates this
                    county from Linlithgowshire for a great part of its course, and falls into the
                    sea near the village of Cramond, where, at high water, it is navigable by sloops
                    for about a quarter of a mile. The Water of Leith has its source in the western
                    extremity of the parish of Currie, on the north side of the Pentland Hills, and
                    falls into the sea at Leith, after a course of about sixteen miles. It flows in
                    a deeper channel than the former; and the banks are, for the most part,
                    beautifully fringed with wood. In no part of the island perhaps is so small a
                    body of water employed with greater effect, there being upwards of seventy
                    mills, the greater number corn mills, on ten miles of its course. The Esk is the
                    most considerable rivulet, and also the most beautiful. It is formed of two
                    others of the same name, called the North Esk and the South Esk. The North Esk
                    rises on the southern side of the Pentland Hills, above Newhall, about fourteen
                    miles from Edinburgh, and flows by Pennicuik, Roslin, Hawthornden, Laswade, and
                    Melville Castle, till it meets with the South Esk below Dalkeith. The South Esk
                    has its source in the Moreſoot Hills. On its banks, which are also well wooded
                    and picturesque, stand Arniston, Dalhousie, and Newbattle. Their united streams
                    flow into the sea at Musselburgh. The Tyne, which rises in this county, after a
                    course of five or six miles in a north-east direction, passes into East Lothian;
                    and the Gala, the only rivulet that flows to the south, rising on the north of
                    the Moreſoot Hills, leaves this county after it has proceeded about ten miles,
                    and falls into the Tweed below Galashiels. The Esks and the Gala contain trout,
                    and salmon are caught in the Esk at Musselburgh; but the quantity of either is
                    not considerable.</p>
                <p>Edinburghshire abounds in coal, limestone, and sandstone, or, as it is popularly
                    called, <hi rend="italic">freestone.</hi> A continued bed of coal extends across
                    the whole county from Carlops, on the confines of Tweeddale or Peeblesshire, in
                    a direction from south-west to north-east, near fifteen miles in length, and
                    from seven to eight in breadth, on both sides of the North Esk. But it is
                    chiefly towards the lower end of this vale that the coal is wrought, where there
                    are in some places twenty-six seams, from two to ten feet thick. Some of the
                    seams are horizontal, and others almost perpendicular, from which they are
                    distinguished by the names of <hi rend="italic">pat</hi> seams and <hi
                    rend="italic">edge</hi> seams; and it has been remarked that the position of the
                    coal corresponds in some degree with the surface of the ground, being level in
                    the valley of the North Esk, and inclined to the horizon on the higher grounds
                    at a distance. Coal has been wrought in the parish of Laswade for upwards of two
                    centuries, where it is still so abundant that the quantity raised is said to be
                    equal to a sixth part of what is obtained from all the coal works of the county.
                    Over nearly the whole coal district it is necessary to keep up powerful
                    steam-engines, for the purpose of freeing the workings from water. A stupendous
                    machine of this description has recently been erected in the parish of Inveresk,
                    by Sir John Hope, Bart. Dikes or veins of stone frequently occur in the coal
                    strata, which, with the expense attending the erection of machinery, and also
                    that incurred in propping the roofs of the pits, forms a very considerable
                    drawback upon the profits realized by the coal-masters. Limestone is found not
                    only in the same tract with the coal, but still farther to the east, and also in
                    the south-west, where coal has not yet been discovered. The great quarry at
                    Gilmerton, in the parish of Libberton, about four miles from Edinburgh, is
                    nearly a mile in length, everywhere open to the light of day, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193328725" xml:id="kp-eb0708-8725-0430"/>has the appearance of a long
                    chasm, advancing obliquely to the surface. Like the coal in its neighbourhood,
                    the stone rests in an inclined position, which, when removed, leaves a floor of
                    such a moderate declivity as to be descended by paths among the fragments of
                    rock that have been left. At the bottom there is a pool of water. Overhead is a
                    roof of considerable height, consisting of a bed of solid rock, supported by
                    pillars of limestone. The principal freestone quarries are at Craigleith, in the
                    neighbourhood of the city, from which the six columns in the front of the New
                    College were obtained; and at Hales, in the parish of Colinton, about three
                    miles to the westward. The stone of the former, from its superior whiteness, has
                    been of late most in request for building; but the latter is still unrivalled
                    for flags and for stairs. In the year 1830 a large fossil tree was found in the
                    former quarry, at a considerable depth down in the mass of stone; and another
                    towards the end of October 1833, still deeper. A stone similar to that of
                    Craigleith, but easier wrought, is now got at Redhall, also in the parish of
                    Colinton. Mill-stones have been wrought in the parish of Pennicuik. Copper has
                    been found in the parish of Currie and some other places, but not so rich as to
                    pay for working. Ironstone abounds in the coal district, and also along the
                    shore from Leith westwards; and stones for building and paving are to be found
                    in every parish of the county. A stone similar to the Chinese <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petunse,</hi> used in the manufacture of porcelain, has been found in the
                    Pentland Hills; and clay, fit for being made into crucibles, in the parish of
                    Dud-dingstone. There are mineral waters in different parts of the county, none
                    of which are of much celebrity, with the exception probably of St Bernard’s
                    Well, to the northwest of the city.</p>
                <p>The valuation of Edinburghshire, which appears to have been taken in 1649, is
                    L.191,054. 3s. 9d. Scots; and iι&gt; 1811 the real rent of the lands, according
                    to the returns made under the property-tax, was L.277,827. 19s. Id. sterling,
                    and of the houses L.4(M),004. 5s. 6d. In 1795 the landed property was divided
                    into 542 estates, of which twelve belonged to hospitals and other corporate
                    bodies, of the valued rent of L. 10,628. 4s. 5d. Scots, or more than an
                    eighteenth part of the whole. Here, as throughout the rest of Scotland, the land
                    is occupied by tenants on leases for a term of years, excepting the
                    comparatively small portion possessed by the proprietors themselves, or let in
                    grass for the season. Within a few miles round the city the cultivation of farms
                    is conducted with a view to the wants of that great market, where potatoes,
                    turnips, and clovers are found more profitable than corn. The price of these
                    crops, sold on the ground, the purchaser taking upon himself all the expense of
                    carrying them to market, or taking them away for his own consumption, may
                    average about L.20 the Scotch acre (about L.16 the English), and very fine crops
                    sometimes bring even more than L.30. Early potatoes, raised within a mile of the
                    city, have been sold, to the extent of several acres on one farm, at L.50 an
                    acre. The manure for raising these crops is amply supplied by the streets and
                    stables of the city. The street soil manure, although the etfects of it are not
                    so lasting as those of stable or farm-yard dung, enables the farmers to raise
                    large crops of wheat and other kinds of corn, after the green crops, upon soils
                    that are not naturally very fertile; but the seeds of all sorts with which it
                    abounds are unfavourable to the cleanness of their fields. Their straw, instead
                    of being consumed or converted into manure on their farms, is carried to the
                    city for sale, or given to stab-lers in exchange for their dung. The rent of
                    farms of from fifty to a hundred acres, within a mile of the city, is in some
                    instances as high as L.8 or L.10 an acre. Lime is very little employed as a
                    manure within the circle to which the town dung extends. Beyond this circle,
                    which has been materially extended by the canal, the system of cultivation is
                    nearly the same as we have already described under other Scotch counties. The
                    extent of the natural wood has been estimated at 3000 acres, and of plantations
                    at about 14,000, being together about one acre in every fourteen.</p>
                <p>In 1812, four hundred acres were employed in raising vegetables for the city
                    within a circuit of five miles, and a hundred acres more were under
                    strawberries. Mr Neill, secretary to the Horticultural Society, states the
                    produce of the former at L.45, and the rent from L.8 to L.16 an acre. Between
                    60,000 and 70,000 Scotch pints of strawberries, or nearly half as many English
                    gallons, are annually sold in Edinburgh, at from 10s. 6d. a pint down to 9d. The
                    produce of an acre is from eight to nine hundred pints, thus yielding a return
                    not very different from the garden grounds. There are also several nurseries in
                    the immediate vicinity of the city, some of them equal to any in the united
                    kingdom for their collection of fruit and forest trees, shrubs, and herbaceous
                    plants, as well as for the arrangement and keeping of the grounds. About a
                    hundred and thirty acres are employed in this way.</p>
                <p>The manufactures and commerce of this county, exclusive of Edinburgh, and Leith
                    its sea-port, are inconsiderable. None of the three great branches of industry,
                    the woollen, cotton, or linen manufacture, is carried on here to any extent.
                    Distilleries, paper-mills on both branches of the Esk, iron-works at Cramond,
                    potteries and salt-pans at Inveresk, and gunpowder-works at Stobbs and
                    I&lt;oslin, on the South Esk, are the most worthy of notice. The paper-mills of
                    the county have latterly much increased in number, and the article made has
                    become celebrated for its quality. Machinery is employed to a considerable
                    extent in the manufacture of it. From the metropolis of Scotland being situated
                    here, the public roads which pass through it in every direction are kept in the
                    best order, and thus promote its internal trade. A system of railways has lately
                    been constructed between the city and the coalworks to the south-east. By this
                    useful conveyance the metropolis is well supplied with the valuable mineral with
                    which its vicinity abounds. A number of coaches also ply upon the railway, by
                    which a cheap and agreeable conveyance is obtained for ten miles or thereabout
                    to the south-east of the city. A railway between Dalkeith and the port of Leith
                    was laid in 1836; and it is in contemplation to extend these improvements in
                    land carriage a considerable way farther.</p>
                <p>There is a communication between Edinburgh and Glasgow by means of the Union
                    Canal. This work was commenced in 1817, and finished in about five years
                    afterwards. One of the principal objects for which it was projected was to
                    facilitate the conveyance of coal from the coal fields of Falkirk. It has been
                    found of considerable utility in this respect, as also in various others, such
                    as the conveyance of manure from the city into the interior of the country.</p>
                <p>Besides the capital itself, there is no town of any note in Edinburghshire, but a
                    great many thriving villages. Of these may be mentioned Mid Calder,
                    Corstorphine, and Cramond, in the north-west; Pennicuik, Dalkeith, which is a
                    burgh of barony, Laswade, Loanhead, and Gilmerton, in the east and south; and

                    Newhaven, on the Frith of Forth. Portobello is a pleasant village, resembling a
                    portion of the metropolis in elegance, and much resorted to for sea-bathing.
                    Roslin, in the parish of Laswade, is a pleasant village, and much resorted to on
                    account of its chapel, a beautiful remnant of antiquity. Dalkeith, the most
                    populous of the places we have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328738"

                    great weekly markets for meal and grain.</p>
