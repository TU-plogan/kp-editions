                    Augustus</hi></label>, Lord Heathfield, was the youngest son of Sir Gilbert
                    Elliot, Baronet, of Stobbs, in Roxburghshire, and was born about the year 1718.
                    He received the rudiments of his education under a private tutor, and at an
                    early period of life was sent to the university of Leyden, where he made
                    considerable progress in classical learning, and spoke with fluency and elegance
                    the German and French languages. Being designed for a military life, he was sent
                    from thence to the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Ecole·</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Royale</hi><hi rend="italic">du Génie Militaire,</hi> conducted by Vauban, at
                    La Fère in Picardy, where he laid the foundation of that science which he so
                    conspicuously exhibited at the defence of Gibraltar He completed his military
                    course on the Continent by a tour, undertaken for the purpose of seeing in
                    practice what he had studied in theory. Prussia was the model for discipline,
                    and he continued some time as a volunteer in the service of that state.</p>
                <p>Mr Elliot returned, in the seventeenth year of his age, to his native country,
                    Scotland; and was the same year, 1735, introduced by his father Sir Gilbert, to
                    LieutenantColonel Peers of the twenty-third regiment of foot, then stationed at
                    Edinburgh, as a youth anxious to bear arms for his king and country. He was
                    accordingly entered as a volunteer in that regiment, where he continued for
                    upwards of a year. From the twenty-third regiment he went into the engineer
                    corps at Woolwich, and made great progress in study, until his uncle Colonel
                    Elliot appointed him adjutant of the second troop of horse grenadiers. With
                    these troops he went upon service to Germany, and was present with them in a
                    variety of actions. At the battle of Dettingen he was wounded. In this regiment
                    he obtained the rank of captain and major, and afterwards purchased the
                    lieutenant-colonelcy. On arriving at this grade he resigned his commission as
                    engineer, which he had enjoyed along with his regimental rank, and quitted a
                    branch of the service in which he had been actively employed very much to the
                    advantage of his country. He received the instructions of the famous engineer
                    Bellidor, and made himself completely master of the science of gunnery; and had
                    he not so disinterestedly resigned his rank in the engineer department, he would
                    long before his death have, by regular progression, reached the head <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193331871" xml:id="kp-eb0708-1871-0672"/> of that corps.
                    Soon after this he was appointed aid-decamp to George II. and was distinguished
                    for his military skill and discipline. In the year 1759 he quitted the second
                    troop of horse grenadier guards, being selected to raise, form, and discipline,
                    the first regiment of light horse, which was called after him <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elliot's.</hi> As soon as they were raised and formed he was appointed to the
                    command of the cavalry in the expedition on the coasts of France, with the rank
                    of brigadier-general. After this he passed into Germany, where he was employed
                    on the staff, and greatly distinguished himself.</p>
                <p>During the peace he was not idle. His great talents in the various branches of
                    the military art procured him ample employment. In the year 1775 he was
                    appointed to sueceed General A’Court as commander-in-chief of the forces in
                    Ireland; but he did not continue long on this station, not even long enough to
                    unpack all his trunks; for finding that interferences were made by petty
                    authority derogatory of his own, he resisted the practice with becoming spirit;
                    and not choosing to disturb the government of the sister kingdom on a matter
                    personal to himself, he solicited to be recalled. The government acceded to his
                    request, and, in a fortunate hour for the safety of Gibraltar, he was appointed
                    to the command of that important fortress. The system of his life, as well as
                    his education, peculiarly qualified him for this trust. He was perhaps the most
                    abstemious man of the age, indulging himself neither in animal food nor in wine.
                    He never slept more than four hours at a time, so that he was up later and
                    earlier than most other men. He so inured himself to habits of hardiness, that
                    the things which prove difficult and painful to other men were to him his daily
                    practice, and rendered pleasant by use. It could not be easy to starve such a
                    man into a surrender, nor possible to surprise him. The example of the
                    commander-in-chief in a besieged garrison has the most persuasive efficacy in
                    forming the manners of a soldiery. Like him, his brave followers came to
                    regulate their lives by the most strict rules of discipline before there arose a
                    necessity for so doing; and severe exercise, with short diet, became habitual to
                    them from their own choice. The military system of discipline which he
                    introduced, and the preparations which he made for his defence, were contrived
                    with so much judgment, and executed with so much address, that he was able with
                    a handful of men to preserve his post against an attack, the constancy of which,
                    even apart from the vigour with which it was made, would have been sufficient to
                    exhaust any common set of men. Collected within himself, he in no instance
                    attempted by premature attacks to destroy the labours which it would cost the
                    enemy time, patience,-and expense to complete; he deliberately observed their
                    approaches, and, with the justest discernment, seized on the proper moment at
                    which to make his attack with success. He never spent his ammunition in useless
                    parade or in unimportant efforts. He never relaxed his discipline from the
                    appearance of security, nor hazarded the lives of his garrison by wild
                    experiments. By a cool and temperate demeanour, he maintained his station for
                    three years of constant investment, in which the whole powers of Spain were
                    employed against him. All the eyes of Europe were on this garrison; and his
                    conduct has justly exalted him to the most elevated rank in the military annals
                    of his time. On his return to England, the gratitude of the British senate was
                    as forward as the public voice in awarding him that distinguished honour which
                    his merit deserved. Both houses of parliament voted an unanimous address of
                    thanks to the general; the king conferred on him the honour of knight of the
                    bath, with a pension during his own and a second life of his own appointment;
                    and on the 14th June 1787, his majesty advanced him to the peerage by the title
                    of Lord Heathfield, Baron Gibraltar, permitting him to take, in addition to his
                    family arms, the arms of the fortress which he had so bravely defended.</p>
                <p>His lordship died on the 9th of July 1790 at Aix-la-Chapelle, of a second stroke
                    of the palsy, after having for some weeks preceding enjoyed tolerable good
                    health and an unusual flow of spirits. His death happened two days before he was
                    to have set out for Leghorn on his way to Gibraltar, of which place he was once
                    more appointed governor, in the view of an approaching war. He married Anne,
                    daughter of Sir Francis Drake of Devonshire, and had by her Francis Augustus, by
                    whom he was succeeded in his title.</p>
