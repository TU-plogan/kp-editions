                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ENFIELD, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, LL.D, an
                    elegant and justly admired writer, was born in the year 1741, at Sudbury. His
                    original destination was for the sacred office of the ministry, and he was
                    educated amongst the Protestant dissenters at Daventry, where the high polish
                    which he gave to his compositions distinguished him from many of his
                    contemporaries. The congregation of Benn’s Garden of Liverpool made choice of
                    him for their minister in tfie year 1763, when he was not more than twenty-two
                    years of age; and in this situation he was soon taken notice of as an amiable
                    member of society, and an engaging preacher. Whilst he resided in Liverpool, he
                    published two volumes of sermons, duodecimo, as well as a collection of hymns
                    and family prayers, which met with a very favourable reception. In the year 1770
                    he was appointed tutor and lecturer in the belles-lettres at Warrington academy,
                    which he filled for some years with general approbation and unwearied diligence.
                    He was the compiler of many useful books, amongst the most popular of which we
                    may rank his <hi rend="italic">Speaker,</hi> consisting of pieces for recitation
                    selected from the best and most approved English authors. At the beginning of
                    this collection there is an excellent essay on elocution. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Preachers Directory,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">English Preacher,</hi> a
                    collection of sermons in 9 vols. 12mo, from the most celebrated authors, and
                    Biographical Sermons on the principal characters in the Old and New Testament,
                    with a number of single sermons on particular occasions, were also the
                    productions of his pen. The controversy relative to literary property likewise
                    engaged his attention, and on this he wrote a quarto pamphlet. He also
                    published, in one volume quarto, <hi rend="italic">Institutes of Natural
                    Philosophy,</hi> theoretical and experimental; and during the time of his
                    residence at Warrington, as teacher in the academy, the university of Edinburgh
                    conferred upon him the degree of LL.D. When that academy was dissolved in 1783,
                    Dr Enfield continued for two years at Warrington in the capacity of private
                    tutor, after which he was chosen pastor<pb break="no" facs="nls:193332235"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-2235-0700"/> of the Octagon meeting-house at Norwich, in the
                    year 1785. He at length gave up his private tuition, and entirely devoted his
                    time to literary labours, and the peculiar duties of his pastoral charge. About
                    this time he lost his eldest son, who had been appointed to the office of
                    town-clerk of Nottingham. This event would have been productive of very serious
                    effects on his health and spirits, had it not been for the consolations of
                    religion and philosophy, which are sufficient to support the human mind under
                    the pressure of the severest calamities. He undertook and executed the laborious
                    task of abridging Brucker’s <hi rend="italic">History of Philosophy,</hi> which,
                    in 1791, he published in 2 vols. 4to. It has been generally acknowledged that
                    the tenets of the different sects of philosophers were never before exhibited to
                    the world with such perspicuity and elegance; qualifications for which Dr
                    Enfield was undoubtedly eminent. He contributed largely to the Biographical
                    Dictionary published under the inspection of Dr Aiken and others.</p>
                <p>An unsuspected distemper hastened the termination of his useful life, and, on the
                    3d of November 1797, he expired in the fifty-seventh year of his age. That
                    general love of mankind which Dr Enfield possessed, falls to the lot of but few;
                    nor does it often happen that an individual dies so universally lamented. It was
                    essential to him to be amiable in every station and condition of life. His
                    posthumous sermons, in 3 vols. 8vo, had a very numerous list of subscribers; a
                    strong proof of the estimation in which he was held by all who knew him, either
                    personally or by report. In these discourses be treats chiefly on moral topics,
                    which he discusses with the nicest discrimination, and in a train of the most
                    pleasing and manly eloquence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Enfield,</hi> a village of the hundred of Edmonton, in the
                    county of Middlesex, nine miles from London. There are the remains of an ancient
                    royal palace, in which Edward VI. kept his court, and where Elizabeth rested on
                    her way to London in order to assume the crown. Near to it was Enfield chase,
                    disforested in 1779, divided between several parishes and the crown, and now
                    occupied by several country seats of the more opulent traders of London. The
                    parish is extensive, and its population amounted in 1801 to 5881, in 1811 to
                    6884, in 1821 to 8227, and in 1831 to 8812.</p>
