                <p><label type="entry">EGG</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Physiology,</hi> a body
                    formed in certain females, in which is contained an embryo or foetus of the same
                    species, under a cortical surface or shell. The exterior part of an egg is a
                    shell, which in a hen, for instance, is a white, thin, and friable cortex,
                    including all the other parts. The shell becomes more brittle by being exposed
                    to a dry heat. It is lined everywhere with a very thin but pretty tough
                    membrane, which dividing at or very near the obtuse end of the egg, forms a
                    small bag, where only air is contained. In new-laid eggs this follicle appears
                    very little, but becomes larger when the egg is kept. Within this are contained
                    the albumen or white, and the vitellus or yolk; each of which has its different
                    virtues. The albumen is a cold, viscous, white liquor in the egg, different in
                    consistence in its different parts. It is observed, that there are two distinct
                    albumens, each of which is inclosed in its proper membrane. Of these, one is
                    very thin and liquid, the other is more dense and viscous, and of a somewhat
                    whiter colour, but, in old and stale eggs, after some days incubation, inclining
                    to a yellow. As this second albumen covers the yolk on all sides, so it is
                    itself surrounded by the other external liquid. The albumen of a fecundated egg
                    is as sweet and free from corruption during the whole time of incubation as it
                    is in new laid eggs; and so is also the vitellus. As the eggs of hens consist of
                    two liquors separated one from another, and distinguished by two branches of
                    umbilical veins, one of which goes to the vitellus, and the other to the
                    albumen; so it is very probable that they are of different natures, and
                    consequently appointed for different purposes. When the vitellus grows warm with
                    incubation, it becomes more humid, resembling melting wax or fat; and hence it
                    occupies more space. For as the foetus increases, the albumen insensibly wastes
                    away and condenses; the vitellus, on the contrary, seems to lose little or
                    nothing of its bulk when the foetus is perfected, and only appears more liquid
                    and humid when the abdomen of the foetus begins to be formed. The chick in the
                    egg is first nourished by the albumen, and, when this is consumed, by the
                    vitellus, as with milk. If we compare the <hi rend="italic">chalaza</hi> to the
                    extremities of an axis passing through the vitellus, which is of a spherical
                    form, this sphere will be composed of two unequal portions, its axis not passing
                    through its centre; consequently, since it is heavier than the white, its
                    smaller portion must always be uppermost in all positions of the egg. The
                    yellowish white round spot, called <hi rend="italic">cicatricula,</hi> is placed
                    on the middle of the smaller portion of the yolk; and therefore, from what has
                    been said above, must always appear on the superior part of the vitellus. Not
                    long before the exclusion of the chick, the whole yolk is taken into its
                    abdomen; and the shell, at the obtuse end of the egg, frequently appears cracked
                    some time before the exclusion of the chick. The chick is sometimes observed to
                    perforate the shell with its beak. After exclusion, the yolk is gradually
                    wasted, being conveyed into the small guts by a small duct.</p>
                <p>Eggs differ very much, according to the birds which lay them, as to their colour,
                    form, size, age, and the different ways of dressing them: those most used in
                    food are hens’ eggs. As to the preservation of eggs, it is observed that the egg
                    is always quite full when it is first laid by the hen; but from that time it
                    gradually becomes less and less so, till its decay; and however compact and
                    close its shell may appear, it is nevertheless perforated with a multitude of
                    small holes, though too minute for the discernment of our eyes, the effect of
                    which is a daily decrease of matter within the egg, from the time of its being
                    laid. This perspiration is much quicker in hot w cather than in cold. To
                    preserve the egg fresh, there needs no more than to preserve it full, and stop
                    its transpiration; the method of doing which is, by stopping up those pores with
                    matter which is not soluble in watery fiuids; and on this principle it is that
                    all kinds of varnish, prepared with spirit of wine, will preserve eggs fresh for
                    a long time, if it be carefully rubbed all over the shell. Tallow, or mutton
                    fat, is also good for this purpose.</p>
