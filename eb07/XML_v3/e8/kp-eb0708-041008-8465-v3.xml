                <p><label type="entry">EDDA</label>, a system of the ancient Icelandic or Runic
                    mythology, containing many curious particulars of the theology, philosophy, and
                    manners of the northern nations of Europe; or of the Scandinavians who had
                    migrated from Asia, and from whom our Saxon ancestors were descended. Mr Mallet
                    apprehends that it was originally compiled, soon after the Pagan religion was
                    abolished, as a course of poetical lectures, for the use of such young
                    Icelanders as devoted themselves to the profession of scald or poet. It consists
                    of two principal parts; the first containing a brief system of mythology,
                    properly called the <hi rend="italic">Edda</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    second being a kind of art of poetry, and called <hi rend="italic">Scalda</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">poetics.</hi> The most ancient Edda was compiled by Soemund
                    Sigfusson, surnamed the Learned, who iras born in Iceland about the year 1057.
                    This was abridged, and rendered more easy and intelligible, about one hundred
                    and twenty years afterwards, by Snorro Stur-leson, who was supreme judge of
                    Iceland in the years 1215 and 1222; and it was published in the form of a
                    dialogue. The latter added also the second part in the form of a dialogue, being
                    a detail of different events transacted amongst the divinities. 'Die only three
                    pieces which are known to remain of the more ancient Edda of Soemund are, the
                    Volupsa, the Havamaal, and the Runic chapter. The Volupsa, or prophecy of Vola,
                    or Fola, appears to be the text on which the Edda is the comment. It contains,
                    in two or three hundred lines, the whole system of mythology disclosed in the
                    Edda, and may be compared to the Sibylline verses, on account of its laconic yet
                    bold style, and its imagery and obscurity. It is professedly a revelation of the
                    decrees of the father of nature, and the actions and operations of the gods. It
                    describes the chaos, the formation of the world with its various inhabitants,
                    the functions of the gods, their most signal adventures, their quarrels with
                    Loke their great adversary, and the vengeance that ensued; and it concludes with
                    a long description of the final state of the universe, its dissolution and
                    conflagration, the battle of the inferior deities and the evil beings, the
                    renovation of the world, the happy lot of the good, and the punishment of the
                    wicked. The Havamaal, or Sublime Discourse, is attributed to the god Odin, or
                    Woden, who is supposed to have given these precepts of wisdom to mankind; it is
                    comprised in about a hundred and twenty stanzas, and resembles the book of
                    Proverbs. Mr Mallet has given several extracts of this treatise on the
                    Scandinavian ethics. The Runic chapter <pb break="no" facs="nls:193328478"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-8478-0411"/>contains a short system of ancient magic,
                    especially of the enchantments wrought by the operation of Runic characters, of
                    which a specimen is also given. A manuscript copy of the Edda of Snorro is
                    preserved in the library of the university of Upsal; the first part of it was
                    published with a Swedish and Latin version by Μ. Goranson. The Latin version is
                    printed as a supplement to Mallet’s Northern Antiquities. The first edition of
                    the Edda was published by Resenius, professor at Copenhagen, in the year 1665,
                    in a large quarto volume, containing the text of the Edda, a Latin translation
                    by an Icelandic priest, a Danish version, and various readings from different
                    manuscripts. Mallet has also given an English translation of the first part,
                    accompanied with remarks; from which we learn, that the Edda teaches the
                    doctrine of the Supreme, called the Universal Father, and Odin, who lives for
                    ever, governs all his kingdom, and directs the great things as well as the
                    small; who formed the heaven, earth, and air; who made man, and gave him a
                    spirit or soul, which will live after the body shall have mouldered away: then
                    all the just shall dwell with him in a place called Gimle or Vingolf, the palace
                    of friendship; but wicked men shall go to Hela, or death, and thence to
                    Niflheim, or the abode of the wicked, which is below in the ninth world. It
                    inculcates also the belief of several inferior gods and goddesses, the chief of
                    whom is Frigga or Frea, that is, <hi rend="italic">lady,</hi> meaning thereby
                    the earth, who was the spouse of Odin or the Supreme God; and hence we may infer
                    that, according to the opinion of these ancient philosophers, this Odin was the
                    active principle or soul of the world, which uniting itself with matter, had
                    thereby put it in a condition to produce the intelligences or inferior gods, and
                    men, with all other creatures. The Edda likewise teaches the existence of an
                    evil being called Loke, the calumniator of the gods, and the artificer of fraud,
                    w ho surpasses all other beings in cunning and perfidy. It teaches the creation
                    of all things out of an abyss or chaos; the final destruction of the world by
                    fire; the absorption of the inferior divinities, both good and bad, into the
                    bosom of the grand divinity, from whom all things proceeded, as emanations of
                    his essence, and who will survive all things; and, lastly, the renovation of the
                    earth in an improved state</p>
