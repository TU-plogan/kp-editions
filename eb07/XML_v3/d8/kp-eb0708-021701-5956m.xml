                <p><label type="entry">DRUSES</label>, an independent people of Palestine, of
                    warlike habits, who inhabit the mountains of Libanus, Anti-Libanus, and all the
                    coast from Gibail to Saide, and east as far as Balbec. There are various
                    conjectures concerning the origin of this singular race; the most rational of
                    which is, that they were originally a persecuted sect of Mahommedans, who,
                    flying from oppression, took refuge, about the commencement of the eleventh
                    century, amongst the mountains of Lebanon, and there formed an independent
                    society.</p>
                <p>The unity of the Mahommedan faith was at a very early period broken by contending
                    sectaries; and, according to the full and accurate details of Vólney, from whom
                    the following account is chiefly compiled, Egypt, under the influence of these
                    delusions, became, in the reign of the third caliph of the race of the
                    Fatimites, and in the year of the Hegira 386 <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi>
                    996), the theatre of the most extravagant enthusiasm and absurdity ever perhaps
                    recorded in history. This prince, called Hakem-b’amr-ellah, was remarkable for
                    his heresies and fanatical zeal. He caused the first caliphs, the companions of
                    Mahommed, to be cursed in the mosques, and afterwards revoked the anathema; he
                    compelled the Jews and Christians to abjure their religion, and then permitted
                    them to resume it; he forbade the pilgrimage to Mecca, fasting, and the five
                    prayers; and at length carried his madness so far as to desire to pass for God
                    himself. This impious pretension was supported by a false prophet, who came from
                    Persia into Egypt, and who, to ingratiate himself with Hakem, maintained that
                    this caliph was God himself incarnate. But unluckily for the prophet, his new
                    god had not the power to protect him from the fury of his enemies, who slew him
                    in a tumult almost in the arms of the caliph, who was himself massacred soon
                    afterwards on Mount <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325969"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-5969-0218"/>Mokhattam, where, as he said, he had held
                    conversation with angels.</p>
                <p>The death of these two chiefs did not stop the progress of their opinions. A
                    disciple of Mohammed-ben-Ismael, named Hamzu-ben-Ahmud, propagated them with
                    indefatigable zeal in Egypt, in Palestine, and along the coast of Syria, as far
                    as Sidon and Berytus. But his proselytes being persecuted by the sect in power,
                    took refuge in the mountains of Lebanon, where they were better able to defend
                    themselves; and shortly after this era we find them established there, and
                    forming an independent society.</p>
                <p>The difference of their opinions naturally disposes them to be enemies, but the
                    urgent interest of their common safety forces them to allow mutual toleration;
                    and they have always appeared united, and have jointly opposed, at different
                    times, the Crusaders, the sultans of Aleppo, the Mamelukes, and the Ottomans.
                    The conquest of Syria by the latter made no change in their situation. Selim I.
                    on his return from Egypt, meditating no less than the conquest of Europe,
                    disdained to waste his time before the rocks of Lebanon. Soliman II. his
                    successor, incessantly engaged in important wars, either with the knights of
                    Rhodes, the Persians, the kingdom of Yemen, the Hungarians, the Germans, or the
                    emperor Charles V. had no time to think of the Druses. Emboldened by this
                    inattention, and not content with their own independence, they frequently
                    descended from their mountains to pillage the Turks. The pashas in vain
                    attempted to repel these inroads; for their troops were invariably routed or
                    repulsed. But about the year 1588 they .were at last subdued by Amurath III., to
                    whom they became tributary, and under whose powerful sway the anarchy by which
                    the country was distracted under its different chiefs was put an end to; and one
                    head or chief was established, who was invested with the executive power, and
                    who was made liable to the sultan for the stipulated tribute, which he was to
                    collect as he best could from the people. The whole power and resources of the
                    country being by this conquest or revolution concentrated under one head, the
                    Druses were engaged in continual warfare and in marauding hostilities with the
                    Turks; and towards the middle of the seventeenth century they had attained to
                    the height of their power under the celebrated emir Fakir el-din or Fakar-din.
                    This chief extended his conquests, and at length became so formidable that he
                    excited the terror of the sultan, who resolved to make an effort for his
                    destruction. To avert the threatening storm he embarked for Italy to solicit
                    succours from the court of the Medici, at Florence, where he remained for nine
                    years. On his return he found every thing prosperous under the wise government
                    of his son Ali. But .this prince was afterwards defeated in a battle with the
                    Turks; and Fakir-el-din himself being compelled to take refuge in the mountains,
                    was betrayed into the hands of the Turks by his companions, and by the orders of
                    Amurath he was strangled at Constantinople in the year 1631.</p>
                <p>After the death of Fakir-el-din, the posterity of that prince still continued in
                    possession of the government, though at the pleasure, and as vassals, of the
                    Porte. But as this family failed in the male line at the beginning of the last
                    century, the authority devolved, by the election of the scheiks, on the house of
                    Shelah. The only emir of that house whose name deserves to be preserved, is
                    Melhem, who reigned from 1740 to 1759; in which interval he retrieved the losses
                    of the Druses, and restored them to that consequence which they had lost by the
                    defeat of Fakir-el-din. Towards the end of his life, about the year 1754,
                    Melhem, wearied with the cares of government, abdicated his authority, to live
                    in religious retirement, after the manner of the Okkals; but the troubles which
                    succeeded forced him once more to resume the reins of government, which he held
                    till 1759, when he died universally regretted.</p>
                <p>He left three sons, minors, the eldest of whom ought, according to the custom of
                    the country, to have succeeded him; but being only eleven years of age, the
                    authority devolved on his unclo Mansour, agreeably to a law very general in
                    Asia, which provides that the people shall be governed by a sovereign who has
                    arrived at years of maturity. The young prince was but little fitted to maintain
                    his pretensions; but a Maronite, named Sad-el-kouri, to whom Melhem had
                    intrusted his education, took this upon himself. Aspiring to see his pupil a
                    powerful prince, that he might himself become a powerful vizir, he made every
                    exertion to advance his fortune; and accordingly entered into a great many plots
                    and intrigues, in which he succeeded by means of an emir of the name of Yussuf
                    in subverting his authority. We have no exact or accurate information of the
                    internal state of this country, or of the domestic agitations and wars by which
                    it has since been distracted. Nor would the detail of these petty wars, however
                    ample or correct, possess any peculiar interest. The country is ruled by an
                    emir, who is considered as the vassal of the Turks.</p>
                <p>In their religion the Druses have very peculiar tenets and observances. They
                    practise neither circumcision, nor prayers, nor fasting; they observe neither
                    festivals nor prohibitions. They drink wine, eat pork, and allow marriage
                    between brothers and sisters, though not between fathers and children. From this
                    we may conclude, with reason, that the Druses have no religion; yet one class of
                    them must be excepted, whose religious customs are very peculiar. These who
                    compose it are to the rest of the nation what the initiated were to the profane.
                    They assume the name of <hi rend="italic">Ohhals,</hi> or spiritualists, and
                    bestow on the vulgar the epithet of <hi rend="italic">Ojahel,</hi> or ignorant.
                    They have various degrees of initiation, the highest orders of which require
                    celibacy. These are distinguished by the white turban, which they affect to wear
                    as a symbol of their purity; and so proud are they of this supposed purity, that
                    they think themselves sullied by even touching a profane person. If you eat out
                    of their plate, or drink out of their cup, they break them; and hence the
                    custom, so general in this country, of using vases with a sort of cock, which
                    may be drank out of without touching them with the lips. All their practices are
                    enveloped in mysteries. Their oratories stand alone or detached, and are
                    constantly situated on eminences; in these they hold their secret assemblies, to
                    which women are admitted. It is believed that they perform ceremonies therein
                    presence of a small statue resembling an ox or a calf; and hence some have
                    pretended to prove that they are descended from the Samaritans. But besides that
                    the fact is not well ascertained, the worship of the ox may be deduced from
                    other sources.</p>
                <p>The rest of the Druses, strangers to this spirit, arc wholly indifferent about
                    religious matters. The Christians who live in their country pretend that several
                    of them believe in the metempsychosis, and that others worship the sun, moon,
                    and stars. All this is possible; for every one, left to his own fancy, follows
                    the opinion which pleases him most; and these opinions are those which present
                    themselves most naturally to unenlightened minds. When among the Turks, they
                    affect the exterior of Mahommedans, frequent the mosques, and perform their
                    ablutions and prayers. Among the Maronites, they accompany them to church, and,
                    like them, make use of holy water. Many of them, importuned by the missionaries,
                    suffer themselves to be baptized; and if solicited by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193325982" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5982-0219"/>Turks, receive circumcision,
                    and conclude by dying neither Christians nor Mahommedans. But they are not so
                    indifferent in matters of civil policy.</p>
                <p>The Druses may be divided into two classes: the common people; and the people of
                    eminence and property, distinguished by the title of scheiks and emirs, or
                    descendants of princes. The greater part are cultivators, either as farmers or
                    proprietors; and every man lives on his inheritance, improving his mulberry
                    trees and vineyards. In some districts they grow tobacco, cotton, and some
                    grain; but the quantity of these is inconsiderable. It appears that at first all
                    the lands were, as formerly in Europe, in the hands of a small number of
                    families. But in order to render them productive, the great proprietors were
                    forced to sell part of them, and let leases; which subdivision has become the
                    chief source of the power of the state, by multiplying the number of persons
                    interested in the public welfare. There still exist, however, some traces of the
                    original inequality, which even at this day produces pernicious effects. The
                    great property possessed by some families gives them too much influence in all
                    the measures of the nation; and their private interests have too great weight in
                    every public transaction. Their recent history affords sufficient proofs of
                    this, since all the civil or foreign wars in which they have been engaged have
                    originated in the ambition and personal views of some of the principal families,
                    such as the Lesbeks, the Djambelats, and the Ismaels of Solyma. The scheiks of
                    these houses, who alone possess one tenth part of the country,-procured
                    retainers by means of their money, and at last involved all the Druses in their
                    dissensions. It must be owned, however, that possibly to this conflict between
                    contending parties the whole nation owes the good fortune of never having been
                    enslaved by its chief.</p>
                <p>This chief, called <hi rend="italic">Hahem</hi> or governor, and also <hi
                    rend="italic">Emix or</hi> prince, is a sort of king or general, who unites in
                    his own person the civil and military powers. His dignity is sometimes
                    transmitted from father to son, sometimes from one brother to another; and the
                    succession is determined rather by force than by any certain laws. Females can
                    in no case pretend to this inheritance. They are already excluded from
                    succession in civil affairs, and consequently can still less expect it in
                    political. In general the Asiatic governments are too turbulent, and their
                    administration renders military talents too necessary, to admit of the
                    sovereignty of women. Among the Druses, the male line of any family being
                    extinguished, the government devolves to him who is in possession of the
                    greatest number of suffrages and resources. But the first step used to be to
                    obtain the approbation of the Porte, of whom he became the vassal and tributary.
                    It even happens, that, not unfrequently, to assert its supremacy, it names the
                    Hakem, contrary to the wishes of the nation, as in the case of Ismael Hasbeya,
                    raised to that dignity by Djezzar; but this constraint lasts no longer than it
                    is maintained by the violence which gave it birth. The office of the governor is
                    to watch over the good order of the state, and to prevent the emirs, scheiks,
                    and villages, from making war on each other; and in case of disobedience, he may
                    employ force. He is also at the head of the civil power, and he names the cadis,
                    reserving to himself the power of life and death. He collects the tribute, from
                    which he annually pays to the pasha a stated sum. This tribute, which is called
                    <hi rend="italic">niiri,</hi> is imposed on the mulberry trees, vineyards,
                    cotton, and grain. All sown land pays in proportion to its extent; every foot of
                    mulberries is taxed at three medins, or three sols nine deniers (not quite
                    twopence). A hundred feet of vineyard pays a piastre, or forty mcdins; and fresh
                    measurements are often made to preserve a just proportion. The scheiks and emirs
                    have no exemption in this respect; and it may truly be said that they contribute
                    to the public stock in proportion to their fortune. The collection is made
                    almost without expense. Each man pays his contingent at Dair-el-kamar, if he
                    pleases, or to the collectors of the prince, who make a circuit round the
                    country after the crop of silks. The surplus of this tribute is for the prince;
                    so that it is his interest to reduce the demands of the Turks, as it would
                    likewise be to augment the impost. But this measure requires the sanction of the
                    scheiks, who have the privilege of opposing it. Their consent is necessary,
                    likewise, for peace and war. In these cases, the emir must convoke general
                    assemblies, and lay before them the state of his affairs. There every scheik,
                    and every peasant who has any reputation for courage or understanding, is
                    entitled to give his suffrage; so that this government may be considered as a
                    mixture of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. Every thing indeed depends on
                    circumstances. If the governor be a man of ability, he is absolute; if he be
                    weak, he is a cipher. This proceeds from the want of fixed laws; a want common
                    to all Asia, and the radical cause of all the disorders in the governments of
                    the Asiatic nations.</p>
                <p>Neither the chief nor the individual emirs maintain troops; they have only
                    persons attached to the domestic service of their houses, and a few black
                    slaves. When the nation makes war, every man, whether scheik or peasant, able to
                    bear arms, is called upon to march. He takes with him a little bag of flour, a
                    musket, some bullets, a small quantity of powder made in his village, and
                    repairs to the rendezvous appointed by the governor. If it be a civil war, as
                    sometimes happens, the servants, the farmers, and their friends, take up arms
                    for their patron, or the chief of their family, and repair to his standard. In
                    such cases, the parties irritated frequently seem on the point of proceeding to
                    the last extremities; but they seldom have recourse to acts of violence, or
                    attempt the death of each other. Mediators always interpose, and the quarrel is
                    appeased the more readily, as each patron is obliged to provide his followers
                    with provisions and ammunition.</p>
                <p>The Druses are noted for their hospitality. Whoever presents himself at their
                    door in the quality of a suppliant or passenger, is sure of being entertained
                    with lodging and food in the most generous and unaffected manner. Volney often
                    saw the lowest peasants give the last morsel of bread they had in their houses
                    to the hungry traveller; and when it was observed to them that they wanted
                    prudence, their answer was, “God is liberal and great, and all men are
                    brethren.” There arc, therefore, no inns in their country any more than in the
                    rest of Turkey. When they have once contracted with their guest the sacred
                    engagement of bread and salt, no subsequent event can make them violate it.
                    Various instances of this are related which do honour to their character. A few
                    years ago an aga of the janissaries having been engaged in a rebellion, fled
                    from Damascus and retired among the Druses. The pasha was informed of this, and
                    demanded him of the emir, threatening to make war on him in case of refusal. The
                    emir demanded him of the scheik Talhouk, who had received him; but the indignant
                    scheik replied, “When have you known the Druses deliver up their guests? Tell
                    the emir, that as long as Talhouk shall preserve his beard, not a hair of the
                    head of his suppliant shall fall.”</p>
                <p>In consequence, says Volney, of their prejudices, the Druses do not choose to
                    make alliances out of their own families. They invariably prefer their relation,
                    though poor, to a rich stranger; and poor peasants have been known to refuse
                    their daughters to merchants of Saide and Bairout, who possessed from twelve to
                    fifteen thousand piastres. They <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325995"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-5995-0220"/>observe also, to a certain degree, the custom of
                    the Hebrews, which directed that a brother should espouse his brother’s
                    widow.</p>
                <p>In short, the proper and distinctive character of the Druses is a sort of
                    republican spirit, which gives them more energy than any other subjects of the
                    Turkish government, and an indifference for religion, which forms a striking
                    contrast with the zeal of the Mahommedans and Christians. In other respects,
                    their private life, their customs and prejudices, are the same with those of
                    other orientals. They may marry several wives, and repudiate them when they
                    choose; but, except by the emir and a few men of eminence, that is rarely
                    practised. The women are all veiled, so that no man knows the face of any other
                    woman than his wife, his mother, his sister, and sisters-in-law. Every man lives
                    in the bosom of his own family, and goes little abroad. The women, those even of
                    the scheiks, make the bread, roast the coffee, wash the linen, cook the
                    victuals, and perform all domestic offices. The men cultivate their lands and
                    vineyards, and dig canals for watering them. In the evening they sometimes
                    assemble in the court, the area, or house of the chief of the village or family.
                    There, seated in a circle, with legs crossed, pipes in their mouths, and
                    poniards at their belts, they discourse of their various labours, the scarcity
                    or plenty of their harvests, peace or war, the conduct of the emir, or the
                    amount of the taxes; they relate past transactions, discuss present interests,
                    and form conjectures on the future. Their children, tired with play, come
                    frequently to listen. This is the only education of those who are termed the
                    Ignorant.</p>
                <p>This account of the character, manners, and religious tenets of the Druses has
                    been corroborated by modern travellers. The reverend Mr Connor, a missionary and
                    travelling agent of the British and Foreign Bible Society, mentions that there
                    are many sects among them; but that they are divided into two great classes,
                    that of the Okkals or the Intelligent, who to the number of 10,000 form the
                    sacred order; and the Djahels or Ignorant. It is stated to be extremely
                    difficult to learn any thing satisfactory respecting the religious creed of this
                    people. It is generally agreed that they believe in the transmigration of souls;
                    and according to the character of the individual in his journey through life,
                    will be the nature of the body which his soul will animate in a future state of
                    existence. If his conduct has been fair and honourable, his soul will vivify the
                    body of some respectable character in life. But if his conduct has been evil,
                    his soul will enter the body of a horse, a mule, or an ass. In like manner it is
                    believed that persons of eminent and conspicuous virtue will, as the highest
                    recompense of their merit, pass after death into the bodies of Chinese Druses.
                    In the schools, which are frequent among the Druses, the Okkals are generally
                    the masters, and are paid by the pupils. They teach reading and writing, and the
                    book generally used is the Koran. In some villages where there are Christian
                    schools, the Druses send their children thither, where they are taught to read
                    the Psalms of David. There are no Christians among the Druses, though the emir
                    with his family and some of the other nobles have their children baptized, have
                    chapels in their houses, and hear mass on Sunday, not from any rational belief
                    in the truths of Christianity, but for the same reason that, though they dislike
                    the Mahommedans generally, and entertain no tenet in common with their faith,
                    yet many of them, as we learn from Buckingham, are infected with their customs,
                    and keep the feast of Ramadan with aš much rigour as the most orthodox follower
                    of the Arabian prophet; just as the Mussulmans of India, though they despise and
                    hate the Hindus, have nevertheless adopted many of their superstitions and
                    ceremonies.</p>
                <p>The Djahels or the Ignorant, who form by far the most numerous class, perform no
                    religious rites whatever, unless when they are obliged by circumstances to
                    assume the appearance of Mahommedans. They cherish an equal dislike to the
                    Christians and Turks; and believe that the deity was incarnated in the person of
                    Hakem, caliph of Egypt, and that he will shortly appear again and utterly
                    destroy all his enemies.</p>
                <p>The Druses are a restless and enterprising people; they are formidable in
                    irregular war, being brave even to temerity; excellent marksmen, and noted for
                    sudden surprises. The passion of all classes for arms is remarked by every
                    traveller; and Buckingham mentions a keen dispute at which he was present
                    relative to the value of different weapons, in which the sabres of Ispahan and
                    Damascus, and the muskets and pistols of England, were unanimously preferred.
                    They are of industrious habits, devoting their attention to the cultivation of
                    the soil; and the same traveller, who was over all this country, on quitting a
                    Mahommedan village and entering one inhabited by Druses, was struck with the
                    contrast of the superior order and neatness everywhere conspicuous, as well as
                    in the more cultivated state of the land. No great distinction of ranks is
                    preserved among them, scheiks and peasants treating each other with the greatest
                    familiarity. They speak pure Arabic. Soeda, which is the capital of the Eastern
                    Druses, and the residence of their emir or prince, is about two miles westward
                    of the summit of that range of hills which forms the eastern boundary of the
                    plains of the Hauran.</p>
