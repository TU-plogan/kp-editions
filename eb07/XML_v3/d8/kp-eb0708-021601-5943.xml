                    use of spirituous liquors, wines, or drugs. Drunkenness is gradually produced,
                    and several distinct stages may be traced in its progress. The sensations
                    experienced in the earlier stages, or the state of incipient intoxication, are
                    peculiarly pleasurable. The mind becomes unusually excited; a soft serenity
                    steals over it, inducing a spirit of universal contentment; gaiety and warmth
                    kindle at the heart, and images of beauty expand before the imagination. In this
                    state, before consciousness is attacked, or the sensorium affected, some of the
                    faculties of the soul act with greater liveliness and vigour, and the feelings
                    of strength and courage are increased. In a short while the sense of propriety
                    is lost, the soul begins to open itself and pour forth its secrets, displaying
                    all the peculiarities of temper, good or bad. Gradually the scene thickens, and
                    consciousness becomes still more weakened. Reason vacates her throne, and
                    grotesque conceptions crowd upon the fancy. Dizziness attacks the brain, and
                    surrounding objects, seeming to lose their balance, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193325956" xml:id="kp-eb0708-5956-0217"/>Into strange
                    vagaries fall, As they would dance.</p><p>The drunkard begins to feel the earth unsteady beneath his feet, his sense of
                    equilibrium gives way, and total insensibility succeeds, in which a state of
                    stupor, wild dreams, and horror, strongly contrasts with that of previous
                    excitement. Different individuals are differently affected by the inebriating
                    liquid. The state of the passions at the period of indulging in strong liquors
                    also operates powerfully in modifying its effects. Persons under sentence of
                    death, and immediately before execution, have been known to swallow with
                    impunity draughts of the strongest alcohol, which, under other circumstances,
                    would have rendered them senseless. Hence the remarkable propriety of the
                    language put into the mouth of Lady Macbeth previously to the contemplated
                    murder, when, alluding to the manner in which she had “drugged the possets” of
                    the grooms, she says, “that which hath made them drunk hath made me bold.” In
                    some persons constitutional moroseness and melancholy are dispelled; in others
                    their habitual gloom is aggravated. Cases of the latter description, however,
                    are by no means so numerous as those of the former, and the general effect of
                    indulgence in “thick potations” is to dispel the clouds of care, at least for
                    the time being. But the re-action which eventually follows over-excitement
                    serves to deepen the darkness, and, by a dispensation of retributive justice, to
                    inflict certain punishment for the previous delinquency. Drunkards who are of a
                    sanguineous temperament are most intensely excited by the use of strong
                    liquors.</p><p>It is unnecessary to enumerate the various inebriating agents, which, as well as
                    temperament, influence the nature of the intoxication produced. Thus ebriety
                    from ardent spirits differs from that generated by malt liquors. Besides
                    alcohol, which is the intoxicating principle in all liquors, there are various
                    substances taken, both in the solid and fluid state, which induce intoxication.
                    The most common and remarkable are opium and nitrous oxide gas. The former, it
                    is well known, is in extensive use for this purpose in the East, but the latter
                    has not yet been employed out of the laboratory of the chemist. The effects
                    produced by this gas are described by the discoverer, Sir Humphry Davy, and
                    others who have experienced them, as very delightful, and similar to those
                    feltduring the earlier stages of intoxication from wine, but of a purer and more
                    ethereal nature.</p><p>Amongst the physiological effects of drunkenness are vertigo, double vision,
                    staggering and stammering, heat and flushing, ringing in the ears, and other
                    analogous affections. Vertigo, though partly produced by the ocular delusions
                    under which the drunkard labours, seems principally to arise from the close
                    sympathy which subsists between the brain and the nerves of the stomach. Double
                    vision is readily accounted for by the influence of increased circulation in the
                    brain upon the nerves of sight. Staggering and stammering may likewise be
                    explained by the disordered state of the nervous system. Heat and flushing
                    result from the strong determination of blood to the surface of the body, and
                    ringing in the ears particularly from the throbbing of the internal carotid
                    arteries, which run in the immediate neighbourhood of the ear. The mental
                    pleasure arising from intoxication is not so easily explained, though the
                    primary cause no doubt is physical or rather nervous excitement gradually
                    superinduced, and thus stimulating both the imagination and the passions. The
                    evil consequences of drinking, both in a physical and moral point of view, are
                    numerous and distressing. On the unhappy victim of this propensity a long train
                    of bodily diseases and infirmities are entailed. The liver, stomach, brain,
                    kidneys, indeed all the functions of the body, are seriously impaired by the
                    practice; and in this state the frame is not only more liable to attacks of
                    disease, but when they do come they are likely to exhibit tenfold inveteracy.
                    Thus life is either suddenly shortened, or protracted into a long disease. Death
                    itself is frequently an immediate consequence of over indulgence. We shall not
                    attempt a classification of the bodily infirmities and pernicious effects which
                    drunkenness produces; but we may mention madness, and spontaneous combustion of
                    the body, as belonging to the number. The former is by no means a rare
                    occurrence, and there are well authenticated cases of the latter. Drunkenness in
                    a judicial point of view is not punishable by our laws; but acts of violence
                    committed under its influence are held to be aggravated rather than otherwise;
                    nor can the accused allege it as an extenuation of the crime of which he has
                    been guilty. In proof of this it maybe stated, that a bond signed in a fit of
                    intoxication holds good in law, and is perfectly binding, unless it can be shown
                    that the person who signed it was inebriated by the collusion or contrivance of
                    those to whom the bond was given.</p><p>Drunkenness has been known from the earliest ages. Wherever the grape flourished
                    inebriation soon made its appearance. It has greatly varied at different times
                    and amongst different nations. There can be no doubt that in a rude, uncivilized
                    state of society, it prevails to the greatest extent, and assumes the most
                    revolting forms. It is also found to exist more extensively in northern than in
                    southern latitudes, owing no doubt to the difference of climate. As society is
                    refined, the vice certainly diminishes amongst the higher orders, although
                    amongst those in the lower ranks it is still found to exist to a fearful extent.
                    For checking this demoralizing practice various moral engines have been set to
                    work, but without a success commensurate with the philanthropy of the design or
                    the importance to society of the anticipated results.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
