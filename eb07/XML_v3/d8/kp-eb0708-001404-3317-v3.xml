                <p><label type="entry">DIDEROT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Denis</hi></label>, a French
                    writer and philosophen was the son of a cutler, and born at Langres in the year
                    1712. He received his education among the Jesuits, and being destined for the
                    church by one of his uncles, who had a canonry to bestow upon him, he assumed
                    the tonsure. But he discovered so little inclination for the ecclesiastical
                    profession, that his father sent him to Paris to prosecute his studies, and
                    afterwards placed him with an attorney. It soon appeared, however, that he was
                    more attached to different departments of literature and science than disposed
                    to submit to the drudgeries of the profession to which his father had destined
                    him; and having neglected his business, his allowance was withheld, which
                    obliged him to shift for himself, and to give lessons in order to procure a
                    subsistence. The studies to which Diderot devoted his attention were extremely
                    various. Physics, geometry, metaphysics, moral philosophy, and belles-lettres,
                    were at different times the objects of his pursuit; and he even indulged in
                    poetry and works of invention. But he attached himself chiefly to graver and
                    more serious studies. Diderot possessed great fluency and animation of language
                    in conversation; ’and this accomplishment, with a decisive tone and manner,
                    procured him both partizans and protectors.</p>
                <p>One of the first of his publications was a translation of Stanyan’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Greece.</hi> In the year 1745 he published <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of Moral Philosophy,</hi> 12mo, a work by which he
                    obtained some reputation. But the year following, when he published a piece
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Pensées Philosophiques,</hi> he acquired considerable
                    celebrity. This work was highly commended by the partizans of the new
                    philosophy, amongst whom he had now enlisted himself. The same work was
                    afterwards reprinted under the title of <hi rend="italic">Etrennes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aux Esprits</hi><hi rend="italic">Ports:</hi> it was very much
                    read, and is supposed to have contributed greatly to the diffusion of those free
                    opinions which had now become so prevalent in France. Soon after this period,
                    Diderot, in conjunction with D’Alembert, concerted the plan of that vast
                    undertaking, the <hi rend="italic">Dictionaire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédique.</hi> The professed object of this work was to form a magazine
                    of every branch of human knowledge; but it has been alleged that it was also
                    intended by the authors and editors as the great engine by means of which
                    established opinions, whether of a religious or politicalŉature, which they
                    supposed had their origin in fraud and superstition, were to be subverted. The
                    department of this work which was entrusted to Diderot was the description of
                    arts and trades <hi rend="italic">(arts</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">metiers).</hi> In fact, he was the principal architect of this
                    great edifice; and, besides the Prospectus, and the <hi rend="italic">Système
                    des Connaissances Humaines,</hi> which has been much commended on account of its
                    classification, he contributed many articles in various departments of science.
                    But his writings in the Dictionary have been considered as extremely verbose and
                    diffuse; and in all of them he is too fond of metaphysical subtilties and the
                    pompous parade of scientific language. The first two volumes of the Dictionary
                    appeared in the year 1751, and the first edition was completed and published in
                    1767; but although Diderot was occupied in this laborious undertaking for a
                    period of nearly twenty years, the recompense which he obtained for his labours
                    is said to have been extremely small.</p>
                <p>During this time be composed various other works. Amongst these may be mentioned
                    <hi rend="italic">A Letter on the Blind,</hi> for the use of those who see. This
                    work made a good deal of noise, and, in consequence of some of the sentiments it
                    contained, gave offence to the government, for which reason the author was
                    detained in confinement during six months at Vincennes. This piece was soon
                    followed by another, entitled <hi rend="italic">A Letter on the Deaf and
                    Dumb,</hi> 2 vols. !2mo, 1751. The <hi rend="italic">Sixth Sense,</hi> which was
                    published in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323330" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3330-0015"
                    />1752; <hi rend="italic">Thoughts on the interpretation of Nature,</hi> which
                    appeared in 1754; and <hi rend="italic">The Code of Nature,</hi> in 1755; are
                    similar works, and may be ranked in the same class. His moral character was
                    considerably affected by the publication of <hi rend="italic">I3ijoux</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Indiscrets,</hi> in two vols. 12mo, which is a collection of
                    licentious tales; but for this he made some kind of compensation when he
                    published two prose comedies, entitled <hi rend="italic">Le Fils
                    Naturel,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vliſl,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le Père de
                    Famille,</hi> 1758, which are not only interesting as dramatic pieces, but
                    exhibit a pure and correct morality. The latter is considered as one of the best
                    comedies of the sentimental kind which has appeared on the French stage, and it
                    has accordingly been much admired. He afterwards published a pamphlet on Public
                    Education, which undoubtedly contains some useful hints, but at the same time it
                    proposes many things which are utterly absurd and impracticable. To the list of
                    his works now mentioned we may add an eulogy on Richardson, which is full of
                    warmth and enthusiasm; and an Essay on the Life and Writings of Seneca the
                    Philosopher. This was his last production, and was published in 1779.</p>
                <p>The character of Diderot suffered considerably from some defamatory attacks which
                    he had made on his former frjend Rousseau, who had quarrelled with the French
                    philosophers, and had separated himself from their school. From the <hi
                    rend="italic">Confessions</hi> of the philosopher of Geneva, it would appear
                    that they expected of him some anecdotes which would not have redounded much to
                    their honour. In one of his letters Rousseau, speaking of Diderot, says,
                    “Although born with a good heart and an open disposition, he had an unfortunate
                    propensity to misinterpret the words and actions of his friends, and the most
                    ingenuous explanations only supplied his subtle imagination with new
                    interpretations against them.”</p>
                <p>Diderot was married and had a family; and, although he possessed considerable
                    irritability of temper, he was, it seems, a kind husband and a tender parent. At
                    the conclusion of the Dictionary, the state of his affairs having rendered it
                    necessary for him to dispose of his library, it was purchased by the empress of
                    Russia, who, with the king of Pŗussia, was at that time the great encourager of
                    literature and literary men. These sovereigns were also considered as disciples
                    of the French school. The price which Diderot received for his library was fifty
                    thousand livres, and he was to have the use of it during his life. But some of
                    his biographers, with what truth we know not, have not hesitated to charge him
                    with disposing of it a second time; they state, that when some person
                    commissioned by the empress wished to see it, the philosopher declined the visit
                    on various pretences, until he had had time to fill it with books borrowed from
                    booksellers. The examination, it is obvious, must have been extremely
                    superficial, otherwise the truth would have been at once detected. Diderot had
                    been admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin; but the doors of
                    the French Academy remained closed against him to the last. He died suddenly, as
                    he rose from table, on the 3lst July 1784. His literary and philosophical works
                    were collected and published by his friend Naigeon, in 15 vols. 8vo, at Paris,
                    in 1798. This collection has been enlarged, in subsequent republications, to 22
                    vols. 8vo, Paris, 1821; and it contains a Memoir of Diderot.</p>
                <p>Diderot, it would seem, had a hand in several of the most remarkable works of his
                    time, published under the names of others. “Who does not know,” says Grimm, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Correspondance,</hi> “that nearly a third of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire Philosophique</hi> of Raynal belongs to him? He laboured
                    on it during two years, and a considerable part of it was even composed under my
                    own eyes. Diderot himself was often startled at the boldness with which he had
                    made his friend the abbé speak. ‘ Who,’ asked he, ‘ who will venture to
                    subscribe this ?’ ‘ I,’ replied the abbé, ‘ I will subscribe it; proceed, I tell
                    you.’ What man of letters is there who may not easily recognise in the book <hi
                    rend="italic">De l’Esprit</hi> (of Helvetius), and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Système</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Nature,</hi> all the fine passages which
                    are, and could only be, from the pen of Diderot? If we undertook to make a more
                    complete enumeration, we should run the risk of naming many ungrateful
                    individuals.” (<hi rend="italic">Correspondance Littéraire, Philosophique, et
                    Critique,</hi> tom. iv. p. 85.) Grimm further states that Diderot furnished a
                    great number of pages to the <hi rend="italic">Systeme</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    la Nature,</hi> and that he likewise laboured, though to less extent, on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Système</hi><hi rend="italic">Social</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Morale</hi><hi rend="italic">Universelle,</hi> also published by
                    Baron d’Holbach. Such were some of the indirect literary efforts of Diderot. But
                    neither as a writer nor as a philosopher did he make for himself any very
                    enviable reputation. As a writer he was decidedly a bad model; he had neither
                    plan nor connection, and knew not how <hi rend="italic">proprie communia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dicere,</hi> whilst his style was deformed by obscurity,
                    neologisms, and a tone of insufferable dogmatism; but nevertheless he was often
                    vigorous, sometimes eloquent, and hit off happy traits of expression, as well as
                    striking truths, which, however, would have gained much by being more simply
                    enunciated. In fact, he had frequently the air of being <hi rend="italic">in
                    cathedra</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> he aimed at ambitious formularies, and
                    fatigued by his strained style, by his prodigal sallies, and by an enthusiasm
                    which seldom appeared natural. As a philosopher he wrote under the influence of
                    a heated imagination rather than under that of cool reason. He was almost always
                    exalted and extravagant; seldom or never simple and natural. His friends,
                    however, have celebrated his goodness, his frankness, his easy and obliging
                    character, and the vigour and <hi rend="italic">entrainement</hi> of his
                    conversation. Grimm, who has praised him warmly in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Correspondance,</hi> regards Diderot as having had the most naturally
                    encyclopaediacal head of any man that ever lived. He admires his energy, his
                    warmth, the variety of his ideas, the multiplicity of his acquirements, the
                    impetuous tumult of his imagination, and the charm and irregularity of his
                    conversation. Then he adds, “However willingly I may pardon all men for
                    believing nothing, I think that it would have been very desirable for the
                    reputation of Diderot, perhaps even for the honour of his age, if he had not
                    been an atheist. The determined war which he thought himself obliged to carry on
                    against God, caused him to lose the most precious moments of his life.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">Correspondance,</hi> 3me partie, tom. iv.
                    p. 87.) But Naigeon, who is less considerate than Grimm, praises his friend
                    without qualification, adding, besides, that “his age has not done him justice.”
                    It is possible indeed that some persons may have too much depreciated the merit
                    of Diderot; but others again exalted it beyond all measure. The general opinion
                    in regard to him, however, seems now to be pretty well fixed, and posterity has
                    at length put him in his right place. He had talent; he was capable of warmth
                    and elevation; but he wanted sagacity, moderation, and taste. “He has written
                    fine pages,” says Marmontel in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> “but he
                    never knew how to make a book.” He adopted a desolating and destructive system,
                    and he dishonoured his cause by the exaggeration of most of his principles, and
                    by the license which reigns in many of his productions. This explains the reason
                    why he never entered the academy, whose doors, as we have already stated, were
                    constantly shut against him, notwithstanding the anxious desire of his friends
                    to procure him admission. Voltaire, who had himself solicited his election,
                    appears latterly to have become less enamoured of the merit of Diderot, and even
                    to have formally censured some of his works. D’Alembert also coolled towards
                    him, and at last they did not even see each other. His rupture with <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193323343" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3343-0016"/> Rousseau,
                    however, was the work of the latter, who began the war which was afterwards
                    waged between them. But Diderot maintained his connection with Baron d’Holbach,
                    whose sentiments approached the nearest to his own on several important points;
                    and in the society of the baron he was relished and admired by reason of his
                    facility in speaking on subjects of all sorts, and no doubt also by his
                    antipathy to that creed, and to those institutions, which were no longer revered
                    or respected. On this topic he never tired, and his friends often amused
                    themselves with affording him opportunities to abandon himself to his
                    imagination, or, in other words, to blaspheme for their diversion. In an
                    unexcited state he exhibited constraint, awkwardness, timidity, and even a kind
                    of affectation. He was never truly Diderot except when his fancy had transported
                    him as it were beyond himself. Enthusiasm had become the condition of being most
                    natural to his mind, nay, even to his voice and features; and he was himself
                    only when in a state of intellectual inebriety. Grimm has reproached him with
                    having consumed in fugitive conversations the time which he might have devoted
                    to more durable labours; but Diderot loved to talk, especially when he could
                    indulge his vehement volubility without interruption; for, as Voltaire once
                    remarked on leaving a company where Diderot had engrossed the whole talk, “<hi
                    rend="italic">Cet</hi><hi rend="italic">homme-là nest</hi><hi rend="italic">pas
                    propre pour le</hi><hi rend="italic">dialogue."</hi> The correspondence recently
                    published has thrown but little new light on the character of this remarkable
                    man, nor has it tended in any material degree to increase the estimation in
                    which his talents and dispositions were previously held by the world.</p>
