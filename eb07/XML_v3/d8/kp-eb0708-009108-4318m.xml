                    learned of Scotish schoolmasters in modern times, was born in the year 1719. His
                    father, who was a small fanner in the county of Forfar, died when he was yet in
                    his infancy; and his mother contracted a second marriage with a worthy man, who,
                    though by no means in affluent circumstances, and soon burdened with children of
                    his own, treated him with the tenderness of a parent. A constitutional defect in
                    his sight prevented him from learning to read till he was twelve years of age,
                    but his subsequent progress was uncommonly rapid. Having for the space of three
                    years attended a parochial school, where he was instructed in writing,
                    arithmetic, and Latin, he became a successful competitor for a <hi rend="italic"
                    >bursary,</hi> or exhibition, in the university of St Andrews. Here he completed
                    the usual course with great approbation; and, having taken the degree of A. B.
                    he enrolled himself as a student of divinity, but his scruples respecting some
                    articles in the Confession of Faith prevented him from entering the church. What
                    those articles were, we have not discovered; but it appears sufficiently evident
                    that his scruples had no reference to the essential doctrines of Christianity.
                    Reconciling himself to the more humble avocations of a parochial schoolmaster,
                    he for a considerable number of years taught the schools of Monificth in his
                    native county, and of Kennoway and Falkland in the county of Fife. He was
                    afterwards appointed master of the grammar school of Stirling; and this office,
                    as a late writer remarks, he discharged for forty years with the greatest
                    ability, and with the respect and esteem of all who knew him.</p>
                <p>His accomplishments, not only as a classical scholar, but as a man of general
                    erudition, procured him no mean reputation long before he was known as an
                    author. Of his extensive knowledge of languages, the earliest specimen which he
                    imparted to the public is to be found in about twenty pages of annotations on
                    the Gaberlunzie-man, inserted in an edition published by his learned friend and
                    neighbour Mr Callander.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    terms: “For the following elucidations of the general principles laid down in
                    the preface, and exemplified in the notes on the foregoing ballad, the public
                    and I are indebted to a learned and worthy friend of the author, ŵhose extensive
                    erudition is only equalled by the modesty and candour conspicuous in his whole
                    deportment. I am sure our learned readers will regret with me, that he has not
                    pushed his researches further than he has done. But from the little he has here
                    given us, the general principles of etymology I have endeavoured to establish
                    will derive new force, and our readers new entertainment.” Although his learning
                    did not procure him any academical preferment, it at least procured him a due
                    share of academical honours. On the same day he received a diploma of A. Μ. from
                    St Andrews, and another of LL. D. from Glasgow <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>After an interval of ten years, he published “Two Letters on the Savage State,
                    addressed to the late Lord Kaims.” Lond, 1792, 8vo. This work, which consists of
                    157 crown pages, is dedicated to Dr Horne, bishop of Norwich, and is introduced
                    by a preface written by the author’s friend Dr Gleig, a learned episcopalian
                    clergyman of Stirling. The first letter, written in 1775, was sent to Lord
                    Kames, who was passing his Christmas vacation at Blair-Drummond, and who was
                    much struck with the learning and ability of lìis anonymous correspondent.
                    Having without much difficulty detected the author, he invited him to dine with
                    him next day; when they met and parted with mutual satisfaction, but with no
                    abatement of the confidence of either party in the correctness of his own views
                    as to the primitive condition of the human race. After a very copious and free
                    discussion of the savage state, each of the disputants retained his own opinion;
                    but they nevertheless laid the foundation of a cordial friendship, which
                    continued uninterrupted during the lifetime of the judge, who survived till the
                    year 1782. It was scarcely to be anticipated that his lordship should abandon
                    the favourite paradox which pervades his Sketches of the History of Man; namely,
                    that the tribes of mankind were originally placed in the condition of savages,
                    from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324331" xml:id="kp-eb0708-4331-0092"/>which
                    they were enabled to emerge by the slow and gradual operation of certain
                    instinctive principles implanted in their nature. This was a paradox which he
                    did not himself devise, but which had already been exhibited in a variety of
                    shapes by Condillac, Rousseau, Hume, Smith, Monboddo, and divers other
                    speculators. Some of these lovers of wisdom delight in representing the human
                    species as very closely allied to what we venture to describe as the lower
                    animals; and whether the remote ancestors of men were not downright monkies, or
                    at least ourang-outangs, they feel a very philosophical degree of hesitation in
                    deciding. Rousseau is much inclined to doubt whether certain animals resembling
                    the human species, but by travellers supposed to be beasts, either on account of
                    some difference in their external formation, or merely on account of their
                    wanting the faculty of speech, are not in reality savage men, whose race being
                    anciently dispersed in the forests, had never had occasion to develope any of
                    the virtual faculties, had never attained to any degree of perfection, and
                    therefore still continued in the primitive state of nature. A shaggy skin and a
                    long tail he did not consider as infallible marks of distinction between one
                    race of beings and another. If such individuals as Montesquieu, Buffon, Diderot,
                    Duclos, d’Alembert, or Condillac, had appeared in the capacity of travellers
                    into unknown regions, he would have been disposed to listen to them when they
                    affirmed that one animal was a man, and another a beast; but he considers it as
                    a piece of great simplicity to leave such a matter to the decision of stupid
                    travellers, in relation to whom one might sometimes be tempted to raise a
                    question similar to that which they take upon themselves to determine in the
                    case of other animals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    affirmeront d’un tel animal que c’est un homme, et d’un autre que c’est une

                    fois tente' de faire la même question qu’ils se mêlent de résoudre sur d’autres
                    animaux.”</p></note> The philosophers of this school are clearly of opinion that
                    man, however created, was left to his own unaided exertions in the formation of
                    an articulate language; but they are so intimately acquainted with the texture
                    of human thought, that they find no difficulty in explaining the entire process
                    which he must have followed. Dr Smith has ascertained that “the institution of
                    nouns substantive” must have been one of the first steps towards the formation
                    of language; and by another philosopher the geography of language is adjusted in
                    a manner not less satisfactory; Rousseau thinks it highly probable that
                    articulate speech must have taken its rise in islands, and must there have been
                    carried to perfection before it was known on the continent.</p>
                <p>Dr Doig was of opinion that “had all mankind, without exception, been once in a
                    state of absolute savagism, they would not only have continued in that state,
                    but would have still sunk lower and lower, till they had at last, in a manner,
                    put off the character of humanity, and degraded themselves to the level of the
                    beasts that perish.” All the learning, religion, laws, arts, and sciences, and
                    other improvements that have enlightened Europe, a great part of Asia, and the
                    northern coast of Africa, were so many rays diverging from two points, on the
                    banks of the Euphrates and the Nile. In proportion as nations receded from these
                    two sources of humanity and civilization, in the same proportion were they more
                    and more immersed in ignorance and barbarism. “I think it obvious, beyond all
                    possibility of contradiction,” he adds, “that all those nations, and societies
                    of men which were removed to a considerable distance from the grand sources of
                    civilization above-mentioned, had early degenerated into a state of savagism;
                    that this degeneracy encreased exactly in proportion to their distance from
                    those two points; that none of those nations who are known to have sunk into
                    that state, ever became civilized, till they had renewed their correspondence
                    with nations, or individuals, who had derived light and knowledge from the
                    oriental sources;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>
                    Relative to the barbarism and civilization of Greece, the following passage
                    occurs in the work of a very ancient philosopher : ∏aλ- aax∣s yap κaι γtγovt ×aι

                    1688.)</p></note> that previous to the opening of this correspondence, no one
                    <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> people discovered the least propension or. tendency
                    towards culture and civilization; that, consequently, had all mankind been, at
                    any one period, absolute savages, they would have continued in that unhappy
                    state as long as the world existed; that if this train of reasoning should
                    happen to be just, there must always have existed, in some part of the globe, a
                    select society, a civilized race of men, among whom the knoavledge of arts and
                    sciences was always preserved, and from whom the blessings of civilization, and
                    a cultivated state of life, were, in process of time, propagated to all the
                    other nations, which at this day enjoy these invaluable benefits.” This
                    reasoning, supported with much ingenuity and learning, directly leads to the
                    conclusion, which he leaves the reader to draw for himself, that the scriptural
                    account of the primeval history of the human race is much more consonant with
                    the principles of sound philosophy, than the account devised by the united
                    wisdom of modern philosophers.</p>
                <p>His next publication, which is of a very different description, bears the

                    the shade of Wallace addressing King Robert the night before the battle of
                    Bannockburn. The hero mentioned in the first verse is Sir John Graham.</p>

                    tyrant sends.</p>
                <p>These are the only works which Dr Doig published in a separate form. For the
                    reputation of authorship he appears to have felt no particular ambition: he was
                    however an indefatigable student, and wrote many tracts which were never
                    printed, which he probably had no intention of printing. He wrote an elaborate
                    dissertation <hi rend="italic">On the Ancient Hellenes,</hi> which appeared in
                    the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. iii. He afterwards
                    prosecuted the same subject, and transmitted his manuscript to one of the
                    secretaries of the society; but on the decease of that gentleman, no vestige of
                    it could be found among his papers. His contributions to the third edition of
                    the present work, and particularly the article <hi rend="italic">Philology,</hi>
                    exhibit the most conspicuous monument of his erudition. In the articles <hi
                    rend="italic">Mysteries</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mythology,</hi> although they
                    bear marks of the same hand, he has not taken so wide a range; but the article
                    <hi rend="italic">Philology</hi> is a long and elaborate treatise, distinguished
                    by ingenuity as well as learning. “In addition,” says Lord Woodhousclee, “to the
                    most profound knowledge of the Greek and Latin languages, which he wrote with a
                    classical purity, Dr Doig had successfully studied the Hebrew, Arabic, and other
                    kindred dialects, and was deeply versed in Oriental literature.” Of this
                    variegated knowledge he has fully availed himself in his treatise on Philology.

                    struck with the coincidence of Dr Doig’s opinions on many points with his own,
                    that he began an epistolary correspondence with the author; and these two
                    eminent scholars went hand in hand in their researches, and in a free
                    communication of their opinions, with a liberality of sentiment which did honour
                    to both. Such likewise was the conduct of the learned Mr Bryant, who had entered
                    into a correspondence with Dr Doig on the subject of ancient mythology.”<note

                <p>Dr Doig, who was married and left descendants, died on the 16th of March 1800, at
                    the mature age of eighty-one. The following epitaph, written by himself, has
                    been engraved on a marble monument erected to his memory by the town of
                    Stirling, where he was respected for his worth, and admired for his
                    learning:</p>

                    to the erection of a monument to the memory of Buchanan.</p>
