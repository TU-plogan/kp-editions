                    Viscount</hi></label>, an illustrious naval commander, the second son of
                    Alexander Duncan, of Lundie, in the county of Angus, Scotland, by Helen,
                    daughter of Haldane of Gleneagles, in the county of Perth, was born in the month
                    of July 1731. He received the rudiments of his education at Dundee, which is
                    only about four miles distant from the family residence; and as his elder
                    brother Alexander was designed for the army (in which he died lieutenant-colonel
                    in 1771), Adam appears to have been early intended for the naval service.
                    Accordingly, about the year 1746, he was placed under Captain Haldane, who then
                    commanded the Shoreham frigate, and he remained two or three years with that
                    officer. In 1749 he was entered as midshipman on board the Centurion of fifty
                    guns, which then bore the broad pendant of Commodore Keppel, commander-in-chief
                    on the Mediterranean station. In the beginning of 1755 he was promoted to the
                    rank of lieutenant, and appointed to the Norwich, a fourth rate, one of the
                    squadron under Keppel, destined to convoy to America the transports having on
                    board the land forces commanded by General Braddock. After the debarkation of
                    this armament he was transferred to the Centurion, where he continued until that
                    ship returned to England; when Captain Keppel, who had for a short time
                    commanded the Swiftsure, procured his appointment as second lieutenant of the
                    Torbay seventy-four, to which he himself had just been appointed. Having
                    remained on the home station for three years, he proceeded with the expedition
                    sent against-the French settlement of Goree, on the coast of Africa, and was
                    slightly wounded in the attack of the fort, after which he became first
                    lieutenant of the Torbay, and in this capacity returned to England. His
                    promotion was now rapid. In September 1759 he was raised to the rank of
                    commander; in February 1761 he was advanced to that of post-captain; and having
                    been appointed to the Vaillant, of seventy-four guns, he again became connected
                    in service with his original friend and patron Keppel, who, having received the
                    command of the naval part of the expedition against Belleisle, now hoisted his
                    broad pendant on board the Vaillant. After this affair Captain Duncan
                    accompanied the commodore in the same ship to the attack of the Havanna, and
                    commanded the boats in which the troops were landed, the commodore covering the
                    disembarkation. He was afterwards very actively employed in the siege, during
                    which he greatly distinguished himself; and when the town surrendered, he was
                    dispatched to take possession of the Spanish ships in the harbour, being five of
                    seventy and four of sixty guns.</p>

                <p>After the capture of the Havanna, he, in the same capacity ’ as formerly,
                    accompanied Admiral Keppel, who had been appointed to the command on the Jamaica
                    station, and continued with him as captain of the flag-ship until the conclusion
                    of the war, when he returned to England.</p>
                <p>On the recommencement of war with France in the year 1778, Captain Duncan was
                    appointed to the Suffolk, of seventy-four guns; but before the end of the year
                    he was removed into the Monarch, of the same rate, which, during the summer of
                    1779, was employed in the Channel fleet under Sir Charles Hardy, who, owing to
                    the junction of the French and Spanish fleets, was now acting upon the
                    defensive. Towards the close of the same year, the Monarch was one of the ships
                    placed under the orders of Sir George Bridges Rodney, who had received
                    instructions to force his way through all impediments into Gibraltar, and to
                    relieve that fortress, then closely invested by a Spanish army on the land side,
                    whilst it was blockaded on the seaward face by a flotilla sufficiently powerful
                    to oppose the entrance of any ordinary force. In the beginning of 1780, the
                    British fleet, when off Cape St Vincent, fell in with a Spanish squadron under
                    Don Juan de Langara, which had been stationed there to intercept Sir George
                    Rodney, who was supposed to have only a squadron of four sail of the line. On
                    this occasion Captain Duncan carried the Monarch into action before any other
                    ship of the fleet; and the St Augustin, of seventy guns, struck to him, after ·
                    having been so much disabled that he was obliged to abandon her. In this action
                    the disparity of force was great; the British fleet consisting of nineteen ships
                    of the line, and the Spanish of only eleven ships and two frigates. Of the
                    latter, four were taken, one was blown up, three surrendered, but afterwards got
                    away much damaged, one was reduced almost to a wreck, and two others, together
                    with the frigates, made their escape. Soon after his arrival in England Captain
                    Duncan quitted the Monarch, and remained without employment until the beginning
                    of 1780, when he was appointed to the Blenheim, of ninety guns, and continued in
                    command of this ship during nearly the whole remainder of the war. He was
                    constantly employed with the Channel fleet, then under the command of Earl Howe;
                    and in September 1780, having accompanied his lordship to Gibraltar, he was
                    appointed to lead the larboard division of the centre, or squadron of the
                    commander-in-chief, and greatly distinguished himself in the encounter with the
                    combined fleets of France and Spain, which took place off the entrance of the
                    Straits. Soon after the return of the fleet to England Captain Duncan was
                    removed into the Foudroyant, of eighty-four guns; and on the conclusion of the
                    peace in the spring ensuing he passed into the Edgar, of seventy-four guns, one
                    of the guard ships at Portsmouth, where, as is customary in such cases, he
                    continued in command during the three succeeding years.</p>
                <p>This was the last commission which he ever held as captain of a ship. In
                    September 1789 he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, and in
                    September 1790 he was made rear-admiral of the white; in February 1793 lie was
                    raised to be vice-admiral of the blue, and in April 1794 he became vice-admiral
                    of the white; in June 1795 he was appointed admiral of the blue; and lastly, in
                    February 1799 he received the rank of admiral of the white. But during all these
                    periods, excepting the two last, the merit of Admiral Duncan, which was never of
                    an obtrusive, bustling, or forward kind, seemed to have been wholly overlooked;
                    and though he frequently solicited employment, his applications proved
                    unavailing; in consequence of which he had it in contemplation to retire
                    altogether from the service. This period of obscuration, however, at length
                    passed away. In February 1795 he received an appointment, constituting him
                    commander-in-chief of the North Seas, that is, from the North Foreland to the
                    Ultima Thule; and he accordingly hoisted his flag on board the Prince George, of
                    ninety-eight guns, at Chatham, but afterwards shifted it to the Venerable, of
                    seventy-four guns, the Prince George being considered as too large for the
                    particular quarter in which he was destined to act. Having thus attained the
                    object of his wishes, Admiral Duncan lost no time in proceeding to carry into
                    execution the important trust which had been confided to him; and during the
                    whole time he held the command, he exhibited that inexhaustible patience and
                    unwearied constancy, which, with cool judgment and determined gallantry, formed
                    the great attributes of his professional character. In the midst of many
                    discouragements, and on a station exposed to peculiar dangers from the shoals
                    ar.d sand-banks which cover the coasts of the United Provinces, and the storms
                    with which the North Sea is frequently visited, he never shrunk from the duty
                    which had been assigned him, or failed at any season, however tempestuous, to
                    show his squadron off the coast which it domineered over and insulted.</p>
                <p>For more than two years, however, nothing occurred beyond the ordinary routine of
                    such a service; namely, occasional captures, and smart affairs with the coast
                    batteries and the craft which took shelter under their guns. The Dutch trade,
                    however, was nearly annihilated; their merchant-vessels were frequently captured
                    in sight of their own ports; and the whole coast was so completely blockaded
                    that few vessels could venture out to sea, and escape the vigilance of the
                    British fleet or its cruisers. The Batavian fleet, though consisting of five
                    sail of the line, six frigates, and five sloops, was also obliged to remain
                    quietly in port, or to confine itself to short cruises, at times when want of
                    water or provisions compelled the British ships to repair for a few days to
                    their own coasts; and in the beginning of June 1797, it even suffered itself to
                    be blocked up in port, although for several days Admiral Duncan’s force was
                    limited to his own ship the Venerable, of seventy-four guns, and the Adamant, of
                    fifty. This was owing to the unhappy and dangerous spirit of mutiny which at
                    that period had infected in succession almost every portion of the British navy.
                    It first broke out amongst the ships at Portsmouth, then extended itself to the
                    fleet at the Nore, and afterwards reached the North-Sea fleet, in which almost
                    every ship hoisted the flag of defiance. At this alarming and unprecedented
                    crisis, the conduct of Admiral Duncan proved him to be equal to the fearful
                    exigencies of the occasion, and perhaps contributed more to the safety and true
                    glory of the country than even his subsequent victory. Although by the secession
                    of the disaffected ships his fleet had been so thinned that, towards the end of
                    May 1797, he found himself at sea with only his own ship and another, he
                    nevertheless proceeded to his usual station off the Texel,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the 3d of June 1797, Admiral Duncan having
                    assembled the officers, seamen, and marines of his own ship (the Venerable),
                    addressed them from the quarter-deck as follows :—“My lads, I once more call you
                    together with a sorrowful heart, from what I have lately seen of the
                    disaffection of the fleets; I call it <hi rend="italic">disaffection,</hi> for
                    the crews have no <hi rend="italic">grievances.</hi> To be deserted by my fleet
                    in the face of an enemy, is a disgrace which I believe never before happened to
                    a British admiral; nor could I have supposed it. My greatest comfort, under God,
                    is, that I have been supported by the officers, seamen, and marines of this
                    ship; for which, with a heart overflowing with gratitude, I request you to
                    accept my sincere thanks. I flatter myself, much good may result from your
                    example, by bringing those deluded people to a sense of the duty which they owe,
                    not only to their king and country, but to themselves. The <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0708-6736-0277" xml:id="pbn7277"/> British navy has ever been the
                    support of that liberty which has been handed down to us by our ancestors, and
                    which, I trust, we shall maintain to the latest posterity, and that can only be
                    done by unanimity and obedience. The ship’s company, and others who have
                    distinguished themselves by their loyalty and good order, deserve to be, and
                    doubtless will be, the favourites of a grateful country; they will also have,
                    from their individual feelings, a comfort which must be lasting, and not like
                    the fleeting and false confidence of those who have swerved from their duty. It
                    has often been my pride with you to look into the Texel, and see a foe which
                    dreaded coming out to meet us. My pride is now humble indeed. My feelings are
                    not easily to be expressed. Our cup has overflowed, and made us wanton. The
                    all-wise Providence has given us this check as a warning, and I hope we shall
                    improve by it. On Him, then, let us trust, where our only security can be found.
                    I find there are many good men among us: for my own part, I have had full
                    confidence of all in this ship, and once more beg to express my admiration of
                    your conduct. May God, who has thus far conducted you, continue to do so; and
                    may the British navy, the glory and support of our country, be restored to its
                    wonted splendour, and be not only the bulwark of Britain, but the terror of the
                    world. But this can only be effected by a strict adherence to our duty and
                    obedience; and let us pray that the Almighty God may keep us in the right way of
                    thinking. God bless you all.” If this speech has but little to recommend it on
                    the score of rhetoric, it has qualities of a nobler kind to compensate for the
                    want of the graces of diction or oratory: it is indeed affecting and impressive
                    in a very high degree; and it is recorded that, among the crew of the Venerable
                    who listened to it, there was not a dry eye when the good admiral had concluded
                    his address.</p></note> where <pb corresp="pbn7277" facs="nls:193326736"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-6736-0277"/>there lay at anchor the Dutch fleet of fifteen
                    sail of the line, under the command of Vice-Admiral de Winter; and in order to
                    detain the latter in port until a reinforcement should arrive, he caused
                    repeated signals to be made, as if to the main body of his fleet in the offing;
                    a stratagem which, it was supposed, had the desired effect. At length, about the
                    middle of June, several line-of-battle ships, in detached portions, joined the
                    British admiral, and in a short time thereafter the two fleets were again placed
                    on an equal footing.</p>
                <p>But the Venerable having been upwards of eighteen weeks at sea, and during part
                    of that time exposed to boisterous weather, was now in want of almost every
                    description of stores; whilst others of the ships had also suffered by the
                    recent gales, and were besides short of provisions. In these circumstances, the
                    admiral, on the 3d of October, put into Yarmouth roads in order to refit and
                    revictual; having left off the Dutch coast a small squadron of observation under
                    the orders of Captain Trollope of the Russell. But early on the morning of the
                    9th, the Black Joke hired armed lugger showed herself at the back of Yarmouth
                    sands with the signal for an enemy flying at her mast-head. Immediately all was
                    bustle and preparation, and, by incredible exertions, Admiral Duncan, with
                    eleven sail of the line, was enabled, a little before noon, to weigh and put to
                    sea; directing his course with a fair wind right across to his old station. On
                    the following day, the Powerful, Agincourt, and Isis joined, and on the
                    afternoon of the llt’n the advanced ships were near enough to count twenty-two
                    sail of square-rigged vessels at anchor in the Texel. Meanwhile the admiral
                    having received from Captain Trollope information of the course the enemy’s
                    fleet was steering, now stood along shore to the southward. At about seven on
                    the morning of the 12th, the Russell, Adamant, and Beaulieu were descried in the
                    south-west, bearing at their mast-heads the signal of an enemy in sight to the
                    leeward; and about half-past eight, a strange fleet, consisting of twenty-one
                    ships and four brigs, made its appearance in the quarter pointed out by the
                    signal.</p>
                <p>This was the Dutch fleet, under Vice-Admiral de Winter, consisting of four
                    seventy-fours, seven sixty-fours, four fifty gun ships, two forty-four gun
                    frigates, two of thirty-two guns, two corvettes, four brigs, sloops, and two
                    adviceboats, all which had quitted the Texel at ten o’clock in the morning of
                    the 10th, with a light breeze at east and by north. As soon as Admiral de Winter
                    had learned that the British fleet was approaching, he recalled some ships which
                    he had previously detached, and edged away with the wind at north-west, towards
                    Camperdown, the appointed place of rendezvous. At daylight on the 11 th, the
                    Dutch fleet was about nine leagues off the village of Schevenningen, in loose
                    order; but on receiving additional information, Admiral de Winter ordered his
                    captains to their respective stations, and, to facilitate the junction of the
                    ships to leeward, stood towards the land. On the Wy-kerdens bearing east,
                    distant about four leagues, the Dutch fleet hauled to the wind on the starboard
                    tack, and shortly afterwards discovered the British fleet in the
                    north-north-west; upon which it put about, and as soon as a close line was
                    formed, with frigates and other smaller vessels opposite the openings, the Dutch
                    ships throwing their main-top-sails aback, resolutely awaited the approach of
                    the British.</p>
                <p>When the Dutch appeared in sight, the British fleet was, owing to the inequality
                    of the ships in point of sailing, in very loose order. To connect the squadron,
                    therefore, and enable the heavy-sailing ships to take their allotted stations,
                    the admiral made the signal to shorten sail, and bring to on the starboard tack;
                    but observing, soon afterwards, that the Dutch ships were drawing fast in shore,
                    and finding there was no time to be lost in making the attack, he made the
                    signals to bear up, break the enemy’s line, and engage them to leeward, each
                    ship her opponent, and also for the van to attack the enemy’s rear. In his
                    dispatch the admiral states that his signals were obeyed with the greatest
                    promptitude; but it has been asserted that, owing to the thickness of the
                    weather, the signal to pass through the enemy’s line and engage him to leeward
                    was not generally understood during the short time it was displayed, and that
                    hence some uncertainty prevailed in the fleet as to the precise mode of attack.
                    In fact, the admiral perceived that if he waited to form line, there would be no
                    action; and, with equal judgment and boldness, he dispensed with this
                    preliminary arrangement, and notwithstanding the still disunited state of the
                    ships, he hurried them into action as fast as possible. The signal above
                    mentioned was replaced by that for close action, which continued flying for an
                    hour and a half, until it was shot away by the enemy. This signal could not
                    possibly be mistaken.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The following anecdote, which is told by Admiral Sir Charles Ekins <hi
                    rend="italic">(Naval Battles,</hi> p. 236), shows that the instinct of true
                    valour sometimes supplies the place of knowledge, if not of genius. Captain
                    Inglis of the Belliqueux, sixty-four guns, owing either to long absence from
                    active service, or an inaptitude for the subject sometimes apparent in naval
                    officers, had neglected to make himself competently master of the signal-book;
                    and hence, on the morning of the day of battle, when it became necessary to act
                    with promptitude, in obedience to the signals, he found himself more puzzled
                    than enlightened by it; so, throwing it -with contempt upon the deck, he
                    exclaimed in broad Scotch, “Damn me, up wi’ the hellem, an’ into the middle
                    o’t.” In this manner he bravely anticipated the remedy in such cases provided by
                    the illustrious Nelson, who, in his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Memorandum</hi>
                    on the eve of the battle of Trafalgar, observed, that “if a captain should be at
                    a loss, he would not do <hi rend="italic">very wrong</hi> if he laid his ship
                    alongside of the enemy.” In strict conformity with this doctrine, the Belliqueux
                    was carried by her brave and honest captain into the very thickest of the fight,
                    and got very roughly handled by the van of the enemy.</p></note></p>
                <p>About forty minutes past twelve o’clock (12th October) <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193326749" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6749-0278"/>the action commenced, when
                    Vice-Admiral Onslow in the Monarch, which led the advanced or larboard division
                    of the British fleet, cut through the Dutch line between the Haerlem and
                    Jupiter, pouring into each in passing a well-directed broadside; and then
                    leaving the Haerlem to the Powerful, luffed up alongside of the Jupiter, upon
                    which the two ships became warmly engaged. In rounding, the Monarch received the
                    raking fire of the Monnikendam frigate and the Atalanta brig, stationed in the
                    rear or second line. The remaining ships of the larboard division, particularly
                    the Monmouth and Russell, were soon in action with those of the enemy’s rear;
                    amongst which the last to surrender was the Jupiter, which had been first
                    engaged. About twenty minutes after the Monarch had passed through the Dutch
                    line, the Venerable, frustrated in her attempt to pass astern of the Vryheid, by
                    the promptness of the States-General in closing up the interval, ran under the
                    stern of the latter, and soon compelled her to bear up; whilst the Triumph,
                    theVenerable’s second astern, found immediate employment for the Wassemaer, the
                    second astern of the States-General. In the meanwhile the Venerable had ranged
                    up close on the lee-side of the Vryheid, with which, on the opposite side, the
                    Ardent was also warmly engaged, and, in front, the Bedford, as she cut through
                    the enemy’s line astern of the Gelykheid. The Brutus, Leyden, and Mars, not
                    being pressed by opponents, advanced to the assistance of their admiral, and did
                    considerable damage to the Venerable, Ardent, and other ships of the British
                    van. At this time the Hercules, having caught fire on the poop, bore up out of
                    the line, and came drifting near the Venerable to leeward; but although the
                    Dutch crew contrived to extinguish the flames, yet having thrown their powder
                    overboard, they were compelled to surrender their ship to the nearest opponent.
                    The Venerable, which had sustained serious damage, was now obliged to haul off,
                    and to wear round on the starboard tack. As soon as this was observed, the
                    Triumph, which had compelled the Wassemaer to strike her colours, approached to
                    give the finishing blow to the Vryheid, which still persisted in defending
                    herself. At length, from the united fire of the Venerable, Triumph, Ardent, and
                    Director, the three masts of the gallant ship fell over her side, and disabled
                    her starboard guns; upon which the Vryheid dropped out of the line an
                    ungovernable hulk, and then struck her colours. With the surrender of De
                    Winter’s ship the action ceased, and the British found themselves in possession
                    of the Vryheid and Jupiter, seventy-fours; Devries, Gelykheid, Haerlem,
                    Hercules, and Wassemaer, sixty-fours; Alkmaar and Delft, fifties; and the
                    frigates Monnikendam and Ambuscade. The victors then hastened to secure their
                    prizes, in order that, before night-fall, they might get clear of the shore.</p>
                <p>This battle presented on both sides the singular spectacle of heroic courage and
                    determined perseverance, contrasted with conduct little, if at all, short of
                    downright cowardice or disaffection; and from first to last the opposing forces
                    were, from various causes, pretty nearly equal. Seven Dutch line-of-battle ships
                    quitted the action in order to return home, and nearly as many British seem
                    scarcely to have entered it. The actual combatants, however, maintained the
                    strife with fierce, unflinching valour; and hence the loss on both sides was
                    proportionally severe. That of the British amounted to 203 killed and 622
                    wounded, while the Dutch had 540 killed and 620 wounded. During the action the
                    latter directed their shot solely at the hulls of their adversaries, and this
                    not until they were so near that scarcely any aim could miss; which accounts for
                    the unusual severity of the loss sustained. On the other hand, the captured
                    ships were all either dismasted outright, or so injured in their masts that most
                    of these fell in the passage hotne; whilst as to their hulls, they were
                    completely riddled, and only worth bringing into port as trophies of the
                    victory.</p>
                <p>If any proof were wanting of the superior efficacy of Admiral Duncan’s mode of
                    attack, it would be found, first, in a manly declaration made by the gallant
                    Dutchman, and, secondly, in the practical testimony to its excellence borne by
                    Lord Nelson. “Your not waiting to form a line,” said De Winter to Admiral
                    Duncan, “ruined me; if I had got nearer the shore, and you had attacked, I
                    should probably have drawn both fleets on it, and it would have been a victory
                    to me, being on my own coast.” And after the battle of the Nile, Nelson,
                    although unacquainted with Lord Duncan, wrote his lordship to tell him how he,
                    Nelson, “had profited by his example.” Besides, the British squadron was
                    composed of very indifferent and inadequate ships; many of them having been
                    intended for Indiamen, and otherwise ill conditioned and deficient. Had Lord
                    Duncan’s fleet been composed of the same materials as Lord St Vincent’s, every
                    Dutch ship would have been taken; and had all the ships imitated the example of
                    their chief, the same result must have followed. Few people are aware of the
                    merits of the chief on that memorable day. When the action ceased, the ships
                    were in nine fathoms water, within five miles of a lee shore, with every
                    appearance of the gale which followed; a situation as critical as it is possible
                    to imagine. And it should also be recollected, that when the Dutch put to sea,
                    the admiral had only been two days in port, after a blockade of nineteen weeks.
                    It was the opinion of Lord Duncan that, upon such occasions, the
                    commander-in-chief should hoist his flag on board of a frigate; and he stated
                    that, if he should ever fight another battle, he would certainly do so. He was
                    often heard to declare that, if his flag had been flying on board of a frigate
                    in this action, not one of the Dutch fleet would have escaped.</p>
                <p>No victory was ever more seasonable, none more gratifying to the nation, than
                    that of Camperdown. Politicians beheld in it the annihilation of the marine of
                    Holland, long our most formidable rival on the seas; naval men admired the
                    promptitude, decision, and address displayed by the admiral in approaching to
                    the attack, in circumstances altogether unprecedented; and the people at large
                    were transported with admiration and delight, though they did not very well know
                    why. Hence the honours which were immediately conferred on the admiral received
                    the approbation of all parties. On the 21st of October he was created Lord
                    Viscount Duncan of Camperdown, and Baron Duncan of Lundie, in the county of
                    Angus; his second in command, Vice-Admiral Onslow, was made a baronet;gold
                    medals were struck and presented to the flag officers and captains; and the
                    thanks of parliament were voted to the fleet. A pension of L.2000 per annum was
                    likewise granted to Lord Duncan for his own life, with remainder to the two next
                    heirs of the peerage.</p>
                <p>After the victory of Camperdown, Lord Duncan continued to hold the same command
                    until the commencement of 1800, when, being advanced in years, he withdrew from
                    the service, and passed the remainder of his life in retirement, chiefly at his
                    patrimonial residence. At the period of his death, however, which happened on
                    the 4th August 1804, he was, we believe, about to be recalled into active
                    service; and he had signified his determination to obey the call of his country
                    at a season of unexampled difficulty and danger, when his career was terminated
                    for ever by a sudden and fatal illness. In June 1777 he had married Henrietta,
                    daughter of the Right Honourable Robert Dundas, lord president of the Court of
                    Session in Scotland, and father of Lord Viscount Melville; and by this lady he
                    had a large family. Lord Duncan was sueceeded<pb break="no" facs="nls:193326762"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-6762-0279"/> in his titles and estate by his second son,
                    Robert, now Earl of Camperdown.</p>
                <p>Lord Duncan was a man as remarkable in appearance as he was distinguished for
                    character and worth. In person he was of a colossal and athletic form, six feet
                    four inches in height, erect in his carriage, and, notwithstanding his great
                    size, graceful in his movements, with a countenance strongly expressive of
                    intelligence and benevolence. In him, singular meekness of disposition, extreme
                    modesty in all that concerned himself, and the most unaffected dignity of mind,
                    were blended with genuine spirit, high professional genius, vigorous and active
                    wisdom, singular alacrity and ability for performing great achievements, and a
                    decided indifference about success, excepting in as far as it might contribute
                    to advance the good of his country. His private character was that of a man most
                    exemplary in all the social relations of life; an affectionate relative, a
                    steady friend, and a pattern of virtue and true piety. Lord Duncan was a most
                    sincere and devout Christian, nor did he ever lose sight of the duties belonging
                    to that character. He encouraged religion by his own practice, and, wherever he
                    held a command, caused the public observance of it to be maintained. Immediately
                    after the victory, which has immortalized his name, was decided, he ordered the
                    crew of his ship to be called together, and, at their head, upon his bended
                    knees, in the presence of the Dutch admiral, who was greatly affected with the
                    scene, he solemnly offered up praise and thanksgiving to the God of battles for
                    having crowned with success the arms of his country. In like manner, when all
                    eyes were upon him, in the cathedral of St Paul’s, on the day of general
                    thanksgiving, in December following, his demeanour was so humble and devout, as
                    not only to increase the admiration which his services had otherwise gained him,
                    but to impress on all present a sense of the real dignity as well as importance
                    of religion. In a word, Lord Duncan afforded a conspicuous instance of the truth
                    of the remark, that piety and true courage are naturally allied, and that death
                    loses its terrors to those who have placed their hope beyond it. (Collins’s <hi
