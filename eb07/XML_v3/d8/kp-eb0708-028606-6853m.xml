                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">DUPUIS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Francis</hi></label>, an
                    eminent French writer, and member of the Institute, was born of poor parents, at
                    Tryé-Château, between Gisors and Chaumont, on the 26th of October 1742. His
                    father, who was a teacher, instructed him in mathematics and land-surveying. The
                    Duke de la Rochefoucault, who accidentally became acquainted with the youth,
                    took him under his protection, and gave him a bursary or exhibition in the
                    College of Harcourt.</p>
                <p>Dupuis made such rapid progress in his studies, that, at the age of twenty-four,
                    he was appointed professor of rhetoric at the college of Lisieux. In his hours
                    of leisure he applied himself to the study of the law, and on the 11th of August
                    1770 he was admitted an advocate before the parliament. He was charged by the
                    rector of the university with the task of delivering the customary discourse at
                    the distribution of prizes; and he was also employed in the name of the
                    university to compose the funeral oration of the Empress Maria Theresa of
                    Austria. These two works having been printed, were admired on account of their
                    elegant latinity, and laid the foundation of the author’s fame as a writer.</p>
                <p>The mathematics having been the object of his early studies, he now devoted his
                    more serious attention to that science; and for some years he attended the
                    astronomical lectures of Lalande, with whom he formed an intimate friendship. In
                    1778 he constructed a telegraph on the principle suggested by Amontons; and he
                    succeeded so well, that he was enabled to correspond with bis friend Μ. Fortin,
                    who, from the village of Bagneux, where he had a country seat, observed with a
                    telescope the signals made by Dupuis at Belleville, and returned his answer on
                    the following day. In this manner they continued to correspond every year,
                    during the fine season, from 1778 to the commencement of the Revolution. Dupuis
                    then destroyed his machine, lest it should render him suspected in those
                    dangerous times.</p>
                <p>Much about the same time, Dupuis formed his ingenious theory with respect to the
                    origin of the Greek months. In the course of his investigations upon this
                    subject, he composed a long memoir on the constellations. He had been struck
                    with the singularity of the figures by which the groups of stars called
                    constellations were represented on the most ancient planispheres; and had also
                    remarked that these groups did not present to the eye any form analogous to
                    their representations. Hence he concluded, that the real configurations of these
                    constellations, or asterisms, could not have been the origin of the figures and
                    of the names which had been given to them from the highest antiquity. Dupuis
                    attempted to resolve this enigma, in so far at least as related to the
                    constellations of the zodiac. He conceived that this representation of the
                    heavens during the course of the year must have some reference to the state of
                    the earth, and to the labours of agriculture at the time, and in the country, in
                    which these signs had been invented; so that the zodiac was, for the people who
                    invented it, a sort of calendar at once astronomical and rural. It seemed only
                    necessary, therefore, to discover the clime and the period in which the
                    constellation of <hi rend="italic">Capricon</hi> must have arisen with the sun
                    on the day of the summer solstice, and the vernal equinox must have occurred
                    under <hi rend="italic">Libra.</hi> It appeared to Dupuis that this clime was
                    Egypt, and that the perfect correspondence between the signs and their
                    significations had existed in that country for a period of between fifteen and
                    sixteen thousand years before the present time; that it had existed only there;
                    and thst this harmony had been disturbed by the effect of the precession of the
                    equinoxes. He therefore ascribed the invention of the signs of the zodiac to the
                    people who then inhabited Upper Egypt or Ethiopia. This was the basis on which
                    Dupuis established his mythological system, and endeavoured to explain the
                    curious subject of fabulous history, and the whole system of the theogony and
                    theology of the ancients.</p>
                <p>Persuaded of the importance of his discoveries, which, however, were by no means
                    entirely original, Dupuis published several detached parts of his system in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savants</hi> for the months of June, October, and
                    December 1777, and of February 1781, which he afterwards collected and
                    published, first in Lalande’s <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> and then in a
                    separate volume in 4to, 1781, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alemoire</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Origine des</hi><hi rend="italic">Constellations,</hi><hi

                    The theory propounded in this memoir was refuted by Μ. Bailly, in the fifth
                    volume of his <hi rend="italic">History of Astronomy</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but, at the same time, with a just acknowledgment of the erudition and
                    ingenuity exhibited by the author.</p>
                <p>Condorcet proposed Dupuis to Frederick the Great of Prussia as a fit person to
                    succeed Thiebault in the professorship of literature at Berlin; and Dupuis had
                    accepted the invitation, when the death of the king put an end to the
                    engagement. The chair of humanity in the college of France having at the same
                    time become vacant by the death of Μ. Bejot, it was conferred on Dupuis; and in
                    1788 he became a member of the Academy of Inscriptions. He now resigned his
                    professorship at Lisieux, and was appointed by the administrators of the
                    department of Paris one of the four commissioners of public instruction.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of the revolutionary troubles Dupuis sought an asylum at
                    Evreux; and having been chosen a member of the national convention by the
                    department<pb break="no" facs="nls:193326866" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6866-0287"/> of
                    the Seine and Oise, he distinguished himself by the moderation of his speeches
                    and public conduct. In the third year of the republic he was elected secretary
                    to the assembly, and in the fourth he was chosen a member of the council of Five
                    Hundred. After the memorable 18th of <hi rend="italic">Brumaire</hi> he was
                    elected by the department of the Seine and Oise a member of the legislative
                    body, of which he became the president. He was afterwards proposed as a
                    candidate for the senate; and here terminated his political career.</p>
                <p>In 1794 he published his large work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Origine de tous
                    les Cultes, ou la</hi><hi rend="italic">Religion</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Universelle,</hi> 3 vols. 4to, with an atlas, or 12 vols. 12mo. This work
                    excited considerable sensation at first; it gave umbrage to many, was attacked
                    and defended with warmth, at length ceased to be read, and fell into utter
                    neglect. In 1798 he published an abridgment of this work in one volume 8vo,
                    which mct with no better success. Another abridgment of the same work, executed
                    upon a much more methodical plan, was published by Μ. de Tracy. The other works
                    of Dupuis consist of two memoirs on the <hi rend="italic">Pelasgi,</hi> inserted
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Institute</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a
                    memoir <hi rend="italic">On the Zodiac of</hi><hi rend="italic">Tentyra,</hi>
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophique</hi> for the month of May 1806; and a <hi rend="italic">Mémoire
                    Explicatif</hi><hi rend="italic">du</hi><hi rend="italic">Zodiaque Chronologique
                    et Mythologique,</hi> published the same year, in one volume 4to. It was from
                    the perusal of the poem of <hi rend="italic">Nonnus,</hi> which he once thought
                    of translating into French, and of which a fragment was printed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouvel Almanach</hi><hi rend="italic">des Muses</hi> for the year
                    1805, that Dupuis caught the first idea of his astronomical system.</p>
                <p>Dupuis died at Is-sur-Til, on the 29th of September 1809, leaving behind him
                    several manuscripts on subjects connected with the works which he had published
                    during his life. He was a member of the legion of honour; and his character was
                    that of an honest man and a paradoxical writer. He was born poor, and never
                    acquired any fortune. Μ. Dacier, secretary to the third class of the Institute,
                    delivered his <hi rend="italic">Eloge;</hi> and an historical account of his
                    life and writings was published by his widow. (See also <hi rend="italic"
