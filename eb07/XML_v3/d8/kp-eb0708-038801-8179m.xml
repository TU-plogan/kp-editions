                <p><label type="entry">DYNANOMETER</label>, an instrument for ascertaining the
                    relative strength of men and animals. * Of an instrument of this kind, invented
                    by Regnier, and of which a description is given in the <hi rend="italic">Journal
                    de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Ecole Polytechnique,</hi> tom. ii. the author thus
                    speaks: “Some important knowledge might be acquired, had we the easy means of
                    ascertaining, in a comparative manner, our relative strength at the different
                    periods of life, and in different states of health. Buffon and Guéneau, who had
                    some excellent ideas on this subject, requested me to endeavour to invent a
                    portable machine, which, by an easy and simple mechanism, might conduct to a
                    solution of this question, on which they were then engaged. These philosophers
                    were acquainted with that invented by Graham, and improved by Dr Desaguliers, at
                    London; but this machine, constructed of wooden work, was too bulky and heavy to
                    be portable; and, besides, to make experiments on the different parts of the
                    body, several machines were necessary, each suited to the part required to be
                    tried. They were acquainted also with the dynanometer of citizen Leroy of the
                    Academy of Sciences at Paris. It consisted of a metal tube ten or twelve inches
                    in length, placed vertically on a foot like that of a candlestick, and
                    containing in the inside a spiral spring, having above it a graduated shank
                    terminating in a globe. This shank, together with the spring, sunk into the tube
                    in proportion to the weight acting upon it, and thus pointed out, in degrees,
                    the strength of the person who pressed on the ball with his hand.</p>
                <p>“This instrument, though ingenious, did not appear sufficient, however, to Buffon
                    and Guéneau; for they wished not merely to ascertain the muscular force of a
                    finger or hand, but to estimate that of each limb separately, and of all the
                    parts of the body. I shall not here give an account of the attempts I made to
                    fulfil the wishes of these two philosophers, but only observe, that in the
                    course of my experiments I had reason to be convinced that the construction of
                    the instrument was not so easy as might have been expected. Besides the use
                    which an enlightened naturalist may make of this machine, it maybe possible to
                    apply it to many other purposes. For example, it may be employed with advantage
                    to determine the strength of draught cattle; and, above all, to try that of
                    horses, and compare it with the strength of other animals. It may serve to make
                    known how far the assistance of well-constructed wheels may favour the movement
                    of a carriage, and what is its <hi rend="italic">vis inertiae</hi> in proportion
                    to the load. We might appreciate by it, also, what resistance the slope of a
                    mountain opposes to a carriage, and be able to judge whether a carriage is
                    sufficiently loaded in proportion to the number of horses that are to be yoked
                    to it. In the arts, it may be applied to machines of which we wish to ascertain
                    the resistance, and when we are desirous to calculate the moving force that
                    ought to be adapted to them. It may serve, also, as a Roman balance to weigh
                    burdens. In short, nothing would be more easy than to convert it into an
                    anemometer, to discover the absolute force of the wind, by fitting to it a frame
                    of a determined size filled up with wax cloth; and it would not be impossible to
                    ascertain by this machine the recoil of fire-arms, and consequently the strength
                    of gunpowder.</p>
                <p>“This dynanometer, in its form and size, has a near resemblance to a common
                    graphometer. It consists of a spring twelve inches in length, bent into the form
                    of an ellipsis; from the middle of which arises a semicircular piece of brass,
                    having engraved upon it the different degrees that express a force of the power
                    acting on the spring. The whole of this machine, which weighs only two pounds
                    and a half, opposes, however, more resistance <pb break="no"

                    determine the action of the strongest and most robust horse.”</p>
