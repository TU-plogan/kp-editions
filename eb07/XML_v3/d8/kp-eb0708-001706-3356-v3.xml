                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> necessity of aliment is explained by a knowledge of
                    the functions of the body, and its selection depends upon the same principles.
                    The living machine, as well as those that are inanimate, wastes in proportion as
                    it is used, and this waste must be supplied. To learn the kind of supply
                    required, the kind of waste and its mode must be ascertained.</p>
                <p>The human body is of a very compound nature; indeed it is the most compound of
                    all bodies, as well as the most complicated of all machines. It is composed of
                    solids and fluids, and these again consist of various chemical elements in
                    different states of combination. A great part of the mass of our bodies consists
                    of water, and certain animal substances, to which chemists have given the name
                    of fibrin, albumen, gelatin, mucus, and osmazone. Our bones consist principally
                    of phosphate of lime. Besides these, some other principles enter into the
                    composition of our bodies, though in comparatively small proportion. All the
                    elementary matters of which these principles consist are continually discharged
                    by the various excretions, but generally in states of combination different from
                    those in which they existed as a part of our body. By the lungs a great deal of
                    carbon and hydrogen is exhaled in the form of carbonic acid gas and vapour; by
                    the skin carbon and hydrogen are also thrown off in considerable quantity; by
                    urine, in addition to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, much azote, phosphorus, and
                    lime, are discharged in the form of urea and the phosphate of lime; and by the
                    alvine evacuation, not only the indigestible parts of our aliment are expelled,
                    but also carbon, hydrogen, and azote, which formed integrant parts of our
                    bodies, and have fulfilled their functions in the form of bile, mucus, and
                    intestinal flatus. We therefore see that there is a constant waste of carbon,
                    azote, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and lime, going on, which must be replaced.
                    But there are only two sources from which this waste can be repaired, the
                    atmosphere in which we live, and the aliment which we introduce into our
                    stomach. The atmosphere consists of oxygen and azotic gases, and it is very
                    doubtful whether any part of either be absorbed or converted into a part of our
                    bodies. At least we may assume, that from the air no part of the materials to
                    supply the waste of the body is derived. These must, therefore, be furnished
                    entirely from the matters introduced into the stomach, and those which are
                    calculated to restore any of the deficient elements or principles alone are
                    alimentary. It is not at all necessary that these elements should be in the same
                    state of combination with the principles whose loss they are to supply. It is
                    sufficient that the elements be there, for it is the very essence of the
                    function of digestion to analyse the alimentary matters, and reunite their
                    elements into other combinations assimilated to our nature. From this view of
                    the subject, it would however seem, that the more nearly the alimentary
                    substances approach to the nature of the substances whose waste they are to
                    supply, the less change upon them is necessary, and their digestion and
                    assimilation will be more easy. Upon these principles, animal substances should
                    be more easily digested than vegetable, and a larger proportion of their
                    elements should be assimilated, while a smaller proportion should be separated
                    to form excrementitious or indigestible compounds. In the same manner, vegetable
                    substances are more digestible, and generate less excrementitious matter, than
                    inorganic substances, which furnish only a small proportion of assimilable
                    matter, and which must be separated from combinations totally foreign to our
                    nature.</p>
                <p>Besides alimentary substances properly so called, there is another class of
                    substances which do not contribute much to repair the waste of our bodies, and
                    yet perform an essential part in the function of digestion. These are called
                    condiments, and their use is to stimulate the organs of digestion to greater
                    activity; and, in fact, they are all much more sapid than the proper alimentary
                    substances, which are in themselves generally insipid or mawkish.</p>
                <p>From the view we have taken of aliments, it will appear that they are furnished
                    by all the kingdoms of nature; the mineral kingdom supplying chiefly water and
                    lime, while the vegetable, in addition to these in smaller quantity, yields much
                    carbon and hydrogen; and the animal kingdom, in addition to a proportion of all
                    the preceding elements, furnishes almost all the azote which enters into our
                    composition. Although this statement be generally true, there are facts which at
                    first do not seem to accord with it; and there are some grounds for believing
                    that living bodies have either the power of changing the elementary nature of
                    bodies, or of analysing these bodies we at present consider as simple, so that
                    one is apparently changed into another. Thus some animals, in the state of
                    nature, live only upon animal substances, and it is easy to conceive how, by a
                    very simple process, the blood and flesh of their prey should become a part of
                    their proper blood and flesh. Their elements, and even the combinations<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193323369" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3369-0018"/> of them, are
                    alike. But there are other animals whose flesh and blood do not differ
                    materially from those of carnivorous animals, and which live almost entirely
                    upon vegetable substances far removed from animal nature, and containing little
                    if any azote.</p>
                <p>This subject has lately engaged the attention of Magendie,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mémoire sur les propriétés nutritives des
                    substances qu,i ne contiennent pas d’azote, 8vo, Paris, 1818.</p></note> the
                    most distinguished Parisian physiologist of the present day; and his views are
                    the most important lately promulgated upon this point, and throw very great
                    light upon the subject of dietetics. To ascertain the sources from which animals
                    derive the azote .which enters into their bodies, he performed some experiments,
                    which appear to prove that azote is an indispensable constituent in the food of
                    animals. For the subjects of his experiments he chose dogs, because, like man,
                    they can be supported by vegetable as well as animal food, and he confined them
                    to the use of pure water, and substances totally devoid of azote. <hi
                    rend="italic">Sugar,</hi> perfectly pure, was first tried. Of this, and of
                    distilled water, he allowed an unlimited quantity to a small dog, three years
                    old. For the first seven or eight days it seemed to agree very well with this
                    diet. It was lively, active, and eat and drank as usual. In the second week it
                    began to fall off, although its appetite continued very good, and it eat from
                    six to eight ounces of sugar in the course of twenty-four hours. Its alvine
                    excretions were scarce and scanty, while that by urine was abundant. In the
                    third week it became more emaciated, it lost its liveliness, and its appetite
                    began to fail. During this period also its eyes became affected in a singular
                    and very distressing manner. The emaciation increased every day, its strength
                    failed, and although it continued to eat from three or four ounces of sugar
                    daily, it became so weak that it could neither chew nor swallow, and of course
                    could not move. It died on the thirty-second day of the experiment; and, on
                    opening its body, there was a total absence of fat; the muscles were reduced to
                    one sixth of their bulk, and the stomach and intestines were much contracted.
                    The gall and urinary bladder were both filled with fluid; but on analysis, the
                    bile and urine resembled those of herbivorous animals. The urine, instead of
                    being acid, as in those which eat flesh, was like that of herbivorous animals,
                    sensibly alkaline, and did not contain a trace of uric acid or the phosphates,
                    while the bile contained the picromel so remarkable in ox gall. The excrements
                    also contained much less azote than usual. This experiment was twice repeated,
                    with nearly the same result.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Olive-oil</hi> was next tried with two healthy young dogs,
                    which seemed to agree with them for the first fifteen days, but then produced
                    the same bad effects, and both died on the thirty-first day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gum</hi> was given to several dogs, and always with the same
                    result.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Putter,</hi> an animal substance, but which does not contain
                    azote, was also tried; and although, after the thirty-second day, the dog was
                    allowed as much meat as it could eat, it died on the thirty-sixth day, similarly
                    affected.</p>
                <p>M. Magendie also killed several dogs at a proper period, after they had got a
                    full meal of oil, sugar, or gum, in order to observe the nature of the chyle
                    thus furnished. The chyle of the oil was of a decided milky white, whilst those
                    of the gum and sugar were transparent, opaline, and more watery. These
                    experiments, in M. Magendie’s opinion, render it doubtful whether the oils,
                    fats, gum, and especially sugar, are so nutritive as is generally supposed. But
                    before we adopt his conclusion, we must remember that whole nations subsist upon
                    food which contains very little if any azote. The Hindus live almost entirely
                    upon rice, the peasants of Lombardy upon maize, those of Ireland upon potatoes,
                    the slaves in the West Indies get fat during the cane crop, and the negroes of
                    Senegal during the gum harvest, and herbivorous animals are nourished at all
                    times upon grass. Μ. Magendie is not ignorant of these facts, but tries to
                    explain them away by doubting the accuracy of some of the relations, and
                    alleging that few vegetables are altogether destitute of azote. He cites, in
                    confirmation of his observations, the experiments of Dr Stark, who injured
                    himself by trying to live on sugar, bread, and water; and of Μ. Clouet, who grew
                    extremely weak upon potatoes and water; and instances the insufficiency of sugar
                    and a little rum to support the crew of a shipwrecked Hamburg vessel. The
                    legitimate conclusions from all the facts relating to this subject seem to
                    be,</p>
                <p>1. That animals derive the azote which enters into their composition entirely
                    from their food, and hence that no animal can live for a considerable time upon
                    food totally destitute of azote.</p>
                <p>2. That animals, even those naturally carnivorous, can live a certain time upon
                    food entirely destitute of azote, in consequence of which the excretions of the
                    naturally carnivorous become altered, and throw off less azote than when fed on
                    animal food, acquiring the properties which these excretions have in animals
                    whose food contains a very small proportion of azote.</p>
                <p>3. That vegetable and animal substances destitute of azote are highly nutritious,
                    provided, at the same time, azote be supplied from the admixture of some other
                    aliment containing it, though in small proportion.</p>
                <p>Upon these principles, alimentary substances may naturally and philosophically be
                    divided into three great classes.</p>
                <p>I. Those which contain azote, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>
                <p>II. Those which contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.</p>
                <p>III. Those which contain neither azote nor carbon.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Alimentary Principles which contain Azote, Carbon, Hydrogen,
                    and Oxygen.</hi></p>
                <p>The aliments which contain azote correspond with the animal substances in
                    general, and are calculated to repair the waste of our solids and fluids,
                    without great alteration or effort in the digesting organs. All the immediate
                    principles of this class are not, however, equally digestible, or possessed of
                    the same properties. We shall say a few words of each.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fibrin</hi> constitutes the great mass of the solid matter of
                    the muscles of animals, especially of those which are old and have dark-coloured
                    dry flesh. It is also a principal constituent of the blood of all animals. There
                    can be no doubt, therefore, that it is pre-eminently nutritious in these its
                    natural forms of combination, but we know of no experiments to ascertain its
                    nourishing powers when used alone. The purest form of fibrin which occurs in
                    common circumstances is the fibre of flesh which has been long boiled in a great
                    quantity of water, as in the remains of the meat from which beef-tea is made, or
                    of that boiled down for soup. This is generally considered, and is often thrown
                    away, as totally indigestible, and deprived of all its nourishing principles;
                    but this is probably a vulgar error, for animal fibre in this state still
                    contains, as much as ever, all the elementary substances which are necessary for
                    animal food; and the only circumstance which can account for their
                    indigestibility, is their great aggregation, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323382"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3382-0019"/>which it is the business of cookery to overcome.
                    Fibrin also forms a large proportion of the substance of some of the internal
                    organs of animals, all of which are nutritious. Pure fibrin is white and opaque
                    when moist, but acquires a dark colour on being dried. It does not become putrid
                    when kept in the air, nor even when immersed in water for a considerable length
                    of time. It contracts and shrinks on the application of heat, and gives out, on
                    being burnt, the smell of burning horn or feathers. It is insoluble in cold
                    water; is corrugated by boiling in water; is insoluble in alcohol; but strong
                    acetic acid swells it considerably, and renders it transparent like cartilage,
                    in which state it may be dissolved, or, at least, diffused through water by long
                    boiling.</p>
                <p>Fibrin varies in every species of animal, and in the same animal at different
                    ages, either from a difference in its nature, or from a difference in the matter
                    with which it is combined. In many fishes, and the lower classes of animals in
                    general, it is semitransparent and colourless. In veal, pork, salmon, chicken,
                    and some other kinds of poultry, it has a pink colour; in beef and mutton it is
                    of a fuller red; and in pigeon and game, both birds and quadrupeds, it is dark
                    coloured. In general it is more tender in the female than in the male, and in
                    the young animal than in the old.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Albumen</hi> is also a principal constituent of animal
                    substances, in which it exists in two states, one uncoagulated and the other
                    coagulated. Of the former, the purest example occurs in the raw white of eggs.
                    Cartilage, horn, hair, nails, consist chiefly of the latter. It is also a
                    principal constituent of blood and brain; and it seems to be the chief substance
                    of oysters, mussels, and snails. Uncoagulated albumen is sometimes solid, often
                    glairy, always transparent, and, when fluid, is soluble in water, and its taste
                    is bland or almost insipid. At 165° Fahrenheit it is 'converted into a white
                    solid mass, of which we have a familiar example in the white of a hard-boiled
                    egg. There can be no doubt that albumen, especially in its un-coagnlated state,
                    is highly nutritious and easily digestible.</p>
                <p>The curd of milk may be considered as a variety of albumen, although it possesses
                    some peculiar properties, especially that of being converted into cheese by a
                    particular mode of management.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gelatin</hi> is a third very principal constituent of animal
                    solids, as bones, ligaments, tendons, membranes, skin, muscles, &amp;c. and
                    exists in much larger proportions in the flesh of young than of adult animals.
                    Thus we see the gravy of veal and lamb always gelatinize, while that of beef and
                    mutton does not. The swimming bladder of the several species of sturgeon is
                    gelatin in a state of very great purity, and by boiling it may be extracted pure
                    from the shavings of hartshorn. Its taste is bland and nearly insipid. It is
                    characterized by its solubility in water, being much increased by a boiling
                    temperature, and by the solution, when of a certain strength, gelatinizing or
                    cooling. It is highly nutritious, and supposed to be the most easily digestible
                    of animal matters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mucus</hi> differs from albumen chiefly in not being coagulated
                    by heat or corrosive sublimate, and from gelatin in not being precipitated by
                    vegetable astringents, nor gelatinizing when its solution is concentrated. It
                    exists nearly pure in saliva, and is a constituent of most of the secretions.
                    There can be no doubt of its easy digestion and nutritious quality.</p>
                <p>Of these four principal constituents of animal matter we may remark, that in
                    themselves they are almost insipid; that gelatin exists almost entirely in a
                    solid form, more or less dense; that mucus and albumen exist in every form of
                    aggregation, from perfect fluidity to the density of cartilage; and that fibrin
                    is only fluid in the living blood, but in every other instance is a tough solid:
                    and that gelatin is very soluble in boiling water, and gelatinizes on cooling;
                    that albumen in soluble in cold water, and coagulates at 165°; and that fibrin
                    is not soluble either , in cold or hot water. We may also remark that, although
                    chemists have given very definite characters of each, as . if they constituted
                    absolutely distinct species of matter, these characters are taken from certain
                    selected kinds of . each, and that, in reality, we find tha’t there is a regular
                    and insensible gradation from mucus, through gelatin and albumen, to fibrin; and
                    that, as in the process of animali-zation, as well as in the progress of life,
                    they pass into each other, and many intermediate states are found which cannot
                    be distinctly referred to any of them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Osmazome,</hi> or animal extractive, differs very much from the
                    preceding principles; chemically, in being soluble in alcohol, and to the
                    senses, in being very savoury or sapid. It is upon this, which seems to admit of
                    considerable varieties, that the flavour of animal food, and of each of its
                    kinds, depends. It exists chiefly in the fibrous organs, or combined with fibrin
                    in the muscles, while the tendons and other gelatinous organs seem to be
                    destitute of it. The flesh of game and old animals also probably contain it in
                    greater quantity than that of young animals abounding in gelatin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gluten</hi> is the only vegetable substance which contains a
                    notable proportion of azote in its composition. When , separated from other
                    principles, it forms a tough, ductile, elastic, and tenacious mass of a gray
                    colour, resembling, when drawn out, thin animal membrane; when dried it is
                    brittle, hard, and slightly transparent, like glue. When kept moist it ferments
                    and acquires some of the properties of cheese. Immersed in water it at last
                    putrefies. When burnt or distilled it resembles in its properties horn or
                    feathers. It is soluble in concentrated acetic acid, and, by the assistance of
                    heat, in muriatic acid and in the alkalies. It then bears a strong analogy to
                    the animal substances in general, resembling, by different properties, fibrin,
                    albumen, and gelatin. It is very generally found, though only in a small
                    proportion, in the vegetable kingdom, in all the farinaceous seeds, in the
                    leaves of cabbages, cresses, &amp;c.; in some fruits, flowers, and roots, and in
                    the green feculum of vegetables in general; but it is particularly abundant in
                    wheat, and imparts to wheatflour the property of fermenting and making bread. On
                    the nutritious powers of gluten separated from other principles nothing certain
                    is known; but the superior nutritious powers of wheat-flour over that of all
                    other farinaceous substances sufficiently proves that, in combination with
                    starch, it is highly nutritive; and in all probability it is the gluten of the
                    green feculum which supplies the azote necessary for the support of the
                    herbivorous animals.</p>

                    Oxygen.</hi><hi rend="italic">Starch</hi> is very abundantly diffused through
                    the vegetable kingdom. It exists in great purity in various farinaceous grains,
                    such as rice, barley, maize, and millet; it is combined with gluten in wheat;
                    with saccharine matter in some grains, asnats, and in many leguminous seeds,
                    such as harico-beans, lentils, vetches, and peas; with viscous mucilage, in rye,
                    potatoes, and Windsor beans; with fixed oil and mucilage in the emulsive seeds,
                    such as nuts, almonds, cocoa, tamarinds, in linseed, rapeseed, hempseed,
                    poppyseed, and, in general, all those from which an oil can be obtained by
                    expression. Lastly, starch is sometimes united to a poisonous substance. Of this
                    singular union of a nutritious with an injurious principle the most remarkable
                    instance occurs in the roots of the Ja- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323395"

                    the former of which the negro slaves of the West Indies are indebted for their
                    cassada bread, and from the latter is prepared the best arrow-root starch. Only
                    one species of grain, the <hi rend="italic">Lolium ternulentum,</hi> is hurtful;
                    but many leguminous seeds are poisonous, of which the most familiar example
                    occurs in the laburnum peas.</p>
                <p>Starch is artificially prepared in great purity from various substances. <hi
                    rend="italic">Starch</hi> is got from wheat and potatoes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >arrow-root</hi> from various species of arum, <hi rend="italic"
                    >cassada-fiour</hi> from the manioc root, <hi rend="italic">salep</hi> from the
                    orchideae in general, <hi rend="italic">sago</hi> from the pith of various
                    species of palm-trees, <hi rend="italic">tapioca</hi> from the bitter and sweet
                    cassava root. In all of these varieties of form, starch furnishes a bland and
                    wholesome nutriment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mucilage</hi> is also a principal
                    ingredient in the composition of our alimentary vegetables. The distinctive
                    character of gum is its solubility in cold as well as hot water, and its
                    insolubility in alcohol. It is devoid of smell, and to the taste it is bland and
                    agreeable. In Arabia, Senegal, and the East Indies, it is obtained in great
                    quantities from the various species of <hi rend="italic">Mimosa,</hi> from the
                    bark of which it exudes in great purity; and in hot climates in general it is
                    furnished by many trees, especially those which have an astringent bark. In our
                    own country an example of its production is seen on the bark of the plum and
                    cherry trees. Where it is produced in sufficient quantity it constitutes a
                    principal article of diet; and the Africans of Senegal are said to live entirely
                    upon it during the gum harvest. Eight ounces of gum are the daily allowance, and
                    furnish sufficient nourishment, for each man.</p>
                <p>Mucilage is the alimentary principle of many of our esculent vegetables. In some
                    it is united only to green colouring matter, as in the leaves of beet and
                    spinach; with bitter matter, which may be prevented by the process of blanching,
                    as in endive, lettuce, succory, and cardoon, or by using the plant very young,
                    as in asparagus. It exists also in every part of the mallow tribe; in many
                    roots, as scorzonera, salsafy, and Jerusalem artichokes, in the receptacle of
                    the flower of the artichoke. It is combined with an acid in sorrel leaves; with
                    saccharine matter in many fruits, as the fig and date; in roots, as the carrot,
                    parsnip, and beet; and with slight acrimony in the turnip, cabbage leaves,
                    cauliflower, and broccoli, and with considerable acrimony in the radish, cress,
                    and mustard. It exists in great quantity, combined with a peculiar nauseous
                    principle, in onions, garlic, shalot, leek, &amp;c.; and, lastly, in small
                    quantity, with much aroma, in those vegetables which are used only for
                    seasoning, as parsley, thyme, &amp;c. In short, it is very generally found
                    throughout the vegetable kingdom, and in every mode of union with other
                    principles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sugar,</hi> the common properties of which, in a state
                    approaching to purity, are familiar, is also highly nutritious. It is
                    crystallizable, soluble in water both cold and hot, in alcohol and the weak
                    acids, readily undergoing, when dissolved in sufficient water, the vinous and
                    acetous fermentation, but, on the other hand, when concentrated, preserving
                    vegetable substances. Chemically considered, it presents many varieties. It
                    exists in greatest quantity, combined with mucilage, in the juice of the sugar
                    cane, of the maple tree, the manna ash tree, and of beet-root. It seems to be a
                    constant attendant upon the inflorescence of vegetables, for almost every flower
                    furnishes honey to the bee, and is a chief constituent of all the accrb,
                    subacid, and sweet fruits, in combination with vegetable jelly. Sugar is
                    produced, or at least collected, by several insects. To the bee we are indebted
                    for honey; and a species of locust in New Holland covers the trees and ground
                    with a kind of sugar. In all animals a principle having some analogy with sugar
                    exists in the bile, and it is a product of morbid action in the disease called
                    diabetes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Oil and fat</hi> are also nutritious. They differ most
                    obviously in fluidity, and they coincide in being insoluble in water, and in
                    containing a larger proportion of hydrogen than the alimentary matters already
                    spoken of. The oils may be divided into the fluid and concrete, and both are
                    furnished by the vegetable and animal kingdoms. Fluid oil exists in quantity in
                    the emulsive seeds; in some of them combined with prussic acid, as in the bitter
                    almond, and in others with an acrid matter, as in the seeds of the ricinus; but
                    it is obtained in greatest quantity and purity from the olive. The animal fluid
                    oils are all more or less nauseous, as spermaceti oil, seal oil, whale .oil, and
                    cod liver oil. The concrete oils are generally furnished by the animal kingdom,
                    and these are often bland and agreeable when fresh, but are apt to become rancid
                    in proportion as they are less solid. Butter is the least consistent, if we
                    except the fat of some birds; then hog’s lard, the subcutaneous fat of beef, and
                    the kidney fat of beef and mutton in succession. The only concrete oil obtained
                    from the vegetable kingdom is the butter of cocoa.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Alimentary Principles which do not contain Carhon.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Water</hi> is perhaps the only real alimentary substance which
                    belongs to this class, but it is one of the most essential. It is not only
                    necessary to replace the constant waste of water which is drained off from our
                    bodies, by the secretions, the cuticular discharge, and the vapour of the
                    breath, but it is in itself strictly digestible, and capable of supplying either
                    hydrogen or oxygen to the system, as may be required, according to the nature of
                    our other food. When we consider how large a proportion of the whole weight of
                    our bodies consists of water only, and that the fluids require more frequent
                    renewal than the solids, the necessity of water as an aliment cannot be
                    disputed. Some animals, as the rabbit, are supposed to be capable of living a
                    long time or altogether without water; but this is a mere deception, for their
                    vegetable food consists almost entirely of water. On the other hand, Dr Fordyce
                    kept gold fishes six months in distilled water, and thought himself warranted in
                    concluding that animals could live in water and air alone. Pouteau allowed some
                    of his patients nothing but water for several weeks, without their falling off;
                    and the histories of shipwrecked mariners prove with how small a portion of
                    solid food man can subsist, provided he has sufficient allowance of water,
                    whilst without water, or a substitute, no quantity of solid food can support man
                    for even a few days.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Earths</hi> are, perhaps, not altogether unalimentary. Not to
                    mention the depraved appetite of many young females, and of the dirt-eating
                    negroes of the West Indies, for chalk, cinders, and such substances, earth is
                    sought after and devoured by whole nations. The luxurious Capuans paid a
                    considerable tribute to the Neapolitans for an earth called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leucog&lt;xum,</hi> which they considered necessary for the preparation of a
                    favourite dish, √4Z⅛&lt;z. The Tungusses, according to Laxmann, cat a fine clay
                    with rein-deer’s milk. Chandler saw the women and children in Samos chewing
                    pieces of steatite as a luxury. La Billardière saw the same practised in New
                    Caledonia, and found edible earth sold in the market in several villages in
                    Java. Throughout all India lime is used along with the betel leaf. Kepler
                    partook of the butter earth, which is eaten with great relish, spread upon
                    bread, by the millstone quarriers of Thuringia; and, lastly, Humboldt has made
                    us acquainted with the existence of a whole nation of earth-eaters, the Ottomacs
                    on the Orinoco.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tableaux

                    bird-fanciers find it necessary to supply birds shut up in cages with sand and
                    earth. All these facts, we are aware, might be explained upon principles
                    different from the digestibility of the earthy substances taken into the
                    stomach; and we have no idea that any earthy substances can supply carbon or
                    azote to the system; but we have absolute proof that earthy matter may enter
                    into the circulation, in the growth and absorption of the bony frame of our
                    body, for which phosphate of lime is as necessary as carbon or azote for our
                    soft solids.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sea Salt</hi> is more obviously necessary than earth. Even in
                    insular and maritime situations it is voluntarily used as a condiment by all;
                    but it is only in inland countries, at a distance from the sea, that its
                    necessity is duly appreciated. Muriate of soda enters into the composition of
                    all our fluids, and is thrown off by many of our secretions; hence its waste
                    must be supplied, and where the vegetables are not naturally impregnated with
                    it, it becomes one of the most indispensable articles of our food.</p>
                <p>Alimentary substances, as presented to us by nature or prepared by art, maybe
                    considered in various points of view.</p>
                <p>They differ in regard to digestibility, or the facility with which they are
                    decomposed by the powers of the stomach, ’ to enter into new combinations fitted
                    to repair the waste of the blood. In this particular, also, they may differ in
                    respect to the length of time, or in regard to the digestive power of the
                    stomach, required for their digestion. Thus the digestion of one substance may
                    be slow, though ultimately complete, even in a weak stomach, and that of another
                    quick enough in a strong stomach, although imperfectly digested by one that is
                    weak. In reference to their digestibility, aliments are commonly described as
                    being light or heavy; but in this respect there is very great difference in
                    regard to different individuals, the same substances being light to one and
                    heavy to another, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>

                    company with the late Dr Gordon, there appears to be great irregularity in the
                    time necessary for the completion of digestion, so that they scarcely furnish
                    any conclusion as to the comparative digestibility of different substances. Dr
                    Macdonald infers that, of those he tried, butter was the most, and rice the
                    least, digestible in the stomach of the dog. In the experiments which Dr Stark
                    made upon himself, to ascertain the nutritious properties of oily substances, he
                    found that, with a daily allowance of thirty ounces of bread and three pounds of
                    water, two ounces of olive oil taken at one meal was so large a quantity as to
                    be disagreeable; three ounces in the day caused some uneasiness in his bowels;
                    and four ounces griped him very much, although he gained weight; but this
                    experiment was not conclusive, as at that time he was suffering under sloughing
                    gums, the effects of a protracted diet of sugar. A diet of four ounces of pure
                    fat, obtained from the subcutaneous fat of beef, made into a pudding, with
                    twenty ounces of flour, and twelve or twenty ounces of water, with the remainder
                    of three pounds of water in drink, was both nourishing and agreeable; but when
                    the fat was increased to six ounces, great part of it passed unassimilated, and
                    his bowels were affected. The same pudding without the suet was not sufficiently
                    nutritious, and did not satisfy his appetite in the same manner. When the
                    pudding was made with butter, although only four ounces were used, he was made
                    very ill by it. Oil of butter agreed very well; and oil of marrow, of all the
                    fats Dr Stark tried, he found to be the mildest in the bowels. His gums having
                    again become purple and swelled, with petechial appearances on his body, while
                    making these experiments, suggested to him the following queries, which seem
                    important to the science of dietetics. “Although at present I take more food
                    than what is absolutely necessary for the support of the body, I remain
                    perfectly well, whereas I have several times suffered considerable inconvenience
                    from committing any excess in the quantity of oils. Is it not evident that
                    excess in the quantity of oils is more hurtful to the body than excess in any
                    other article of food? and that, of course, we ought to be particularly careful
                    in regulating the quantity and quality of the oils we may employ in diet? Is it
                    not probable, then, that animal oils, though they nourish and increase the
                    weight of the body, are not of themselves sufficient to prevent a morbid
                    alteration from taking place in the blood and fluids? whilst, on the other hand,
                    the lean of meat, though less nutritious, is of more efficacy in preserving the
                    fluids of the body in a sound state.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Aliments also differ in regard to the proportional quantity of nourishment they
                    furnish, and, in this point of view, they are said to be strong and weak, or
                    rich and poor. This difference may arise either from the proportional quantity
                    of digestible and indigestible parts in the various kinds of aliment, or from
                    the digestible parts being different in kind, and furnishing a supply of a
                    different kind to the blood. There is even in this respect some opposition
                    between light food and strong food, and it may be generally observed, that food
                    which is most quickly digested, requires the soonest to be repeated, while
                    digestible food, that is only slowly digested, supports the body for a greater
                    length of time.</p>
                <p>Aliments also differ in the impression they make on our palate; and it is chiefly
                    in this respect that they are considered by the epicure. This impression
                    proceeds from two distinct qualities in the aliment; the one depending upon
                    their grosser physical properties, and the other upon their finer, recognizable
                    only by the senses of taste and smell. To the former class belong the sensations
                    of solid and fluid, hard and soft, tough and tender, crisp and stringy, hot and
                    cold, greasy, glutinous, gritty, smooth, &amp;c. These are judged of by the
                    tongue and palate, rather <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323421"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3421-0022"/>as organs of touch than of taste, and are
                    altogether independent of flavour, as capable of affecting the organs of taste
                    and smell. The latter class consists of all the variety of tastes properly so
                    called, namely, sweet, bitter, sour, salt, alkaline, astringent, aromatic,
                    nauseous, pungent, acrid, spirituous, cooling, &amp;c., and also the want of
                    taste, the vapid or mawkish. Of these, some are almost universally agreeable,
                    and others generally disliked, but much depends upon idiosyncracy, state of
                    health, education, habit of the individual, and upon the degree or quantity of
                    flavour.</p>
                <p>Aliments also differ in the impression made upon the stomach; but the sensations
                    arising from this source are more obscure and less varied. Except the sensation
                    of heat, which may arise from caloric, and is transient, or from acrimony or
                    spirit, which is more durable, most of the sensations experienced in the stomach
                    are indications of its mechanical state, or of affections of the appetite. Hence
                    we have the feeling of gratification, from removal of a sense of emptiness, of
                    repletion, distension, cessation of hunger or thirst, satiety, and sickness.</p>
                <p>We should also consider the effect of different kinds of diet, when the body is
                    in a state of health, and different states of disease; but accurate experiments
                    are still wanting to enable us to give any thing more than fragments of this
                    interesting subject. It is extremely difficult to institute these experiments
                    satisfactorily. They are irksome to the person on whom they are tried; and so
                    many causes tend to interfere with the results, that it is only by frequent
                    repetition that the real effects can be fairly deduced.</p>
                <p>Our diet may be either proper, or it may err, and this either in quantity or
                    quality. When the quantity is too small, the body is not nourished; it becomes
                    lean, the fat disappears, and the muscles either get soft and flabby, or
                    shrivelled and dried up, accompanied by loss of strength or stiffness, with
                    predisposition to an actual disease. Errors in regard to the quantity of food
                    are merely relative; so much depends upon circumstances, as individuality of
                    constitution, period of life, state of health, degree of mental and corporeal
                    exertion, habit and temperature. Each person may be said to have a different
                    standard quantity, deviations from which are to be accounted errors. In our
                    army, the rations allowed for each soldier at home are, three quarters of a
                    pound of meat, boiled so as to afford broth, with l^d. worth of potatoes and
                    other vegetables, one pound of bread, or one and one eighth pound of oatmeal;
                    and in most cases one pound of milk or coffee is purchased for his breakfast. On
                    service the rations are, one pound of meat, one and a half pound of bread, and
                    one pint of wine or one sixth of a pint of spirits.</p>
                <p>Mr Buxton states that the diet allowed to the prisoners in the jails in London
                    varies from fourteen ounces of bread per day, and two pounds of meat per week,
                    which, he says, is not enough to support life, up to one pound and a half of
                    bread, one pound of potatoes, two pints of hot gruel, and either six ounces of
                    boiled meat, without bone, and after boiling, or a quart of strong broth, mixed
                    with vegetables, per day, which is as much more than enough; and Mr Buxton
                    thinks that the meat should be discontinued. A fit prison diet, in his opinion,
                    should consist of one pound and a half of bread, at least one day old, to each
                    prisoner, daily, and one pint of good gruel for breakfast; and, upon good
                    behaviour, half a pound of meat on Sundays.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Some experiments have been made in order to ascertain the quantity of different
                    kinds of food necessary for the sustenance of individuals. Dr Franklin, when a
                    journeyman printer, lived a fortnight on bread and water, at the rate of ten
                    pounds of bread a week. Dr Stark, whose weight was 171 pounds avoirdupois, found
                    that thirty-eight ounces of bread daily were not more than sufficient to satisfy
                    his appetite; forty-eight ounces were the utmost he could consume in one day,
                    and the greatest quantity he could take at one meal, without uneasiness, was
                    thirty ounces; and, with this diet, he required necessarily three pounds of
                    water for drink, for with only two pounds he was not satisfied. In another
                    experiment, thirty ounces of bread and three pounds of water, with six ounces of
                    boiled beef, sufficed: with four ounces of the beef his appetite was not
                    satisfied; with two pounds of bread and three pounds of infusion of tea, he
                    found that one pound of cold stewed beef was not more than sufficient: he was
                    not satisfied with four ounces of beef to breakfast; but eight ounces at dinner,
                    and four ounces at supper, were rather too much.</p>
                <p>Absolute starvation produces diminished excretions, fetid breath, foul skin, and
                    death. The most distressing histories of this dreadful end are recorded in the
                    account of shipwrecks, and of those unfortunate persons who fall into the hands
                    of the Arabs of the desert. Man can sustain the absolute want of food for
                    several days, more or fewer in number according to circumstances; the old better
                    than the young, and the fat, probably, better than the lean. The total want of
                    drink can be borne only a very short time, and its effects are even more
                    distressing than those of want of food. They have been strikingly described by
                    Mungo Park and by Ali Bey, as experienced in their own persons. The narratives
                    of shipwrecked mariners also prove with how very little food life may be
                    supported for a considerable length of time; and the history of those impostors
                    who pretend to live altogether without food or drink display this adaptation of
                    the wants of the body to its means of supply in a still more striking manner;
                    for, even after the deception in such cases as that of Ann Moore is exposed, it
                    will be found that the quantity of aliment actually taken was incredibly
                    small.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An Examination of

                    and his five companions rowed their boat for seven days without any sustenance

                    without any other food than a little water and a few berries. Robert Scot-ney
                    lived seventy-five days alone in a boat, with three pounds and a half of meat,
                    three pounds of flour, two hogsheads of water, some whale oil, and a small
                    quantity of salt. He also used an amazing quantity of tobacco. Six soldiers
                    deserted from St Helena in a boat on the 10th of June 1799, with twenty-five
                    pounds of bread and about thirteen gallons of water. On the 18th they reduced
                    their allowance to one ounce of bread and tw 0 mouthfuls of water, on which they
                    subsisted till the 26th, when their store was expended. Captain Inglefield and
                    eleven others, after five clays of scanty diet, were obliged to restrict it to a
                    biscuit divided into twelve morsels for breakfast, and the same for dinner, with
                    an ounce or two of water daily. In ten days, a very stout man died, having <pb

                    wound, dreading the punishment which awaited him, he resolved to starve himself,
                    and on the 2d of August began obstinately to refuse all food or drink, and
                    persisted in this resolution till the 24th August. During these twenty-two days
                    he had absolutely taken neither food, drink, nor medicine, and had no evacuation
                    from his bowels. He had now become very much emaciated, his belly was somewhat
                    distended, he had violent pain in his loins, his thirst was excessive, and his
                    febrile heat burning. Ins behaviour had also become timid. Having been promised
                    his discharge unpunished, he was now prevailed upon to take some sustenance, but
                    could not at first bear even weak soup and lukewarm drinks. Under proper
                    treatment he continued to mend for eight days, and his strength was returning,
                    when, on the 1st of September, he again refused food, and assumed a wild look.
                    He took a little barley water every four or five days to the 8th; from that day
                    to the 11th he took a little biseuit with wine; but again, from the 11 th
                    September to the 9th Oetober, a period of twenty-eight days, he neither took
                    food, drink, nor had any natural evacuation. From the 9th to the 11th he again
                    took a little nourishment, and began to reeruit; but, on the 11th, he finally
                    renewed his resolution to starve himself, and persevered until his death, which
                    took place on the 21st November, after a total abstinence of forty-two days.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the quantity of nourishment whieh can be devoured with
                    impunity is often very great. Almost every person in good circumstances eats
                    more than is necessary for supporting his body in a state of health, and many
                    bring their stomachs to require a very excessive allowance as almost necessary.
                    In some individuals an inordinate appetite seems constitutional. Charles
                    Do-mery, aged’ twenty-one, six feet three inches high, and well made, but thin,
                    when a prisoner of war at Liverpool, consumed in one day four pounds of cow’s
                    udder and ten pounds of beef, both raw, together with two pounds of tallow
                    candles and five bottles of porter, and, although allowed the daily rations of
                    ten men, he was not satisfied.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    only a hundred and seventy pounds, could devour, in the course of twenty-four
                    hours, a leg of beef twenty-four pounds in weight, and thought nothing of

                    quantity they consumed, but also for its quality, giving a preference to raw
                    meat, and even living flesh and blood. Do-mery in one year eat 174 eats, dead
                    and alive; and Tarare was strongly suspected of having devoured an infant, which
                    disappeared mysteriously. Many other histories of the same kind are preserved;
                    and although some of the individuals were men of large stature and great
                    strength, others were of ordinary size. The excess of food may be taken either
                    in the form of too much at one meal or of too many meals. It is either digested
                    and furnishes an excess of nourishment, or it passes through the canal simply
                    indigested, or it undergoes the fermentation natural to it. An excess of
                    nourishment either produces a great or rapid increase of the size of body
                    generally, or of the fat and abdominal visecra in particular, or, by inducing
                    great fulness of blood, produces diseases which sometimes counteract the effects
                    of the plethora. When the excess passes simply indigested, it only occasionally
                    proves hurtful as a mechanical irritation in the bowels, especially when it is
                    of a hard substance, and has sharp angles. When it undergoes its natural
                    fermentation this is either acid or putrid, as the substance is vegetable
                    or'animal, or rather as it is destitute of or contains a notable proportion of
                    azote.</p>
                <p>When diet errs in quality, it gives rise to a greater variety of eases. It may
                    either produce a directly hurtful effect upon the constitution, in the manner of
                    a poison or medicine, in its natural state, or after fermenting in the stomach;
                    or it may prove injurious more indirectly by not supplying an element necessary
                    for its healthy condition, or by supplying one in excessive proportion. The
                    poisonous effects of alimentary substances are always occasional, and arise from
                    a peculiarity in the aliment itself, as in the ease of poisonous fishes, or in
                    the individual, as in those persons who cannot eat particular kinds of food,
                    which are to others wholesome and nutritious. The unpleasant effects of
                    substances undergoing their natural fermentation in the stomach are much more
                    frequently observed. They occur either from a very strong disposition in the
                    food to ferment, so that the action of a healthy stomach is not able to restrain
                    it, or from excess of the food, so that part of it is left to its natural
                    changes, or from weakness of the stomach, which exerts little action upon it.
                    Fermenting substances are hurtful, by acting as direct poisons, and by
                    distending the stomach; in the non-azotized substances becoming acid and
                    producing flatulencies, in the azotized substances becoming putrid and producing
                    fetid crueta-tions and flatus. Diet, which errs by supplying one of the
                    elementary constituents of our body in excess, or in not supplying another, does
                    not produce its full effects at once, but gradually changes the condition of the
                    body. When an elementary principle is furnished in excess, it iš thrown off by
                    the various exeretions, and hence we find that the urine of omnivorous animals,
                    when confined to animal food, contains more urea, and their perspirations and
                    stools are more fetid; while the urea disappears, and the stools and
                    perspirations lose their fetor, when they are restricted to vegetables. The same
                    observations have been made in regard to man. Also, when the supply of an
                    elementary principle is deficient, it ceases to be thrown off by exeretion, even
                    after it has performed its functions in the body, but is re-absorbed, and thus
                    the body, for a time, lives as it were upon itself.</p>
                <p>The chief varieties of diet, in regard to quality, depend upon their immediate
                    effects, and in this respect they may be divided into the simply nutritious and
                    the stimulant. All animal flesh seems to be more or less stimulant, and, in
                    general, the more so the darker its colour is; and upon this principle chiefly
                    has Dr Darwin founded his classification of aliments, but he has erred in
                    considering them as also more nutritious. Moor-game, pigeon, hare, and venison,
                    are more stimulating, but perhaps not more nutritious, than the turkey or
                    barn-door fowl, veal, or lamb. The effect upon the composition of our bodies is
                    the secondary but most important effect. In this respect, food <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323447" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3447-0024"/>might be divided into the
                    azotized, hydrogenous, carbonaceous, and oxygenous, or rather into those which
                    supply abundantly azote, hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen. This view is, however,
                    chiefly theoretical, as we are very far from possessing facts enough to
                    establish it completely, or to overturn it; but yet there arc some which favour
                    it. We have already noticed Magendie’s experiments on substances which do not
                    contain azote, from which he inferred that a certain supply of it was absolutely
                    necessary to the support of animal life. Other facts lead to the same
                    conclusion, especially the effect of restriction to one kind of aliment in the
                    generation and cure of disease.</p>
                <p>It is many years since Dr Rollo<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>An Account of two Cases of Diabetes Mellitus. By John Rollo,
                    Μ. D. 2 vols. 8vo, London, 1747∙</p></note> was led, by the singular sweetness
                    of diabetic urine, to conclude that, if he deprived the patient of all food
                    which contained sugar, or the principles of sugar, he should be able to cure
                    this hitherto untractable disease. He accordingly restricted his patients to the
                    use of animal food, especially fat, and absolutely prohibited all vegetables,
                    even bread, and all fermented liquors. The effects were very striking, and some
                    patients were believed to be cured; at least the nature of their urine was
                    completely altered from a morbid to a healthy state. As conducted by others, the
                    same regimen has produced the same effects; but it is so disagreeable to the
                    patients that they can seldom be prevailed upon to adhere to it, and
                    unfortunately, notwithstanding the temporary removal of this prominent symptom,
                    the disease generally continues its fatal course. We may, however, notice, that
                    Rollo and others were guided in their choice of regimen by the principle of
                    withholding the elements of sugar, and hence fat formed a chief part of it, and
                    was a principal cause of the disgust it excited; but perhaps it would be better
                    to select a highly azotized diet, in which point of view the muscular parts of
                    dark-fleshed animals, such as game and old mutton, and those kinds of fish, such
                    as skate, which contain much azote in a loose state of combination, should be
                    selected; while wheaten bread, the want of which is so distressing to many,
                    might be allowed, and fat, which contains no azote, should not be
                    prescribed.</p>

                    superabundance of azote in our food, as the uric acid of which gravel consists
                    is a highly azotized substance, and seems to be produced as a means of throwing
                    off the excessive azote; and among the various causes with which gravel is
                    connected, the most active in its agency is high living, or the use of animal
                    food in excess. A Hanseatic citizen, who kept a good table previous to 1814, was
                    afflicted with the gravel. He emigrated and lived very miserably in England, but
                    his gravel completely left him. He re-established his affairs, and with his
                    fortune his gravel returned. Again he was ruined, and went to France almost
                    destitute, and his gravel disappeared. By industry he finally acquired a
                    competency, and with it his old complaint, for which he then consulted Magendie.
                    A Parisian lady of sixty, subject to gravel, read in a journal a short notice of
                    Magendie’s experiments, in which it was said that he had discovered in sugar a
                    cure for the gravel. Without more advice she set about eating sugar, often to
                    the extent of a pound daily, and in effect she removed the gravel, but
                    disordered her stomach so much that she was obliged to resume her usual food,
                    and with it the gravel returned.</p>
                <p>The chemical theory of the scurvy is, that it is owing to the want of oxygenous
                    food; and it cannot be denied that this theory has been very ingeniously
                    supported by Dr Trotter, Dr Beddoes, and others. The rapidity with which those
                    afflicted with it recover by the use of recent vegetables, especially the fresh
                    citric acid, shows that it proceeds from an error in diet, but whether from a
                    deficiency of nourishment in general, or from a deficiency of oxygenous aliment,
                    is not quite so clear. When we compare the accounts of the ravages formerly
                    committed by this dreadful disease, even during short voyages, with the almost
                    total immunity which the British fleet has enjoyed since the time of Captain
                    Cook, we have the strongest possible proof of the influence of diet upon the
                    human frame, either as inducing or preventing disease.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Hydrogenous food, such as the excessive indulgence in fat meat, butter, and oil,
                    and still more especially in spirituous liquors, produces a change in the
                    chemical constitution of our bodies, independently of the exhaustion of
                    excitability by excess of stimulus. Bilious diseases, and a tendency to
                    unwholesome fatness, are its most common effects; and it is only in the
                    excessive hydrogenation of the system that we can find a rational explanation of
                    that very singular phenomenon called the spontaneous combustion of the body; for
                    even admitting that the clothes are accidentally set on fire in these cases,
                    there appears no reason to doubt that the combustion is continued by the burning
                    of the body itself. Now the greatest number of instances have occurred in old
                    women addicted to the abuse of ardent spirits.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The effects of oxygenous food, in imparting oxygen to the body, are not so well
                    ascertained. Acids, and the subacid fruits, quench thirst, and are supposed to
                    reduce animal heat; but their more obvious action is to affect the bowels and
                    induce diarrhoea, and ultimately to render the body spare and thin. The new
                    chemical pathology led to the exhibition of nitric acid for the cure of
                    syphilis, as mercury was supposed to act by oxygenizing the system; and this
                    acid has since been much employed also, from analogy, in the liver complaint.
                    That the acid has excellent effects as a tonic, seems to be perfectly
                    ascertained. It does not act upon the bowels like the vegetable acids, but there
                    is no proof of its decomposition in the stomach, or of its imparting oxygen to
                    the body. The oxygenizing of the system by means of the nitro-muriatic or
                    oxymuriatic bath, now so fashionable in London, is a mere chimera. Pulmonary
                    consumption was also, at one time, considered as a disease proceeding from
                    superabundant oxygen, and the florid colour of the cheeks was adduced in proof
                    of it.</p>
                <p>No observations have yet been made on the effects of aliments containing an
                    unusually large proportion of carbon, nor has any disease been ascribed to the
                    carbonization of the system.</p>
                <p>It would extend this article much beyond the space we can allot to it, if we were
                    even hastily to sketch the varieties of diet recommended in disease, and to
                    explain their action; but it will not be superfluous to enter a little into the
                    detail of that kind of regimen which has been found by experience to bring
                    animals and man to the highest possible state of health, at least as measured by
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323460" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3460-0025"/> the amount of
                    their physical force, and their power of continuing its exertions. It is to
                    bring animals to this state that constitutes the business of <hi rend="italic"
                    >trainers,</hi> as they are called. Cocks, greyhounds, race-horses, and men, are
                    much more active and vigorous after being trained than in their ordinary
                    condition. They are, in fact, in a higher state of health; and we are fully
                    convinced that, by training, many diseases might be removed, and by living
                    according to the same principles, general ill health might be commonly
                    prevented. The public is very much indebted to Sir John Sinclair for having
                    taken the pains to collect the fullest information on this subject.<note

                    attention was directed to the subject by having the professional care of Captain
                    Barclay during his great walkingmatch. From the answers procured to Mr Bell’s
                    inquiries, it appears that the whole secrets of training reduce themselves to
                    principles which every man may practise, and ought to practise, as far as is
                    consistent with his business and other duties; and, in particular, we think that
                    they ought to be studied, thoroughly understood, and enforced, by all those to
                    whom, in consequence of accidental circumstances, the care of the health and
                    lives of many individuals are intrusted. We allude chiefly to military and naval
                    officers, and the proprietors of large manufactories. In the British navy the
                    importance of this subject has been long appreciated; and the comparative state
                    of health of our fleets, in recent times, is as honourable to our naval
                    commanders as the laurels of victory which encircle their brows. Soldiers are
                    left more to themselves, and their officers have neither the same control nor
                    responsibility; but we think that more might be done in keeping the troops, as
                    well as the military horses, when at home or in garrison, always in a state fit
                    for active service. The evil of not attending to this was very severely
                    experienced during the Spanish campaigns. The artillery horses sent from Chatham
                    were found to be unfit for the fatigues of service, and good cart-horses were at
                    last substituted with great advantage. In garrison both men and horses are
                    over-fed and under-worked. In manufactories the opposite evils sometimes occur;
                    the workmen, and especially the children, are over-worked and under-fed. This
                    subject has lately occupied the attention of parliament; and it is connected
                    with some interesting inquiries, which belong properly to the science of
                    political economy. In a medical point of view, the principle to be followed is,
                    that the food and labour bear a just proportion to each other. When the quantity
                    and quality of the food is not limited by its expense, the best possible
                    condition of the individual is attainable, by attending to the principles upon
                    which training is conducted, and which resolve themselves into temperance
                    without abstemiousness, and regular exercise in the open air. Mr Jackson says,
                    that a man properly trained feels himself light and <hi rend="italic"
                    >corhy,</hi> as the technical phrase is; and that, during a course of training,
                    the skin always becomes clear, smooth, well coloured, and elastic; or that
                    cleanness of skin is the best proof of a man being in good condition. Another
                    very striking effect of training is upon the lungs. Trained men can draw a much
                    fuller inspiration, and retain their breath longer, than others. But it is not
                    only on the state of bodily health that the good effects of training are
                    conspicuous; for Mr Jackson distinctly, and we believe correctly, states, that
                    the mental faculties are always improved, the attention is more ready, and the
                    perceptions are more acute. From these observations some valuable hints may be
                    derived by physicians, for the cure of many cutaneous and pulmonary affections,
                    which obstinately resist the power of medicines.</p>
                <p>Cookery is strictly a branch of dietetics, and one of the most important. Only a
                    small part of our food is consumed as it is furnished by nature. Many alimentary
                    substances are disagreeable, and some even poisonous, until they have undergone
                    certain preparations. Few of them are to be had at all seasons of the year,
                    although produced at others in greater quantity than can be consumed; and all of
                    them occur of very different qualities. Hence the selection, preservation, and
                    preparation of alimentary substances, are arts of primary importance in
                    life.</p>
                <p>We hold the contempt with which cookery is very generally spoken of to be
                    downright affectation, we had almost said hypocrisy; for, in the practice of
                    life, every individual who is not perfectly imbecile and devoid of understanding
                    is an epicure in his own way. The epicures in the boiling of potatoes even are
                    innumerable; and every school-boy in Scotland passes a judgment on the culinary
                    skill of the servant who makes his porridge. Cookery only becomes truly
                    degrading when it occupies an undue proportion of attention; and that epicurism
                    is to be utterly condemned which produces more pain than pleasure. Boswell, the
                    biographer of Johnson, has defined man to be a cooking animal; and, in fact, man
                    is the only animal which does not consume his food as presented to him by
                    nature. We are not from this to conclude that man in cooking deviates from the
                    ordinary course of nature; but that the appetite for cooked food is given to him
                    for wise and useful ends. Count Rumford has not considered the pleasure of
                    eating, and the means that may be employed for increasing it, as unworthy the
                    attention of a philosopher.</p>
                <p>“The enjoyments which fall to the lot of the bulk of mankind are not so numerous
                    as to render an attempt to increase them superfluous. And even in regard to
                    those who have it in their power to gratify their appetites to the utmost extent
                    of their wishes, it is surely rendering them a very important service to show
                    them how they may increase their pleasures without destroying their health.</p>
                <p>“If a glutton can be made to gormandize two hours upon two ounces of meat, it is
                    certainly much better for him, than to give himself an indigestion by eating two
                    pounds in the same time.</p>
                <p>“The pleasure enjoyed in eating depends first upon the agreeableness of the taste
                    of the food; and, secondly, upon its powers to affect the palate. Now there are
                    many substances extremely cheap, by which very agreeable tastes may be given to
                    food, particularly when the basis or nutritive substance of the food is
                    tasteless; and the effect of any kind of palatable solid food (of meat, for
                    instance) upon the organs of taste, may be increased almost indefinitely, by
                    reducing the size of the particles of such food, and causing it to act upon the
                    palate by a larger surface. And if means be used to prevent its being swallowed
                    too soon, which may be easily done by mixing with it some hard and tasteless
                    substance, such as crumbs of bread rendered hard by toasting, or any thing else
                    of that kind, by which a long mastication is rendered necessary, the enjoyment
                    of eating may be greatly increased and prolonged.</p>
                <p>“The idea of occupying a person a great while, and affording him much pleasure at
                    the same time, in eating a small quantity of food, may perhaps appear ridiculous
                    to some; but those who consider the matter attentively will perceive that it is
                    very important. It is, perhaps, as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323473"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3473-0026"/>much so as any thing that can employ the attention
                    of the philosopher.”</p>
                <p>But we shall consider cookery in another point of view, and that one, the
                    importance of which will not be denied by the most austere philosopher. The
                    political economists have extolled agriculture above all other arts, and have
                    obtained the assent of mankind to their dogma, that he who makes two blades of
                    grass grow where only one grew before, is a benefactor to his race. And why?
                    Truly because he thus increases the quantity of food, and enables the world to
                    support a larger population. And is not he who by his skill enables the raw
                    material, whether corn or flesh, furnished to him by the agriculturist, to feed
                    a larger population, or who renders articles alimentary which were formerly
                    rejected, equally a benefactor of his race? Again, every country has its own
                    favourite articles of food, and modes of preparing them; and there is perhaps no
                    subject in regard to which local prejudices are so strong. Now, by bringing
                    these to the test of comparison upon scientific principles, much good would
                    ultimately arise by the gradual introduction into each country of whatever was
                    worthy of imitation in the practice of other nations.</p>
                <p>The learned Krunitz, in his voluminous <hi rend="italic">EconomicoTechnologic
                    Encyclopedia,</hi> has anticipated many of our views of the subject. “The
                    preparation of good food, and the directions for this purpose contained in
                    cookery books, are commonly very much despised, or rather altogether neglected,
                    by literary men. But in itself cookcry does not deserve this contempt, for it is
                    an important part of domestic economy. Upon its due practice depend the health
                    and comfort of families, which must inevitably suffer from errors committed in
                    it. The reason of this contempt is to be found in the manner in which it has
                    hitherto been treated in cookery books, which have been prepared by common
                    cooks, as they are accustomed to dress a ragout. Since the economical arts in
                    general have been discussed scientifically, it is now time that the same
                    attention should be paid to cookery, which is so generally useful, and which is
                    capable of being considered in so many points of view. But then a totally
                    different course from that commonly followed must be pursued. A man of much
                    knowledge, especially physical, chemical, and dietetical, must condescend to
                    apply to the making experiments on vulgar and refined cookery, and collect the
                    whole into a system, as has been done long since in regard to the knowledge and
                    preparation of medicines. What has been written upon dietetics by Zückert,
                    Ber-gius, Lorry, Plenk, and others, must be compared with the practices in
                    different countries, and a general view of the whole must be drawn up and
                    arranged in systematic order. In regard to the preparations themselves, certain
                    fixed processes and principles are to be determined, general operations to be
                    accurately described, and new improvements to be brought forward. After this the
                    subject might be treated in detail, and a variety, first of simple, then of more
                    compound articles, with the best modes of preparing each as to palatableness,
                    and in relation to effect upon the health, should be perspicuously and
                    thoroughly described. Lastly, their combination into bills of fare, adapted to
                    different ranks in society, .modes of life, various tastes, the season of the
                    year, &amp;c. should be pointed out particularly, and with a due regard to good
                    economical arrangements.” (z.)</p>
