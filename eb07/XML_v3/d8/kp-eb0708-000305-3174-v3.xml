                <p><label type="entry">DIAMOND</label>, <hi rend="italic">adamas</hi> of the
                    ancients, <hi rend="italic">almas</hi> of Persia, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >heera</hi> of Hindustan, is the most brilliant of gems; and although known from
                    the remotest times, if we may judge by the casual notice made of it in
                    Scripture, it had in the earlier periods of history obtained little more than a
                    name. Pliny states that it bore a price <hi rend="italic">above all things in
                    the world,</hi> and was known to very few except princes and crowned heads. His
                    meagre remarks on this gem are even less satisfactory than those upon almost any
                    other; which affords another reason to conclude that the diamond still remained
                    in his time an object of great rarity. The localities quoted by Pliny appear to
                    be quite erroneous, at least subsequent observations give us reason to think
                    so.</p>
                <p>Up to the commencement of the eighteenth century diamonds were wholly derived
                    from India, where they were found in detached crystals, accompanied with grains
                    of gold, amongst metallic sand washed down from surrounding mountains. In 1728 a
                    similar territory, loaded with the two most valuable substances in nature, was
                    discovered on the southern continent of the New World. When in pursuit of gold,
                    crystals of diamond were often found; but the labourers being ignorant of their
                    value, laid them aside as curiosities. A miner, who is said to have arrived in
                    Brazil at this time, first directed attention towards them; and, without
                    attempting to appropriate his discovery to his own aggrandisement, he led his
                    comrades to turn their pursuit to the more engaging object. It soon, therefore,
                    attracted the notice of the government, and was shortly afterwards taken
                    possession of in name of the sovereign.</p>
                <p>Hitherto the supply of diamonds was entirely confined to Hindustan and the island
                    of Borneo; and, as might reasonably be expected, the opening of a new field, the
                    extent of which was as yet wholly unknown, could not fail to affect the market.
                    The discredit which was at first thrown upon the accounts from Brazil, as also
                    on the purity and perfection of the stones, repressed the fears of the Asiatic
                    dealers, and the increased demand after the purchase of the Pitt diamond, a
                    circumstance which no doubt rendered that gem far more <hi rend="italic"
                    >recherche</hi> at the gay and luxurious court of France, all tended to increase
                    the demand, and keep it more upon an equilibrium with the increased supply than
                    could possibly have been expected. At a subsequent period, no doubt, the
                    revolution of France interfered with the value of jewels; but the surplus thus
                    produced was soon absorbed by the wealth of Britain, and diamonds of the first
                    water for a long time maintained their ground.</p>
                <p>At the present day this perhaps cannot be said to hold good. As a commercial
                    commodity, diamonds must have suffered depression like all others, and may
                    perhaps be valued at from twenty-five to thirty per cent, particularly those
                    beyond the smallest sizes, under the prices which they bore in the times of
                    Tavernier; although Mawe appears to have been anxious to inculcate a different
                    doctrine. After his examination of the Brazilian district, he says there would
                    be no difficulty in calculating the period requisite to work out the whole of
                    the diamond ground in that country; and as many of the mines of Hindustan are
                    considered as exhausted, the period must come sooner or later when diamonds will
                    be no longer to be had.</p>
                <p>In both countries the gem is confined within the limits of the tropics. In India,
                    Golconda has always been cited as one of its principal repositories, although
                    none was ever found in the immediate vicinity of that fortress, from the
                    circumstance perhaps of the geological character of the neighbourhood, which is
                    entirely syenitic. It may have arisen, however, from the fact, that the diamond
                    mines of Raolconda and Gance Purteeal were situated in the territory of the
                    Kootub Shahee kings of Golconda. When that dynasty was overthrown, and their
                    country occupied by the officers of the Mogul emperors, Golconda ceased to be
                    the capital, and Hyderabad, which is only a few miles distant, became the
                    occasional seat of the new government. The territory in which the mines are
                    situated has since been ceded to the East India Company. It lies near
                    Condapilly, on the northern bank of the Kistna, about fifty miles from the sea,
                    and near the Pass of Bezoara, where the river appears at some period to have
                    forced its way through a chain of hills, and to have emptied an extensive lake
                    which had existed to the westward of them. All attempts to work them have been
                    abandoned, as the produce has ceased to refund the expense of labour. The
                    localities of the diamond in Hindustan are so various that it would be almost
                    endless to enumerate them. Those on the Mahanuddy, with those on the Kistna and
                    at Malla-villy, north-west of Ellore, may be mentioned as probably the most
                    productive of this beautiful gem. The island of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323187" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3187-0004"/>Borneo is the only other
                    eastern locality which can boast of its production. It occurs at Pontiana, in
                    that island, directly under tlw line, and at Benjarmassin, about three degrees
                    south of the equator. Here it is said to be of a quality superior to that of the
                    gems found in the other Indian localities, and to be distinguished in
                    consequence by the name of <hi rend="italic">Landah,</hi> the place they are
                    found in. Here also the diamond occurs in alluvial soil, accompanied with gold.
                    One diamond was found about a century ago, of 367 carats, supposed to be now in
                    the hands <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> chief of Pontiana.</p>
                <p>From Heyne’s account of the working of diamond mines in Hindustan, it seems to
                    afford a very miserable livelihood. He states that the diamond has hitherto been
                    found only in alluvial soil, or in the most recent rocks; and that the stones
                    are not scattered through the whole of these beds, but confined to one rather
                    harder than the rest. The upper stratum, of eighteen inches, consists of sand,
                    gravel, and loam; next there is a deposit of stiff black clay or mud, of about
                    four feet; and next the diamond bed, which is distinguished by a mixture of
                    large rounded stones. It is from two to two and a half feet thick, closely
                    cemented together with clay. Sometimes this stratum is covered with calcareous
                    tuffb. Here shallow pits are excavated, of a few feet in diameter, in such spots
                    as the practice of the workman may induce him to select; he sinks to a depth of
                    a few feet, and searches the bed which he considers most promising for his
                    purposes, and if he meets with little encouragement, he shifts his situation,
                    and proceeds elsewhere. Thus a great deal of the country may be turned to waste
                    and neglected, and, when it comes to be again wrought over more carefully, may
                    give risÈ to the absurd fancy of regeneration.</p>
                <p>The miners, Μ. Voysey <hi rend="italic">(Asiatic Researches,</hi> vol. xv. p.
                    120) says, are of opinion all over India, that the chips and small rejected
                    pieces of former searchers actually increase in size, and in process of time
                    become large diamonds; and he finishes his paper, by hoping that some future
                    mineralogist would ascertain whether there were any foundation for the vulgar
                    opinion of the continual growth of the diamond; particularly as he hoped at some
                    future period to produce undeniable proof of the re-crystallization of amethyst,
                    zeolite, and felspar, in alluvial soil. This respectable gentleman did not live
                    to bring forward his proofs; but had he been doomed to arrive at the age of the
                    patriarchs of old, we are of opinion he would have been puzzled to produce
                    them.</p>
                <p>In Brazil, the diamond is more confined to one spot than in India. The district
                    of Minas Geraes comprehends, as far as we yet know, the whole of the diamond
                    grounds hitherto discovered in the New World. There the workings appear to be
                    carried on more systematically than in India. The operations at the Serra do
                    Frio we have already described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Brazil</hi>
                    (vol. v. p. 199). The Serra do Frio, or cold mountain, is a mountainous
                    platform, having an elevation of from sixteen to eighteen hundred metres. The
                    district over which the diamonds are searched for, extends about sixteen leagues
                    from north to south, by about eight from east to west. It is situated twelve
                    leagues north of Tejuco, on the river Tigitouhonha, which falls into the river
                    San Francisco. By the decomposition of the granite, an agglomerate is formed,
                    composed of rounded white quartz pebbles, and light-coloured sand, to which the
                    natives give the name of cascalho; and it is in this substance that the diamonds
                    are found, along with gold, which is sometimes crystallized. It is exactly
                    similar to some of the samples of the diamond deposits of Hindustan sent to the
                    Royal Society of Edinburgh by Mr Swinton, but differs considerably from others,
                    where a conglomerated sandstone of considerable tenacity has in several
                    instances been sent, as the matrix of the diamond.</p>
                <p>From any thing w e are yet able to judge, it does not appear that the diamond has
                    ever yet been seen in a matrix which could be esteemed its original position.
                    Heyne has given two coloured engravings of diamonds in the ma- . trix, and they
                    have the merit of representing very faithfully specimens of this description we
                    have seen at home; but they are in all probability only diamonds accidentally
                    agglutinated in ferruginous matter having no character of a rock. The Musnuddy,
                    which joins the Mahanuddy, is mentioned as affording an indication which might
                    lead to a favourable result in such an investigation. At its confluence with the
                    Maund River, near Chunderpoor, and not farther down than Sonpoor, it is only on
                    the left bank of the river that diamonds are found. Hence the Maund is the point
                    at which the examination should commence; and if the country can be effectually
                    penetrated, it would be well worthy the attention of some enterprising
                    mineralogist.</p>
                <p>We have no satisfactory geological account of any of the diamond countries; a
                    slight sketch by Voysey, in the article above quoted, is the best that we can
                    refer to. He particularly alludes to a range of hills, called the Nalla Malla,
                    or Blue Mountains, about Cummum, on the Gun-lacummum river, which are composed
                    of schistose rocks, of all varieties, from clay-slate to pure limestone,
                    accompanied with quartz rock, sandstone, sandstone brescia, flinty slate,
                    hornstone slate, and a tuffaceous limestone, containing imbedded, rounded, and
                    angular masses of all these rocks. These are bounded on all sides by granite,
                    which appears to pass under and form the base. The only rock of this formation
                    on which the diamond is found is the sandstone brescia. “I have as yet,” says
                    he, “only visited the rich mines of Banaganpilly (lying in Heyne’s map in 78° 4'
                    by 15° 4'), where the brescia is found under a compact sandstone rock, differing
                    in no respect from that which is found under other parts of the main range. It
                    is composed of a beautiful mixture of red and yellow jasper, quartz, calcedony,
                    and hornstone, cemented together by a quartz paste. It passes into puddingstone,
                    composed of rounded pebbles of quartz, &amp;c. cemented by an argillo-calcareous
                    earth, of a loose friable nature, in which the diamonds are most frequently
                    found.”</p>
                <p>Heyne states, that in some of the mines in India the diamonds are found entirely
                    broken or crushed, and only of value for pounding; but at the same time thinks
                    it must be owing to carelessness. He mentions also that the diamonds of Cuddapah
                    are carried to Madras to be used for the same-purpose, and the price he quotes
                    for a carat of stones fit for brilliants is only seven rupees.</p>
                <p>No crystal in nature is more beautiful than that of the diamond. It is sometimes
                    so pure and so pellucid, with its angles and faces so perfectly symmetrical, as
                    to shine like a dew-drop in the rays of the sun. Its primitive form is that of
                    the equilateral octahedron. It passes into the dodecahedron and the cube,
                    presenting modifications in each. The colourless diamond of the first water is
                    the most valuable; but very fine diamonds sometimes present a deep red tinge,
                    also yellow, orange, green, blue, and black. Those which have a slight tint of
                    yellow are often remarkably brilliant, and are said to be of a superior
                    hardness.</p>
                <p>The value of diamonds is always calculated in carats, which consists of four
                    grains; but it must be remembered, that the diamond grain differs from the Troy
                    grain, as it takes five of the former to weigh four of the latter, or more
                    exactly one carat = 3∙174 gr. Troy.</p>
                <p>In valuing diamonds, either rough or cut, the practice is to take the weight in
                    carats, to square that weight, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193323200"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-3200-0005"/>then to multiply the product by such a rate of
                    price as may correspond to the state and quality of the stone; thus, if a
                    natural crystal of diamond be clear, without flaws, and of a favourable shape,
                    the price by which the square of its weight should be multiplied is L.2; so that
                    if the stone weigh one carat, its value will be L.2, if two carats, 2×2-4, and 4
                    X 2 = 8, or a stone of two carats is worth L.8. A stone of ten carats, in the
                    same way, will give 10 × 10 = 100, and 100 × 2 = L.200, the value of a perfect
                    rough diamond of this weight.</p>
                <p>If the diamond has been worked into a brilliant of just proportions, the same
                    rule is observed of squaring the weight in carats; but a much higher price is
                    used as the multiplier of the product; as L.8 is considered to be the proper
                    multiplier when the stone is perfect in water and shape. Thus a diamond of
                    5ļ-carats gives 301- as its square, and this multiplied by 8 makes L.242 as its
                    price. If the stone has been worked into the form which is termed a rose, L.6 is
                    used as the multiplier; and if it be of the form termed table-cut, it is still
                    lower.</p>
                <p>Considerable modifications, however, must be made in these multipliers, according
                    to the quality of the diamonds and the state of the market. If a brilliant be
                    what is termed “off colour,” that is, not absolutely colourless, or if it be in
                    any other way imperfect in shape or purity, a corresponding diminution must be
                    made in the multiplier. Thus a brilliant with a yellow or a milky hue, or with a
                    small speck or flaw, may not be multiplied by more than L.4, L.5, or L.6,
                    according to the nature or extent of the imperfection. The state of the demand
                    in the market must likewise have great influence. At present the demand for good
                    brilliants of one carat and under is greater in proportion to the supply than
                    for heavier stones, and such stones will therefore sometimes cost L.10 the
                    carat; whilst there being fewer purchases for the larger sizes, they may often
                    be had in commerce at a lower rate than has been mentioned above.</p>

                    named, all else must be left to subsequent arrangement.</p>
                <p>Of the remarkable diamonds we have enumerated, the first is that known by the
                    name of the Regent or Pitt diamond. It was found at Pasteal, in the Golconda
                    district. It was imported into this country by Mr Pitt, governor of Madras, who
                    purchased it from a native for 48,000 pagodas, about L.20,400 at the exchange of
                    the day, and after being offered to different crowned heads in Europe, was
                    purchased by the regent of France in 1717 as a jewel for the crown. It was
                    placed by Napoleon in the hilt of the sword of state, and, according to Brard,
                    the price paid for it was 2,250,000 francs; Jeffreys calls it L.125,000, and
                    other authors say L.130,000. Any of these, however, although by much the largest
                    price ever paid for any jewel, is not equal to the rule of value. This is
                    esteemed the finest and most perfect diamond known.</p>
                <p>The second was purchased for a bit of rock-crystal, on a stall in the
                    market-place of Florence, at the cost of a few pence; it is of a beautiful
                    lemon-yellow colour, and is now in the possession of the house of Austria. The
                    diamond mentioned as the property of the Emperor of Russia ornaments the top of
                    his sceptre. It is of the size of a pigeon’s <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> and is
                    said to have been the eye of an Indian idol pillaged by a deserter from the
                    French service, who had the address to get himself installed as a priest in the
                    service of the Malabar deity at Seringham, as narrated by Dutens. The Empress
                    Catherine purchased it for L.90,000, together with an annuity of L.4000.</p>
                <p>The Great Mogul is described by Tavernier as an irregularly-shaped diamond, but
                    cut and polished. It was found at Colore, in the district of Golconda, in the
                    year 1550; and is said to have weighed 900 carats before cutting, but this
                    appears a most enormous sacrifice. Of the Brazilian diamond some suspicions have
                    been entertained. It has been insinuated that it is only a mass of very fine
                    white coloured topaz, and it is not likely that the king of Portugal will run
                    the hazard of ascertaining the fact.</p>
                <p>The supply of diamonds from Brazil, according to Baron d’Eschwege, during the
                    eighty-four years from 1730 to 1814, was at the rate of 36,000 carats per annum;
                    but the return from the registers of the administration of the diamond mines
                    from 1800 to 1806 was only 19,000 carats. It is also added, that the revenue
                    derived by government during the first period was only eighteen or nineteen
                    francs the carat, whilst from forty to fifty were obtained during the last; a
                    certain indication of a diminished supply. A singular circumstance is noticed
                    with respect to the uniformity of the diamond ground of Do Frio. The same cubic
                    mass of cascalho will yield, on washing, pretty nearly the same number of
                    carats, in large or small diamonds, so that the superintendent can calculate on
                    the probable produce of the washing.</p>
                <p>Large stones do not abound in Brazil, but there are some of considerable
                    dimensions. Mawe mentions one from the little rivulet D’Albaite of 120 carats,
                    but they do not often exceed from eighteen to twenty.</p>
                <p>The prices of diamonds quoted by Heyne, who visited with a scrutinizing eye the
                    principal mines of Hindustan, differ from those laid dow n by the rule of
                    Tavernier and Jeffreys. Without attempting to reconcile them, we shall quote the
                    value which the Hindus put upon what they consider as the best, and denominate
                    the Brahma diamond; it is sold by the manjalin, which is equal to two carats,
                    and each carat at the price of ten pagodas.</p>

                <p>He adds that these are the prices of stones free from speck, flaw, or crack. Cut
                    stones are valued in a different way.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable circumstance in the history of the diamond is to be found in
                    the nature of its composition. This proud, this imperial ornament, which has
                    ever occupied the summit of the diadem, this most brilliant of gems, and hardest
                    of all known bodies, is, after all, but a morsel of charcoal, which has been
                    made to yield to the rays of the sun, and dissolve into a noxious vapour. As
                    early as 1607, Boetius de Boodt threw out the hint that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323213" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3213-0006"/>diamond was inflammable. In
                    1673 Boyle discovered that when it was exposed to a great heat it was dissipated
                    into acrid vapour. In 1694, the experiments of Boyle were confirmed by those of
                    Cosmo III. Grand Duke of Tuscany, with his celebrated burning glass. About the
                    same time, but whether before or not is uncertain, Sir Isaac Newton was led,
                    from the great refractive power of the diamond, to pronounce it “an unctuous
                    substance coagulated.” Lavoisier proved it to be composed of carbon, by throwing
                    the sun’s rays concentrated by a powerful lens upon a diamond inclosed in a
                    vessel with oxygen gas; when the diamond and the oxygen disappeared, and
                    carbonic acid was generated. Sir George Mackenzie repeated the experiments of
                    Boyle in 1800; and, finally, when Sir Humphry Davy visited Florence in 1814, the
                    experiment of the grand duke was performed again with the same lens; and
                    mineralogists no longer hesitated to place the gem amongst inflammable
                    bodies.</p>
                <p>According to Ellicot, the specific gravity of Brazil diamonds is 3∙513, and of
                    India diamonds 3 ’ 519. The former is the mean of four, the latter of ten
                    experiments.</p>
                <p>Diamond cutting was little understood till 1476, when an artist of the name of
                    Berghen, residing at Bruges, introduced the practice of using diamond powder for
                    forming and polishing the facets. Holland, in consequence, long maintained a
                    monopoly of this trade; and to this day the smaller diamonds are almost entirely
                    manufactured for the European market, at Amsterdam. The Pitt diamond was,
                    however, cut and polished in London, as most of the larger sized stones continue
                    to be. It is a very laborious and tedious operation. The grinding into the
                    required form is entirely done by the hand. Two stones are cemented to the ends
                    of tool handles, and rubbed with a powerful pressure against each other, a
                    leaden model being first taken of the rough stone intended to be cut. The faces
                    are thus determined. The two stones are then rubbed together over a little metal
                    box haying a double bottom, the upper one being loose and perforated with small
                    holes, through which the diamond dust passes, and is carefully preserved. The
                    desired form being thus obtained, the dust is afterwards used in polishing the
                    faces of the diamond, mixed up with sweet oil, on a common lapidary’s wheel, and
                    the brilliancy of the gem brought out. The period of constant work required to
                    reduce a stone of between twenty-four and thirty carats to a regular form will
                    extend to at least seven or eight months constant work. The Pitt diamond was
                    said to occupy two years. From the outline in Plate CCII. fig. 1, there was a
                    great deal of extraneous matter to reduce, and that space of time may very
                    likely have been required. When the mass to be removed is of such a size as to
                    render it of importance to keep it entire, the piece is cut off by means of a
                    steel wire, extended on a bow of cane or whalebone, anointed with diamond
                    powder. This process is very commonly adopted in India. The diamond is sometimes
                    also split by means of a chisel under a sharp stroke of a hammer; but this means
                    requires great firmness of mind and dexterity of hand, for a valuable stone is
                    sometimes destroyed by an unlucky blow.</p>
                <p>The forms into which the diamond is cut are the brilliant, the rose, and the
                    table. The first is composed of a principal face, which is called the table,
                    surrounded by a fringe composed of a number of facets, which is all that is
                    visible above the bezil when set. The proportion for the depth should be half
                    the breadth of the stone, terminated with a small face, parallel to the table,
                    and connected with the surface by elongated facets. As the octahedron is the
                    most common natural form of the stone, and the brilliant cut being by far the
                    most advantageous in point of effect, and the most economical form that can be
                    adopted, it is hence preferred. The others are suggested by the shape of the
                    mass.</p>
                <p>The rose is entirely covered with facets on the surface, and is flat below. The
                    table form is adopted in consequence of the shape of the mass, whether crystal
                    or fragment, and produces the least effect. It is principally used in India,
                    where the native jewellers cleave stones into plates, having often a large
                    surface with little proportioned weight or brilliancy, except at the edges,
                    which are ornamented by being cut into facets. The great diamond of the Mogul
                    emperor, called Derriah Noor, is of this description; that called Koh-é-noor is
                    rose-cut.</p>
                <p>Much of the value of diamonds depends on the cutting of the stone. A late
                    celebrated philosopher, who required a piece of diamond for philosophical
                    purposes, found a large mass in the hands of a jeweller. It was of an awkward
                    form, and presented a flaw which very greatly deteriorated its value, as, in
                    consequence of the refraction and reflection which took place within the mass,
                    the flaw seemed to occupy nearly the whole of the interior. The gentleman,
                    however, was not afraid. He paid a large sum for the stone, directed the workman
                    in cutting it, amputated the piece he wanted, separating the flaw, and sold the
                    remainder back to the jeweller, after being properly cut and polished, for
                    double the price he paid for it.</p>
                <p>Hopes were recently excited, that a new diamond district had been discovered in
                    Siberia by the celebrated traveller Humboldt. He thought he had met with
                    appearances in a territory belonging to Count Demidoff, analogous to that of
                    Minas Geraes, and recommended a search for the gem. But as two years have since
                    elapsed without any confirmation of this suggestion, the old localities of Asia
                    and Brazil are likely to remain without competition.</p>

                    also represent the brilliant before it undergoes the process of re-cutting. No.

                    No. 10 and 11, that of the table-cut. The scale No. 12 exhibits the sizes of the
                    set diamond within the bezil, together with the depth of the stone, and the
                    number of carats a diamond of that size is likely to weigh. This estimate can
                    only be an approximation to the exact weight; but the weight of a set stone may
                    thus be very nearly ascertained. No. 13 is the figure of the octahedral diamond
                    seen perpendicularly, with the table traced where the stone should be cut; and
                    No. 14 is the same crystal seen laterally, with the table and the opposite face
                    also traced. By these figures it will be seen how much more advantageous it is
                    to adopt the brilliant form than any other.</p>

                    it is nearly impossible for unpractised eyes to detect the difference. Recently
                    quartz has been used with great effect to form the faces of factitious

                    instrument made of steel or iron, into the point of which a diamond is
                    introduced and fixed by solder. Care must be taken to place the gem so that, by
                    applying the instrument in a particular position, the angle of the crystal will
                    come in contact with the glass.</p>

                <p>Guillim does not approve of blazoning the coats of peers by precious stones
                    instead of metals and colours; but the English practice allows it. Morgan says
                    the diamond is an emblem of fortitude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Diamond</hi><hi rend="italic">Harbour,</hi> a harbour in the
                    western branch of the Ganges, on the Hooghly river, about thirty-four miles
                    below Calcutta in a straight line, but much more by the windings of the river.
                    Here the Company’s ships generally unload, and take in great part of their
                    homeward bound cargoes. There are mooring chains for their accommodation, and
                    storehouses on shore; and in the adjacent villages, consisting of a few thatched
                    houses, with some petty shops, provisions may be purchased. But the place is
                    very unhealthy, especially during the periodical rains in July, August, and
                    September, owing to the exhalations from the swamps, and the heavy dews which
                    fall at night. The country on both sides of the river is infested with
                    tigers.</p>

                    surrounded by shoals, which render it dangerous for boats to land. It has fresh
