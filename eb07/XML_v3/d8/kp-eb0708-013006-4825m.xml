                <p><label type="entry">DOUW, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gerhard</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    painter, was born at Leyden in 1613, and received his first instruction in
                    drawing and design from Bartholomew Dolendo, an engraver, and also from Peter
                    Kouwhoorn, a painter on glass. At the age of fifteen he became a disciple of
                    Rembrandt; and in that famous school he continued for three years, at the
                    expiration of which he found himself qualified to study nature, the most
                    unerring director.</p>
                <p>From Rembrandt he learned the true principles of colouring, and obtained a
                    complete knowledge of the chiaroscuro; but to that knowledge he added a delicacy
                    of pencil, and a patience in working up his colours to the highest degree of
                    neatness, superior to any other master. He therefore was more pleased with those
                    pictures of Rembrandt which were painted in his youth than with those by which
                    he was distinguished in his more advanced age; because the first seemed finished
                    with more care and attention, the latter with more boldness, freedom, and
                    negligence, which was quite opposite to the taste of Douw. But although his
                    manner appears so different from that of his master, yet it was to Rembrandt
                    alone that he owed that excellence in colouring by which he triumphed over all
                    the artists of his own country.</p>
                <p>His pictures are usually of a small size, with figures so exquisitely touched, so
                    transparent, so wonderfully delicate, as to excite astonishment as well as
                    pleasure. He designed every object after nature, and with an exactness so
                    singular, that each object appears as perfect as nature itself, in respect to
                    colour, freshness, and force. His general manner of painting portraits was by
                    the aid of a concave mirror, and sometimes by looking at the object through a
                    frame with many exact squares of fine silk. But the latter custom is disused, as
                    the eye of a good artist seems a more competent rule, though the use of the
                    former is still practised by painters in miniature.</p>
                <p>It is almost incredible what sums have been given and are given at this day for
                    the pictures of Douw, even in his own country, as also in Italy and every polite
                    part of Europe; for he was exceedingly curious in finishing them, and patiently
                    assiduous beyond example. Of that patience Sandrart gives a very strong proof in
                    a circumstance which he mentions relative to this artist. Having once, in
                    company with Bamboccio, visited Gerhard Douw, they could not forbear admiring
                    the prodigious neatness of a picturewhich hewasthen painting,and
                    inparticularnoticed a broom, at the same time expressing their surprise at the
                    excessive neatness of the finishing of that minute object; upon which Douw told
                    them he would spend three days more in working on that broom before he should
                    account it entirely complete. In a family picture of Mrs Spiering, the same
                    author observes, that the lady sat five days for the finishing of one of her
                    hands that leaned on an arm chair. For this reason not many would sit to him for
                    their portraits; and he therefore indulged himself mostly in works of fancy, in
                    which he could introduce objects of still life, and employ as much time on them
                    as suited his own inclination. Houbraken states, that his great patron Mr
                    Spiering allowed him a thousand guilders a year, and paid besides whatever he
                    demanded for his pictures, having purchased some of them for their weight in
                    silver; but Sandrart, with more probability, assures us, that the thousand
                    guilders a year were paid to Gerhard, on no other consideration than that the
                    artist should give his benefactor the option of every picture he painted, for
                    which he was immediately to receive the utmost he demanded. This great master
                    died in 1674, aged sixty-one.</p>
