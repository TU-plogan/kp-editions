                <p><label type="entry">FATA <hi rend="smallcaps">Morgana</hi></label>, a very
                    singular phenomenon, mentioned by different philosophical writers and
                    travellers, who inform us that it is seen in the Straits of Messina, and
                    sometimes denominated the <hi rend="italic">Castles of the Fairy Morgana.</hi>
                    The accounts of this phenomenon differ considerably from one another, and
                    travellers are not agreed as to the causes of its production.Minasi, in his
                    dissertation on the <hi rend="italic">Fata Morgana,</hi> gives a description of
                    this remarkable phenomenon. When the rising sun shines from that point whence
                    its incident ray forms an angle of 45° on the Sea of Reggio, and the bright
                    surface of the water in the bay is not disturbed either by the wind or the
                    current, whilst the spectator is placed on an eminence, with his back to the sun
                    and his face to the sea, there appear on a sudden in the water, as in a
                    catoptric theatre, multiplied objects, numberless series of pilasters, arches,
                    castles well delineated, regular columns, lofty towers, superb palaces, with
                    balconies and windows, extended alleys of trees, delightful plains with herds
                    and flocks, armies of men on foot and horseback, and many other strange images,
                    in their natural colours and proper actions, passing rapidly in succession along
                    the surface of the sea during the whole of the short period of time that the
                    above-mentioned circumstances remain as described. But if, in addition to these
                    circumstances, the atmosphere be highly impregnated with vapour and dense
                    exhalations, not previously dispersed by the action of the wind or waves, or
                    rarefied by the sun, it then happens that in this vapour, as in a curtain
                    extended along the channel to the height of from fifteen to twenty feet, and
                    nearly down to the sea, the same objects are beheld not only reflected from the
                    surface of the sea, but likewise in the air, though not so distinct or well
                    defined as the former objects from the sea.If the air be slightly hazy and
                    opake, and at the same time dewy and adapted to form the iris, then the
                    above-mentioned objects will appear only at the surface of the sea, as in the
                    first case, but all vividly coloured, or fringed with red, green, blue, and
                    other prismatic colours.From this account, then, it appears, that there are
                    three different species of <hi rend="italic">Fata Morgana</hi>; the first, that
                    which appears at the surface of the sea, being denominated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marine Morgana</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the second, that which is seen in
                    the air, called the <hi rend="italic">Aerial Morgana</hi>; and the third, that
                    which is observed only at the surface of the sea, being the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morgana</hi> fringed with prismatic colours. Minasi has attempted to trace (he
                    etymology of the word <hi rend="italic">Morgana,</hi> which, he thinks, is
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">μwος,</hi><hi rend="italic">tristis,</hi> and
                    yακ&gt;⅛ι, <hi rend="italic">laetitia afficio.</hi> This splendid sight affects
                    all descriptions of men with such joy, that they run towards the sea, exclaiming
                    <hi rend="italic">Morgana, Morgana.</hi> The etymology of Minasi, therefore,
                    though it may at first view seem to be a contradiction in terms, will appear not
                    unnatural, when, besides the joy which the Morgana inspires, we take into
                    account the corresponding sorrow or dejection which must be felt when it
                    vanishes away. The same author informs us, that he beheld this magnificent
                    appearance three times, and would rather behold it again than the most superb
                    theatrical exhibition in the world.In his physical and astronomical remarks on
                    this phenomenon, Minasi observes that the sea in the Straits of Messina exhibits
                    the appearance of a large inclined speculum ∙ that, in the alternate current or
                    tide which flows and returns in the straits six hours each way, and is
                    constantly attended by an opposite current along shore to the medium distance of
                    about half a league, there are many eddies and irregularities at the time of the
                    change of its direction· and that the Morgana usually appears at this period. He
                    ascribes the effects produced by it to the supposed inclination of the surface
                    of the sea, and its subdivision into different planes by the contrary eddies;
                    and the effects produced in the air he considers as the result of saline and
                    other effluvia suspended in the air. These appearances are produced by a calm
                    sea, and one or more strata of superincumbent air differing in refractive, and
                    consequently in reflective power, rather than from any considerable change in
                    the surface of the water, with the laws of which we are much better acquainted
                    than with those of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>To this account may be added that given by Houel, whose judgment and accuracy
                    render his authority highly respectable. In fine summer days, says he, when the
                    weather is calm, there arises above the great current a vapour, which acquires a
                    certain density, so as to form in the atmosphere horizontal prisms, the sides of
                    which are disposed in such a manner, that when they come to their proper degree
                    of perfection, they reflect and represent successively, for some time, like a
                    moveable mirror, the objects on the coast or in the adjacent country. They
                    exhibit by turns the city and suburbs of Messina, trees, animals, men, and
                    mountains; and are certainly beautiful aerial moving pictures. There are
                    sometimes two or three prisms, equally perfect; and they continue in this state
                    from eight to ten minutes. After this, some shining inequalities are observed
                    upon the surface of the prism, which render confused to the eye the objects
                    which had before been so accurately delineated, and the picture vanishes. The
                    vapour forms other combinations, and is dispersed in air. Different accounts
                    have been given of this singular appearance, which may perhaps be attributed to
                    a bitumen which issues from certain rocks at the bottom of the sea, and is often
                    seen to cover part of its surface in the Straits of Messina. The subtile parts
                    of the bitumen being attenuated, combined, and exhaled with the aqueous globules
                    which are raised by the air, and formed into bodies of vapour, give to this
                    condensed vapour more consistence, and contribute, by their smooth and polished
                    particles, to the formation of a kind of aerial crystal, which receives the
                    light, reflects it to the eye, and transmits to it all the luminous points which
                    colour the objects exhibited in this phenomenon, and render them visible.</p>
