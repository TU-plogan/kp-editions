                <p><label type="entry">FORGERY</label> (from the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >forger,</hi> signifying <hi rend="italic">accudere, fabricare,</hi> to beat on
                    an anvil, forge, or form), may be defined at common law to be the fraudulent
                    making or alteration of a writing, to the prejudice of another man’s right; or
                    it is the crime of imitating the subscription of another, adhibiting it to a
                    deed, and putting that deed to use by acting under it, receiving property in
                    virtue of it, founding on it as a title to sue or to defend, or transferring it
                    to another. In considering forgery, it is necessary to attend, first, to the
                    mode of proof by which the crime is established; and, secondly, to the
                    punishment which is inflicted on the perpetrator thereof.</p>
                <p>The proof of forgery is either direct or indirect. The direct proof consists in
                    the examination of the writer of the deed, and of the witnesses who sign the
                    deed and attest the subscription. As the subscription of witnesses is an
                    attestation to which the law gives effect to the extent of receiving it on their
                    death as evidence of the regularity of the deed, and as weight is given to the
                    subscription of a witness, even where he does not recollect having adhibited it;
                    so, to cut down a deed regularly attested, the instru-nιentary witnesses, as
                    they are called in Scotland, must be brought to swear to circumstances of
                    sufficient force to invalidate the evidence given by their subscriptions; a
                    species of proof which the law does not and indeed cannot reject. The indirect
                    mode of proof consists in an investigation of all the circumstances from which
                    it may be inferred that the person by whom a deed is said to have been executed
                    actually did not subscribe; as, for instance, an error in the date, an <hi
                    rend="italic">alibi,</hi> the stamp, the contexture of or date <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193754982" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4982-0748"/>impressed upon the paper, or
                    a <hi rend="italic">comparatio</hi><hi rend="italic">literarum.</hi> The
                    comparison of the handwriting is made with genuine subscriptions of the same
                    date as that alleged to have been forged; and where the real subscriptions
                    differ materially from the one founded on, the forgery of the latter may be
                    pronounced on with a considerable degree of certainty. The indirect mode of
                    proof, however, is not resorted to where the direct mode is practicable.</p>
                <p>Until recently the punishment of forgery was not expressly laid down by statute;
                    but by the common law and practice of the country, conviction was usually
                    followed by a capital punishment in all cases of gross forgery; whilst those of
                    less moment, as forgeries of executions, or where the evidence was not in every
                    respect conclusive, were commonly visited with what in Scotland is denominated
                    an arbitrary punishment, that is, with imprisonment or transportation. Latterly,
                    however, the severity of the law in this particular has been considerably
                    mitigated, and the punishment of death restricted to those cases of forgery
                    which are not only the most aggravated in their own nature, but at the same time
                    calculated to prove most extensively injurious to the interests and well-being
                    of society. By the 2d and 3d William IV. c. 123, entitled an “act for abolishing
                    the punishment of death in certain cases of forgery,” it is enacted that where
                    any person shall thereafter be convicted of any offence whatsoever for which the
                    1st William IV. c. 66 (entitled an “act for reducing into one all such forgeries
                    as shall hereafter be punished with death, and for otherwise amending the laws
                    relative to forgery”) enjoins or authorizes the infliction of the punishment of
                    death, or for any offence which shall consist wholly or in part of forging or
                    altering any writing, instrument, matter, or thing whatsoever, or of offering,
                    uttering, or disposing of any writing, instrument, matter, or thing whatsoever,
                    knowing the same to be forged or altered, or of falsely personating another,
                    such offender shall not suffer death, or have sentence of death awarded against
                    him, but shall be transported beyond seas for the term of such offender’s life.
                    But it is at the same time specially provided that nothing in this act shall be
                    construed to extend to the forging or altering, offering, uttering or disposing
                    of, knowing the same to be forged or altered, any will, codicil, or testamentary
                    writing, with intent to defraud any body corporate or person whatsoever, or of
                    forging or altering, or of uttering knowing the same to be forged, any power of
                    attorney or other authority to transfer any share or interest in any stock,
                    annuity, or other fund, transferable at the Bank of England or South-Sea House,
                    or Bank of Ireland, or to receive any dividend payable in respect of such share
                    or interest, with intent to defraud any body corporate or person whatsoever, or
                    of procuring, aiding, or assisting in the commission of such offences, for all
                    which offences the punishment of death is to continue the same as if this act
                    had not been passed. And further, by 2d and 3d William IV. c. 44, it is enacted
                    that persons punishable with transportation for life under the foregoing act
                    shall be liable, previously to their being transported, in case the court before
                    which they are convicted shall think fit, to be imprisoned, with or without hard
                    labour, in the common gaol or house of correction, or to be confined in the
                    penitentiary for any term not exceeding four years nor less than one. Such is
                    now the state of the law on this subject. As it formerly stood its excessive
                    severity had rendered it to a certain extent inoperative; for as the natural
                    feelings of mankind revolt at the indiscriminate sacrifice of human life for
                    offences of a secondary description, judges and juries had tacitly combined to
                    evade giving it effect in the less aggravated class of cases, and thus to
                    reconcile with public opinion the practical administration of justice in this
                    particular. But as all such evasions, however humane in their spirit, are
                    pregnant with manifold evils, it is to be hoped that the mitigation which has
                    taken place will augment the efficacy of the law by increasing the certainty of
                    the punishment it awards, and that hence will result a diminution in the number
                    of offences of this kind, which the excessive but irregular severity of the law,
                    as it formerly stood, had failed to produce. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
