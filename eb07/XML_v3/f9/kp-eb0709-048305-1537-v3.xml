                    Gabriel</hi></label>, a celebrated anatomist and surgeon of the sixteenth
                    century, was born at Modena in 1523. Although he taught anatomy with great
                    distinction, and enjoyed an immense reputation, the details of his life are not
                    exactly known, and have been variously related by different biographers; some,
                    as Tomma-sini and Ghilini, fixing his birth in 1490, which is a manifest error,
                    refuted by F ’ allopius himself; and others, again, contending that he was the
                    disciple of Vesale, although Martine and Haller attest the contrary. But be this
                    as it may, Fallopius made great progress in medical study, first at Ferrara
                    under Antonio Musa Brassavola, and afterwards at Padua. For a time, indeed, he
                    possessed a canonry in the cathedral of Modena; but he soon renounced this
                    function, which prevented him from indulging his taste for dissection. After
                    having taught anatomy for some months in the university of Ferrara, and during
                    three years in that of Pisa, he was chosen by the senate of Venice, in 1551, to
                    fill the chair of anatomy and surgery at Padua. He was, besides, entrusted with
                    the demonstration of medicinal plants, and the inspection of the botanic garden,
                    which he enriched with several vegetables collected during his travels in Italy,
                    France, and Greece. But whilst discharging with equal zeal and distinction the
                    various duties which these functions imposed upon him, his career was suddenly
                    arrested by death, on the 9th of October 1562, before he had attained the
                    fortieth year of his age. Fallopius only published a single work, which is not
                    voluminous, but full of curious facts and useful discoveries; it is entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Observationes</hi><hi rend="italic">Anatomie(e,</hi> Venice, 1561,
                    in 8vo, also, Padua, 1562, Paris, 1562, Cologne, 1562, Helmstadt, 1588; and
                    certainly forms an epoch in the annals of anatomical science. It is the first
                    work, indeed, in which we find the exact osteology and angiology of the foetus;
                    notions perfectly sound in regard to the epiphyses; and a luminous description
                    of the delicate and complicated organ of hearing. The illustrious author clearly
                    makes known the cochlea, the demi-circular canals, and the tortuous canal, which
                    still bears the name of Fallopius. He describes, with a care formerly unknown,
                    the ethmoid and sphenoid bones, the alveolar processes in which the teeth are
                    encased, and the arteries, with the veins and nerves connected with them. He has
                    likewise bequeathed his name to the ligament which runs from the anterior point
                    of the ileon to the symphysis pubis. He points out, sometimes individually, at
                    other times with more of method and detail, the occipital, palatine, laryngian,
                    pharyngian, and pyramidal muscles of the abdomen; also the auricular, ocular,
                    and facial muscles; together with the elevator of the eyebrow, and the sphincter
                    of the bladder. Less profound in the knowledge <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193751550" xml:id="kp-eb0709-1550-0484"/>of the vessels, he
                    nevertheless enriched that portion of anthropotomy. Before his time anatomists
                    had the most confused and inaccurate ideas respecting the sinus of the spinal
                    marrow, the carotid, meningean, and ethmoidal arteries, the jugular and
                    vertebral veins, and the origin of the artery of the penis. Nor was neurology
                    less indebted to the researches of Fallopius, who discovered the fourth pair of
                    nerves, enumerated the three branches of the fifth, and completed the
                    description of the eighth. Lastly, he carried the same critical spirit into
                    splanchnology in general, over which he diffused much light, particularly in
                    regard to the different sets of apparatus for secreting the bile, the urine, and
                    the semen; and he also traced an excellent description of the clitoris, of the
                    round ligaments, and of the extremities of the womb. To this enumeration of the
                    anatomical labours of Fallopius it may be added, that he was powerfully seconded
                    in his efforts by the principal men of the state. The protection afforded him by
                    the grand duke of Tuscany was carried a length which may probably strike our
                    readers with horror: <hi rend="italic">Princeps jubet</hi><hi rend="italic">ut
                    nobis dent</hi><hi rend="italic">hominem, quem</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >anatomisamus.</hi> The unfortunate men here alluded to were no doubt criminals;
                    yet it is impossible to avoid being shocked beyond expression by the perusal of
                    these words. The lectures of Fallopius were published, after his death, by
                    several of his disciples; but none of the latter seems to have performed this
                    task in a manner either creditable to himself or worthy of the great teacher of
                    anatomy by whom they were delivered.</p>
