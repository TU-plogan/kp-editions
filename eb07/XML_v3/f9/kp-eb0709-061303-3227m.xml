                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">FLAMSTEED, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, an eminent
                    English astronomer, and the first who obtained the appointment of
                    astronomerroyal, was born at Derby in the year 1646. He was educated at the free
                    school of Derby, where he was head scholar at fourteen years of age, at which
                    period his constitution, naturally delicate, sustained a severe trial by an
                    attack of illness. When some of his companions went to the university, the state
                    of his health prevented him from accompanying them. He afterwards met with a
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De Sphaera,</hi> by Sacrobosco, a work which, being
                    perfectly suited to the natural turn of his genius, he perused with uncommon
                    satisfaction, translating as much of it into English as he thought could be
                    necessary for him; and from the <hi rend="italic">Astronomia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Carolina:</hi> of Street he learned the method of calculating
                    eclipses, and ascertaining the places of the planets. Mr Hatton, a
                    mathematician, sent him Kepler’s <hi rend="italic">Tabul(e Rudolphlnoe,</hi> and
                    Riccioli’s <hi rend="italic">Almagestum Novum,</hi> together with some other
                    astronomical works to which he was as yet a stranger. In 1669 he calculated an
                    eclipse of the sun, which had been omitted in the Ephemerides, together with
                    five appulses of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753240"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-3240-0614"/>the moon to fixed stars, and sent them to Lord
                    Brouncker, then president of the Royal Society, who submitted them to the
                    examination of that learned body, by whom they were greatly applauded, and
                    Flamsteed received lettersorthanks from Mr Oldenburg the secretary, and from Mr
                    John Collins, one of the members. In 1670, being invited by his father to come
                    up to London, in order that he might become personally acquainted with his
                    learned correspondents, he gladly accepted the invitation, and had an interview
                    with Mr Oldenburg and Mr Collins, by the latter of whom he was introduced to Sir
                    Jonas Moore, who became his warm friend and patron. In consequence of this
                    journey he became acquainted with many astronomical instruments, and was
                    presented with Townley’s micrometer by Sir Jonas Moore, who also assisted him in
                    procuring glasses at a moderate rate for the construction of telescopes. On his
                    way home he paid a visit to Dr Barrow and Mr, afterwards Sir Isaac Newton, at
                    Cambridge, and entered himself as a student of Jesus College.</p>
                <p>In the year 1672, he made large extracts from the letters of Gascoigne and
                    Crabtree, by which his knowledge of dioptrics was much improved; and during the
                    same year he made a number of celestial observations when the weather would
                    permit, which were afterwards published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions-</hi> In 1673 he composed a treatise on the true and apparent
                    diameters of the planets, when at their greatest and least distances from the
                    earth; a work from which even Newton himself did not scruple to borrow, and of
                    which he made some use in his <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> in 1685. In 1674,
                    Flamsteed published an Ephemeris, in which he exposed the folly and absurdity of
                    astrology; and the same year he drew up a table of the tides for the use of the
                    king, with an astronomical account of their ebbing and flowing, which Sir Jonas
                    Moore assured him would be well received by his majesty. Sir Jonas received from
                    Mr Flamsteed a pair of barometers, with directions how to use them, which he
                    presented to the king and the duke of York, to whose notice he embraced every
                    opportunity of introducing Mr Flamsteed.</p>
                <p>Having taken the degree of master of arts at Cambridge, he formed the resolution
                    of entering into holy orders, when Sir Jonas wrote to him to come to London,
                    where he had an appointment for him very different from any in the church. But
                    as Sir Jonas found that nothing could induce him to abandon the resolution he
                    had formed, he obtained for him a situation which was perfectly consistent with
                    the charac ter of a clergyman. This was the new office of astronomer to the
                    king, with a salary of L.100 per annum. In Easter 1675, he received ordination
                    at Ely-House by Bishop Gunning; and on the 10th of August the same year was laid
                    the foundation stone of the royal observatory at Greenwich, which received the
                    designation of Flamsteed-House, in honour of the first astronomer-royal. Till
                    this edifice was erected, he made his observations in the queen’s house at
                    Greenwich; and in 1681 Flamsteed’s <hi rend="italic">Doctrine of the Sphere</hi>
                    was published by Sir Jonas Moore in his <hi rend="italic">System of the
                    Mathematics.</hi> But notwithstanding his extraordinary merit, he never rose
                    higher in the church than the living of Burslow in Surrey, although he was held
                    in deserved estimation by the greatest men in the nation. He corresponded with
                    Sir Isaac Newton, Dr Halley, Mr Molyneux, Dr Wallis, and many others; whilst Μ.
                    Cassini and he commenced their respective discoveries with the utmost confidence
                    and cordiality. But none of his works contributed so much to establish his fame
                    as his <hi rend="italic">Histοτiα Coelestis Britannica^</hi> in three volumes
                    folio. Mr Flamsteed was suddenly carried off by a stranguary, on the 31st of
                    December 1719, having, notwithstanding the extreme delicacy of his constitution,
                    and incessant labour, reached the seventy-third year of his age. "</p>
