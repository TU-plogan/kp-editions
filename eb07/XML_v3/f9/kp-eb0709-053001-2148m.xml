                <p><label type="entry">FEZZAŃ</label>, a country of considerable extent in Northern
                    Africa, and situated to the south of Barbary. Its northern boundary is the well
                    of Bonjem, which is situated in lat. 30. 35. 32. N. South of this point it
                    extends, according to Captain Lyon, six degrees and a half of latitude, or about
                    450 miles, and is bounded in that quarter by what are called the Wells of
                    Meshroo. To the south and south-east is the country of the Tibboos, to the
                    south-west that of the nomadic Tuaricks, and to the north-west the borderers are
                    Arabs. Of this tract of country it is calculated that about 300 miles,
                    stretching from north to south, are cultivated. The greatest breadth is
                    estimated at 200 miles; but the Black Haratch to the east, and other deserts to
                    the south and west, are, according to Horneman, included in its territory.
                    Fezzan may be said to consist of a chain of verdant islands embosomed in an
                    ocean of sand. Fine yellow sand, and a species of gravel, cover the whole
                    surface of the plains, except where the Soudah and Haratch extend. It is only in
                    the immediate neighbourhood of towns that the palm is cultivated, and that corn
                    and esculent plants, of which a little is raised with great difficulty and
                    labour, are produced. The plains of the desert consist of red sand and
                    sand-stone, containing gypsum and rock-salt, associated with beds of dolomite
                    and carbonate of lime. Soda, alum, saltpetre, and sulphur, are also found in
                    this country.</p>
                <p>In order to convey as clear and intelligible a view of Fezzan as possible, we
                    shall follow the route generally pursued by travellers in proceeding from
                    Tripoli to Mourzouk, the capital, and thence to the other parts of the country
                    which have been described. About half a mile beyond the walls of Bonjem, which
                    is the northern frontier, stands a Roman castle, situated amongst some high sand
                    hills. It is of an oblong form, having in the centre of each of the walls a
                    large arched gateway, between two strong towers. After leaving this interesting
                    ruin, the traveller proceeds over a barren desert called Klia, the soil of
                    which, where clear of sand, consists of gypsum intermixed with numerous shells.
                    Twenty-two miles from Bonjem the road leads through a defile called Hormut
                    Emhalla, or the Pass of the Army. After crossing a range of table-mountains
                    called Elood, running north-east and south-west, it passes through a stony and
                    very uneven plain, encircled with mountains, to the pass of Hormut Tazzet, which
                    appears to be situated about sixty miles from Bonjem. After clearing this pass,
                    the road opens upon a plain called El Grarat Arab Hoon. The journey now becomes
                    harassing, on account of the scarcity of vegetation and water, and the frequency
                    of sand-winds. The first place of importance that is met with on this route is
                    Sockna, near which are a plantation of palms and two wells of fresh water.</p>
                <p>Sockna, which is about half way between Tripoli and Mourzouk, is situated on an
                    immense plain of gravel. It is bounded to the south by the Soudah Mountains, at
                    the distance of about fifteen miles; to the eastward by the mountains of Wadan,
                    at the distance of about thirty miles; to the westward by a distant range of
                    hills; and to the northward by the country above described. The town, which is
                    about a mile in circumference, is walled, and contains, according to Major
                    Denham, considerably more than 3000 persons. The streets are very narrow, and
                    the houses are built of mud mixed with small stones. The water is almost all
                    brackish or bitter. In the immediate neighbourhood there are several hundred
                    thousand date trees, which pay duty to the government. Sockna pays of duty
                    annually about 2000 dollars, exclusively of a tax of one dollar on every 200
                    date trees. The Tripoli money is the currency of Sockna; and this occasions a
                    considerable loss to the traders, who are obliged to pay their taxes in Spanish
                    dollars, which they purchase at exorbitant prices. The dates grow in a belt of
                    sand, at the distance of two or three miles from the towns; and then-quality is
                    far superior to any produced in the north of Africa, in consequence of which
                    they bring a very high price in Tripoli. In the gardens situated about three
                    miles from Sockna, barley, maize, a small quantity of onions, and a few other
                    garden-stuff’s, are cultivated. But there is little or no other kind of
                    vegetation, so that all the animals are fed on dates. This place is infested
                    with an immense quantity of flies, attracted probably by the dates, which are
                    preserved in storehouses. The men have in general a clean and neat appearance,
                    whilst the women are pretty and handsome, but remarkable, it seems, for their
                    love of intrigue. The latitude of Sockna is 29. 5. 36. N.</p>
                <p>Ten miles east by south from Sockna stands the town of Hoon. It is smaller than
                    the former, but is built and walled in the same manner. Palm groves and gardens
                    approach close to the walls of the town, and completely conceal it. The soil is
                    sand, but it is fertilized and refreshed by little streams from wells of
                    brackish water. Twelve miles east by north of Hoon stands the town of Wadan. Its
                    external aspect is pleasing, being built upon a conical hill, on the top of
                    which are some enclosed houses called the castle; but internally it is inferior
                    to the two other towns in point of neatness, comfort, and convenience. There is
                    here a well of great depth, cut through the solid rock. The bulk of the
                    inhabitants of Wadan are <hi rend="italic">schereefs,</hi> that is, pretended
                    descendants of the Prophet, and Arabs who act as shepherds. A few miles eastward
                    of the town there is a chain of mountains, which, with the town itself, derives
                    its name from a species of buffalo called <hi rend="italic">wadan,</hi> which is
                    found here in immense numbers. There is also a great abundance of ostriches
                    amongst these mountains, by hunting which many of the natives obtain a
                    subsistence. At all the three towns, Sockna, Hoon, and Wadan, it is the practice
                    to keep tame ostriches in a stable, and in two years to take three cuttings of
                    the feathers.</p>
                <p>The whole way to Mourzouk is now an almost uninterrupted succession of stony
                    plains and gloomy wadys, with no water but that of wells, generally muddy,
                    brackish, or bitter, and placed at widely extended intervals. Sand winds also
                    prevail, and their visitations are at all times harassing, and not unfrequently
                    destructive. Several towns or villages are situated in this long and dreary
                    waste, and they are usually encircled with groves of palm. Sebha, whip stands in
                    latitude 27. 3. 8. N., is a mud-walled town, picturesquely situated on a rising
                    ground, and surrounded by a palm grove. Two marches farther on lies Ghroodwa, a
                    small and miserable collection of mud huts. The palms here, which are the
                    property of the sultan, extend from ten to fifteen miles east and west. The
                    leading features of the above remarkable tract of country may be shortly
                    described. The basaltic chain known by the name or θ Soudah, or Jebel Assoud,
                    that is, Black Mountains, commences near Sockna, and extends from north to south
                    three <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752161" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2161-0531"/>days’
                    journey, but in so tortuous· a direction as not, according to Major Denham, to
                    exceed thirty-five miles in a straight line. Captain Lyon, however, is of
                    opinion that they stretch nearly a hundred miles from north to south between the
                    parallels of 28. 40. and 27. 30. To the westward they extend as far as the well
                    of Assela, on the road to Shiati, a district to the westward of Sebha, where the
                    red clay hills continue unbroken, and unite with those of Benioleed in Tripoli.
                    To the east they extend three days to a wady called Temelleen, which lies on the
                    way to Zella or Zala near Barca. They form, indeed, a branch or continuation of
                    the mountainous desert called Haratch el Assouan which was traversed by Horneman
                    in his route from Cairo to Mourzouk. That traveller gives a fearful description
                    of this wild region, so much dreaded by those who have had to traverse it. The
                    mountain presents the appearance of an imperfect cone, and the rock, upon
                    fracture, seemed to Horneman to consist of ferruginous basalt. Range upon range
                    of black and dreary mountains, intersected by narrow and dismal ravines rather
                    than valleys, rose before his view. Here and there, however, the eye was
                    relieved by the sight of patches of vegetation, approaching even to luxuriance,
                    from the rains which fall in this hilly region. Contiguous to the Black lies the
                    White Haratch, a chain of mountains composed of friable limestone, and abounding
                    in petrifactions. To the south of Sockna, the description of the Jebel Assoud,
                    as given by Major Denham, exactly corresponds to that of the Black Haratch. Dr
                    Oudney describes the hills as from 400 to 600 feet in height, the tops being in
                    general tabular, but a few are irregular, and two or three terminate in conical
                    peaks. The sides of all of them are covered with a considerable quantity of
                    debris. Captain Lyon says the chain rises to an elevation of 1500 feet. The
                    lower stratum of these hills is limestone mixed with a reddish day, superimposed
                    upon which are large masses of tabular basalt and irregular precipices, so
                    common to this formation; whilst the sides occasionally present the usual
                    steplike appearance, and in many instances are overhung by pillars, curved,
                    inclined, and perpendicular. The whole exhibits a scene of barrenness which,
                    according to Major Denham, cannot be perfectly described, either by poet or
                    painter. After these dreary wastes have been passed, the hills of Zeghren
                    commence. They run nearly east and west, are low, long, oval, and truncated at
                    the top, and altogether different from any others which Denham and Oudney had
                    seen. The town of Zcghren, according to the former traveller, is better built
                    than any other in Fezzan.</p>
                <p>Mourzouk, the capital of Fezzan, which stands in latitude 25. 54. N. and
                    longitude 15. 52. E ., is a walled town, containing about 2500 inhabitants, who
                    are blacks, and who do not, like the Arabs, change their residence. The walls
                    are built of mud, but sufficiently thick and high to guard the place from
                    attack. As a substitute for stones, which are not to be found, the people use
                    baked clay, a substance which is found sufficiently durable, as rain is here
                    unknown. The houses are generally of one story; the doors are low and without
                    hinges, but made to move upon a pivot. The streets are small and narrow, but
                    there are numerous open spaces, destitute of buildings, and covered with sand,
                    on which the camels of the traders remain. Many palms grow in the town, and a
                    few red peppers and onions are cultivated. The street of entrance is a place
                    about a hundred yards broad, leading to the walls which surround the castle, and
                    is extremely elegant. The castle itself is an immense mud edifice, about ninety
                    feet in height, and furnished with small battlements immensely broad at the
                    base, but gradually tapering to about four feet in thickness at the top. Like
                    all the rest of the buildings, the castle has no pretensions to regularity. It
                    is the residence of the sultan, whose apartments are of the best quality,
                    although, on account of the enormous mass of wall, all the rooms are of very
                    small dimensions. The more spacious houses in Mourzouk are constructed in the
                    manner which we shall now endeavour to describe. A large door, sufficiently high
                    to admit a came], opens into a broad passage, in which there is a stable, and
                    near it a room for slaves. Opposite the stable is a large square apartment, the
                    roof of which is supported by palm trees. In the centre of the roof is an open
                    space, through which the apartment is lighted, for al] the houses are destitute
                    of windows. There is generally a divan or seat of mud about eighteen inches high
                    and twelve feet long. From the sides of the large room, doors open into the
                    smaller ones, and a passage leads into a yard which has small houses attached to
                    it, and a well. There are sixteen mosques in Mourzouk, which are covered in, but
                    some of these are very small. The principal one is a low building, destitute of
                    elegance. The burying places are outside the walls, and of considerable extent.
                    Owing to the want of wood, no coffins are used; the bodies are merely wrapped in
                    a mat or linen cloth, and covered with palm branches, over which the earth is
                    thrown. The men of the lower orders of Mourzouk wear a large shirt of white or
                    blue cotton, with long loose sleeves, trousers of the same, and sandals of
                    camel’s hide; but the shirt being in general long, many have no other covering.
                    Those of the better sort, however, attire themselves more gaily; and their dress
                    nearly resembles that of the people of Tripoli. The men have little beard, which
                    they likewise keep closely clipped. The dress of the women here differs
                    materially from that generally worn by Moorish females, and their appearance is
                    by no means prepossessing. They plait their hair in thick bobbins, which hang
                    over the forehead, and anoint it so profusely with oil, that this liquid drips
                    down over the face and clothes. From the back hair, however, ornaments of silver
                    or coral are suspended. Other parts of the face and head, such as the ears, are
                    profusely adorned. A woollen handkerchief is fastened to the back of the head,
                    and falling over, is tied by a leather strap under the chin. A blue shirt is
                    generally worn; and a jereed and red slippers complete their equipment. Some of
                    the better class of women wear trousers, and all adorn their persons according
                    to their rank and importance. Both men and women have a singular custom of
                    stuffing their nostrils with a twisted leaf of onions or clover, which has a
                    very disgusting appearance. The natives have a variety of dances, two or three
                    of which are peculiar to the country. In Mourzouk the luxuries of life are very
                    limited, the people subsisting principally on dates. Many of them do not taste
                    corn for months together; but when obtained, it is made into cakes, which are
                    baked in ovens formed of clay in holes in the earth, and heated by burning wood.
                    Tobacco is very generally chewed by the women, as well as by the men; but
                    smoking is the amusement of a great man only.</p>
                <p>The revenues of the sultan of Fezzan arise from slaves, merchandise, and dates.
                    For every slave that enters his dominions he receives two Spanish dollars (in
                    some years the number of slaves amounts to 4000); for a camel’s load of oil or
                    butter, seven dollars; for a load of beads, copper, or hardware, four dollars;
                    and for one of clothing, three dollars. All Arabs who buy dates pay a dollar of
                    duty on each load before they are allowed to remove it; an impost which, at
                    times, is equal to the market price of the article. Above 30 ĴO loads are sold
                    to them annually. Date trees, excepting those of the kadi and Mamelukes, are
                    taxed at the rate of one dollar for every 200. By this duty, in the
                    neighbourhood of Mourzouk, or, more properly, in the few neighbouring villages,
                    the sultan receives yearly about 10,000 dollars. Of all sheep or goats he is
                    entitled to a fifth. On the sale <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752174"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-2174-0532"/>of every slave he has, in addition to the head
                    money, a dollar and a half, which, at the rate of 4000 slaves annually, gives
                    6000 dollars. The captured slaves are sold by auction, at which the sultan’s
                    brokers attend, bidding high only for the finest. The trees which are his
                    private property produce about 6000 camel-loads of dates, each of 4001bs.
                    weight, which may be estimated at about 18,000 dollars. Every garden pays a
                    tenth part of the corn produced. The gardens are very small, and are watered
                    with great labour from braekish wells, as rain is unknown, and dews never fall.
                    Pomegranate trees and fig trees are sometimes planted in the water channels.
                    Presents of slaves are frequently made, and fines levied. Each town pays a
                    certain sum, which is small; but as the towns are numerous, the average amount
                    may be estimated at 4000 dollars. Add to this the annual excursions for slaves,
                    sometimes bringing 1000 or 1500, of which one fourth are the sultan’s property,
                    as well as the same proportion of camels. He alone can sell horses, which he
                    buys for five or six dollars, when half starved, from the Arabs, who come to
                    trade, and cannot maintain them, and makes a great profit by obtaining slaves in
                    exchange for them. All his people are fed by the public, and he has no money to
                    pay, excepting to the pasha, which was formerly 15,000 dollars per annum. There
                    are various other modes by which he extorts money. If a man dies childless, the
                    sultan inherits the greater part of his property; and if he thinks it necessary
                    to kill a man, he becomes his sole heir.</p>
                <p>In Mourzouk about a tenth part of the population are in a state of slavery. There
                    are some white families, who are denominated Mamlukes, being descended from
                    renegades, whom the pasha had presented to the former sultan. These families and
                    their descendants are considered as noble, and, however poor and humble their
                    situation may be, they are not a little vain of their title.</p>
                <p>The general appearance of the men of Fezzan is plain, and their complexion is
                    black; the women are of the same colour, and ugly in the extreme. Neither sex
                    are remarkable for figure, height, strength, vigour, or activity; and they have
                    a very peculiar east of countenance, which distinguishes them from other blacks.
                    But they are a cheerful people, fond of daneing and mnsie, and obliging to each
                    other. The men almost all read and write a little; but in every thing else they
                    are very dull and heavy, their affections being cold and selfish, and a kind of
                    general indifference to the common incidents of life marking all their actions.
                    In Mourzouk the men drink a quantity of <hi rend="italic">lachbi,</hi> as also a
                    liquor called <hi rend="italic">busa,</hi> which is prepared from dates. The
                    Arabs generally practise hospitality; but amongst the Fezzanese that virtue does
                    not exist. They are, however, very attentive and obsequious to those in whose
                    power they are, or who can repay them tenfold for their pretended
                    disinterestedness. Their religion enjoins that, should a stranger enter whilst
                    they are at their meals, he must be invited to partake; but they generally
                    contrive to evade this injunction by eating with closed doors. The lower classes
                    are, from necessity, very industrious; but amongst people of rank industry is
                    not a characteristie virtue. In regard to morals, they are much upon a level
                    with the people of Tripoli, being both dishonest and insincere. Falsehood is not
                    looked upon as odious unless it be detected.</p>
                <p>The lower classes work neatly in leather; they weave a few coarse barracans, and
                    work iron in a solid although clumsy manner. A few likewise work in gold and
                    silver with tolerable skill; and every man is capable of acting as a carpenter
                    or mason. The wood being that of the date tree, and the houses built of mud,
                    very little elegance or skill is required in their construction.</p>
                <p>From the constant communication with Bornou and with Soudan, the languages of
                    both these countries are generally spoken, and many of their words are
                    introduced into the Arabic; but the pronunciation is very different from that of
                    the east. Their writing is in the Mogrebyn characters; but they have no idea of
                    arithmetic, and reckon every thing by dots on the sand, ten in a line. Though
                    very fond of poetry, they are incapable of composing it. The Arabs, however,
                    compose a few little songs, which the natives have much pleasure in learning.
                    The women are kept in a state of abject subordination, as is indeed common in
                    all Mahommedan nations. The authority of parents over their children is very
                    great, in faet, unnecessarily despotic. There are no written records of events
                    among the Fezzanese, and their traditions are so disfigured, and so strangely
                    mingled with religious and superstitious falsehoods, that no confidence whatever
                    can be placed in them. Several scriptural passages are selected and believed.
                    The Psalms of David, the Pentateuch, the books of Solomon, and many extracts
                    from the inspired writers, are universally known, and most reverentially
                    considered.</p>
                <p>The only towns of any consideration in Fezzan, besides those already described,
                    are Zuela, towards the eastern frontier, on the road to Egypt; Germa, to the
                    west; and Garione, on the road to Bornou. In 1822, Dr Oudneyand Captain
                    Clapperton visited Germa, which lies towards the western frontier. It is a
                    walled town, and surrounded by a ditch. At a little distance from it stands the
                    remains of ancient Germa, which appears to have occupied more space than the
                    modern town. It was formerly the capital of Fezzan, and once gave its name to
                    the nation of the Garamantes; at least, unless there are two places of the same
                    name, this must be the ancient Garama, which is described by Pliny as a fine
                    city, the capital of Fazania. The inhabitants of the modern town are very poor,
                    and many of the houses are in ruins. The aspect of the country between this
                    place and Mourzouk is similar to that of the other portions of Fezzan which we
                    have already described. The hills, which stand about a hundred yards apart, are
                    composed of sandstone, finely interstratified with beds of blue and white
                    pipe-clay and alum slate. There is a valley of considerable dimensions, and also
                    several villages. The number of date trees in the eastern and western divisions
                    of this valley is very great. There is here a town callecl Khraik, situated
                    amidst some fine groves of palm trees, and possessing cultivated patches of
                    ground and wells of good water.</p>
                <p>The eastern and southern portions of Fezzan were visited by Captain Lyon. In
                    latitude 25. 55. stands the town öt Traghan, which was formerly a place as
                    considerable as Mourzouk. It is situated in a flat desert plain, with its
                    gardens and date groves at a short distance, and contains four mosques; but most
                    of the houses, which are large, are in ruins, and the population is very
                    trifling. Major Denham says that carpets are manufactured here equal to those of
                    Constantinople. The route to Zuela lies entirely through salt plains and stony
                    deserts, with here and there a small village. Zuela, or Zuila, is situated in
                    latitude 26.11.48. It was formerly a considerable place, but is now only about a
                    mile in circumference. It contains three mosques and three gates, but there are
                    few good houses in it. The inhabitants arê nearly all white; and Captain Lyon
                    observes, that “they are certainly the most respectable, hospitable, and quiet
                    people in Fezzan; and their whole appearance, for they are handsome, and very
                    neatly dressed, bespeaks something superior to the other whites.” At a short
                    distance from Zuela are some very interesting ruins, one of them a castle, which
                    must have been a place of great strength, on account of the immense thickness of
                    the walls. These ruined fabrics have been much commented upon, but there is
                    nothing to prove that they were of Roman origin. The next town of any importance
                    is Gatrone, which stands m latitude 24. 47. 57. The country between Zuela and
                    this <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752187" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2187-0533"/>place is
                    a perfect desert, which in one place consists of a singular mixture of sand and
                    salt. Gatrone is rather pleasantly situated. It is surrounded with sand hills
                    and mounds ’ of earth, covered with a small tree called <hi rend="italic"
                    >athali.</hi> On leaving this place, Captain Lyon proceeded to Tegerhy, the
                    southernmost town in Fezzan, and situated in lat. 24. 4. N. Here the cultivation
                    of the date and palm ceases, and the Arabic gives place to the Bornouese
                    language. The desert comes close to the walls of the town, which is situated to
                    the southward of its palms. The dates are here very fine and plentiful. Tegerhy
                    is commanded by a fort, containing wells of water within the walls. A range of
                    low hills extends to the eastward; and near the town are some salt pools, which
                    are frequented by snipes, wild ducks, and geese. The natives are black, and
                    little superior to savages.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of Fczzan is computed to contain about a hundred towns and villages,
                    but the population is thought not to exceed 80,000. It is governed by a sultan,
                    who, although in fact only a viceroy, dependent upon the pasha of Tripoli,
                    possesses absolute sway. In regard to climate, Fezzan cannot be considered as
                    fortunate. In summer the heat is intense, and the south wind, which is very dry,
                    and impregnated with fiery particles, is scarcely supportable even by the
                    natives. The winter, on the other hand, is accompanied with a bleak and
                    penetrating wind blowing from the north, the cold of which is painfully felt
                    even by the natives of a northern climate. Rain falls seldom, and in small
                    quantities; thunder is also rare, but tempests of wind frequently occur. With
                    regard to the soil, we have already spoken at sufficient length. The revenue, as
                    derived from sources already mentioned, is devoted solely to the maintenance of
                    the sultan, his army, and court. The cadi and other officers of justice, the
                    ministers of religion, and even the great officers of state, are maintained from
                    grounds set apart for this purpose, and which are covered usually with gardens,
                    or woods of date trees. The office of cadi or chief judge, to which is also
                    attached that of first minister of religion, is hereditary in a certain family.
                    There is no regular army; but in time of war all who are able to carry arms may
                    be called out.</p>
                <p>This country was well known to the ancients under the title of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phazania Regio,</hi> and the country of the Garamantes, whose
                    ancient capital has been recognized by Major Rennell in the modern Germa, as
                    already noticed. The name of Fasan or Fezzan seems to have been imposed by the
                    Saracens, when they overran Northern Africa, and established the Mahommedan
                    faith, and ever since it has continued to prevail.</p>
