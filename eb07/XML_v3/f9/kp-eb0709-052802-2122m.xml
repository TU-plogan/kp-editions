                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    of the most able scholars of his age, was born at Caen, in Normandy, in the year
                    1615. His father (who, according to Segrais, was the son of a grave-digger in
                    the parish of St Jean de Caen), having dissipated his means, an uncle of the
                    young Lefevre, a learned ecclesiastic, took charge of his education, and finding
                    that he had a good ear and a fine voice, taught him music, by which means he was
                    ere long in a condition to execute the most difficult pieces with the book open
                    before him. He was twelve years of age when he commenced Latin, and his progress
                    was extremely rapid. But the severity of his uncle discouraged him, and his
                    father could only induce him to continue his studies by giving him another
                    preceptor. The latter, however, did not understand Greek; but Lefevre learned it
                    alone, without any other assistance than a grammar, and some books which he read
                    before he was in a condition fully to comprehend their meaning. He was then sent
                    to study humanity and philosophy at the college of La Flèche, one of the most
                    celebrated which the Jesuits possessed in France. His masters made useless
                    efforts to detain him amongst them; and his father and uncle equally failed in
                    persuading him to take orders. After remaining several years in Normandy, he
                    proceeded to Paris, where he soon made himself known, and gained the friendship
                    of several persons of distinction. Μ. Desnoyers, one of these friends, presented
                    him to Cardinal Richelieu, who appointed him inspector of the press of the
                    Louvre, with a salary of two thousand livres. But, after the cardinal’s death,
                    the pension of Lefevre became ill paid, and he was even obliged to sell his
                    library, in order to procure the means of subsistence. Some time afterwards, the
                    Marquis of Francières carried Lefevre with him to Langres; but having in that
                    city acquired a taste for the reformed doctrines, the latter took leave of his
                    noble friend, and retired to Preuilly in Ί ouraine, where he publicly made
                    profession of Calvinism. He was immediately offered a chair in the academy
                    ofSaumur, which he accepted in preference to the professorship of Greek at
                    Nimeguen, to which he was about the same time appointed. But he had afterwards
                    some disputes with the consistory of Saumur, in consequence of having
                    unguardedly attempted to excuse the libertinism of Sappho; and as the annoyance
                    which this misunderstanding occasioned had determined him to quit Touraine, he
                    was preparing to set out for Heidelberg, where the elector palatine had offered
                    him considerable advantages, when he died of a fever produced by excess of
                    labour, on the 12th of September 1672. By his marriage with Marie Olivier,
                    Lefevre left three children; a son, named Tannegui after his father who, after
                    having for thirty years discharged the pastoral functions in Holland and in
                    England, returned into the bosom of the Catholic church, and died at Saumurin
                    1717· and two daughters, one married to Paul Bauldry, and the other the
                    celebrated Madame Dacier. Lefevre wrote better in Latin than in French; but if
                    his productions are deficient in elegance, they have at least the merit of
                    fidelity, and are accompanied with very learned notes. His productions consist
                    of, 1. Editions of several works of Lucian,with a Latin version and notes;
