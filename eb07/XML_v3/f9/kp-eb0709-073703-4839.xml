                    Scottish lawyer, and Lord P resident of the Court of Session, was born at
                    Culloden, Itwerness-shire, in the year 1685. His natural disposition inclined
                    him to the army; but, as he early discovered a superior genius, he was induced
                    by the advice of friends to apply himself to learning. Having completed his
                    studies at the university of Edinburgh, he removed thence to Utrecht, and
                    afterwards to Paris, where he directed his attention particularly to the civil
                    law, in which he made great progress. He returned to Scotland in 1710, and was
                    the same year called to the bar, where his abilities soon attracted notice, and
                    procured him extensive practice. In 1717 he was appointed solicitor-general of
                    Scotland; in 1722 he was returned member of parliament for the county of
                    Inverness; in 1725 he was made King’s Advocate; and in 1742 he attained the
                    highest judicial dignity in Scotland, that of Lord President of the Court of
                    Session. During the rebellion in 1745 and 1746, he was mainly instrumental in
                    preventing a general rising of the Highlanders in favour of the pretender to the
                    crown, and he even mortgaged his estate in support of the government. But the
                    glory he acquired in checking the spread of the insurrection, by preventing some
                    of the most powerful chiefs from joining the standard of Prince Charles Edward,
                    and in afterwards contributing to re-establish peace and order, was the only
                    reward of his services. Although he had impaired, nay almost ruined, his private
                    fortune in the cause of the public, government declined to make him the smallest
                    recompense. The minister of the day, with the meanness for which it is difficult
                    to account, desired Jo have a state of his disbursements; an incivility which so
                    much shocked the proud spirit of the patriotic president that he withdrew
                    without deigning to make any reply. He had saved the country, yet they wished to
                    huckster with him about pence. His services had been too great to be requited by
                    any ordinary recompense, and hence they repaid him with ingratitude. It seems,
                    also, that he had displeased the government of the day by the freedom and
                    boldness with which he censured the barbarous system pursued, after the battle
                    of Culloden, in a spirit of vindictive ferocity to which there has been no
                    parallel in modern times, excepting, perhaps, in the wars of La Vendée. The
                    ungrateful treatment which he experienced at the hands of the government he had
                    saved is understood to have preyed on the spirits of President Forbes, and to
                    have produced the fever of which he died in 1747, in the sixty-second year of
                    his age. Throughout the whole course of his life he entertained a lively sense
                    of religion, without the least taint of superstition; and his charity was
                    indiscriminately extended to every sect and denomination of religionists. He was
                    well versed in the Hebrew language; and wrote in a flowing style concerning
                    theology and philosophy, particularly respecting the sources of incredulity. His
                    writings, which had no reference to his profession, were, 1. Thoughts on
                    Religion; 2. A Letter to a Bishop; and, 3. Reflections on Incredulity, 1750, in
                    2 vols. 12mo.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Forbes,</hi><hi rend="italic">William,</hi> bishop of
                    Edinburgh, was born at Aberdeen in the year 1585, being the son of Thomas
                    Forbes, a respectable citizen descended from Forbes of Corsinday, whose ancestor
                    was the second son of the same Lord Forbes from whom Forbes of Corse derived his
                    lineage. His mother was Janet the sister of Dr Cargill, an eminent physician.
                    From the grammar school, where he had made uncommon progress, he was at the
                    early age of twelve removed to Marischal College, and after the usual period of
                    four years he took the degree of A. Μ. The principal, Gilbert Gray, was so much
                    pleased with his scholarship and modesty, that he procured his appointment to
                    the professorship of logic. It was his duty to teach the logic of Aristotle,
                    whom he very strenuously defended against the attacks of Ramus. This office he
                    resigned at the expiration of four years, and afterwards prosecuted his
                    theological studies on the continent. Having landed at Dantzig, he travelled
                    through a great part of Prussia and Poland. He studied in several of the
                    universities, particularly those of Helmstadt and Heidelberg. Diligently
                    rescrting to the public libraries, he rendered himself familiar with the
                    writings of the fathers and schoolmen; and in the Hebrew language<pb break="no" facs="nls:193754852" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4852-0738"/> he became a
                    great proficient, or, according to the ' expression of his biographer, equalled
                    the skill of any Jew.</p><p>After spending four years in Germany, he went to Holland, and visited the
                    university of Leyden, where his relation Dr Jack was then a professor of
                    philosophy. He was anxious to extend his travels to France and Italy, but being
                    deterred by the delicate state of his health, he sailed for England. From London
                    he proceeded to Oxford, where his learning was held in so much estimation that
                    he was offered the professorship of Hebrew in that university: but his
                    countryman Dr Craig, physician to the king, advised him to consult his health by
                    returning to his native air; and he accordingly arrived at Aberdeen, after an
                    absence of five years, when, according to an obvious calculation, he must have
                    attained the age of twenty-five. The corporation immediately conferred upon him
                    the freedom of the city. When his health was in some measure restored, he was
                    appointed minister of Alford, and was afterwards removed to Monyrriusk. He
                    speedily acquired the reputation of a most eloquent preacher, and after a short
                    interval he became one of the ministers of Aberdeen. During the king’s visit to
                    St Andrews in the year 1617, Forbes was created D. D. As the state of his health
                    was still very infirm, he. was willing to exchange his cure for an academical
                    office. He was nominated principal of Marischal College, and discharged his duty
                    with learning and zeal: he not only read lectures in divinity, but likewise
                    taught the Hebrew language. After retaining the office for two years, he was
                    induced to accept of a pastoral charge in Edinburgh, where however he soon
                    discovered that his character and doctrines were held in much less estimation
                    than in his native city. Aberdeen was the strong-hold of episcopacy, and its
                    clergy were among the most learned and respectable of the episcopalians; but in
                    Edinburgh the presbyterians were the predominant party, and Dr Forbes therefore
                    found himself placed in a situation far from agreeable. When he already thought
                    of resigning his living, his old friends at Aberdeen invited him to resume his
                    spiritual labours among them, and there he continued to reside till near the
                    close of his life. When King Charles visited Edinburgh in the year 1633, Forbes
                    was one of those who preached before him; and the king was so much struck with
                    his eloquence, that when he erected the new see, he spontaneously nominated him
                    as the first bishop. His patent bears the date of January 26, 1634. He was
                    consecrated in the month of February, and soon afterwards removed his wife and
                    children to Edinburgh,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Spalding’s History of the Troubles in Scotland, vol. i. p. 24. Edinb.

                    on the 11th of April, before he had completed the third month of his episcopate,
                    and when he had only attained the forty-ninth year of his age. His remains were
                    interred in the cathedral church of St Giles.</p><p>Bishop Forbes was a man of very extensive reading, but he did not himself publish
                    any work. He wrote copious animadversions on the works of Cardinal Bellarmin,
                    and, after his death, these papers came into the possession of Dr Baron, who
                    intended to prepare them for the press; but the national commotions speedily
                    ensued, and this design was never executed, nor has their subsequent fate been
                    ascertained. These animadversions, which his biographer describes as elaborate
                    and nervous, filled the margin of the cardinal’s works, printed at Paris in
                    three vo lumes. T wenty-four years after the author’s death, Thomas Sydserf,

                    but it is a very indifferent method of securing the peace of the church, by
                    offering to meet the papists half-way. This is reforming backwards. The
                    character of the learned author has thus been drawn by Bishop Burnet: “He was a
                    grave and eminent divine: my father, that knew him long, and being of council
                    for him in his law-matters, had occasion to know him well, has often told me,
                    that he never saw him but he thought his heart was in heaven, and he was never
                    alone with him but he felt within himself a commentary on these words of the
                    apostles, ‘ Did not our hearts bum within us, while he yet talked with us, and
                    opened to us the Scriptures?’ He preached with a zeal and vehemence, that made
                    him forget all the measures of time, two or three hours was no extraordinary
                    thing for him; those sermons wasted his strength so fast, and his ascetical
                    course of life was such, that he supplyed it so scantly that he dyed within a
                    year after his promotion; so that he only appeared there long enough to be
                    known, but not long enough to do what might have been otherwise expected from so
                    great a prelate. That little remnant of his that is in print shews how learned
                    he was. I do not deny but his earnest desire of a general peace and union among
                    all Christians has made him too favourable to many of the corruptions in the
                    church of Rome: but tho’ a charity that is not well ballanced may carry one to
                    very indiscreet things, yet the principle from whence they flowed in him was so
                    truly good, that the errors to which it carried him ought to be either excused,
                    or at least to be very gently censured.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘ Burnet’s Life of william Bedell, D.D. Bishop of Kilmore,

                    learned divines whom Scotland has produced, was born on the second of May 1593.
                    He was the descendant of an ancient and opulent family: his father was Patrick
                    Forbes, bishop of Aberdeen, his mother was Lucretia the daughter of David Spence
                    of Wormiston. His paternal ancestor was a younger son of Lord Forbes, and he was
                    thus connected with some of the principal families in his native district.</p><p>Patrick Forbes was the eldest son of William Forbes of Corse and Oneill in the
                    county of Aberdeen. William, the second son, bequeathed to his posterity the
                    estates of Craigievar and Fintray. John, the third son, became minister of
                    Alford, and, adhering with great zeal to the presbyterian discipline, was at
                    length driven into exile on account of his having acted as moderator of the
                    Aberdeen assembly. He settled in Holland, and successively officiated as a
                    clergyman at Middelburg and Delft. His son Patrick Forbes quitted the
                    presbyterians, and became bishop of Caithness in the year 1662. William’s fourth
                    son was Sir Arthur Forbes of Castle Forbes in the kingdom of Ireland, whose son
                    was created earl of Granard: the father <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754865" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4865-0739"/>followed the
                    profession of arms, and after quitting the Swedish service, had obeyed the call
                    of fortune in Ireland, where he acquired an ample estate. The bishop of Aberdeen
                    had other three brothers, of whom no particular notices have been preserved. He
                    was himself educated at Stirling school, under Thomas Buchanan, an eminent
                    classical master, and afterwards became a student in the university of Glasgow,
                    where he was committed to the care of his distinguished kinsman Andrew Melville.
                    When this learned man removed to St Andrews, in the year 1580, he was
                    accompanied by Forbes, who applied himself to the study of the Hebrew language
                    and of divinity with so much assiduity and success, and was so conspicuous for
                    the propriety and gravity of his deportment, that a design was entertained of
                    appointing him to a professorship in St Mary’s College; but his father, who was
                    already advanced in years, was anxious to see the heir of his estates otherwise
                    settled, and, in compliance with this wish, the son relinquished his academic
                    life. After his marriage, he fixed his residence near Montrose, and gained the
                    respect of all his neighbours. Nor were his religious exercises confined to his
                    own family: several of the churches in that vicinity were deprived of their
                    pastors, and in one of these he regularly officiated for some time, till he was
                    strongly urged by the bishop of the diocese, as well as by many other clergymen,
                    to enter into holy orders. He was however unwilling to comply with this
                    requisition, and the archbishop of St Andrews, who did not approve of
                    lay-preaching, enjoined him to desist from the discharge of clerical functions.
                    After a certain interval, which is not clearly defined, he consented to take
                    orders, and was appointed parson of Keith, in the diocese of Moray. In the year
                    1618, he was elected bishop of Aberdeen, and he appears to have been one of the
                    most exemplary prelates of that age. He was, says Bishop Burnet, “a gentleman of
                    quality and estate, but much more eminent by his learning and piety, than his
                    birth or fortune could make him. He had a most terrible calamit^on him in his
                    family, which needs not be named: I do not know whether that or a more early
                    principle determined him to enter into orders: he undertook the labour of a
                    private cure in the country, upon the most earnest invitations of his bishop,
                    when he was forty-eight years old, and discharged his duty there so worthily,
                    that within a few years he was promoted to be bishop of Aberdeen; in which see
                    he sat about seventeen years. It was not easie for King James to per-swade him
                    to accept of that dignity, and many months passed before he could be induced to
                    it, for he had intended to have lived and dyed in a more obscure comer. It soon
                    appeared how well he deserved his promotion, and that his unwillingness to it
                    was not feigned, but the real effect of his humility. He was in all things an
                    apostolical man; he used to go round his diocess without noise, and but with one
                    servant, that so he might be rightly informed of all matters. When he heard
                    reports of the weakness of any of his clergy, his custome was to go and lodge
                    unknown near their church on the Saturday night, and next day, when the minister
                    was got into the pulpit, he would come to church, that so he might observe what
                    his ordinary sermons were, and accordingly he admonished or encouraged them. He
                    took such care of the two colledges in his diocese, that they became quickly
                    distinguished from all the rest of Scotland: so that when the troubles in that
                    church broke out, the doctors there were the only persons that could maintain
                    the cause of the church; as appears by the papers that past between them and the
                    covenanters. And though they begun first to manage that argument in print, there
                    has nothing appeared since more perfect than what they writ. They were an honour
                    to the church both by their lives and by their learning, and with that excellent
                    temper they seasoned that whole diocess, both clergy and laity, that it
                    continues to this day very much distinguished from all the rest of Scotland,
                    both for learning, loyalty and peaceableness.” Bishop Forbes is the author of
                    several works, which deserve to be mentioned. The most considerable of them
                    appear in a volume bearing the subsequent title: “An learned Commentarie vpon
                    the Revelation of Saint Iohn, wherein both the covrse of the whole booke, as
                    also the more abstruse and hard places thereof, are more cleerly and euidently
                    explaned then heretofore they haue bene. Newly corrected, and the deſectes and
                    errors of the first edition supplied and amended. By Patrick Forbes of Cotharis.
                    Wherevnto is added an profitable Treatise of the author, in defence of the
                    lawfull Calling of the Ministers of Reformed Churches, against the Cauillations
                    of Romanistes: and an Epistle to a Recusant, cleering and maintayning some
                    pointes of the said Treatise, chalenged by a Roman Elymas Bar-Iesus-it.”
                    Middelburg, 1614, 4to. Of these different works a Latin translation was long
                    afterwards published by his son Dr Forbes: “Commentarius in Apocalypsin, cum
                    Appendice,” &amp;c. Amstelodami, 1646, 4to. Another work of the bishop is
                    entitled “Eubulus, or a Dialogve, wherein a rugged Romish Ryme (inscrybed, <hi rend="italic">Catholicke Questions to the</hi><hi rend="italic">Protestunt)</hi> is confuted, and the Questions there-of answered. By P. A.”
                    Aberdene, 1627, 4to.</p><p>Of this worthy father, John Forbes was the second son. After having studied at
                    Aberdeen, he was sent to the university of Heidelberg, where he was placed under
                    the care of David Pareus, an eminent professor of divinity. He likewise
                    prosecuted his studies at Sedan, and in some other universities which are not
                    specified. Having devoted much time and labour to the acquisition of the Greek
                    and Hebrew languages, and of all the variegated knowledge requisite for a
                    theologian, he returned to his native country in 1619, being then in the
                    twenty-sixth year of his age, and on the 27th of April he was admitted professor
                    of divinity in King’s College, Aberdeen. In this important vocation he laboured
                    with great diligence, and speedily acquired the character of a most able and
                    useful teacher. He was profoundly skilled in ecclesiastical antiquity; and, not
                    contented with delivering what is called a system of divinity, he exhibited a
                    very elaborate deduction of the progress of Christian doctrine in various ages
                    of the church. Of the value of his instructions in this department, a very
                    adequate opinion may be formed from the inspection of a work which he published
                    in the maturity of his learning and judgment. Nor did he neglect to instruct his
                    students in practical religion: one division of his lectures related to moral
                    theology, another to the pastoral care and to residence.</p><p>While he was engaged in these useful and honourable labours, the kingdom was
                    agitated by religious dissensions. Episcopacy, commonly described by the more
                    odious name of prelacy, was no favourite with the great body of the people; and
                    the five articles of Perth, passed in 1618, and relating to kneeling at the
                    communion, the observance of festivals, confirmation, private baptism, and
                    private communion, had excited a violence of opposition with which it was found
                    very difficult to contend. Dr Forbes, who was as much distinguished by his piety
                    as by his learning, endeavoured to promote peaceable measures; and with this
                    view, he published his earliest work, bearing the title of “Irenicum Amatoribus
                    Veritatis et Pacis in Ecclesia Scoticana.” Aberdoniae, 1629, 4to. Of this work
                    he sent a copy to Archbishop Usher, who received it with much cordiality.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the Letters (p. 456·)

                    Aberdeen did not live to witness the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754878" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4878-0740"/>subversion of
                    episcopacy: he died on the 28th of March 1635, in the seventy-first year of his
                    age. As his eldest son had died ten years before, the professor of divinity
                    succeeded to the family-estates. This prelate being regarded as the restorer of
                    the university, and as a great pillar of the church, his death was sincerely
                    lamented by the adherents of his own party. Soon after his decease, a volume,
                    consisting of 429 pages, and including a portrait, was published under the
                    following title: “Funerals of a Right Reverend Father in God, Patrick Forbes of

                    strenuous defender of the presbyterian cause. The introduction of the covenant
                    involved the most conscientious of the episcopalians in inextricable
                    difficulties. The professors and ministers of Aberdeen, who had recourse to
                    argument and remonstrance, printed a paper containing “Generali Demands
                    concerning the late Covenant.” To this paper, which was subscribed by six
                    doctors of divinity, Forbes, Scrogie, Lesley, Baron, Sibbald, and Ross, an
                    answer was returned under the names of Alexander Henderson, David Dickson, and
                    Andrew Cant, three individuals of no small influence among the covenanters. The
                    doctors of Aberdeen subjoined replies to the answers; which produced further
                    answers from Henderson and Dickson. The doctors published a rejoinder, and had

                    reputation, and he is described as “a person of incomparable worth and
                    learning.”·<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Middleton’s

                    him as good Dr Baron. He subjoins, “I had great hopes, if he had lived a little,
                    he should have quit them, and been glad to embrace the covenant of his mother
                    church, as his learned, brother now has done.” Middleton speaks of John Baron as
                    “a person of great worth and learning, and of great candour. He died in the time
                    of our late combustions.”</p></note> ' He was elected bishop of Orkney, but he
                    died at Berwick in 1639, before he could be consecrated. Like Dr Lesley, he had
                    been deprived of his office, and had been obliged to fly from Aberdeen. His
                    brother Dr John Baron, professor of divinity at St Andrews, was finally induced
                    to subscribe the covenant. Dr Forbes was treated with some degree of tenderness;
                    and the covenanters being solicitous to gain such a convert, the proceedings
                    against him in the ecclesiastical courts were protracted for several years.
                    After some preliminary steps, he was in 1640 cited to appear at Aberdeen before
                    a delegation of the general assembly. He was declared to be free from the taint
                    of popery and Arminianism; but as he still adhered to episcopacy, and declined
                    to subscribe the covenant, his case, through the influence of Baillie, was
                    remitted to the presbytery of Edinburgh. He was allowed a month to yield
                    satisfaction to this judicatory, and as he failed to do so, sentence of
                    deprivation was pronounced against him. In 1643 he moved the synod of Aberdeen
                    to make application to the general assembly, that he might be permitted to
                    retain his professorship without subscription; but it was there determined that
                    his deprivation was valid from the beginning.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Baillie’s Letters and Journals, vol. i. p.

                    prosecuting his researches in the public libraries; but he found that he must
                    either subscribe the solemn league and covenant, or abandon his native country.
                    Preferring the latter alternative, he embarked for Holland on the 5th of April
                    1644, and, after a voyage of five days, landed at Campvere. He travelled through
                    the different provinces, and frequently preached in the Scotish and English
                    churches. He had formerly married a lady of Middelburg, named Soete Roos-boom,
                    who died on the 19th of January 1640. She was the mother of nine children; but
                    only one of them, a son named George, was alive at the time of the father’s
                    exile. Dr Forbes chiefly resided at Amsterdam, and occupied himself in preparing
                    for the press a work of great research and value. It appeared under the title of
                    “Instructiones HistoricoTheologicae de Doctrina Christiana, et vario Rerum

                    followed after a considerable interval. Genevae, ] 680, fol. And an abridgement
                    of the work was published by Arnoldus Montanus, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Forbesius contractus.</hi> Amst. 1663, 8vo. Forbes was enabled to
                    prefix to his ample volume the favourable judgment of the theological faculties
                    of Leyden, Utrecht, and Franeker, as well as that of Rivet, Maresius, and
                    Vossius. This book established <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754891" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4891-0741"/>the reputation of the author as a theologian of a
                    very high rank. Bishop Burnet speaks of it as “a work which, if he had finished
                    it, and had been suffered to enjoy the privacies of his retirement and study, to
                    give us the second volume, had been the greatest treasure of theological
                    learning that perhaps the world has yet seen.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Burnet’s Life of Bedell, pref.</p></note> Dr

                    on the 8th, and arrived at Aberdeen on the 14th of July 1646. He immediately
                    retired to his country-seat at Corse, and was permitted to spend the remainder
                    of his days in learned and devout seclusion. He died on the 29th of April 1648,
                    having completed the fifty-fifth year of his age. A short time before his death,
                    he made application to the presbytery for permission to have his bones deposited
                    in Bishop Dunbar’s aisle in the cathedral church, beside those of his father and
                    wife; but even this last favour was denied to a learned and excellent man, whose
                    fault was a difference of opinion on the subject, not of Christian doctrine, but
                    of ecclesiastical polity. He then directed his body to be interred in the
                    churchyard of Leochel, where no monument was erected to his memory.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Orem’s Description of King’s
                    College, Aberdeen, p. 85.</p></note> He left an only son, who is described by Dr
                    Garden as the heir of his father’s estates, but not of his virtues.</p><p>Dr Forbes was small in stature, and of a somewhat swarthy complexion. A person
                    who had acquired such ample stores of erudition must have been an ardent and
                    indefatigable student; and, with respect to his habits of study, we are informed
                    that he always read and wrote in a standing posture. One of the few relaxations
                    in which he indulged was the Scotish game of golf. With his extensive learning
                    he united fervid and habitual piety. His conduct was upright and consistent in
                    times of no small difficulty and distress.</p><p>An honourable monument was at length erected to his memory, in a collective
                    edition of his Latin works. “Reverendi viri Johannis Forbesii a Corse,
                    Presbyteri et SS. Theologiae Doctoris, ejusdemque Professoris in Academia
                    Aberdonensi, Opera omnia, inter quae plurima posthuma, reliqua ab ipso auctore
                    interpolata, emendata atque aucta.” Amstelaedami, 1703, 2 tom. fol. The second
                    volume bears the date of 1702. The edition is introduced by two dedications,
                    written by George Garden, D.D., an advertisement by Wetstein the printer, and a
                    preface by Dr Gürtler, professor of divinity at Deventer. A copious life of the
                    author, by Dr Garden, is next subjoined. The biographer, who appears to have
                    been a very amiable man, was a regent in King’s College, and afterwards minister
                    of St Machar’s, but was ejected from his living on the restoration of the
                    presbyterian discipline. Under the title of “J. Forbesii Vita interior,” he has
                    added an abstract of Forbes’s diary, which was written in English. One of the
                    posthumous works is an ample treatise, entitled “Theologiae Moralis libri decem;
                    in quibus Praecepta Decalogi exponuntur, et variae circa Dei Legem, et specialia
                    ejusdem Praecepta, Controversi® dissolvuntur, et Casus Conscienti® explicantur.”
