                <p><label type="entry">FORSTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Reinhold</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated naturalist and geographer, and an accomplished scholar and linguist,
                    was born on the 22d October 1729, at Dirschau, in Polish Prussia, where his
                    father was burgomaster or mayor. His family was of English descent, and had
                    quitted Great Britain in the time of Charles I.</p>
                <p>At the age of fourteen he was placed for a year at the public school of
                    Marienwerder, and was afterwards admitted into the gymnasium of Joachimsthal at
                    Berlin. Among his schoolfellows was Pallas, who became so well known for his
                    various researches in natural history, with several others who distinguished
                    themselves in literature and science. He applied himself with diligence to the
                    study of the ancient and modern languages, and in particular of the oriental
                    languages, as connected with divinity. He continued the same pursuits at the
                    university of Halle, which he entered in 1748. After three years, having
                    completed his theological studies, he resided for two years more at Dantzick,
                    preaching as a candidate. In 1753 he obtained a small benefice at the
                    neighbouring town of Nassenhuben, and the next year he married his cousin
                    Elizabeth Nikolai; but he still found leisure to improve himself in natural
                    philosophy, geography, and the mathematics. His increasing family having become
                    too expensive for his income, he accepted the proposals of the Russian consul at
                    Dantzick, and agreed to superintend the establishment of the new colonies at
                    Saratof on the Volga. The consul received the thanks of the reigning favourite,
                    Count Orlof, for his judicious selection of a person so well qualified; but our
                    adventurer was not satisfied with his success in the undertaking,, and, in 1766,
                    he resolved, somewhat suddenly, to try his fortune in England, whither he
                    proceeded well recommended, but with exhausted finances. Soon afterwards,
                    however, he received a gratuity of 100 guineas from the Russian government, and
                    he obtained some remuneration from the booksellers for his translations from the
                    German and the Swedish. He declined a proposal of Lord Baltimore, who offered
                    him the management of his large estates in America, preferring the appointment
                    of a teacher of modern languages and natural history in the dissenting academy
                    of Warrington, where he found a more interesting society than would have been
                    attainable in any part of the New World. He was not, however, very popular as an
                    instructor; and he was soon after this engaged to accompany Mr Dalrymple, who
                    was going out as governor of Balambanjan, near Borneo; but the plan was never
                    executed. In 1772 he was appointed naturalist to the expedition under the
                    command of Captain Cook in his second voyage of circumnavigation; and he took
                    with him his son George, then seventeen years old. For this undertaking Forster
                    was abundantly qualified as a man of science and an accurate observer, though
                    his temper and conduct were not always such as to make him agreeable to his
                    shipmates, nor was he uniformly considerate and humane in his intercourse with
                    the uncivilized inhabitants of the countries which he explored. After the return
                    of the expedition, there were repeated discussions and disputes respecting
                    Forster’s share in the intended publication of the narrative of the voyage. Two
                    thousand pounds, which had been granted by government for the plates of the
                    work, were to have been equally divided between Cook and Forster for this
                    purpose; but Forster’s performance of his part of the undertaking was
                    disapproved, and he was deprived of the advantage which he expected to have
                    derived from the plates. It is possible that he may have expressed himself
                    incautiously respecting the conduct of the expedition; perhaps also he may have
                    been thought deficient in accuracy of idiom; for he was more fluent than correct
                    or elegant in the various languages which he was in the habit of speaking and
                    writing. He was, however, supposed to be concerned in the account of the voyage
                    which was published by his son; and this participation was considered by his
                    opponents, and even by many of his friends, as an infringement of the conditions
                    of his engagement; besides that many offensive remarks and a few inaccuracies
                    were introduced into the work, some of which were afterwards candidly admitted
                    and corrected by his son. All these circumstances made Forster’s residence in
                    England by no means agreeable, and his pecuniary embarrassments became so
                    pressing that he was at one time in confinement for debt. He was, however, set
                    at liberty in 1780, by the munificence of the king of Prussia, who furnished him
                    with the means of satisfying his creditors, and established him at Halle, as
                    professor of natural history, and inspector of the botanical garden. The year
                    after he took the degree of doctor of physic in the university. He was not
                    always on the most cordial terms with his academical colleagues, and he was too
                    fond of accusing them in his reports to his superiors. His circumstances were
                    also much embarrassed by his unfortunate propensity to play, which absorbed the
                    whole earnings of his labour. He, however, considered the eighteen years that he
                    spent at Halle as the happiest of his life. He was much afflicted in his old age
                    by the premature death of his two sons; indeed his health seemed to be impaired
                    by his grief, and he died on the 9th December 1798. Professor Kurt Sprengel has
                    written an account of his life, containing a just encomium on his various
                    talents and acquirements, though somewhat too flattering with regard to his
                    moral character. He appears to have been master of seventeen different
                    languages; and he was as extensively acquainted with things as with words, being
                    as much indebted for his various knowledge to his industrious and accurate
                    observation of nature, as to his great reading and his profound learning. He was
                    long intimate with Buffon, and greatly admired his writings; and he was in
                    constant correspondence with Linnaeus and his son, the latter of whom gave the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Forstera</hi> to a new genus of plants, in compliment
                    to the two botanists who had discovered it in New Zealand. In conversation he
                    was witty, but frequently too satirical; and his unguarded sallies created him
                    many enemies. He became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries soon after his
                    arrival in England; in February 1772 he was elected a fellow of the Royal
                    Society; and in 1775, upon his return from the South Seas, the university of
                    Oxford conferred on him the honorary diploma of a doctor of laws. His principal
                    publications are these:</p>

                    uniformly cotton. In his Egyptian etymologies he is learned and ingenious, but,
                    like almost all other Egyptian etymologists, extremely precipitate. 21. <hi

                    >George,</hi> a distinguished naturalist and circumnavigator, the son of John
                    Reinhold Forster, was born at Dantzick in 1754, and enjoyed, in his earliest
                    youth, the advantage of his father’s assiduous and affectionate instructions, by
                    which he profited so rapidly, that he was capable, at the age of ten years, when
                    he went with his father into Russia, of ascertaining the species of a plant by
                    comparing it with the Linnaean description. He was for a short time at a school
                    in Petersburg. Upon his arrival in London, he was at first placed in a
                    merchant’s counting-house, but soon found his health unequal to the employment,
                    and followed his father to Warrington, where he continued his studies at the
                    academy with so much application, that he became a perfect master of the English
                    language, and otherwise distinguished himself by the strength of his memory and
                    the vigour of his imagination, at the same time that he assisted his father in
                    giving lessons in French, and in completing a variety of translations of voyages
                    and travels. He also accompanied his father, together with Sparrman, in the
                    arduous engagement of making all kinds of physical observations in the
                    circumnavigation of the globe; and he was particularly employed in delineating
                    the various objects of natural history which were discovered. After his return
                    he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society; but he soon quitted England to
                    settle at Paris. In 1779, however, he was appointed professor of natural history
                    at Cassel; and, in 1784, he was nominated to a similar situation in the
                    University of Wilna, where he took a degree of doctor of physic; but he found
                    little satisfaction in residing amongst a people so imperfectly civilized. The
                    empress of Russia had engaged him to take an important part in a new voyage of
                    discovery which she meditated; but the design was abandoned upon the
                    commencement of the war with the Turks. He was next invited by the elector of
                    Mentz to accept the appointment of president of the university newly established
                    in that city, and he was residing there at the time when the French army entered
                    it. Being a declared republican in his political principles, he was dispatched
                    as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193755060" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5060-0754"/>an envoy to
                    Paris to solicit the incorporation of Mentz with the French republic; but during
                    his absence the Prussian troops retook the city, and he lost the whole of his
                    property, including his numerous manuscripts. He had married a Miss Theresa
                    Hayne, and had one daughter as early as 1788; but, at a subsequent period, his
                    wife⅛ conduct gave him great reason for uneasiness; and though he affected to
                    despise what he called the prejudices of social life, and to excuse her
                    infidelity, and even attempted to facilitate her union with a more favoured
                    admirer, still the affair in reality affected him deeply, and he resolved once
                    more to leave Europe, as if in search of the waters of oblivion; and he was
                    actually preparing for a voyage to Thibet, when his health was subdued by the
                    ravages of a scorbutic disorder, and he died on the 13th February 1792. Besides
                    the assistance which he rendered his father in many of his literary
                    undertakings, he was also the author of a variety of separate publications under
                    his own name.</p>

                    vols. 4to, Berlin, 1779, 1780, and 3 vols. 8vo, 1784. The style of this work is
                    rather more animated and poetical than that of the official account of the
                    voyage; the second volume is considered as the best written, and the freest from
                    affectation and false sentiment. 2. Mr Wales, the astronomer of the expedition,
                    published some remarks on the work, which occasioned a <hi rend="italic">Reply

                    the author declares that his father had no concern whatever in the book, but he
                    admits that he had committed some inaccuracies. 3. <hi rend="italic">A Letter to

                    animadversions from Professor Meiners, who declared himself the author of the
                    criticisms. 5. In 1787 he published at Berlin, in 4to, <hi rend="italic">A

                    the arts, showing that the author possessed very extensive information, as well
                    as originality of talent; but there is too much affectation of sentiment, and an
                    injudicious display of hostility to Great Britain. 19. <hi rend="italic"

                    also several political pamphlets of a temporary nature, which could add little
                    or nothing to their author’s fame; and a few scattered memoirs in different
                    periodical publications. He was also concerned in the <hi rend="italic"

                    literary activity; but his application to the labour of compilation was too
                    unremitting to allow him to concentrate the whole force of his mind on the
