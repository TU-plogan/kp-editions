                    narrow tract of land, about twenty-eight miles in length, but varying
                    considerably in its breadth, though in no part exceeding ten miles. The Irish
                    Sea partly bounds it on the north; the river Dee and part of Cheshire on the
                    north and north-east side; and the county of Denbigh on the south and west
                    sides. A portion of the county is detached from the rest by the interposition of
                    a part of Denbighshire. It is divided into five hundreds, viz. Coleshill,
                    Maylor, Mold, Prestatyn, and Rhyddlan. The river Dee formerly washed the walls
                    of the ancient castle of Flint, the county town, but has of late considerably
                    receded, and it has now no means of carrying on commerce by sea, except in very
                    small vessels; and it is necessary that those should be so constructed as to
                    remain dry, during low water, without injury. Mold, the town at which the
                    assizes are held, has rapidly increased, owing in some measure to the
                    establishment of very extensive mills for spinning cotton in its vicinity. The
                    city of St Asaph is neither distinguished by its extent nor the beauty of its
                    buildings. Its situation, on the side of a hill, the summit of which is crowned
                    by the cathedral, and between the rivers Clwyd and Elwy, is very imposing, and
                    strikes the traveller forcibly as he approaches it. Though the immediate
                    vicinity of this city has a sterile appearance, yet the views near it in one
                    direction over the enchanting vale of Clwyd, and in another over the diversified
                    landscape which terminates with the ruins of the castle of Denbigh, present to
                    the eye of those who have a taste for beautiful scenery a most delightful
                    treat.</p><p>The diocese of St Asaph extends nearly over the whole of the county, and, from
                    several livings which are held <hi rend="italic">in commendam</hi> by the
                    bishop, is a very lucrative preferment The Episcopal chair has, since the
                    Reformation, been filled by many prelates of most distinguished character.
                    Morgan was translated to this see in 1601, as a reward for his eminent
                    acquirements as an oriental linguist. He was employed in translating the sacred
                    writings into the Welsh language, as well as in a part of the English edition
                    commonly called Queen Elizabeth’s Bible. Dr Isaac Barrow, uncle to the
                    celebrated mathematician, was eminent for his munificence to the see, as well as
                    for his profound learning. The pious Beveridge, during a few of his last years,
                    was bishoporSt Asaph; and the chair has been since filled by the amiable and
                    learned Shipley, and the powerful and energetic Horsley. The cathedral has been
                    of late much improve and beautified by the bounty of Bishop Bagot, and the
                    liberal contributions of the nobility and gentry of the county. It was built
                    about the year 1480, upon a foundation of muc more ancient date; it is in length
                    from east to west 1 feet, and in breadth from north to south 108 feet. The most
                    important place in this county, from its wealth, its po pulation, and its
                    continued increase, is the town of Holywell, deriving its name from the well of
                    St Wenefrede, which, in the ages of credulity, was supposed to possess
                    miraculous powers of healing, but has of late been applied to better purposes
                    than nurturing such superstitions. As <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753357" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3357-0623"/>there are many
                    Catholics in Flintshire, the belief in the miraculous power of this spring is
                    not wholly extinct, nor have the pilgrimages to it altogether ceased. So late as
                    1805, indeed, a very zealous attempt was made to revive the credit of the saint,
                    and establish faith in the wonderful cures achieved by bathing in her well. A
                    case was narrated, accompanied with certificates, and a challenge given to all
                    who doubted of the miracle, by an appeal to facts which, however it might
                    confirm the faith of the saint’s votaries, had no influence beyond that narrow
                    circle.</p><p>The productions of Flintshire which deserve most notice are the minerals, the
                    preparation of which gives employment to a considerable share of the population.
                    Coals are found in abundance, chiefly near the banks of the Dee, and in other
                    parts near the surface, and in very thick seams. The city of Chester is
                    principally supplied with its fuel from hence, and considerable quantities were
                    shipped for Ireland before the change in the course of the Dee, and before the
                    coal mines of Lancashire and Cumberland had attained their present extent. Lead
                    is most copiously raised from a very extensive mining tract near Holywell; and
                    in the same excavations is raised most excellent limestone, applicable to the
                    purposes of agriculture as well as building, and so hard that it will bear a
                    high polish, in fact a kind of marble. Below the limestone is found petrosilex,
                    which is ground and becomes very valuable in the manufacture of earthenware.
                    Calamine is found in considerable quantities; a part is exported, but much is
                    used within the county in the preparation of brass. The lead is divided by the
                    miners into two kinds; that called cubic, or dice ore, is generally used in
                    glazing earthenware; the other, called white, or steel-grained ore, is
                    principally cast into pigs for distant consumption; this latter contains a
                    portion of silver sufficient to defray the expense of separating the metals, and
                    several thousand ounces have been annually extracted. The workmen in the lead
                    mines are visited with maladies which both embitter and shorten their lives.</p><p>The manufactories of this county are very considerable, and have taken that
                    course which the natural productions seem to have indicated. Brass is made by
                    the mixture of copper with calamine, and formed into the different shapes to fit
                    it for domestic and commercial purposes. Copper-works, under the Pargs Mine
                    Company, are constructed, and produce large quantities of copper sheathing,
                    bolts, nails, and other necessaries for naval equipment, as well as brass wire
                    and minuter articles. The potteries are very extensive, and manufacture large
                    quantities of the inferior kinds of earthenware, <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi>

                    considerable quantities to Ireland. Besides those manufactories which the
                    minerals have introduced, the fine stream that issues from the well of St
                    Wenefrede has attracted the attention of cotton-spinners, who have erected a
                    most powerful mass of machinery. They carry on the operations of carding and
                    spinning cotton to a great extent. . ’</p><p>The agriculture of this county is in a neglected state, drawing to it a very
                    insufficient portion of its capital; and hence few improvements have been
                    adopted of late years. Near the banks of the Dee there is some good corn land,
                    of a clayey texture, on which, after a fallow, good wheat is grown. The meadows
                    in this part produce excellent herbage, and the cows afford the best possible
                    butter. The northern part of the county is generally a level country, and well
                    calculated for the growth of wheat, oats, and beans. On the higher lands rye is
                    cultivated, but those lands are very imperfectly tilled, and nearly destitute of
                    manure. The rich vale of Mold forms a striking contrast with the more
                    mountainous parts of the county, and yields very good butter, corn, and
                    meat.</p><p>The ruins of ancient edifices, and other antiquities, are numerous, and invite
                    the attention of the antiquarian. A few years ago, whilst digging for the
                    purpose of laying the foundation of a copper work, a Roman <hi rend="italic">hypocaust</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> y</hi> or hot bath, was discovered,
                    furnished with numerous flues, covered with tiles of a red colour; a clear
                    evidence that the county had been anciently inhabited by some persons acquainted
                    with the luxuries of Rome.</p><p>Few counties, in proportion to their extent, contain so many gentlemen’s seats as
                    Flintshire. The most remarkable are, Mostyn Hall, Sir Thomas Mostyn; Pengewern,
                    Sir Edward Pryce Lloyd; Boddlewyddan, Sir John Williams; Kinmael Hall, Reverend
                    Edward Hughes; Gwernhailed, Philip Lloyd Fletcher, Esq.; Hamner Hall, Sir Thomas
                    Hanmer; Downing, David Pennant, Esq.; Halken, Earl Grosvenor; Adwynt, J.
                    Roberts, Esq.; Llewenny Hall, Lord Kirkwall.</p><p>The following are the returns of the population for the years ending 1811, 1821,
