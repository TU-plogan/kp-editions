                <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> calculus of fluxions, the most important addition
                    that ever was made to the fabric of abstract science, was invented in the latter
                    part of the seventeenth century. Considered as a purely intellectual
                    speculation, it far transcends any theory that had been previously known in pure
                    mathematics; and it is not less estimable by reason of its applicability to
                    physical knowledge. By its powers as an instrument of analysis, the science of
                    geometry has been exceedingly enlarged; and the elegant speculations of the
                    ancient geometers now go but a little way into the vast field of knowledge which
                    has been laid open by the fluxional calculus, the sublime discoveries of
                    Apollonius and Archimedes being merely easy deductions from more extended
                    theories. It has, further, rendered most efficient aid in the investigation of
                    the laws of nature, more especially in establishing the true theory of the
                    motions of the heavenly bodies, which, without its assistance, could not have
                    attained its present high position in the scale of human knowledge.</p>
                <p>It may easily be supposed that the invention of the calculus was not at once
                    fully revealed to the world. Its principles being inherent in the nature of
                    geometrical magnitude, they would of course be gradually disclosed with the
                    advance of mathematical science.</p>
                <p>As long as the geometers of antiquity confined their speculations to the
                    comparison of figures bounded by straight lines, there was no difficulty. The
                    axioms and the mental process of conceiving the magnitudes compared to be placed
                    one upon another, was sufficient to establish the equality of triangles in the
                    cases when these could be brought entirely to coincide. The principle of
                    superposition might have been carried further in the elements, so as to prove
                    the equality of parallelograms, which are the complements of those about the
                    diameter of a parallelogram; also of parallelograms having equal bases and
                    altitudes; and the equality of the square on the hypotenuse of a right angled
                    triangle to the squares on its sides. In fact, the doctrines of plane geometry
                    were sufficient to prove that any two equal rectilineal figures admit always of
                    being decomposed into spaces, such that, corresponding to every space in one of
                    the figures, there may be found a space exactly equal and similar to it in the
                    other figure; so that in this way any two equal rectilineal figures, however
                    dissimilar, may yet, by division, be brought to coincide.</p>
                <p>The principle of superposition, which was sufficient for the comparison of
                    rectilineal plane figures, one with another, could not, however, be extended to
                    the comparison of rectilineal with curvilineal, or of curvilineal with
                    curvilineal figures. In treating of these, the ancients bund it necessary to
                    introduce new notions and modes ofdemonstration into geometry; and the
                    difficulty which occurred in reasoning about curvilineal figures gave rise to
                    the method of exhaustions, the most refined and important of their geometrical
                    theories.</p>
                <p>. The fundamental principle of the method of exhaustions <hi rend="superscript">
                    ιs</hi> this very simple proposition, that the difference of any '" <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> unequal quantities, by which the greater exceeds the
                    oss, may be added to itself so often, as to exceed any finite quantity of the
                    same kind. On this the geometers <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> antiquity
                    founded their propositions concerning curvi-meal figures. By its aid they found
                    that polygons may inscribed in circles, which shall differ from them by less
                    than any assignable space; and hence they might infer that the circles have to
                    each other the same ratio as si nlar polygons inscribed in them, namely, the
                    squares of their diameters. Although in this way they could assure themselves of
                    the truth of the propositions, yet as this kind of proof was of a looser nature
                    than that by which they established their more elementary doctrines, they
                    fortified it against all cavil by their usual mode of synthetic demonstration,
                    proving that the square of the diameter of one circle was to that of another as
                    the first circle to a space that was neither less nor greater than the second,
                    and therefore exactly equal to it. By a like process they proved that a cone is
                    one third of a cylinder of the same base and altitude; and from the
                    demonstrations which they gave of these propositions, it might be concluded in
                    general, that when two variable quantities which have a constant ratio approach
                    to two determined quantities, so as to differ at last from them by less than any
                    assignable space, the same constant ratio is also the ratio of the determined
                    quantities, which are the limits of the variable quantities.</p>
                <p>The cautious way in which the ancients proceeded in finally establishing the
                    truth of their propositions concerning the proportions of solids, could be∙of
                    very little use in their original discovery. Indeed we may reasonably suppose,
                    that in the first instance they arrived at a knowledge of their truth by a much
                    shorter road, probably in a way not very different from that followed by the
                    earlier geometers in modern times, who have extended their theories. But
                    whatever path they followed, it led them to some truths of the highest
                    importance at the time they were first known. After ages of fruitless labour in
                    attempting to square the circle, the fine discoveries of Archimedes, that the
                    parabola was two thirds of its circumscribing parallelogram, and the sphere two
                    thirds of its circumscribing cylinder, and its surface four times that of one of
                    its great circles, must have been received by his contemporaries with high
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the seventeenth century, the writings of Archimedes greatly
                    engaged the attention of the principal cultivators of mathematical science, who
                    soon seized the spirit of his method, which was altogether distinct from the
                    unwieldy machinery of the ancient mode of synthetic demonstration. He had only
                    considered such solids as could be generated by the revolution of conic sections
                    about an axis, and he had not even exhausted all the cases of these. The
                    celebrated Kepler greatly extended this theory, in a treatise which he composed
                    on the mensuration of round solids. These he conceived to be formed by the
                    revolution of the conic sections about any ordinate, or a tangent to the curve
                    at the vertex, or, in short, about any line whatever within or without the
                    curve. In this way he described about ninety new solids, and proposed them as
                    problems for the consideration of his contemporaries; but of these he resolved
                    only a few of the most simple. In this work he first introduced the name and
                    notion of infinity into the language of geometry. He considered the circle as
                    composed of an infinite number of triangles, having their vertex at the centre,
                    and forming the circumference by their bases. The cone he regarded as composed
                    of an infinite number of pyramids, resting on the infinitely small triangles
                    which formed its circular base, and having their vertices at its vertex; and he
                    supposed a cylinder of the same base and altitude as the cone to be made up of
                    prisms having the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753474"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-3474-0632"/>same bases and altitudes as those which composed
                    the cone. ,</p>
                <p>The bold extension which Kepler thus gave to the cautious language of geometry
                    drew the attention of his contemporaries, some of whom eagerly followed in his
                    steps. Cavalieri, a friend and disciple of Galileo, embodied the new views in
                    his geometry of indivisibles, the theory of which he possessed in 1629, although
                    it was not published until 1635. In this work, lines were considered as made up
                    of points, surfaces as composed of lines, and solids as formed of surfaces.
                    Cavalieri was exceedingly careful to verify his method, comparing his results
                    with those which had been established by the ancient geometrical mode of
                    demonstration; and, assured by their agreement, he ventured boldly in his new
                    career. His principles were attacked, but he defended them by showing that they
                    might be translated into those of Archimedes, from which they only differed in
                    brevity of expression; his surfaces and lines being in fact merely the thin
                    solids and small inscribed and circumscribed triangles of the ancient geometer,
                    and their number being supposed so great that the difference between them and
                    the figure about which they were described was less than any assignable
                    quantity.</p>
                <p>Ťhe new views proposed by Kepler were taken up in France by Roberval, who had
                    carefully studied the writings of Archimedes, and formed a theory by which he
                    could resolve problems concerning curvilineal figures. Instead of supposing
                    lines to be made up of points,, and surfaces of lines, as had been assumed by
                    Cavalieri, he regarded a line as composed of an infinite number of infinitely
                    short lines, a surface as composed of an infinite number of infinitely narrow
                    surfaces, and so on; an assumption which at bottom was the same as that of the
                    Italian geometer, but capable of being wrought up into a theory differing less
                    from the spirit of the ancient geometry. Roberval concealed his views, employing
                    them secretly as the means of invention in geometry, and expecting in this way
                    to get the start of his contemporaries in reputation as a geometer. In the
                    meanwhile the work of Cavalieri appeared and frustrated his selfish
                    expectations.</p>
                <p>The facility which the introduction of the notion of infinitely small quantities
                    gave in the extension of geometry, induced all the mathematicians of that day to
                    employ it in their researches. In the doctrine of curve lines it was applied to
                    the theory of tangents by Roberval, Descartes, and Fermat, with great success.
                    So very near had this last-mentioned geometer approached to the fluxional or
                    differential calculus, that Laplace says he ought to be reputed its true
                    inventor. Laplace was no doubt a great authority; but the facts on which he
                    formed his opinion have always been generally known, and no one before him has
                    attempted to reverse the decision of the age in which the calculus was invented.
                    The justice of the decision has been subjected to a scrutiny by men of the
                    highest powers of mind, who, differing in many of their opinions, have yet
                    agreed in ascribing the invention to others.</p>
                <p>The problem of drawing tangents to curves is indeed closely connected with the
                    calculus, and at the period when this was about to be revealed that problem was
                    much agitated, and successfully resolved by Slusius, Wallis, Barrow, and others.
                    The writings and discoveries of .Descartes exerted a most beneficial influence
                    on the new geometry, particularly by his happy application of algebra to
                    geometry. Before his time geometrical problems had been resolved by algebra, and
                    a rich mine of discovery thereby opened. But he was the first who thought of
                    applying algebraic formulae to express the nature of curve lines; an invention
                    of vast importance to both branches or mathematical science.</p>
                <p>Another most important benefit that resulted from the new views which Descartes
                    brought forward, was the notion of <hi rend="italic">variable quantity.</hi> The
                    early analysts distinguished quantities chiefly from the circumstance of their
                    being known or unknown; and the main object of inquiry with them was to discover
                    the chain of reasoning by which they might pass from the given quantities to the
                    determination of those required. The view which Descartes took of geometrical
                    magnitude brought the <hi rend="italic">relations</hi> of quantities forward as
                    a principal subject of contemplation. A new subject of discussion was brought
                    into mathematical science, namely, the changes which take place in quantities
                    connected by an invariable relation, when one of them is supposed to change its
                    value, and pass from one state of magnitude to another. The science of geometry
                    owes its elegance and the variety of its doctrines to the combined effect of
                    magnitude and position, as they influence the subjects under consideration; and,
                    in addition to these, the doctrine of curve lines has introduced a new element,
                    namely, the property of varying in magnitude, as an attribute of quantity. This
                    property of indefinitude, in respect of greatness, although it may appear a
                    trivial affection of quantity, has, however, led to the most important
                    consequences; for from this, combined with other principles, have sprung the
                    fluxional calculus and other mathematical theories, which, originating in the
                    ordinary conceptions of the human mind, have engaged the attention of men
                    endowed with the highest powers of intellect for more than a century past.</p>
                <p>In the progress of time the notions of infinite quantity introduced by Kepler,
                    Cavalieri, and others, into mathematics, became familiar to geometers, who
                    perceived the immense value of the improvement, and saw that, by due care in its
                    application, there was no risk of its leading into error. Dr Wallis, in the year
                    1655, gave an admirable specimen of this new analysis in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetic of Infinites</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a work which contained the
                    first traces of the algebraic analysis applied to the quadrature of curvilineal
                    spaces. Pursuing the views of Cavalieri, he reduced the problem of finding the
                    areas of curves to the summation of the powers of an arithmetical series,
                    consisting of an infinite number of terms, or rather the ratio of the mean of
                    all the terms to the last term. He also showed by the same principles, that
                    certain curve lines might be <hi rend="italic">rectified,</hi> or that straight
                    lines might be found to which they were exactly equal; a remark that was shortly
                    afterwards verified by William Neil, a young mathematician of that period, who,
                    at the age of nineteen, showed that the length of the semicubical parabola might
                    be found in finite terms. This was the first curve that was rectified, and the
                    second was the cycloid, a discovery due to Sir Christopher Wren.</p>
                <p>Thus the principles of the fluxional calculus were at this period coming
                    gradually into view. Their importance was seen and understood, and in substance,
                    although without an appropriate notation, they were employed in extending the
                    dominion of geometry; it might therefore be supposed that in the course of time
                    they would have been gradually formed into a system, just in the way the science
                    of algebra advanced from the rude form it had when first introduced into Italy,
                    to that degree of compactness and perfection which it acquired by the successive
                    improvements of Vieta, Harriot, and Descartes. But, m the case of the fluxional
                    calculus, a happy combination of circumstances anticipated the slow operation of
                    time. Newton and Leibnitz, two men endowed with the highest powers of mind,
                    appeared nearly at the same time in the field, of discovery. The genius of each
                    shone with resplendent lustre, even amidst the blaze of intellect which
                    enlightened the latter period of the seventeenth century, and which has rendered
                    it for ever memorable in the annals of human<pb break="no" facs="nls:193753487"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-3487-0633"/> knowledge. They both turned their attention to
                    this branch of mathematical science, and, as is now generally admitted, each,
                    independently of the other, collected the undigested principles into a system,
                    and, by a powerful effort, performed at once what the united labour of ordinary
                    minds would have hardly accomplished in a century.</p>
                <p>In ascribing to each of these great men the full honour due to the merit of the
                    invention of the calculus, it is proper to add, that this is a question which at
                    one time divided the opinions of the learned world, and gave rise to a
                    controversy which was agitated with great keenness for almost a whole century.
                    There never could be any doubt as to Newton being the inventor of the calculus
                    of fluxions. He has been acknowledged by all to have been the inventor, and the
                    first inventor; but the question strongly contested has been, whether Leibnitz,
                    without knowing what had been done by Newton, invented his differential calculus
                    by the force of his own mind, or borrowed it from the fluxional calculus, with
                    which at bottom it is identical.</p>
                <p>In the course of this controversy it was clearly established by the British
                    mathematicians, who almost to a man ranged themselves on the side of their
                    illustrious countryman, that, as far back as the year 1669, Newton, then in his
                    twenty-sixth year, and a fellow of Trinity College, communicated to Dr Barrow a
                    tract, entitled <hi rend="italic">De Analysi per Aequationes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Numero Terminorum Infinitas.</hi> In this manuscript the method of
                    fluxions was first indicated; and rules deduced from it given for the quadrature
                    of curves, and various other matters to which the calculus is applicable, were
                    distinctly specified. From this tract, which was sent by Dr Barrow to Collins,
                    the secretary of the Royal Society, it is established beyond all doubt that
                    Newton was then in full possession of his method; and indeed it is certain from
                    other evidence that he must have had it as far back as 1666. The important
                    discoveries made by Newton were communicated without reserve by the secretaries
                    of the Royal Society to mathematicians on the Continent, as well as to those in
                    Britain. In this way it might be generally known that Newton possessed a most
                    valuable instrument of research, by which he had been led to these results,
                    although its nature was too obscurely indicated to give any assistance in
                    divining its precise form.</p>
                <p>Leibnitz appears to have been later than Newton in beginning his career of
                    discovery in the mathematics. In the year 1672, being then in London, he
                    communicated to some members of the Royal Society what he supposed to be
                    discoveries relating to the differences of numbers. It was, however, shown to
                    him that the same subject had been discussed long before, by Mouton, a French
                    geometer. He then appears for the first time to have turned his attention to
                    infinite series. Afterwards, on his return to Germany in 1674, he announced to
                    Mr Oldenburgh, then secretary of the Royal Society of London, that he possessed
                    very general analytical methods, by which he had found theorems of great
                    importance relating to the quadrature of the circle, by means of series. In
                    answer, the secretary informed him that Newton and James Gregory had also
                    discovered methods which gave the quadrature of curves, and which extended to
                    the circle.</p>
                <p>In the year 1676 Newton addressed a letter to the secretary of the Royal Society,
                    which was made known to Leibnitz. This was the first direct communication
                    between these two great men. It contained the binomial theorem, which Newton had
                    known in the year 1669, and a variety of other matters relating to infinite
                    series and quadratures; but nothing directly relating to the method of fluxions.
                    At this time Newton entertained no jealousy of Leibnitz, for he sneaks of him in
                    the letter with great respect. In a second letter Newton explained at his
                    request the way in which he had found the binomial theorem, and he adverted also
                    to his own calculus, explaining the purposes to which it could be applied, but
                    concealing its nature under the form of an anagram of transposed letters, which
                    was expressed thus, 6αced <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> αe13e^713Z9n4o
                    49rτ∙4s9i12ya‰ It is not easy to see what certain information Leibnitz could
                    draw from this assemblage of characters; yet such was the effect of national
                    prejudice in biassing the minds of the British mathematicians, that Raphson, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">History of Fluxions,</hi> a work dedicated to the Royal
                    Society of London, expressly asserts that Leibnitz deciphered the anagram, and
                    found it to be this sentence, <hi rend="italic">Data equatione</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fluentes</hi><hi rend="italic">quotcunque quantitates</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">involvente</hi><hi rend="italic">in. venire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fluxiones,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi>
                    “Having any given equation involving never so many flowing quantities, to find
                    the fluxions, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa”</hi> We believe there was not
                    the least ground for this assertion; and from such a specimen of want of
                    candour, it is easy to infer that there was very little chance of Leibnitz
                    getting justice done him by the English mathematicians.</p>
                <p>In the month of June 1677 Leibnitz sent to Mr Oldenburgh, to be communicated to
                    Newton, a letter containing the first essays of a method which extended to all
                    that could be done by that of Newton. The death of Oldenburgh, which happened
                    soon afterwards, put an end to the correspondence, and it was not until the year
                    1684 that Leibnitz made his discovery public, it being then inserted in the
                    Leipsic Acts; so that whilst Newton’s claim to the priority of the discovery
                    must be admitted by all, it is not less certain that Leibnitz was the first to
                    give the full benefit of the calculus to the world; for Newton’s Method of
                    Fluxions only became generally known in the year 1687, by the publication of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Philosophice Naturalis Principia.</hi></p>
                <p>It is certain that Leibnitz enjoyed unchallenged for fifteen years the honour of
                    being the inventor of his calculus; even Newton himself rendered him that
                    justice in the first edition of his immortal work. Subsequently, however, a
                    foreign mathematician, Fatio de Duillier, piqued, it is said, by having been
                    omitted in an enumeration of eminent geometers by Leibnitz, declared, in a
                    treatise on the line of shortest descent, printed at London in 1699, that he was
                    obliged by the undeniable evidence of things to acknowledge Newton not only as
                    the first, but as by many years the first inventor of this calculus; from whom,
                    whether Leibnitz, the second inventor, borrowed any thing or not, he would
                    rather they who had seen Newton’s letters and other manuscripts should judge
                    than himself.</p>
                <p>The insinuation contained in this passage of Fatio’s book could not but be very
                    offensive to Leibnitz, who inserted an animated reply in the Leipsic Acts of
                    1700, and complained to the Royal Society of London of the injustice done him;
                    and here the affair rested for a time: but it was revived some years afterwards.
                    When Newton’s treatise on the quadrature of curves, and his enumeration of lines
                    of the third order, was published, the Leipsic journalists gave an unfavourable
                    review of the work. Amongst other things, after a brief exposition of the nature
                    of fluxions, they added, that Newton uses and has always used fluxions for the
                    differences of Leibnitz, just as Fabri had substituted in his synopsis of
                    geometry motion instead of the indivisibles of Cavalieri. This most unjust
                    accusation excited great indignation in the minds of the British mathematicians,
                    one of whom, Keill, Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford, in a paper
                    inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions of</hi> the year
                    1708, affirmed that Newton was the first inventor of the calculus, and that
                    Leibnitz, in publishing it in the Leipsic Acts, had merely changed the name and
                    the notation. Leibnitz, thus directly charg-ed<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193753500" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3500-0634"/> with having taken his
                    calculus from that of Newton, addressed a letter to Mr, afterwards Sir Hans
                    Sloane, the secretary of the Royal Society, in which he required that Keill
                    should retract his accusation. Keill however refused to do this, and in answer
                    addressed a letter to the secretary, in which he professed to show, not only
                    that Newton had preceded Leibnitz in the invention, but that he had given so
                    many indications of his calculus that its nature might easily be understood by
                    any man of ordinary understanding. This letter was sent to Leibnitz, who
                    addressed a second letter to the Royal Society, requiring that they should stop
                    these reproaches of Keill, saying that he was too young a man to know what had
                    passed between him and Newton.</p>
                <p>The society, thus appealed to as a judge, appointed a committee to examine the
                    old letters, papers, and. documents which had passed between the mathematicians
                    on the subject. The report of this committee does not appear altogether
                    satisfactory. “We take the proper question to be,” say the reporters, “not who
                    invented this or that method, but who was the first inventor of the method; and
                    we believe those who have reputed Leibnitz the first inventor, knew little or
                    nothing of the correspondence between Mr Collins and Mr Oldenburg long before,
                    nor of Mr Newton having that method about fifteen years before Mr Leibnitz began
                    to publish his in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eruditorum</hi> of Leipsic; for which reason we reckon Mr Newton the first
                    inventor, and are of opinion that Mr Keill, in asserting the same, has been
                    nowise injurious to Mr Leibnitz.” This declares nothing on the only point about
                    which there could be any doubt, namely, whether Leibnitz had formed his calculus
                    entirely by the power of his own genius, or had availed himself of a knowledge
                    of Newton’s invention. The judgment satisfied neither party. Keill wished to
                    establish against Leibnitz the charge of plagiarism, but was disappointed; and
                    Leibnitz found in the decision grounds of complaint against the Royal Society.
                    In a communication to the Abbé Conti, a Venetian nobleman and a common friend of
                    his and Newton, then in England, he accused the English nation of desiring to be
                    considered as almost the only inventors. He said it did not appear, as had been
                    well observed by Bernoulli, that Newton possessed before him the infinitesimal
                    characteristic and algorithm, although it would have been easy to have found it
                    if he had been so disposed, just as it would have been easy for Apollonius to
                    have discovered the theory of curve lines of Descartes. He complained that his
                    opponents had attacked his candour by forced and unfounded interpretations of
                    his words. The question was the calculus of differences, and his opponents made
                    it turn entirely upon series, where Newton had no difficulty in going before
                    him. He maintained that he had found for himself a general method for series,
                    and that he had no need of Newton’s method of extractions. There were other
                    grounds of complaint, such as, that only extracts from letters had been given in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ċommerciwn Εpistoli-cum</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    f</hi> whereas the entire letters should have been published· Throughout the
                    whole, which is a postscript to a letter, he manifests much chagrin; and he
                    concludes with proposing this problem, intended, he says, to feel the pulse of
                    the English analysts: To find a line which shall cut perpendicularly all curves
                    of a determinate series, and of the same kind; for example, all hyperbolas,
                    which shall have the same vertex and centre. This he desires the abbe to propose
                    as from himself, or a friend thl. <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> ι <hi

                    writing until he could at the same time send the answer which Newton had given
                    to his postscript. He tells him that he had read the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commercium</hi><hi rend="italic">Ep</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ls</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tohcum,</hi> and the originals of the letters which it contained,
                    and, on the whole, he inferred that, setting aside matters foreign to the
                    dispute, the only question at issue was, whether Newton had found the Calculus
                    of Infinitesimals, or Fluxions, before, or after him? The abbé says, you
                    published it first, it is true; but you admit that Newton allowed much to
                    transpire in the’letters which he wrote to Oldenburgh and others. This has been
                    proved at length in the <hi rend="italic">Commercium</hi> and its extract; what
                    is your answer? This is what the public requires, to form a correct opinion on
                    the matter. The abbé further informs Leibnitz that his friends believe he
                    x&gt;ught to give an answer, if not to Keill, at least to Newton himself, who,
                    in the letter which the abbé had received from him to be communicated to
                    Leibnitz, had challenged him in express terms. In a spirit of friendship and
                    good sense, he further adds, that he wishes to see á good understanding between
                    them, that the public will profit but little by their disputes, and that the
                    additions to knowledge which they prevent are a pure loss to posterity. He
                    moreover tells him that the king, George L, had desired to be informed of all
                    that had passed between Newton and him. From this we may judge what an interest
                    was excited in the public mind by a dispute which, even at this day, fetv could
                    perfectly understand. The answer which Leibnitz gave to the abbé’s friendly
                    advice was, that he had put his letters, and Newton’s, with his own answers to
                    them, into the hands of Mr Remond at Paris, with a view to have a neutral and
                    impartial opinion as to the matters in dispute. The whole were then to be
                    submitted to the Abbé Varignon and other members of the Royal Academy of
                    Sciences, and afterwards sent to England. In his answers he disavowed the sense
                    which the English mathematicians had extracted from the assertion of the Leipsic
                    journalists, namely, that Newton employed and always had employed fluxions for
                    the differentials of Leibnitz,, which they understood to mean that Newton had
                    availed himself of Leibnitz’s method, only substituting fluxions for
                    differentials. It was from this passage that the English had declared Leibnitz
                    to be the aggressor, in having abetted an attack of Newton; but Leibnitz
                    declared the English interpretation to be full of malignity towards him, and
                    that the sentence in the <hi rend="italic">Leipsic Acts (Pro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">differentiis</hi><hi rend="italic">Leibnitianis D.

                    fluxions after having seen his differences, and also before he had seen
                    them.</p>
                <p>We believe enough has been detailed to show that, besides a desire to arrive at
                    truth, there was infused into this controversy the jealousy of two rivals for
                    the glory of a great discovery; and, in addition, the spirit of partizanship of
                    their respective admirers, and that natural feeling which induces men of
                    different countries to exalt their own nation, although sometimes at the expense
                    of their neighbours. It is not wonderful, then, that at the time this
                    controversy was at its height, men were greatly divided in their opinions.</p>
                <p>It is now impossible to obtain absolute certainty as to the question, whether
                    Leibnitz derived any aid from the discoveries previously made by Newton, which,
                    to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> certain extent, were made known to the scientific
                    world. It may therefore be some satisfaction, in the want of perfect evidence,
                    to have the judgment of Montucla, the historian of the mathematics, on this
                    subject. “In regard to the principle of fluxions,” says he, “there are only
                    three places of the <hi rend="italic">Commercium Epistolicum</hi> which treat o
                    it with sufficient clearness to prove that Newton hat found it before Leibnitz,
                    but I believe too obscurely to take from him the merit of the discovery, one o
                    these is a letter from Newton to Oldenburgh, who had re marked to him that
                    Slusius and Gregory had found a very <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753513"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-3513-0635"/>simple method of tangents. Newton answered that he
                    conjectured what it was, and he gave an example, which is in effect the same
                    thing as these two geometers had found. He added that it was but a particular
                    case, or rather a corollary to a method much more general, by which tangents.to
                    all sorts of curves, whether geometrical or mechanical, might be found without
                    laborious calculation. He repeated the same thing, without explaining himself
                    further, in his second letter, which has been already mentioned, and he
                    concealed the principle under transposed letters. The only writing in which
                    Newton had allowed any thing of his method to transpire is his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Analysis per Equationes</hi><hi rend="italic">numero Terminorum infinitas.</hi>
                    He there briefly and obscurely reveals-his principle of fluxions. It cannot be
                    denied that the principle and method were there indicated; but it is not certain
                    that Leibnitz had ever seen the passage. His adversaries have never said that it
                    had been communicated to him by letter; they have merely thrown out a suspicion
                    that Collins might have communicated it to him in his second journey to London.
                    Indeed the suspicion is not altogether void of probability, inasmuch as Leibnitz
                    admitted that in his interview with the secretary he had seen a part of his
                    epistolary correspondence. I believe, however, that it would be rash to
                    pronounce upon this. There might have been grounds for suspicion if Leibnitz had
                    merely given a few essays of his new calculus; but when we consider the
                    improvements he made, as appears by the number of pieces he contributed to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Leipsic Acts,</hi> it seems probable that he owed his calculus
                    to his own genius, and his efforts to divine the nature of a method by which
                    Newton had made so many fine discoveries. This is the more probable, as from the
                    method of tangents of Barrow to the differential calculus, the step is not too
                    great to have been made by a power of mind of which Leibnitz had given so many
                    proofs.”</p>
                <p>If it had been true, as the British mathematicians alleged, that Leibnitz had
                    taken his calculus from that of Newton, it would have been a very remarkable
                    circumstance that such a long period should have elapsed between his first
                    putting forth his pretensions to the honour of the invention, and the denial of
                    Newton and his friends. This is a thing uncommon in the history of contested
                    claims to discovery, when both the claimants are alive and all the facts known.
                    It is also remarkable that Newton, while in the prime of life, did not of his
                    own accord bring forward a charge of plagiarism against his contemporary. On the
                    contrary, in the first edition of his <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> which
                    appeared in 1687, he expressly admitted Leibnitz’s claim; and this admission is
                    found even in the edition of the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> published in
                    1713. It is now well known, that before the period of the controversy between
                    Newton and Leibnitz, the mind of the former had at one time been in a state
                    which rendered him unfit to draw correct conclusions from the ordinary incidents
                    of life; witness his letters to Mr Pepys and Mr Locke in September 1693
                    (Brewster’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Newton).</hi> At this time he seems to
                    have laboured under great bodily indisposition, from which he afterwards in
                    appearance recovered; indeed it may be doubted whether his temper was so equal
                    and mild in the latter period of his life as has been represented by his
                    biographers. A collection of letters which passed between Flamsteed the
                    astronomer and Abraham Sharp the celebrated calculator, which have lately come
                    into the possession of the Astronomical Society of London, prove that Newton, in
                    conjunction with Halley, opposed Flamsteed in the publication of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Caelestis,</hi> a work of the
                    highest merit, and the result °f the labour of his life, with a pertinacity of
                    purpose <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> hich is by no means an amiable trait in
                    his character. It is certain that Newton entertained towards Leibnitz a very
                    different feeling at one period of his life, from that which he in the end
                    evinced. In the edition of the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> 1713, and those
                    which preceded it, he says, <hi rend="superscript"> &lt;¢</hi> Ten years ago, in
                    a correspondence with Mr Leibnitz, I informed him that I had a method of
                    determining maxima and minima, of drawing tangents, and resolving similar
                    problems, which applied alike to rational and irrational terms, but concealed it
                    under transposed letters. He answered that he had found a like method, which he
                    communicated, and which differed from mine only in the terms and the signs, and
                    in the way of conceiving quantities to be generated.” This concession was
                    liberal, and worthy of Newton. However, in the edition of 1726, he retracted
                    this act of justice, having struck out the passage, as Montucla assures us, with
                    his own hand. The historian of the mathematics, however, finds an excuse for
                    this harshness in the treatment which Newton had received from Leibnitz’s
                    friends.</p>
                <p>The circumstance of the calculus having had two distinct origins, had the
                    inconvenient effect of giving it two different forms and names. Newton at
                    different times used different notations before he finally adopted that which
                    has been followed by the English mathematicians. Leibnitz and his followers
                    employed one somewhat different; and each sect pertinaciously adhered to the
                    example set by its leader. There was a still greater difference in the view
                    which each party took of quantity, and the way in which it may be generated.
                    Newton conceived geometrical magnitudes to be generated by continued motion, a
                    line by a point in motion, a surface by a moving line, a solid by a moving
                    surface, an angle by a line turning about a point, and so on. It is evident,
                    that by assuming geometrical quantities as the representatives of time, force,
                    and whatever can be expressed by number, these can be conceived to increase or
                    decrease according to the same laws as their geometrical representatives. His
                    calculus therefore consisted of two parts:</p>
                <p>Is/, Supposing two quantities to have a given relation to each other (for
                    example, the one to be always equal to the square of the other), and the rate of
                    increase of one of them at any instant of time to be known; to find the rate of
                    increase of the other at the same instant. These rates of increase were called
                    the <hi rend="italic">fluxions</hi> of the quantities; and the rules for their
                    determination constituted the <hi rend="italic">direct method of fluxions.</hi>
                    2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, The second part was the reverse problem, in which the
                    relation between the rates of increase of two quantities which depended the one
                    on the other, being given, it was required to discover the relation of the
                    quantities. This was the inverse method. ∙</p>
                <p>Leibnitz at first supposed quantity to increase by the addition of some
                    indefinite portion of a quantity of the same kind, and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >differentials</hi> were quantities proportional to the instantaneous changes in
                    the greatness of the quantities thus generated. He afterwards found it shorter
                    to introduce directly these instantaneous changes into his calculus under the
                    name of infinitely little differences <hi rend="italic">(infiniment
                    petites).</hi> These however he did not regard as absolute <hi rend="italic"
                    >zeros,</hi> but only as not comparable to finite magnitudes. His calculus had,
                    like Newton’s, two parts, the <hi rend="italic">differential calculus,</hi>
                    which gave rules for deducting the relation of the differentials of quantities
                    from that of the quantities themselves, and the <hi rend="italic">integral
                    oalculιιs,</hi> which resolved the reverse problem, or discovered the relation
                    of the quantities when the relation of their differentials was known. This
                    corresponded to the inverse method of fluxions, as the differential calculus
                    corresponded to the direct method.</p>
                <p>There is this distinction, then, between the two methods: </p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753526" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3526-0636"/>
                <p>Newton’s fluxions are any finite quantities which have to teach other the ratio
                    of the velocities, or degree of quickness with which the quantities are
                    generated.· 1he differentials of Leibnitz are infinitely small quantities, a
                    creation of the mind more removed from ordinary apprehen-; sion than the finite
                    representatives of fluxions. This distinction has often been urged in favour of
                    the superiority I of Newton’s calculus. On the other hand, Newton has ι
                    introduced time into his calculus. Now this is an element foreign to geometry,
                    and belonging to mechanics, a quite distinct branch of science. The metaphysical
                    distinctions between the two forms of the calculus have had but little influence
                    on its progress. Whichever of the two forms is chosen, the rules are the same;
                    and so also are the difficulties to be overcome Some time elapsed before the
                    newly invented calculus was actively employed. At length Leibnitz, to rouse the
                    attention of geometers, proposed in 1687 this problem: To determine the curve
                    along which a heavy body must descend, so as to approach by equal distances in
                    equal times to a horizontal plane. Huygens was the first to resolve the problem.
                    He showed what was the nature of the curve; but he did not give his
                    demonstration. James Bernoulli also resolved the problem by the differential
                    calculus, and published his analysis in the <hi rend="italic">Leipsic Acts.</hi>
                    His younger brother John united himself in a close friendship with Leibnitz, and
                    continued throughout life his coadjutor and staunch defender. He made the
                    calculus known in France, where he resided for a time, and gave lessons to the
                    Marquis de l’Hôpital. Part of these form the <hi rend="italic">Analyse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des infiniment</hi><hi rend="italic">Petits,</hi> a work which
                    bears the name of the marquis, with but a slight acknowledgment in the preface
                    of the share which his preceptor had in its composition. Indeed it was almost
                    entirely his; and of this injury Bernoulli complained justly, but privately, in
                    his correspondence with Leibnitz. The remaining lessons, which teach the
                    integral calculus, are given in the collection of Bernoulli’s works, published
                    in 1742. The whole form an excellent exposition of the principles of the
                    calculus, and contain some of its finest applications.The continental
                    mathematicians who were remarkable for their skill in the differential calculus
                    were at first few in number. They might be nearly all included in the names of
                    Leibnitz himself, James and John Bernoulli, De l’Hôpital, and Varignon. They
                    were, however, remarkably active, particularly the Bernoullis, whose writings
                    have contributed powerfully to its advancement The inventor of the fluxional
                    calculus seems to have taken but little interest in its extension. His treatise
                    on quadratures did not appear till 1706; and his work on fluxions was not
                    published in his life time, but appeared in 1736, nine years after his death. He
                    had however fully availed himself of its power in the composition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia,</hi> without revealing to the full extent the nature of
                    the instrument with which he wrought, but establishing the truth of his
                    propositions by synthetic demonstration,after the manner of the ancient
                    geometers. Probably this was done in deference to the taste of that time; for a
                    contemporary writer, Hermann, in following his example in the composition of his
                    <hi rend="italic">Phoronomia,</hi> assigned to Leibnitz as a reason, that the
                    geometrical method was likely to be better understood than the analytical in
                    Italy. 1his way of proceeding is now, however, disused by the best writers/and
                    replaced by the more legitimate and undisguised use of the calculus.</p>
                <p>The extensive views which the new calculus opened up, afforded the means of
                    resolving problems which had baffled the skill of the earlier mathematicians,
                    and suggested many new ones which without its aid would hav⅞ been quite
                    intractable. The cycloid and the catenary, curves which had eluded the
                    penetrating mind of Galileo, were more fully comprehended; many new ones were
                    suggested and the cultivators of the calculus challenged each other to an
                    investigation of their properties. There is an elegant class of problems which
                    relate to the greatest and least values of quantities. Some of these, called
                    problems of <hi rend="italic">maxima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">minima,</hi> can
                    be resolved by the ordinary geometry and algebra; but there is a class which
                    lies beyond the dominion of these, and to it belongs the solid of least
                    resistance, the curve of swiftest descent, and, in general, the problems called
                    <hi rend="italic">isoperimetrical,</hi> one of the simplest of which is to find
                    the nature of the line which, bein&lt;, given in length, shall comprehend the
                    greatest possible space. These formed the subject of a warm but honourable
                    contest between the two Bernoullis, brothers; and their investigation laid the
                    foundations of that branch of the calculus, the highest, which has been formed
                    into a theory by the labours of Euler and Lagrange, under the name of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Calculus of Variations.</hi></p>
                <p>Among the early cultivators of the calculus in Britain we may reckon Cotes, the
                    friend of Newton, who died at the early age of thirty-four (his <hi
                    rend="italic">Harmonia Mensurarum,</hi> and other writings, indicate a genius of
                    the highest order), De Moivre, Taylor, Craig, David Gregory, and Stirling. It
                    must, however, be confessed, that the continental school in the course of time
                    advanced before that of Britain, as well in the number of its disciples, as in
                    their high mathematical genius and the importance of their discoveries. John
                    Bernoulli had two sons, Nicoas and Daniel, who rivalled their father’s skill in
                    the applications of the calculus; and these had as condisciples Hermann and
                    Euler. This last mathematician has carried the subject to a point of perfection
                    far beyond what it had attained in the hands of those that had gone before
                    him.</p>
                <p>Amongst the means by which the improvement of the calculus has been promoted, we
                    may reckon the problems which passed between the British and continental
                    mathematicians as challenges to each other, in answering which Newton himself
                    condescended sometimes to enter the lists. The doctrine of infinite series, a
                    branch of the mathematics of English origin, gives powerful aid to the calculus
                    in its greatest difficulties; but, legitimately, its assistance ought not to be
                    called in if the problem admit of being resolved in finite terms. The English
                    sometimes failed in the observance of this most proper condition of a good
                    solution, and thus gave rise to reproaches from their opponents, which in at
                    least one instance were not unjustly incurred by Newton himself. In the course
                    of this warfare, Keill, the champion of the English, proposed as a challenge to
                    John Bernoulli, to determine the nature of the curve which a projectile
                    describes in a medium resisting as the square of the velocity. Bernoulli soon
                    resolved the problem, not only in the case proposed, but also when the
                    resistance was as any power whatever of the velocity. He then proposed to put
                    his solution into the hands of some confidential person in London, provided that
                    Keill would deliver his solution to the same person. Keill, however, had upon
                    trial not been able to resolve the problem, and therefore preserved a profound
                    silence, and made himself, by his boasting and failure, quite ridiculous. The
                    triumph of Bernoulli was complete, and he did not miss the opportunity of
                    bestowing severe castigation on his humbled adversary, recollecting, we may
                    suppose, the treatment which his deceased and lamented friend Leibnitz had
                    received from him and his friends.</p>
                <p>As another proof of the spirit and rivalry of the supporters of the two
                    analytical theories, we may mention that Brooke Taylor proposed a problem in the
                    intégra calculus to all geometers not English, and sent it to 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> Montmort to be communicated to the foreign
                    geometers.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753539" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3539-0637"/>
                <p>Notwithstanding the general terms of the challenge, it was well understood to be
                    particularly aimed at John Bernoulli, who in return offered to wager fifty Louis
                    that he would resolve the problem, and to stake fifty more that he would propose
                    a problem which he himself could resolve, but which Taylor could not. The
                    English mathematician did not think it prudent to accept the offered condition.
                    Indeed it was a complaint against the English geometers, that although they made
                    no scruple of trying to puzzle foreigners with difficulties, they rarely
                    responded to the counter challenges proposed to themselves.</p>
                <p>Perhaps there never was a considerable invention or discovery which had not to
                    encounter opposition; sometimes from the slowness with which the human mind
                    yields to the force of truth when opposed to long-received opinions, and
                    sometimes from less excusable causes, such as mistaken or interested views, or
                    mere jealousy excited by the fame of the inventor. The new calculus had in the
                    very outset its opponents, such as the Abbé de Catelan, a zealous Cartesian, who
                    declared that it would be better to extend the principles of the Cartesian
                    geometry than to seek for new methods; and this was said in the preface of a
                    book composed on the principles, somewhat disguised, of the very calculus of
                    which he was an opponent. It had another adversary in Nieuwentiit, a man who had
                    written some tolerable works on morality and religion, but who had but small
                    pretensions to be regarded as a geometer. Catelan was satisfactorily answered by
                    De ľHôpital, as was Nieuwentiit by Leibnitz, and afterwards by Bernoulli and
                    Hermann, who proved that this adversary of the calculus really did not know what
                    he opposed.</p>
                <p>The calculus had a more formidable enemy in Μ. Rolle, a skilful algebraist and
                    indefatigable calculator, but aman full of confidence in his own notions, rash
                    in forming his opinions, and jealous of the inventions of others. He attacked
                    the certainty of its principles, and he attempted to show that its conclusions
                    were at variance with those obtained by methods previously known, which were
                    acknowledged to be correct. His attack was repelled by Varignon, who completely
                    obviated the objections to the truth of the principles, and further showed that
                    the supposed discrepancy between its conclusions and those obtained by other
                    methods, were mistakes he had committed from haste and inadvertence. These
                    disputes occupied the French Academy a considerable part of the year 1701. The
                    members were chiefly geometers considerably advanced in years, who had been long
                    accustomed to other methods, and were therefore not much disposed to receive new
                    doctrines. Some took no part in the dispute, yet were not sorry to see a storm
                    raised against a theory for which they had no great liking, and took no means to
                    allay it; others, more under the influence of heir passions and prejudices,
                    yielded to these, and declared open war against it. In this state of things the
                    best course was supposed to be that of hearing all which could be said for and
                    against the calculus. The academy ’as long involved in the dispute. Rolle
                    brought forward objection upon objection; and although Varignon continually
                    obviated them, yet the former always claimed the ιctory. In the end the dispute
                    degenerated into a real uarrel, and commissioners were appointed to decide on
                    it. 1hese were Père Gouye, MM. Cassini and de la Hire, . <hi rend="superscript">

                    was next taken up <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> y Μ. Saurin. The ground of
                    attack was the indefinite <hi rend="superscript"> 0rtn</hi> which the calculus
                    gives for the subtangent of a curve at the point where two branches intersect
                    each other, and which in this case is expressed by the fraction -∙ Saurin’s
                    answer was satisfactory; but Rolle, intrenched in masses of calculation,
                    obstinately maintained the combat. 1he academy was again appealed to. The Abbé
                    Bignon, who conducted its affairs, undertóok to decide the controversy, with the
                    assistance of MM. Gallois and De la Hire, two judges by no means favourable to
                    Saurin. They gave no absolute judgment; but recommended to Rolle to conform more
                    strictly to the rules of the academy, and to Saurin to forgive the proceedings
                    of his adversary. Rolle suffered in the estimation of competent judges; he,
                    however, afterwards did justice to the calculus, by acknowledging that he had
                    done wrong in opposing it, and admitting that he had been urged forward by the
                    instigation of malevolent persons, one of whom was the Abbé Gallois; and his
                    demise in 1707 accordingly put an end to the controversy.</p>
                <p>In England the Newtonian calculus had to sustain an attack on its principles from
                    a writer of first-rate talents, Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne. The circumstances
                    which led to it are curious. Mr Addison had given the bishop an account of the
                    behaviour of their common friend, Dr Garth, in his last illness, which was
                    highly unpleasing to these two advocates of revealed religion; for when Addison
                    began to discourse with Garth on a future state, “Surely,” said the latter, “I.
                    have no reason to believe these trifles, when my friend Dr Halley, who has dealt
                    so much in demonstration, has assured me that the doctrines of Christianity are
                    incomprehensible, and religion itself an imposture.” The bishop therefore took
                    up arms against Halley, and in the year 1734 addressed to him, as an infidel, a
                    discourse called The Analyst, the object of which was to prove that
                    mathematicians acted inconsistently in objecting to mysteries in faith, seeing
                    that they did not hesitate to admit much greater mysteries, and even falsehoods,
                    in their own science; and he chose the principles of the doctrine of Fluxions,
                    as laid down by Newton and adopted by his followers, to prove the truth of his
                    proposition. It may be supposed that so able a writer would not fail to make an
                    impression on the public mind. But the mathematicians were not slow in coming
                    forward in defence of the doctrines of their chief. In the same year came out a
                    tract with this title: “Geometry No Friend to Infidelity, or a Defence of Sir I.
                    Newton and the British Mathematicians, by Philalethes Cantabrigiensis,” supposed
                    to be Dr Jurin. As usual the attack was renewed, and again repelled by the same
                    hand. Other defences of Newton appeared, one of the best of which was from the
                    pen of Benjamin Robins; it was entitled A Discourse concerning the Nature and
                    Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton’s Method of Fluxions, and of Prime and Ultimate
                    Ratios. But the most important result of this controversy was A Treatise on
                    Fluxions from the pen of Colin Maclaurin, professor of mathematics in the
                    university of Edinburgh, printed in 1742. This defence of the principles of
                    Newton’s views, expressly intended to obviate all objections, is quite
                    satisfactory. The treatise is indeed considerably prolix; but this was a
                    consequence of the circumstances in which it was composed. It however contains a
                    great deal more than a mere theory of fluxions. We have in it some of the finest
                    applications of analysis to the principal problems which had been agitated
                    amongst geometers from the invention of the calculus to the time in which the
                    work appeared.</p>
                <p>By the middle of the century the calculus proceeded with a rapid march of
                    improvement. Euler in 1744 greatly enriched it by his solution of the
                    Isoperimetric Problem <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">Solutio

                    proposed to make the calculus altogether inde-: pendent of the consideration of
                    infinity, and to rest on principles purely analytical, thus connecting it with
                    the doctrines of the ordinary algebra. He has since realised and extended his
                    views in his <hi rend="italic">Theorie</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                    works which, from their excellence and the celebrity of their author, have
                    formed a new era in the history of the calculus.The twofold origin of the
                    calculus, besides placing its principles on different foundations, gave it also
                    two different forms of notation; and in this state it continued during the whole
                    of the eighteenth century, to the great inconvenience of mathematical students,
                    and, we may add, to the hindrance of the progress of science. A change, however,
                    has taken place within the last twenty years; during that period some British
                    geometers, imbued with the mathematics of the continent, adopted also its
                    notation in preference to that of the followers of Newton, and employed it
                    publicly in their researches. This spirit of innovation in time took possession
                    of the minds of the junior members of the university of Cambridge, and now we
                    may say that it has completely supplanted the native notation. We have retained
                    the name of Fluxions, because, from the changes which have taken place in the
                    way of treating the subject since the days of Leibnitz and Newton, it seems to
                    be as proper as the term differential. It is otherwise with the notation. This
                    is consecrated by its having been employed in the writings of Euler, D’Alembert,
                    Lagrange, and other great masters in mathematical science; and besides, it has
                    advantages over the other in point of symmetry and compactness, and the
                    established reputation of a whole century of useful service. It is true, the
                    late illustrious Lagrange laid it aside in his attempt above mentioned to
                    new-model the calculus; but subsequent writers, in extracting what was excellent
                    from his works, have ic general invested his views with the ordinary notation of
                    the continent. In the following treatise we shall conform to this beneficial

                    carried the subject further. The same period abounded in good writers. In this
                    country Demoivre, Simpson, Landen, and Waring, stand among the foremost in the
                    list for the originality of their views; on the continent Ricatti, Clairaut,
                    Fontaine, and others, followed in the train of Euler and the Bemoullis.</p>
                <p>It is a curious fact in the history of mathematics, that there are instances of
                    ladies who have applied their talents to its study and improvement with much
                    success. Hypatia. the daughter of the ancient geometer Theon, is one notable
                    instance. Unfortunately we have no vestiges of her writings by which we might
                    form an estimate of her proficiency in a science which at firstsight seems not
                    to have many attractions for the female mind. We have another instance in an
                    Italian lady, Maria Gaetana Agnesi, who was actually professor of mathematics in
                    the University of Bologna in the year 1748; and how well she was qualified for
                    the office appears from her Analytical Institutions, a work of great excellence
                    on algebra, the theory of curve lines, and the differential calculus, composed
                    for the instruction of the youth of Italy. This work is so excellent, that
                    Bossut, a French mathematician of great eminence, translated the parton the
                    differential calculus into French, and incorporated it with his Course of
                    Mathematics, as the best treatise he could find on the subject. There is also an
                    English translation by the Rev. John Colson, Lucasian professor of mathematics
                    in the university of Cambridge. Her countryman Frisi, a most competent judge,
                    mentions her in enumerating the mathematicians of Italy, and bestows great
                    praise on her work, calling it <hi rend="italic">opus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    admirable instance of a lady who has surmounted the difficulties of the
                    calculus. Mrs Somerville, in her work entitled <hi rend="italic">Mechanism of
                    the Heavens,</hi> London, .1831, has enriched English literature with <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> treatise on physical astronomy, in which the different
                    branches of the calculus are combined with the most refined theories of
                    mechanics. Her book does her infinite credit, and indeed is highly honourable to
                    the whole female sex.</p>
                <p>Geometers have differed in opinion as to the best way of working up the
                    principles of the calculus into a system. Newton, as has already been stated,
                    employed the theory of motion as the means of connecting its doctrines with the
                    principles of the ordinary algebraic analysis. Leibnitz, again, with the same
                    view, conceived quantity as passing from one degree of magnitude to another by
                    the continual accretion of infinitely small parts. The mind finds no great
                    difficulty in distinctly apprehending tie subject in its simplest state either
                    way. Objections have, however, been taken to both, and attempts made to
                    substitute a better. Euler considered the infinitely small quantities of
                    Leibnitz as absolute zeros, that have to each other ratios derived from those of

                <p>The preceding catalogue contains the names of the principal improvers and
                    cultivators of the calculus, from its first invention to the end of the last
                    century. However, it does not contain all their writings; to have enumerated
                    these would have extended the catalogue to too great a length. Almost all the
                    improvements of the calculus Were first given in the form of academical memoirs,
                    from which they have been drawn, and incorporated into the systems that have
                    from time to time been published. The great repertories in which it is contained
                    are the writings of Newton, Cotes, Demoivre, theBernoullis, Maclaurin, Simpson,
                    Euler, D’Alembert, Lagrange, Legendre, La Place, Monge, Poisson, Gauss, Ampère,
                    Ivory, &amp;c. From these have been constructed the treatises of De 1 Hôpital,
                    Bougainville, Le Seurand Jacquier, Cousin, and others, which were the most
                    complete at the different periods when they appeared. At this time the most
                    extensive treatise is the second edition of Lacroix, which came out between 1810
                    and 1819. In the present century there have been published in France treatises
                    by Garnier, Du Bourguet, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753578"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-3578-0640"/>Boucharlat, Cauchy, and others which we have not
                    seen. In Britain we have had treatises by Woodhouse, Dealtry, Lardner, Jephson,
                    Young, Thomson, and others. The university of Cambridge, long infertile, now
                    teems with treatises on the subject, such as those of Brown, Coddington,
                    Earnshaw, Hymer, Jarret, Millar, Myers, and Peacock. There are, besides,
                    treatises on the calculus in courses of mathematics, such as the Elementi
                    d’Algebra of Paoli, the Cours des Mathématiques of Bezout, a like work by
                    Francoeur, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> There have also been works constructed
                    for the benefit of students, which may be used with any treatise on the subject,
                    such as the excellent collection of examples by Peacock, Herschel, and Babbage,
                    which was intended as an accompaniment to an English translation of an
                    abridgment of Lacroix’s treatise; and the integral tables of Hirsch, which have
                    been translated from the original German into English.</p>
                <p>There is a branch of the calculus of great interest, which of late has engaged,
                    and will probably long engage, the attention of mathematicians; we mean the
                    subject of <hi rend="italic">Elliptic Transcendents.</hi> This theory originated
                    in the discovery of a very remarkable property of the ellipse and hyperbola by
                    Fagnano, an Italian mathematician, who first showed that arcs of these curves
                    can be assigned, of which the difference is expressible in finite algebraic
                    terms. This most interesting subject has been discussed by the following

                <p>DIRECT METHOD OF FLUXIONS, OR DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS.</p>
                <p>1. In the application of algebra to the theory of curve lines, some of the
                    quantities under consideration are conceived as having always the same magnitude
                    as the parameter of a parabola, and the axes of an ellipse or hyperbola; others
                    again are indefinite in respect of magnitude, and may have any number of
                    particular values; such are the co-ordinates at any point in a curve. This
                    difference in the nature of the quantities has equally place in various theories
                    of the pure and mixed mathematics, and it naturally suggests the division of all
                    quantities into two kinds; namely, such as are constant, and such as are
                    variable.</p>
                <p>A constant quantity is that which is supposed to have always the same value. A
                    variable quantity, again, is that which may change its value by increasing or
                    decreasing, so that in passing from one degree of magnitude to another it will
                    have had in succession every possible intermediate magnitude.</p>
                <p>Thus, in a circle, the radius is a constant quantity, and any arc of the circle,
                    also its cosine, sine, tangent, secant, &amp;c. are variable, quantities. In the
                    ellipse, the axes or semiaxes are considered as constant; and the co-ordinates
                    to any point in the curve, and in general any lines or spaces or angles which in
                    the same ellipse admit of different values, are variable. So again in the
                    parabola, the parameter is constant, and the co-ordinates to any point in the
                    curve, also any arc of the curve, and the space contained by that arc and the
                    co-ordinates, are to be regarded as variable.</p>
                <p>In what follows, we shall in general call constant quantities simply <hi
                    rend="italic">constants,</hi> and variable quantities <hi rend="italic"
                    >variables.</hi></p>
                <p>It is usual to denote constants by the letters <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi>
                    &amp;c-towards the beginning of the alphabet, and variables by the letters <hi
                    rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> &amp;c. towards the end.</p>
                <p>2. One quantity is said to be a <hi rend="italic">function</hi> of another when
                    they are so related that the latter being supposed to change its value, the
                    former also changes its value. Thus, in geometry, the radius of a circle being
                    constant, the cosine, the sine, the tangent, the secant, &amp;c. are functions
                    of the arc. On the other hand, the arc may be considered as a function of any
                    one of these quantities. In mechanics, the force by which a body is urged
                    forward, the space it has passed over, and its velocity at every instant, may
                    all be regarded as functions of the time.</p>
                <p>In this algebraic expression, <hi rend="italic">a + X</hi></p>
                <p>* = ⅛'</p>
                <p>in which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a constant and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> a
                    variable, the quantity y is regarded as a function of a, which is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">independent</hi> variable. Here <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is
                    expressed by <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> but by resolving the equation, <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> may be expressed by <hi rend="italic">y</hi> thus:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic                 subscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript underline"> a</hi><hi rend="italic underline">
                    (y-.I)</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 1</hi> the quantity <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is now a function of
                    <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> In either case, the constants <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    and 1 are not considered. In these examples, <hi rend="italic">u =
                    a-j-bx-1-cx</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">u = √ (a* + bx</hi> + a?), <hi rend="italic">_ a</hi> 4- √ <hi
                    rend="italic">bx</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript">
                    U</hi><hi rend="italic">~ c + x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i ,</hi><hi rend="italic">u</hi> is a function of <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi><hi rend="italic">A</hi> quantity may be a function of
                    several independent variable quantities. Thus, in the expression <hi
                    rend="italic">u = ax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >+ bxy -ļ-cy</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> a
                    is a function of the independent variables <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y.</hi></p>
                <p>The variety of forms of functions of a variable is endless. They may, however, be
                    resolved into a few elementary functions such as these, <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">, a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> log <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>The first of these, <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    n</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> in which <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is constant,
                    and all that can be formed from it by a finite viunber of the elementary<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193753591" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3591-0641"/> operations of
                    algebra, are called <hi rend="italic">algebraic</hi> functions; for example,
                    this, <hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic">bx</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> ’ <hi

                    a*</p>
                <p>which is formed by addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and the
                    extraction of the square root. These two, α <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>, log
                    <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> which cannot be expressed by a finite number of terms
                    composed of powers of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >transcendental</hi> functions, and the remaining two, sin <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and such as may be formed from them, viz.
                    tan <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> sec <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> &amp;c. are called
                    <hi rend="italic">trigonometrical,</hi> also <hi rend="italic">angular</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">circular</hi> functions.</p>
                <p>In the last example, the value of the function u may be immediately found, if the
                    value of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be known. Such functions are called <hi
                    rend="italic">explicit.</hi> There are functions, however, which require to be
                    separated from the variable by the resolution of equations, or other means,
                    before their value can be found; as in this example, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> 4-
                    <hi rend="italic">X ux =</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">X</hi> in which <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    is supposed to be a function of <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> In this case, before
                    the value of <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> corresponding to a given value of <hi
                    rend="italic">X,</hi> can be found, a quadratic equation must be resolved. Such
                    a function is called an <hi rend="italic">implicit</hi> function of <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>The early algebraists indicated the square root of a quantity by placing the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">r</hi> before it; thus <hi rend="italic">τx</hi> meant
                    the square root of <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> The letter was afterwards changed
                    into the sign ⅜∕, and the square root of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> was
                    conveniently expressed thus, <hi rend="italic">Vx.</hi> In like manner, it is
                    convenient to have a symbol which shall express generally a function of a
                    variable, and accordingly it is now usual to express any function of a variable
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> by the symbol <hi rend="italic">fx</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">f (χ)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> also by Er, or <hi
                    rend="italic">px.</hi> Here the letters <hi rend="italic">f</hi> or F, or <hi
                    rend="italic">φ,</hi> are considered merely as the abbreviation of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">function,</hi> and not as a co-efficient to the letter <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> In this way we include all these expressions, <hi
                    rend="italic">u = x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">,

                <p>When a function depends on two variable quantities <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi>
                    which are independent of each other, such as this expression, <hi rend="italic"

                    function.</p>
                <p>3. The manner in which we propose to treat this subject requires that the reader
                    should distinctly understand what is meant by a <hi rend="italic">limit</hi> to
                    the value of a variable function, or a variable ratio. In the elements of
                    geometry it is shown that the area of a circle is less than that of any regular
                    polygon described about it; and that the greater the number of sides of the
                    polygon, the more nearly is its area equal to that of the circle; so that any
                    space being given, however small, a polygon may be described about the circle,
                    which shall differ from it by less than that space. Suppose now a series of
                    polygons to be described about a circle, each having the number of its sides
                    greater than that which preceded it, the double for example. These will approach
                    continually to an equality with the circle as a <hi rend="italic">limit,</hi>
                    which the series, however far continued, can never absolutely reach in respect
                    of magnitude, but from which some term, and all that follow it, may differ by
                    less than any space assignable.</p>
                <p>In like manner, the circle is the limit of the area of all regular polygons
                    inscribed in it; and the circumference of the circle is the limit of the
                    perimeters of regular polygons described in it or about it.</p>
                <p>In our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Algebra</hi> (sect. 266) it has been shown,
                    that, putting <hi rend="italic">a</hi> for an arc of a circle, the fraction .
                    <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> is sm <hi rend="italic">a</hi> always greater
                    than an unit, but that ML; <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi> always less; farther,
                    that the arc being supposed to decrease continually, these fractions approach to
                    each other, and may differ by less than any assignable quantity; therefore
                    unity, which is always between them, is their common limit. Hence it appears,
                    that of these three quantities, an arc, its sine, and its tangent, the ratio of
                    any two is that of equality. In the same article it has been shown that the arc
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the limit of the fractions <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    tan. - and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> sin -, <hi rend="italic">η</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> supposing the number <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to be
                    increased continually.</p>
                <p>The geometrical series l+β + x* + x <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>....+ <hi
                    rend="italic">ι^-</hi> ’ is equivalent to the function -j—L <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Algebra,</hi> sect. 56); when <hi rend="italic">X</hi> is less than 1, and n
                    is infinitely great, then x" = 0, and the function =; therefore, in this case,
                    the <hi rend="italic">1—x</hi> sum of any finite number of terms of the series
                    will always be less than j——, but will approach to it as the number of terms
                    increases, and may differ from it by less than any assignable quantity; hence it
                    follows that the function ţ is the limit of the sum of the series.</p>
                <p>1 <hi rend="italic">—x</hi></p>

                <p>This is true, whatever be the numerical value of <hi rend="italic">n;</hi> but
                    suppose <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to be a large number, then the factors 12</p>
                <p>1— -, 1—-, &amp;c. will differ but little from unity; and they will differ the
                    less as <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is greater. Suppose now <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> to be indefinitely great, then these factory may be accounted each equal
                    to an unit; and, therefore,</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="superscript"> , +</hi> ff = <hi rend="superscript"> 1+</hi> i+ι⅞+f⅛

                <p>It has been shown in algebra (sect. 177) that the second member of this equation
                    is the development of the function <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> where ♯ denotes the number
                    2-7182818, viz. the base of Napier’s logarithms; therefore, if <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> be supposed to increase continually, the expression <hi rend="italic">Çl
                    +-)"</hi> will approach to <hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>4. Since the value of a function depends essentially on that of the variable,
                    which is its basis, any change in the value of the latter will produce a
                    corresponding change in the value of the former.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753604" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3604-0642"/>
                <p>First, let the function be <hi rend="italic">u = χ-,</hi> and let us suppose that
                    the variable changes its value, being increased by a quantity A, and thereby
                    becoming <hi rend="italic">x + h</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> let u' denote the
                    corresponding value of w, so that we have <hi rend="italic">«* = (x + hp</hi> =
                    x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + <hi rend="italic">2xh</hi> + A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = <hi rend="italic">u + 2xh</hi> + A*; hence <hi
                    rend="italic">u'</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">u = 2xh +
                    h</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>It thus appears that, A denoting the increment of the variable <hi rend="italic"
                    >X,</hi> the corresponding increment of the function, viz. u' — w, is <hi
                    rend="italic">2xh + h</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi></p>
                <p>The algebraic expression for a ratio is a fraction whose numerator is the
                    antecedent, and denominator the consequent. In the present case, the ratio of
                    the increment of the function to that of its variable is <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >⅛-</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> m</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">=</hi><hi

                <p>As another example, let the function be « = <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi>; then, supposing, as before, that the variable
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is increased by the quantity A, ⅛nd, putting <hi
                    rend="italic">u'</hi> for the new value of the function, we have <hi
                    rend="subscript smallcaps"> d’</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">_</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript smallcaps"> (x</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> +</hi><hi

                <p>A</p>
                <p>In this case we see that when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> has increased to <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> + A, the function “has become <hi rend="italic">u +

                    the integer powers of A. Farther, it appears that the expression for the ratio

                <p>3a:® + 3arA + A®, of which the first term 3a√ is entirely independent of the
                    value of A, the increment of <hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>When the function is <hi rend="italic">u =</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                 superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> we
                    have, putting, as in the former examples, A for the increment of the variable,
                    and u' for the new value of the function, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> ’ <hi

                    decrease with it, and, by giving a sufficiently small value to A, may become
                    less than any assignable quantity, so that the first term <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> is the limit of the ratio.</p>
                <p>Let us consider the complex function <hi rend="italic">u = α + bx + cx</hi><hi

                <p>This property of the increments of a function and its variable suggests an

                <p>I. Any function of a variable quantity being proposed, to determine the limit of
                    the ratio of the corresponding increments of the function and its variable.</p>
                <p>II. On the other hand, having given the ratio of the increments, to find the

                <p>In like manner, in the function <hi rend="italic">u = x</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>6. Since, when u = a <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>, then <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The definition which has been given of a differential suggests immediately this
                    rule for finding the differential of a function of a single variable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Substitute</hi> X 4- h <hi rend="italic">in the function
                    instead of</hi> x; <hi rend="italic">expand the expression thus formed into a
                    series of terms composed of integer powers of</hi> h, <hi rend="italic">and take
                    the term which contains the first power of</hi> h <hi rend="italic">for the

                    dx.</p>
                <p>Thus, let the function be w = <hi rend="italic">ax + bs?,</hi> in which <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are constants, then, putting
                    <hi rend="italic">x + h</hi> for <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and u <hi

                <p>Here <hi rend="italic">du,</hi> the differential of the function, is (α4^2Zκr)A,
                    or <hi rend="italic">(a + 2bx) dx,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">= a + 2bx</hi> the
                    differential co-efficient.</p>
                <p>7. The rule given in last article, for determining the differential of a
                    function, supposes that we have methods by which any function may be expanded
                    into a seriesof terms, into each of which some integer power of the increment
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> enters only as a factor. It is sufficient for our
                    purpose, however, if we can find that term of the series which contains the
                    simple power of <hi rend="italic">h;</hi> and this can in general be found
                    easier than the general development, which indeed may be the very thing to be
                    investigated by the calculus. Now we have seen (4) that the co-efficient of this
                    term is the expression for the limit of the ratio of the corresponding
                    increments of a function and its variable, and the same quantity is the
                    differential co-efficient of the function (6), therefore the determination of
                    the differential of a function is the same thing as the determination of the
                    limit of the ratio of the increments.</p>
                <p>Let the function be <hi rend="italic">u</hi> = —; then u ’ = — <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">t—</hi> τ, and <hi rend="italic">X X</hi> τ A</p>

                    calculus is the finding of the ratios of the simultaneous increments of a
                    function and of the variable on which</hi> ií <hi rend="italic"
                    >depends.</hi></p>
                <p>The process of calculation by which the differential of any function <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> is found, may be regarded as a particular operation
                    performed on quantity, analogous to the elementary operations of algebra; and it
                    may, like these, be distinguished by a particular name accordingly. The result
                    of the process being the <hi rend="italic">differential,</hi> the process itself
                    is called <hi rend="italic">differentiation,</hi> and to perform the process on
                    a function is to <hi rend="italic">differentiate</hi> the function.</p>
                <p>8. It is material to observe, that the limit of the ratio of the increments of a
                    function and its variable are the very same, whichever of the two be considered
                    as a function of the other. Thus, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> being a function of
                    <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">X</hi> + A, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">u +

                    from the function <hi rend="italic">u</hi> Let us put</p>
                <p>A = <hi rend="italic">ph + qh</hi><hi rend="italic                 superscript">

                    rend="italic">+, See.</hi> so that the contemporaneous increments of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> are <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    and A. Now, from the value of A, by the reversion of series (<hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Algebra,</hi> art. 163), we find <hi rend="italic">h =- k

                <p>So that, regarding <hi rend="italic">x</hi> as a function of u, when w becomer
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi> + A, <hi rend="italic">X</hi> becomes</p>
                <p>-A—⅛A <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> 4-,&amp;c. <hi rend="italic">P P</hi> ’ and
                    the general expression for the ratio of the incre ments is <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >|=1--2ä+,&amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">P P</hi> ’ which has for its limit -, and the limit of the
                    ratio τ is, aι <hi rend="italic">p</hi> A</p>
                <p>before, = <hi rend="italic">p. ,</hi></p>
                <p>9. It is easy to see that two equal functions must hav⅛ equal differentials; for
                    whatever be the value of the va <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753630"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-3630-0644"/>riable on which they depend, it must necessarily
                    happen , that the respective changes they receive in consequence of the change
                    which is attributed to the variable must also be equal. Thus, if <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> be two functions, such, that w
                    = », whatever may be the value of <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> and if, when <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">x + h,</hi> then <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> becomes and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> we shall have √ <hi
                    rend="italic">= v</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript">
                    r</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">u = υ'</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >v,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u'</hi><hi rend="italic">U</hi> l∕ <hi
                    rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">~h</hi><hi rend="italic">ĥ—</hi></p>
                <p>If then <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> denote the limits
                    of these ratios, <hi rend="italic">p ~ q</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pdx =
                    qdx,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">du = do.</hi></p>
                <p>From this it follows, that under whatever form a function appears, its
                    differential is the very same quantity. For example, the differential of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">+
                    a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi> will be identical with the
                    differential of <hi rend="italic">(x + a) (x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    t</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">ax</hi> + α <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi>), its equal.</p>
                <p>The converse of this proposition is not generally true, and we should be wrong in
                    affirming that two equal differentials belong to equal functions. For, let <hi
                    rend="italic">u = a + l&gt;x</hi> be a function of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    then, substituting <hi rend="italic">x + h</hi> for <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    and putting w' for the new value of w, we have <hi rend="italic">u' = a +
                    bx</hi></p>
                <p>4- <hi rend="italic">bh = u + bh,</hi> and - ~ “ = <hi rend="italic">b.
                    n</hi></p>
                <p>We see here that the constant <hi rend="italic">a</hi> does not enter into the
                    limit of the ratio of the increments, which would therefore be the very same for
                    the function <hi rend="italic">u = bx}</hi> hence it follows that the
                    differential <hi rend="italic">bdx</hi> belongs alike to <hi rend="italic">a +
                    bx,</hi> and to <hi rend="italic">bx.</hi> Thus it appears, that in
                    differentiating any function whatever, all the constant quantities combined with
                    it, either by addition or subtraction, disappear. With respect to those which
                    are connected by multiplication and division, they enter the result as
                    co-efficients.</p>
                <p>10. The differential of any function of a variable <hi rend="italic">x</hi> maybe
                    found by the general methods indicated in article 6; but it is convenient to
                    have rules adapted to particular cases.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> and s be two functions of a variable <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> It is proposed to investigate a rule for finding the
                    differential of <hi rend="italic">u = rs,</hi> their product.</p>
                <p>Suppose that by the substitution of <hi rend="italic">x + ĥ</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> in the functions <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> and their expansion, they become <hi rend="italic">T</hi>

                    independent of the function <hi rend="italic">h;</hi> the following terms are
                    all multiplied by <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> therefore they decrease and vanish

                <p>Instead of the limits of the ratios, let us put the differential co-efficients of
                    the functions <hi rend="italic">u, r, s (art.</hi> 6), and we find <hi

                <p>The rule for the differential of <hi rend="italic">u = -</hi> may be also

                <p>Lastly, let us suppose <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to be a negative whole number or

                    rend="italic">.</hi> In this case we may apply the rule for a fraction (12); and
                    observing that the numerator here is a constant, of which the differential must
                    be accounted = 0, we have</p>
                <p>* = - <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> +⅛ = -"J ‘ŵ.·</p>
                <p>thus it appears, that whether <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be whole or fractional,

                <p>Hence this rule: <hi rend="italic">To differentiate any power of a function,
                    multiply it by the exponent, diminish the exponent by an unit, and multiply by

                    Thus <hi rend="italic">d(ax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi

                <p>The determination of the differential of a power of a variable might have been
                    shortened by assuming the truth of the binomial theorem, as found in our article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Algebra,</hi> art. 160, 161. That theorem however may be
                    derived from the differential calculus, and we shall give its investigation as
                    one of its applications.</p>
                <p>It frequently happens that the differential of √y = <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> the square root of a function, is
                    to be found; therefore a rule for that case will be convenient. By the general
                    rule for a power,</p>
                <p>&lt;*(y <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi>) = ģy <hi rend="superscript"> 4—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> λ</hi><hi rend="italic">dy</hi> = ⅛y <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> ½&gt; that is, d(√y) =</p>
                <p>Hence it appears that <hi rend="italic">the differential of the square root of a
                    function is the diff'erentiaΓof the function divided by twice its square
                    root.</hi></p>
                <p>14. Let y be a function of a variable <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and let <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> be a function of <hi rend="italic">y;</hi> it is proposed

                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">+ex</hi><hi rend="italic

                    which <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> &amp;c., A, B, C, &amp;c. are constants,
                    and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is variable; in order that the equation may hold
                    universally true, it is necessary that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = A, <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> = B, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> ≡ C, <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    = E, &amp;c. For since <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is indeterminate, we may suppose
                    it to decrease untd it vanish; then all the terms into which it enters also
                    vanish, and we have <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = A; therefore, leaving these equal
                    terms out of both sides of (1), and dividing all the remaining terms by <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> we get <hi rend="italic">b + ex + ex</hi><hi rend="italic

                    By proceeding with this equation as with the former, we obtain <hi rend="italic"

                    >x</hi> + A, w becomes w, we have w = α <hi rend="superscript"> x</hi>, tf = d*

                <p>27. A function of a variable, when differentiated, produces a new function, viz.
                    its differential co-efficient. This in its turn may be differentiated, and there
                    will be produced another differential co-efficient, which will stand in the same
                    relation to the former as that did to the original function. By another
                    differentiation, a third differential co-efficient may be formed; and so on
                    continually, unless some differential co-efficient come out = 0.</p>

                <p>28. We have assumed for the foundation of the differential calculus an important
                    analytical principle, first particularly recognised by Euler, viz. Let ∕z)
                    denote any function of a variable quantity a:,· if instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> there be substituted <hi rend="italic">x +</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi><hi rend="italic">h</hi> being any indeterminate quantity, so that the
                    function becomes <hi rend="italic">Jlx</hi> + A), this new value may always be
                    expanded into a series of this form, ytø+rÄ + çÄ’ + rÄ’+.&amp;c., in which the
                    quantities <hi rend="italic">p, q,</hi><hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> are new
                    functions of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> derived from the primitive function, and
                    independent of the indeterminate quantity A.</p>
                <p>29. The truth of this principle has been exemplified by induction from particular
                    cases. Lagrange has, however, given a demonstration of it in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Théorie des Fonctions,</hi> which is to the following effect:</p>
                <p>In the first place, the development of the function <hi rend="italic">(x</hi> +
                    A) cannot contain any fractional power of A, so long as <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    is entirely indeterminate. For the radicals of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> can only
                    come from radicals in the primitive function; and it is manifest that the
                    substitution of <hi rend="italic">x + h</hi> instead of a: can neither increase
                    nor diminish their number, nor change their nature, while <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> are indeterminate. On the other hand, by
                    the theory of equations, every radical expression has as many different values
                    as there are units in its exponent; from which it follows, that every irrational
                    function has as many distinct values as there are combinations of the different
                    values of the radicals which it contains. Therefore, if the development of the
                    function ∕(x + A) could contain a term of the form <hi rend="italic">uh</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> n</hi>, the functional· must necessarily be
                    irrational, and contain a certain number of different values, which must be the
                    same for its development; but this development being represented by the series
                    <hi rend="italic">flx) + ph + qh</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi> 4-, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi><hi rend="italic">+
                    uh</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> 4-, Ac. every value of the
                    function/(z) (the first term). might be combined with each of the <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> values of the radical <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> √x <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi>, so that the function ∕ <hi rend="italic">lx +
                    h)</hi> ex panded would have more values than the same function unexpanded,
                    which is impossible.</p>
                <p>This demonstration is general and rigorous so long as <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    and A continue indeterminate; but it fails if determinate values be given to <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> for it may happen that these values may destroy some
                    radicals in the function <hi rend="italic">flx),</hi> which may yet exist in the
                    function <hi rend="italic">flx</hi> 4- A).</p>
                <p>30. It being proved that the development of the function cannot have any
                    fractional powers of A, it is easy to be assured that it cannot contain negative
                    powers. For if among the terms one had the form <hi rend="italic">m</hi> being a
                    positive integer number, then, in making A = 0, that term would become infinite,
                    and the function <hi rend="italic">lx</hi> + A), and of course <hi rend="italic"
                    >∕lx),</hi> would in this case be infinite, which cannot be, unless a particular
                    value be given to <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Thus it is clearly established that
                    the development of the function can contain neither fractional nor negative
                    exponents.</p>
                <p>31. The general form of the development of the function, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">f(x</hi> + A) <hi rend="italic">=f(x) + ph + qh</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> + rA <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> +,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>being thus ascertained, the next question is, what is the law of relation between
                    the original function <hi rend="italic">flx)</hi> and the functions <hi
                    rend="italic">p, q</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >r,</hi> &amp;c. which are derived from it? We owe the discovery of this
                    relation to a celebrated English mathematician, Brooke Taylor, who gave it in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Methodus Incrementorum,</hi> published in the year 1715 in
                    the form of an analytical theorem, which is now called by his name: we shall now
                    give its investigation. The following is that of Lagrange.</p>
                <p>Let∕(x) = n: be any function of <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    then, supposing a: to become <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + A, <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">flx + h)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi

                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> + <hi rend="italic">sir</hi> 4-, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Suppose now that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> changes again its value, and becomes
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + A, and here A, like A, is independent of <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">flx</hi> + A) becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">flx</hi> 4^ A 4- A).</p>
                <p>There are two ways of finding what the series <hi rend="italic">fl</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">x</hi> + A becomes a: + A + A. ls⅛ We may have the value of the
                    series by substituting A -fA in every term instead of A. 2&lt;ZZy, We may also
                    have its value by substituting <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + A in the functions <hi
                    rend="italic">p,q, r, s, &amp;c.</hi> for <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> that is, instead of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">q,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r, &amp;c.</hi> we must put the

                    in them instead of <hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>

                <p>In the preceding article we found that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = e*, hence, from
                    the theory of logarithms <hi rend="smallcaps">(Algebra,</hi> sect, xix,), A is

                <p>Now we found that in the system whose base is <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> log(l+^)

                <p>By comparing these two expressions for log (l+ar), it appears that in the system

                    those first given to the world by Napier, the celebrated inventor of logarithms,
                    who was, however, led to them by a very different path from that here followed.
                    It so happens that the same logarithms express hyperbolic areas, and hence they
                    were called <hi rend="italic">hyperbolic</hi> logarithms, a distinction quite
                    improper, because hyperbolic areas may be expressed by logarithms of any system.
                    Accordingly, it is now common to denominate them, in lwnour of the inventor, <hi

                <p>47. That a general formula should not express all particular cases, was at one
                    time regarded as a kind of paradox in analysis. Lagrange first cleared up this

                    >x,</hi> the new state of the function contains terms of the form <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">PA</hi>, or QΛ <hi rend="superscript">
                    n</hi>, that is, negative or fractional powers of <hi rend="italic">A,</hi>
                    then, from the very nature of the calculus, all the co-efficients in the general
                    development after a certain term will become infinite. On the other hand, when a
                    particular value of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> renders the co-efficients infinite,
                    we may conclude that the development in that case ought to contain fractional or
                    negative powers of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> In such particular cases as appear
                    not to admit of expansion by Taylor’s theorem, other methods deducible from the
                    calculus are applicable; in general, the ordinary algebraic methods are

                    the equations which chiefly occur in analytical inquiries contain for the most
                    part the two variables combined or mixed together; as in this equation, y <hi

                <p>If we suppose the equation resolved, so that <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is
                    expressed in terms of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> only, which gives <hi

                    differentials may be found by the rules already explained. In general, however,
                    the variables cannot be so separated, and therefore it is necessary that we be
                    able to determine the differential co-efficients of a function by other
                    means.</p>
                <p>49. An equation formed in any way from two independent variable quantities may be

                <p>The variable <hi rend="italic">y</hi> must be expressible in some way by <hi
                    rend="italic">x;</hi> therefore we may represent its value, however found, by
                    the equation <hi rend="italic">y</hi> = X, where X denotes an expression made up
                    of terms containing only <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and constant quantities. When
                    this value of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is substituted in the equation, it
                    becomes <hi rend="italic">f(x, X)</hi> = 0.</p>
                <p>This is an identical equation, involving <hi rend="italic">x</hi> only, which
                    must hold true whatever value be given to <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Let the

                    primitive from which they have been derived, therefore any combination of them
                    will also hold true; and whatever number of values the function y has (in the
                    preceding example it has two), the differential coefficients into which y enters
                    will have the same number.</p>
                <p>It has appeared (art 15) that in functions of a certain form the constants they
                    contain vanish from their differentials. A like remark applies to differential
                    equations. Thus, if y <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = <hi rend="italic">ax +

                    particular equation which can be formed from the primitive, by giving all
                    possible values to <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The constant <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> may also be made to disappear by putting the equation under this form,

                <p>If the constant quantity which is eliminated is not of She first degree in the

                <p>This value of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> being substituted in the proposed

                <p>Under this form, it is manifest that as long as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is

                    fraction equal to nothing, and that it will become when <hi rend="italic">a ≡ a!

                <p>and by the supposition of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> = 0, this result becomes

                <p>60. In supposing that a function changes its value, we may assume that the
                    variable increases continually from 0 to infinity, either positively or
                    negatively. To get distinct notions, it may be convenient to suppose that the
                    variable increases or decreases by successive equal differences. The function
                    however may not increase or decrease continually along with its variable. It may
                    first increase to a certain magnitude, and afterwards decrease; or it may
                    decrease and afterwards increase; or it may alternately increase and decrease
                    several times. We may represent the variable <hi rend="italic">x</hi> by the
                    abscissa of a curve, and the function <hi rend="italic">y</hi> by the
                    corresponding ordinate. The curve, from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753825"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-3825-0659"/>its nature, may recede continually from its axis,
                    like the paι rabola and hyperbola: or it may first recede from and afi '
                    terwards approach to the axis, like the circle and ellipse; or it may be
                    sinuous, alternately approaching and receding. 1 When a variable function, by a
                    continual change in its magnitude, first increases and afterwards decreases,
                    there will be one value of the function which will be greater than those which
                    immediately preceded it, and also greater than those which immediately follow
                    it. In this state the value of the function is the greatest possible, at least
                    within certain limits on each side of that extreme value; and then it is said to
                    be a <hi rend="italic">maximum.</hi> On the other hand, if a function, by a
                    continual change in its value, first decreases, until it be reduced to a certain
                    magnitude, and afterwards increases, it is said to be a <hi rend="italic"
                    >minimum,</hi> when it is just changing from the state of a decreasing to that
                    of an increasing quantity.</p>
                <p>A variable function may have several values, each of which will be a <hi
                    rend="italic">maximum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">minimum,</hi> according to the
                    definition. <hi rend="italic">The essential character of a maximum consists in
                    its being greater than the values which preceded and which follow it</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">and that of a minimum in being less than
                    the pre- 'ceding and following values.</hi> So that as many changes as there may
                    be from increase to decrease, or the contrary, so many <hi rend="italic"
                    >maxima</hi> and <hi rend="italic">minima</hi> there will be.</p>
                <p>61. Before proceeding farther, it will be convenient to establish this principle.

                    &amp;c. may be less than <hi rend="italic">ph,</hi> in any ratio of inequality.
                    In the same way it will appear that <hi rend="italic">rh</hi> + sA <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +, &amp;c. may be less than <hi rend="italic">q,</hi>

                    rend="italic">rh</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript">

                    —</p>
                <p>62. Let <hi rend="italic">y</hi> denote any function which may become a <hi

                <p>Ex. 9. To find the position of the planet Venus in respect of the earth and sun
                    when her light is the greatest.</p>
                <p>The planet does not appear brightest when her disc is perfectly round; she is
                    then too remote to produce that effect; and besides, she is seen in the
                    direction of the sun. In her inferior conjunctions her crescent is too narrow,
                    almost the whole illuminated part being turned towards the sun. It is therefore
                    in some intermediate position, which is to be determined, that she is
                    brightest.</p>
                <p>Let S be the sun, E the earth, and ACBD Venus, ADB its illuminated hemisphere
                    which is turned towards the sun, and CBD its hemisphere towards the earth:
                    produce S V to F.</p>
                <p>The portion of the illuminated surface turned towards the earth is contained
                    between two planes DV, BV, perpendicular to the plane EVS; and this surface will
                    manifestly be projected into a crescent, the breadth of which is the versed sine
                    of the angle BVD, which is equal to EVF, because if BVE be added to both, each
                    is a right angle. Now the area of the crescent is always as its breadth;
                    therefore, the whole disk being taken as an unit, the illuminated part of it
                    will be expressed by the versed sine of the angle EVF, or by 1 + cos EVS.</p>
                <p>Again, the brightness of the planet at different distances is inversely as the
                    square of the distance; therefore the brightness depending on its position in
                    respect of the sun and its distance from the earth jointly, will be pro-</p>

                <p>The general formula for the subtangent was found on the hypothesis that it was on
                    the same side of the ordinate as the absciss; in this case they are supposed to
                    be on opposite sides, and hence its value has the negative sign; leaving the
                    direction of the subtangent in respect of the absciss out of consideration, we
                    have</p>

                <p>This shows that the tangent always passes between the centre and the vertex when
                    x has a finite value; but when Xbecomes infinite, then OT = 0, and the tangent

                <p>Let ⅛B be the line along which a circle CD A rolls, beginning its motion from a
                    point of contact <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and completing a revolution when it
                    has come to B. The point of the circumference which was in contact with the line
                    at <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will then have generated the curve line ÓAB. This is
                    the <hi rend="italic">cycloid,</hi> and the line 6B its <hi rend="italic"
                    >base.</hi></p>
                <p>Let ADC be a fixed circle in the position of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >generating</hi> circle when it has completed half a revolution, 0 its centre,
                    and AC its diameter, called the axis of the cycloid. Let AD be any arc of this
                    circle. Draw the radius OD. When the generating circle, by rolling along CB from
                    the position C, has passed over a distance equal to the arc AD, the centre 0
                    will have generated a straight line OE parallel to CB, and equal to the same arc
                    AD; moreover, the moveable radius, which was coincident with OA, will, by the
                    rotation of the circle, have come into a position EP, parallel to OD, because
                    the angular motion of the radius about the moving point E will always be
                    proportional to the arc of the circle that has been applied to the base, that
                    is, by hypothesis, to the arc AD; and since the lines OD, EP are equal and
                    parallel, a straight line drawn from P through D, meeting AC in Q, will be
                    parallel to EO, and therefore perpendicular to AC; and since PD = OE = arc AD,
                    it follows that PQ, any ordinate to the axis AC, is equal to the sum of the arc
                    AD and its sine DQ. This is the distinguishing property of a cycloid. To express
                    it by equations, let the radius of the generating circle be <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> and the angle AOD = <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> then PD = arc AD = <hi

                    expressed by a polar equation. Let HPK be such a curve, generated by the
                    revolution of a variable radius AP about a given point A in AC, aline given in

                    and draw the normal PD, meeting TA in D. Then AT is the subtangent and AD the

                <p>Ex. Let the curve PH be the spiral of Archimedes, the nature of which is defined
                    by the equation 2π = αr. where « = 2 right angles, and “is a given line, viz.

                <p>68. In some curves the segment of the axis between the origin of the co-ordinates
                    and the tangent increases with the variable <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and may
                    exceed any given line. In others the tangent cuts the axis always at a finite
                    distance from the origin; it is then an <hi rend="italic">asymptote</hi> to the
                    curve. If from the subtangent QT = ⅛ <hi rend="italic">y</hi> (fig. 8) the
                    absciss AQ = <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be subtracted, the remainder <hi
                    rend="italic">y —</hi> a: is the general expression for AT. Now if when <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> is infinite this expression is finite, we may conclude that
                    the curve has asymptotes; but if it be infinite, the curve has no
                    asymptotes.</p>

                <p>The method of drawing tangents to curves is an important branch of the theory of
                    curve lines. It serves also to determine their greatest and least ordinates
                    (which may also be found by the theory of <hi rend="italic">maxima</hi> and <hi

                <p>69. In curve lines it is convenient to consider <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> one of
                    the co-ordinates, as an independent variable quantity; and any area having an
                    arc of the curve for a boundary, also the arc, and in general every other
                    variable quantity connected with the curve, as functions of that variable. If
                    the curve be expressed by a polar equation, the angle which the revolving radius
                    makes with the variable may be taken as the independent variable, and the
                    co-ordinates and other variable quantities related to the curve as functions of
                    that angle.</p>
                <p>We begin by investigating a formula for the area.</p>
                <p>Let AB be the axis of any curve CP, A and C given points in the axis and curve,
                    PQ, HK any two variable ordinates, and CD an ordinate given in position at the

                <p>Put AQ ≡ <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> PQ = <hi rend="italic">y, curvilineal

                <p>The space PHKQ is greater than the rectangle PEKQ, but less than the rectangle
                    FHKQ (supposing <hi rend="italic">y</hi> to increase from the position PQ to

                <p>Thus it appears that <hi rend="italic">The differential of a curvilineal area is

                <p>In the formula just found, the ordinates have been supposed perpendicular to the

                    meeting the ordinates in K and H: The length of the arc is always of an

                <p>Draw the chord PM, and let I be the intersection of the tangents. It is easy to
                    see that PK, one of the tangents, meets the parallel ordinates in an angle K
                    more acute than M, the angle made by the chord PM and ordinate MN; and the other
                    in an angle H less acute; therefore the chord will be less than the former and
                    greater than the latter. Now the arc is greater than the chord; therefore MH,
                    the least of the tangents, is less than the arc PM.</p>
                <p>Again, in the two triangles PIH, MIK, it is evident that the two parts PI, IK, of
                    the longest tangent, are respectively greater than HI, IM, those of the shorter;
                    therefore PK is longer than the sum of PI and IM; but the arc PM is by an axiom
                    of geometry less than the sum of PI and IN, therefore the tangent PK is greater
                    than the arc PM.</p>

                <p>74. We shall now give a method of defining a curve by a polar equation, which

                <p>Let CPD be any curve, and A a given point in AB, a line given by position; draw a

                    the position of the tangent will be known; the calculus gives a general formula
                    for PF, the segment of the tangent between the point of contact and its
                    intersection with the perpendicular; thus the point of contact P is known, and
                    in this way may any number of points in the curve be determined.</p>
                <p>75. Let D be another point in the curve, DH a tangent, and AH a perpendicular on

                    Evolutes.</hi></p>
                <p>76. The method of generating curves by evolution is a geometrical theory invented
                    by Huygens, and given in his <hi rend="italic">Horologium Oscillatorium.</hi> He
                    explained it upon geometrical principles, for his work appeared many years
                    before the calculus was invented.</p>
                <p>Let BHE be a model of a plane curve made of a solid material, having some
                    thickness, and let one end of a thread HEC be fastened at a point B on the edge
                    of the model, and applied along its convexity, so as to coincide with it
                    entirely between B and E, the remaining portion EC of the thread forming a
                    straight line touching the curve at E. Suppose now the thread to be gradually
                    unlapped from the curve BE, keeping it always tight; the end C will now describe
                    another curve CPD.</p>
                <p>All curves, in which the curvature is neither infinitely great nor infinitely
                    small, may be generated in this way by the evolution of a thread from another
                    curve.</p>
                <p>77. The curvfe EHÐ, by means of which the curve CPD is generated, is called its
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Evolute;</hi> and the curve CPD thus generated by
                    evolution, is called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Involute</hi> of the other
                    curve.</p>
                <p>From the way in which the involute is generated from its evolute, we may
                    infer,</p>
                <p>(1.) That PH, the part of the thread disengaged from the arc EH, is a tangent to
                    the evolute at H.</p>
                <p>(2.) That the line PH is perpendicular to a tangent to the curve CPD at P, and
                    that at the same time it describes an element of the curve, and an element of a
                    circle whose momentary centre is H and radius HP.</p>
                <p>(3.) That to a certain extent the part of the involute adjoining to P, and
                    towards C, is <hi rend="italic">more</hi> incurvated than a circle whose radius
                    is PH; because, supposing P to proceed towards C, the variable radius PH is
                    gradually becoming shorter. On the other hand, a portion of the curve from P
                    towards D is <hi rend="italic">less</hi> incurvated than a circle whose radius
                    is CP, because the generating radius is continually becoming longer.</p>
                <p>(4.) That since the curvature of the involute on one side of P, and adjoining to
                    it, is less than that of a circle whose radius is PH, and the curvature on the
                    other side of P is greater, it follows that at the point P the curvature of the
                    involute is exactly the same as that of a circle described with the radius HP.
                    The point H is therefore called the <hi rend="italic">centre of curvature</hi>
                    of the curve CPD in the point P; and PH, its <hi rend="italic">radius of

                    common segment; they meet in a geometrical point at P, and separate on both
                    sides of it. We may also infer that the circle of curvature has a more intimate
                    contact with the curve than any other circle that passes through that point.</p>

                    and H' the centre, and P'H' the radius of curvature of another point P', near
                    the former. Let the radii produced, if necessary, meet the axis in N and N'; and
                    let 0 be the poiht in which they intersect each other.</p>

                    method of finding any number of curves which may be rectified, that is, whose
                    length may be assigned in algebraic terms; for PH, the radius of the curvature,
                    is the sum of the straight line CE, and the arc EH of the evolute. Now we can
                    form innumerable curves whose radius of curvature will be known, therefore,
                    corresponding to every curve whose radius of curvature can be found and
                    expressed in algebraic terms, there is a curve which can be exactly

                <p>Therefore, PH = <hi rend="italic">r =</hi> 2 chord CD.</p>
                <p>It was shown (art. 66) that a tangent at P is parallel to BD, the chord of the
                    supplement of CD; therefore PH, which is perpendicular to the tangent, is
                    parallel to the chord CD; it is therefore determined in position and magnitude
                    for any given point in the curve.</p>
                <p>The evolute AHF may be found by the general formula (art. 79), or otherwise from
                    the expression for PH, the radius of curvature, thus:</p>
                <p>Draw AL perpendicular to AC, and equal to BC,.but on the opposite side of AC;
                    describe the semicircle AML, and draw HMR perpendicular to AL, cutting the
                    semicircle in M; let PH meet AC in N.</p>
                <p>Because CA = semicircle CDB, and CN = DP = arc BD, therefore AN = arc CD. But
                    because PH = 2CD = 2PN; and therefore PN = NH; the parallels PE, HR are equally
                    distant from CA; and hence CE = RA, and arc CD = arc AM and chord CD = chord AM,
                    also angle DCA = angle CAM. Now CD = PN = NH: therefore AM = NH; but AM is
                    parallel to NH; therefore MH = AN = arc CD = arc AM; and HR = arc AM -∣- sin MR;
                    thus it appears that H is a point in a semicycloid having the same base as the
                    cycloid AβA ’. Indeed LAFis just the semicycloidal space CBA ’ transferred to
                    the position AHF, the point B being placed at A, and A ’ at F. If the other
                    semicycloidal space AB be transferred to the position FA'Ľ, the arc APB in the
                    position FA'will form another branch of the evolute, exactly similar to FA, but
                    turned the contrary way.</p>
                <p>From what has been found it appears, that if the semicycloids FLA, FĽA'were
                    placed in a vertical plane, with the point F uppermost, and the semi-bases FL,
                    FĽ in a horizontal line; and if a weight were suspended from F by a thread equal
                    in length to FB, and made to vibrate in that plane, like a pendulum; the weight
                    would manifestly vibrate in an arc of a cycloid. This elegant property of the
                    curve was discovered by Huygens, who also found that the vibrations would be
                    isochronal, that is, performed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753968"

                    in dynamics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Contact of Curves.</hi></p>
                <p>82. The ancient geometers paid particular attention to the contact of straight
                    lines, with the few curve lines which they considered. Apollonius even touched
                    on the contact of circles and the conic sections; for he treated of the shortest
                    line that can be drawn from a given point in the axis to the curve. It is only,
                    however, since the invention of the differential calculus that this branch of
                    geometry has been carried to any considerable extent.</p>
                <p>83. The curvature of a circle being the same throughout, it serves as the means
                    of comparing the curvature in different points of a curve. It is, however, easy
                    to understand, that in like manner we might consider the nature of the contact
                    of a parabola, or a curve of any kind whatever, with a proposed curve.</p>

                <p>This proposition is proved exactly in the same way as that in last article, by
                    means of Taylor’s theorem. These are particular cases of a general proposition
                    relating to the contact of curves which may be stated thus: If two curves have a
                    common absciss and ordinate, and if the differential co-efficients of the first
                    order of the ordinates be equal, no third curve passing through their
                    intersection can go between them, unless the differential co-effi∙ cient of its
                    ordinate, corresponding to the same absciss, be equal to the differential
                    co-efficients of their ordinates. And if, besides their first differential
                    co-efficients, their second differential co-efficients be equal, then no third
                    curve passing through their intersection can go between them, unless the first
                    and second differential co-efficients of its ordinate be equal to the first and
                    second differential co-efficients of the two curves, and so on to differential
                    co-efficients of all orders.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193753981" xml:id="kp-eb0709-3981-0671"/>
                <p>In fact, the two curves meet only in the point in which their ordinates are the
                    same, and the equality of the differential co-efficients merely indicates that
                    no other curve in which the same equality does not take place can pass between
                    them.</p>
                <p>From what has been shown, it appears that the contacts of curve lines may be
                    distinguished into different orders. The degree of contact in which the
                    ordinates and also the first differential co-efficients are equal, may be called
                    a <hi rend="italic">Contact of the first order</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    when, in addition to these, the second differential co-efficients are equal, it
                    is a <hi rend="italic">Contact of the second order</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>85. In illustration of this theory of contacts, let us consider the nature of the
                    contact of any curve HPK (see fig. 6), with a straight line PT. Let A be the
                    common origin of the co-ordinates. In the curve, let AB = <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> PB = y. Its nature will be expressed by an equation y = <hi
                    rend="italic">f(*)∙</hi> In the straight line, let TA = <hi rend="italic"
                    >c,</hi> AB = <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> PB = », angle PTB = e; the equation of
                    the straight line is <hi rend="italic">υ = (c</hi> +x) tan <hi rend="italic"
                    >a.</hi> The hypothesis that the curve and straight line have a common point,
                    gives <hi rend="italic">y —</hi><hi rend="italic">υ</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and the equation of the straight line, considering that <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    and α must be regard-</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">. dv dv</hi> ed as constants, gives = tan <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>; now, by our theory, = ⅛ therefore ⅛ = tan «. This result coincides with
                    <hi rend="italic">dx dx</hi> what was found in art. 66; and it gives the
                    sub-tangent BT = √- = ⅛y.</p>
                <p>tan α <hi rend="italic">dy</hi></p>
                <p>It is impossible that any straight line can pass between the straight line PT and
                    the curve; for, if possible, let the straight line PS pass between them, and
                    meet the axis in S. Put AS = c ’, AB = <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> PB ≡ «, the
                    angle PSB = α'. The equation of the straight line PS is <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    = (c ’ + <hi rend="italic">x~)</hi> tan α'; and hence = tan α'. Now, that the
                    line PS may pass between PT and the curve, we should have ⅛ = ⅛ <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">dx dx</hi></p>
                <p>— (art. 83); therefore, tan <hi rend="italic">a!</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> tan
                    α, and <hi rend="italic">a!</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> α; thus it appears that
                    the lines PS, PT must coincide; therefore the straight line PT is a tangent to
                    the curve, in the strictest sense.</p>
                <p>86. Let us next consider the nature of the contact of a circle and any curve. Let
                    CPD be the curve, and C'PD' a circle referred to the same axis AK, in which A is
                    the common origin of the co-ordinates. In the curve CPD let AQ = <hi
                    rend="italic">X,</hi> PQ = y. Let H be the centre of the circle; draw the radius
                    PH, and produce it to meet the axis in N, and draw HI, HK perpendicular to PQ
                    and AQ. Put AQ = <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> PQ = », these being co-ordinates of P
                    any point in the circumference of the circle; and put AK = α, HK = <hi
                    rend="italic">β,</hi> the co-ordinates of its centre; and PH ≡ <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> its radius.</p>
                <p>The equation of the curve CPD may be expressed generally by <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi><hi rend="italic">=f (x).</hi> And, since IH = <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">x,</hi> PI = <hi rend="italic"
                    >υ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">β,</hi> and PH = <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> the equation of the circle will be <hi rend="italic">(a-xf
                    + (n-βf=r^</hi> (1)</p>
                <p>A contact of the first degree requires that ĝ = ĝ. Now, observing that <hi
                    rend="italic">a, β,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> must be considered as
                    constants, we have ~ = * -*, hence and becausey = e, <hi rend="italic">⅛

                <p>The second side of this formula expresses the trigonometrical tangent of the
                    angle PHI or PNQ. Hence (art. 65) the line PN is a normal to the curve at P, and
                    the circle and curve have a common tangent at that point. By a second

                    determine the position and magnitude of the circle; they are manifestly
                    identical with the radius of the circle of equal curvature, and the co-ordinates
                    of its centre formerly found (art. 78 and 79). Hence we conclude, that the
                    circle of equal curvature with a curve in any point, determined by the theory of
                    evolutes, is identical with a circle, having with the curve a contact of the
                    second order.</p>
                <p>And since it appears that only one circle can have with a curve a contact of the
                    second order, and that no circle can pass between that circle and the curve,
                    therefore the same must be true of the circle of equal curvature, found by the
                    theory of evolutes.</p>
                <p>87. From what has been shown in regard to the degrees of contact of a straight
                    line and circle with a curve, it appears that these depend on the number of
                    constants which enter into the equation of the touching line. The equation of a
                    straight line contains two constants, and it admits of one order of contact
                    only. The equation of a circle has three constants, and it admits of a contact
                    of the second order. It is easy to see that the number of differential
                    co-efficients that can be made equal in the two curves will always be one less
                    than the number of constants in the touching curve. The equation of a parabola
                    isy = α + <hi rend="italic">βx + γx</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> This and the differential equations which may be deduced
                    from it serve to determine the three constants <hi rend="italic">a, β, γ,</hi>
                    and thence the parabola of equal curvature; but since there are only two
                    differential co-efficients, the parabola can have a contact of the first and <pb

                    rend="italic">x</hi> constant, and then <hi rend="italic">x</hi> variable and
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi> constant, the final result either way will be the very

                    the <hi rend="italic">differential</hi> of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> to be the
                    term <hi rend="italic">pdx,</hi> viz. that which contains the simple power of A

                <p>We may now extend these definitions to∕(x, <hi rend="italic">y),</hi> a function

                <p>From this it appears that the <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> differential of a
                    function of two variables consists of two parts, viz. <hi rend="italic">įl dx,
                    dx</hi> or the differential taken on the supposition that <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> alone is variable, and <hi rend="italic">dy, or</hi> the differential

                <p>We may also apply to functions of two variables the rules which have been given
                    (art. 10-23) for those which depend only on one; and for this purpose <hi

                <p>91. The manner in which the differentials of functions which depend on more than
                    one variable are written, gives rise to some important remarks. The expression
                    <hi rend="italic">dx</hi> must not be confounded with <hi rend="italic">du,</hi>
                    which it might be if <hi rend="italic">u</hi> contained only the variable <hi
                    rend="italic">x;</hi> the symbol has in this case a particular meaning, and
                    denotes the differential co-efficient taken on the hypothesis of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> only being variable; or it is the quotient of the first
                    term of the development of the difference taken on that supposition divided by
                    the increment <hi rend="italic">dx</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and ⅛L(y

                <p>The quantities are commonly called <hi rend="italic">partial differences</hi> of
                    the first order of the function <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> and generally <hi

                    y,</hi> is a function of the other, it is sometimes convenient to regard both as
                    functions of a third quantity. Thus, in geometry, supposing <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> and y to be the co-ordinates of a curve, we may consider the one as a
                    function of the other; or we may consider both as functions of the angle which a
                    tangent makes with the axis, which angle is then the independent variable. Or
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> denoting the co-ordinates
                    of the path of a projectile, both may be considered as functions of <hi

                <p>The three increments A, A, <hi rend="italic">i</hi> are generated together,
                    therefore these equations must all hold true at the same time. Let the value of
                    A, found from the third equation, be substituted in the first, then, putting the
                    two values of A equal, we have</p>

                <p>Hence, by involution, and making the co-efficients of like powers oft equal to

                <p>therefore (y) = *-; (y ’) = - <hi rend="superscript"> 8ιc</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>As an example, let us take the formula for the radius of curvature, which, by the

                <p>The independent variable <hi rend="italic">t</hi> does not appear in the formula;
                    nevertheless, in its application, we must keep in mind the hypothesis by which
                    it was found.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Method of Infinitesimals.</hi></p>
                <p>95. The ideas which we have of infinity may be embodied in this proposition: <hi
                    rend="italic">A quantity is not infinite so long as it admits of
                    augmentation.</hi> If, therefore, in the quantity <hi rend="italic">X + a,</hi>
                    we suppose <hi rend="italic">x</hi> to become infinite, then <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> must be suppressed, otherwise it would be supposed that <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> might be increased by the quantity <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> which is contrary to the definition. To show the consistency of the
                    proposition, let there be an equation</p>
                <p>= M (1)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a X</hi> which being multiplied by the product <hi
                    rend="italic">ax,</hi> becomes <hi rend="italic">X + a</hi> = Mar (2)</p>
                <p>Suppose now that <hi rend="italic">x</hi> increases until it becomes infinite;
                    the fraction -, having reached its last degree of diminution, is reduced to 0,
                    and therefore equation (1) becomes</p>
                <p>M = ł, or Mα = 1; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754033"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-4033-0675"/>and this value being substituted in equation (2),
                    it becomes <hi rend="italic">x + a = x.</hi> This shows that when <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> is infinite, <hi rend="italic">x + a</hi> is reduced to <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>The quantity α, in respect of which <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is infinite, is
                    called an <hi rend="italic">infinitesimal</hi> in respect of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x.</hi></p>
                <p>Since we consider here only the ratios of quantities, the preceding demonstration
                    holds good when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> has a finite value, provided that <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> be infinitely small in respect of <hi rend="italic">x.</hi>
                    Thus, if we compared, a finite quantity, with the fraction p then, <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> being supposed to increase continually, will decrease, and
                    may become smaller than any assignable quantity; and when <hi rend="italic"
                    >z</hi> is infinite, the fraction is = 0, so that, in comparison with δ, it may
                    be neglected.</p>
                <p>The ratios of quantities are altogether independent of their absolute magnitude.
                    The halves, or any like parts of quantities, have the same ratios as the wholes.
                    The symbols we employ in our reasonings are not the representatives of absolute
                    magnitudes, but of numbers, which have a reference to an unit; they therefore
                    represent ratios only, and the absolute magnitudes of the terms of the ratios
                    are never considered. The differentials of quantities are the ratios to which
                    the ratios of the increments of the variables continually approach; these
                    increments may have any magnitude whatever. Leibnitz supposed them to be
                    infinitely small quantities. Upon this hypothesis a theory has been constructed,
                    which, by following certain ascertained principles, has led to the discovery of
                    the most recondite truths in geometry and physics.</p>
                <p>96. The admission of infinitesimals into the mathematical sciences, necessarily
                    leads to a succession of different orders of infinitesimals. In a circle the
                    ratio of the diameter to the chord of an arc is the same as the ratio of the
                    chord to the versed sine; therefore, if the chord be infinitely small in respect
                    of the diameter, or an infinitesimal of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> order,
                    the versed sine will be infinitely small in respect of the chord; and,
                    consequently, in respect of the diameter, will be an infinitesimal of the <hi
                    rend="italic">second</hi> order. So also, in a series of continued
                    proportionals, 1, <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> x <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>, ae
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, &amp;c. of which the first term is finite, and
                    the second, <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> an infinitesimal of the first order, the
                    third, <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> will be of the second order, and the fourth, z <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, of the third, and so on. Upon the same principle,
                    the product <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> of two infinitesimals, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a, b</hi> of the first order will be an infinitesimal of the second; for we may
                    consider that 1: <hi rend="italic">a = b</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ab,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">ah</hi> is a fourth
                    proportional to three quantities 1, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> of which the first is finite. In like manner, the product
                    of three infinitesimals of the first order, also the product of an infinitesimal
                    of the first and of the second order, will be an infinitesimal of the third
                    order.</p>
                <p>97. When the infinitely small increments of quantities are once taken as their
                    differentials, the different rules for differentiation are easily found.</p>
                <p>Thus, if <hi rend="italic">u = xy</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then w, <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> receiving the infinitely
                    small augments <hi rend="italic">du, dx,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dy,</hi> we
                    have <hi rend="italic">«</hi><hi rend="italic">+ du = (x + dx) (y + dy)'=
                    xy</hi>-f- <hi rend="italic">xdy + ydx</hi>-J- <hi rend="italic">dxdy</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and, taking from these equals the equals <hi rend="italic"

                    <hi rend="italic">dxdy.</hi></p>
                <p>Now <hi rend="italic">du, xdy, ydx</hi> are infinitesimals of the first order,
                    and <hi rend="italic">dxdy</hi> is an infinitesimal of the second, therefore it
                    is incomparably smaller, and in respect of the others ought to be rejected, so
                    that we have simply <hi rend="italic">du = xdy</hi>-ļ- <hi rend="italic"
                    >ydx.</hi></p>
                <p>98. In this theory a curve is considered as a polygon of an infinite number of
                    sides, any one of which is the differential of the arc, therefore the
                    differential of the arc will be the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, of
                    which the sides are the differentials of the co-ordinates; and these being
                    denoted by <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> and the arc by
                    <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">dz</hi><hi rend="italic

                    the area of a curve, the increment of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ds</hi> will <hi rend="italic">beydx + ⅛dxdy</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but the second part of this, viz. <hi rend="italic">⅛dxdy,</hi> is a
                    differential of the second order, and therefore infinitely less than <hi
                    rend="italic">ydx,</hi> which is of the first order, therefore we have simply
                    <hi rend="italic">ds =ydx,</hi> agreeing with the formula of art. 69.</p>
                <p>In a circle, the infinitely small increments of the cosine, the sine, and the arc
                    form a right-angled triangle similar to that formed by the sine, the cosine, and

                <p>It is equally manifest, according to the infinitesimal theory, that the
                    subtangent is a fourth proportional to <hi rend="italic">dx</hi> (the
                    differential of the absciss), <hi rend="italic">dy</hi> (the differential of the

                <p>The great facility which the theory of infinitesimals gives in the applications
                    of the calculus to the higher geometry, and more especially to the doctrines of
                    physics, is a high recommendation in its favour. Indeed, whatever view be taken
                    of the subject, the mathematician will hardly be restrained from taking the
                    shortest way he can find to the object he wishes to attain, and that is in
                    general by the infinitesimal calculus. Accordingly we observe that Μ. Poisson,
                    in the second edition of his <hi rend="italic">Traité de Mécanique,</hi>
                    distinctly premises that he will exclusively employ the method of <hi

                    >integral calculus,</hi> treats of the analytic processes by winch a function

                    differential. This function has been called, by writers on fluxions, the <hi

                    rend="italic">;</hi> and by writers on the differential calculus, the <hi

                <p>To find the integral of a differential is to <hi rend="italic">integrate</hi>
                    that differential; and the process by which the integral is found is called <hi

                <p>100. When an integral is proposed, its differential may always be found by
                    general rules. There is however no direct rule by which we may return from the
                    differential to the integral, except the obvious one of retracing the steps by
                    which the differential has been deduced from the integral. When these are
                    distinctly indicated, there is no difficulty; but in general the steps of
                    calculation by which the differential might have been deduced from an integral
                    are obliterated or unknown; or the differential may not have been a direct
                    result of differentiation; and then there will be no traces to show how we may
                    pass from it to the integral.</p>
                <p>101. It is convenient to have a symbol by which the integral of a differential
                    may be indicated without regard to its particular form: for this purpose the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> the initial letter of
                    the word <hi rend="italic">sum)</hi> is employed. Thus, the integral of the
                    differential Xu⅛ is expressed by the symbol</p>
                <p>∕x∙ <hi rend="superscript"> fe</hi> ∙</p>
                <p>102. We have seen (art. 9) that in differentiating an expression of the form X
                    ∑±z C, which is the sum or difference<pb break="no" facs="nls:193754046"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-4046-0676"/> of a variable function and a constant quantity,
                    the constant disappears; therefore, reversely, in taking the integral of any
                    differential, the constant, C, must be added to make the integral complete. This
                    indeterminate quantity has been called by early English writers the <hi
                    rend="italic">correction</hi> of the fluent or integral, but now it is generally
                    called the <hi rend="italic">arbitrary constant.</hi> It may be written either
                    with the sign + or —; its value is to be determined, as will appear hereafter,
                    from the particular problem under consideration.</p>

                <p>103. The general form of a differential of the first order of a function is X⅛

                <p>From what has been explained, it appears that differentials which are rational
                    fractions may be always integrated either algebraically or by means of
                    logarithms or circular arcs; all that is necessary is to decompose them into
                    partial fractions, whose denominators are either binomial or trinomial
                    quantities.</p>
                <p>116. We shall now give some examples of the integration of differentials which
                    are rational fractions.</p>

                <p>U = AQ + P <hi rend="italic">(x</hi> + a), in which, by hypothesis, neither U nor

                <p>The proposed integral is now expressed by an algebraic function, and two other
                    integrals of the same form, but in which the exponents of ® are of lower
                    degrees. We have found its value (art. 125, 126) when » = 0, a case to which the
                    formula just found does not apply, because then, <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    entering into the denominators of the fractions, they become infinite. When <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> = 1, the last of the two integrals in the second side of
                    the equation vanishes, because its coefficient = 0, and we have <hi

                    the preceding general formula gives it in the case of » = 2; and in the case of
                    n = 3, it is found from the cases of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> ≡ 1 and n = 2; and

                <p>If we now regard the integral as the angle or arc whose tangent is <hi

                <p>The value of C cannot now be found by making <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 0,
                    because then the arc = 0, and the substitution of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 0
                    makes all the terms of the series infinite. If we suppose the arc to be a

                <p>When the arc =0, then the sine =0; therefore both sides of this equation vanish

                <p>140. The object of integration by series being to ob∙ tain approximate values of
                    the integrals when they cannot be found accurately, it is important to have
                    several series, so that we may be able to choose one convergent for a proposed
                    value of <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Ascending series, or those which proceed by
                    positive and increasing powers of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> do not converge
                    sufficiently unless <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be a small fraction, as happens
                    with the series of Ex. 2; whilst those which proceed by the negative powers of
                    <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> or descending series, converge only∙so as to be of use
                    when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is a large number.</p>
                <p>141. In having recourse to series, it is sufficient to find one, of which the
                    terms are separately integrable, although each may not have the form <hi
                    rend="italic">Ax</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript">

                    the integral of which can be expressed by an algebraic quantity, or a logarithm,
                    or an arc of a circle; or, in short, any function, the numerical value of which
                    is most readily obtained, provided always that the convergency be such as to
                    admit of the sum of all the terms which are not taken in being rejected, because
                    of its smallness in comparison to the sum of the terms taken in.</p>
                <p>In the application of the calculus recourse is only to be had to series as a last
                    resource, when the integral, from its nature, cannot be found in finite terms,
                    or by logarithms or arcs of a circle, which in fact are the sums of infinite
                    series. Indeed it would be very convenient to have various other tables, ready
                    computed, of the value of a function corresponding to given successive values∙of
                    the variable. The labour of their computation, their necessary great extent, and
                    the infrequency of their use, have hitherto limited this valuable aid in
                    calculation to a table of Napier’s Logarithms, in addition to the

                <p>148. There are several ways of integrating expressions which contain circular or

                <p>Let APa be a semicircle on the same axis, and let s' denote the segment cut off

                    Thus it appears that the area of APQ, any segment of an ellipse, has to the area

                <p>From this formula we find 1∙ ~ = ~1∙ Thus it appears that Napier’s logarithm of

                <p>If M be the <hi rend="italic">modulus</hi> of any system, the log of ĩ in that

                <p>Thus we see that logarithms of any system may be expressed geometrically by

                <p>157. Since the area of any plane curve is expressed by an integral <hi
                    rend="italic">ſydx,</hi> in which <hi rend="italic">y</hi> the ordinate is some
                    function of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> the absciss, so, on the other hand, any
                    integral may be represented geometrically by the area of a curve. The
                    geometrical representation of an integral shows distinctly wherein it differs
                    from a common analytic function, such as <hi rend="italic">a-^bx</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >ax,</hi> or sinar, &amp;c. These last have determinate values corresponding to
                    any given value of <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> and each is independent of its
                    preceding and following values; but the magnitude of the space represented by an
                    integral <hi rend="italic">ſydx</hi> is the increment that a certain area
                    receives While the variable <hi rend="italic">x</hi> passes from one state of
                    magnitude to another. Thus the absolute magnitude of the space CDQP (fig. 11),
                    which represents an integral <hi rend="italic">ſydx,</hi> and which, when the
                    curve is a parabola, is expressed by §-ry+C, cannot be known before C is
                    determined, or else eliminated from the expression.</p>
                <p>Whatever be the nature of the curve, the integral <hi rend="italic">ſydx</hi> ≡
                    space CPQD is correctly indicated, so as to admit of being computed, when we say
                    that it is generated while the variable <hi rend="italic">x</hi> increases from
                    any value = AD, to another value = AQ, the lines AD, AQ being supposed given in
                    magnitude, and the relation between <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> known. The same thing is briefly indicated by this
                    notation:</p>
                <p>area CPQD = <hi rend="italic">J*</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ydx,</hi> in which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> denote the lines AD and AQ.</p>
                <p>From what has been shown it appears that an integral is an indeterminate
                    quantity, the result of a change in the value of its variable; and that to know
                    its absolute value we must know the values of the variable at its commencement
                    and completion.</p>
                <p>158. The analogy between a curvilineal area and an integral indicates a general
                    method of finding its numerical value to any degree of nearness. Supposing <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> to be any function of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> let it be
                    proposed to find the integral <hi rend="italic">ſydx</hi> between <hi
                    rend="italic">x = a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x = b.</hi></p>
                <p>Let CPD be a curve, of which the co-ordinates are <hi rend="italic">X</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> In the axis AB, take AQ = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    the least value of <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> and AQ" = <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    its greatest value, and draw the ordinates PQ, P*'Q ’ ". The area PQQ"'P'" will
                    be the geometrical expression of the integral between the proposed limits; and
                    by whatever means that area can be found, the same will apply to the
                    determination of the integral.</p>
                <p>Divide QQ <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> into any number of equal parts at the
                    points Q', Q*, &amp;c. and draw the ordinates P ’ Q', P''Q'', &amp;c. These will
                    divide the whole figure into the spaces PP ’ Q'Q, P'P'Q'Q', &amp;c. Let a series
                    of rectangles PQ', P ’ Q', P"Q <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> be formed, each
                    having the least of two adjoining ordinates for a side: these will fall within
                    the curve, supposing it to be entirely concave or convex towards the axis. Let
                    another series P'Q, P"Q', P"'Q" be constructed, each having the longest of two
                    adjoining ordinates for a side: the aggregate of these will exceed the area of
                    the curve. The length of the base of each rectangle will be known, and, from the
                    nature of the curve, its height will also be known; hence the areas of all the
                    rectangles may be found. The sum of the areas of the inscribed rectangles will
                    be less than the integral, and the sum of the areas of the circumscribing
                    rectangles will be greater. The difference between these sums is the rectangle
                    PMSR, which, by supposing its base PM = QQ' to be sufficiently small, may be
                    less than any assignable space. Thus an approximate value of the integral may be
                    found, which shall differ from the truth by as small a quantity as we
                    please.</p>
                <p>Draw the chords PP', P'P', P <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> P*, thus forming a
                    series of trapeziums, which will differ from the curvilineal area by less than
                    the sum of either the inscribed or circumscribing parallelograms, and will be a
                    mean between them. This will be a nearer approximation than either sum to the
                    integral.</p>
                <p>As an example of the application of this method, let it be proposed to
                    approximate to the integrat that is, to the arc whose tangent is <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> between the values of <hi rend="italic">X</hi> = 0 and <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> = 1, which arc is -j∙ of a semicircle, the radius <pb

                    1. In this case the equation of the curve is <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">=</hi> Τ1~j∙ Let us suppose the base QQ <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>By the elements of geometry, the area of the rectilineal figure formed by the
                    trapeziums is found by adding together all the ordinates except the first and
                    last, and half the sum of the first and last, and multiplying the result by the
                    common breadth of the trapeziums, which is •1. This gives ∙784981 for the area

                    At any point D in the curve draw a tangent DE, and from the centre C draw CE

                <p>163. Ex. 1. Let the solid be a paraboloid generated by the revolution of a
                    parabola AP about its axis AQ. By the nature of the curve, y* = <hi

                    rend="italic">a paraboloid is half a cylinder of the same base and
                    altitude.</hi></p>
                <p>From this geometrical theorem we may find the content of the solid between two
                    sections of a paraboloid by planes perpendicular to its axis, which is called a
                    <hi rend="italic">frustum</hi> of a paraboloid. Let A be the area of the base of
                    the frustum, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the area of its top, <hi rend="italic"

                    vertex of the paraboloid and top of the frustum. The content of the whole
                    paraboloid = ∣(x+A)A, and the content of the part cut off = ⅜xα, therefore the
                    content of the frustum = 1(xA+AA— <hi rend="italic">xa).</hi></p>
                <p>Now by the nature of the solid = p hence xA— <hi rend="italic">xa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> —Im,</hi> therefore the content of the frustum is
                    ∣(A+α)A∙ Hence it appears that a frustum of a paraboloid is equal to a cylinder
                    of the same altitude, and whose base is a mean between the top and bottom of the
                    frustum.</p>
                <p>Ex. 2. Let the solid be a cone whose vertex is A, and base PEp <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, a plane figure of any kind.</p>
                <p>Let AB be the altitude of the cone, and PĘp a section parallel to the base,
                    meeting AB in Q. Let <hi rend="italic">b</hi> = the area of the base P'E'p <hi

                    Now, sections of similar cones are proportional to the squares of their like

                <p>If <hi rend="italic">X</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> begin together, then C =

                    rend="italic">a —Iff</hi></p>
                <p>Proceeding from this case, analysts have succeeded in separating the variables
                    when <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is any number of the form <hi rend="italic

                    t</hi><hi rend="italic">-, i</hi> being supposed an integer number. Riccati’s
                    equation was first considered by James Bernoulli, who gave an approximate
                    solution of it. (Jac. Bernoulli <hi rend="italic">Opera,</hi> p. 1053.) The
                    general problem, however, remains yet unresolved.</p>
                <p>173. When a differential equation is the immediate result of the differentiation
                    of a known function, then that function, put equal to C a constant, will be the
                    integral required. The differential equation <hi rend="italic">xdy+ydx</hi> = 0
                    is of this class; it is the differential of the product <hi rend="italic"
                    >xy,</hi> therefore the primitive equation is <hi rend="italic">xy</hi> = C. A
                    differential equation may, however, not be the immediate result of the
                    differentiation of a function of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and y; it may be
                    formed by the elimination of some constant quantity contained in the function
                    and also in its differential (art. 54); or it may be the result after the
                    differential of the primitive has been divided by some factor common to all its
                    terms. Thus, if the primitive be <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">=
                    ex,</hi> or y —; <hi rend="italic">ex</hi> s≡ 0, the differential equation is
                    <hi rend="italic">dy</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">cdx</hi> =0.
                    If however we eliminate <hi rend="italic">c</hi> by the usual algebraic process,
                    we find <hi rend="italic">xdy</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ydx=0,</hi> an expression which is not the immediate result of any
                    differentiation. The same result will be obtained if the primitive <hi
                    rend="italic">x = cy</hi> be put under the form - = <hi rend="italic">c;</hi>
                    for then, by differentiating, <hi rend="italic strikethrough"> y</hi><hi

                    is not an exact differential; however, it becomes so by restoring the factor -Ļ,
                    and then it is the differential of -.</p>

                <p>174. In general let w <hi rend="italic">—ffx, y)</hi> be the primitive equation,
                    the differential being <hi rend="italic">du</hi> = Md⅛ + Ndy, where M denotes ⅛
                    that is, the differential co-efficient found on <hi rend="italic">dx</hi> the

                    variable and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> constant; now we have found that <hi
                    rend="italic">įA- =4-⅛-</hi> (art. 89); therefore, if Mdx + Ndy <hi

                    rend="italic">c</hi> may be eliminated directly by bringing the primitive

                    this equation does not contain C, it ought to be identical with the equation ĝ +

                <p>Now the second side of the equation is a complete integral; hence it appears that
                    <hi rend="italic">there is always a factor</hi> Q, <hi rend="italic">by which,

                    the result will be a complete integral.</hi></p>
                <p>Let both sides of the equation be multiplied by U, any function of U, and we

                <p>Now <hi rend="italic">Udu</hi> is still a complete differentia], and as the

                <p>Since it appears that when the equation M&lt;⅛ + Ndy = 0; does not satisfy the
                    condition of integrability, it is because differentiation and subsequent
                    elimination of the arbitrary <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> constant have caused a
                    factor to disappear, which, if it ∙ were known and restored, would render the
                    expression a complete differential, the discovery of that factor is a most
                    important problem in the calculus. Its solution, how- ' ever, transcends the
                    present powers of analysis, although it can be resolved in particular cases.
                    When the functions M and N are homogeneous, the factor can be found; but that
                    case can always be integrated as has been explained. When the variables can be
                    separated, a multiplier can be found, but then it is not wanted. It can also be
                    found when the equation has the formrfy + <hi rend="italic">Pydx=Q,dx{</hi> but
                    this also can be integrated by other means.</p>
                <p>Euler, who has entered deeply into this subject, has reversed the problem; and,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Calculus Integralis,</hi> supposing the integrating
                    factor given, has investigated the nature of the functions which must enter into
                    a differential equation of a given form, in order that it may be integrable.
                    These investigations, however, frequently lead to differential equations, which
                    cannot be integrated by any known method; and the cases in which they are
                    successful are of no great importance or extent.</p>

                    the order of the differential coefficients which they involve, and we only
                    succeed in effecting it in a very small number of very limited equations.</p>
                <p>Let the expression <hi rend="italic">/(®&gt; y, e, d)</hi> = 0 .... (1)</p>
                <p>represent any primitive equation composed of the variables <hi rend="italic">X,
                    y,</hi> and two constant quantities c, c ’, besides any other constants. By
                    differentiation (as explained art. 48-54), there is formed its differential
                    equation of the first order, which will contain ⅛ Let this differential
                    co-efficient be <hi rend="italic">dx</hi> represented by <hi rend="italic"

                <p>By differentiating this equation we obtain another which contains also — ≡ g, and
                    may be expressed by <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>. ‰p,i&lt;⅛&lt;0 = O (3)</p>
                <p>Since these three equations must hold true at once, we may eliminate the
                    constants <hi rend="italic">c, d,</hi> and the result will be a single

                    equation of the second order, deducible from the primitive (1), and which is
                    independent of the constants c, <hi rend="italic">d.</hi></p>
                <p>We may arrive at the very same equation (4) in two other ways. We may give the

                    from which, by differentiation, two results will be obtained, one entirely free
                    from <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the other from <hi rend="italic">c:</hi>
                    these again may have the forms <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"

                <p>By taking now the differentials of these equations, we shall obtain the very same
                    equation from each, which will be identical with equation (4).</p>

                    differential equations of the third and higher orders are perfectly analogous to

                <p>186. Wehaveseen inthedifferentialcalculus,art,93,that beyond the first order the

                    quantities, was assumed as the <hi rend="italic">independent variable</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> which comes to the same thing as assuming that <hi

                    these variables, was constant. It is therefore necessary, in integrating
                    equations which exceed the first degree, to know upon which of these hypotheses
                    it has been calculated. The preceding examples all correspond to the case of <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> being a function of <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> and
                    consequently of <hi rend="italic">dx</hi> being constant; but it will be easy to
                    discover, among relations deduced relatively to other hypotheses, to which of

                <p>It is immediately evident that, if we represent by Q any function whatever of <hi

                <p>= ⅛. It may also be reduced immediately to the form = P, by passing by the

                    sphere.</p>
                <p>In this projection, the meridians and parallels of latitude are straight lines,
                    which intersect each other at right angles; and the projection of any small arc
                    of a meridian (as one minute), reckoned from any parallel, is to the projection
                    of a like arc of longitude in that parallel, as radius to the cosine of the
                    latitude of the parallel, that is, in the same ratio as the arcs themselves in
                    the sphere. Supposing the radius of the sphere to be unity, let <hi

                <p>Henry Bond, in the year 1650, discovered, by chance, that the enlarged meridian
                    might be expressed by the logarithmic tangents of half the complements of the
                    latitudes, a rule easily found from the preceding solution; but the difficulty
                    of proving this was then considered so great, that Mercator offered to wager a
                    sum of money against any person that should undertake to prove it either true or
                    false. James Gregory, however, proved it in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exercitationes</hi><hi rend="italic">Geometricae,</hi> published in 1668; also
                    Barrow, in his Geometrical Lectures: their demonstrations, however, were
                    intricate. Afterwards Dr Wallis and Dr Halley gave demonstrations which were
                    sufficiently simple and elegant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problem</hi> 2.</p>
                <p>If any number of straight lines are drawn according to some determinate law, it
                    is required to find the nature of a curve to which these are tangents.</p>
                <p>For example, let AE be a straight line given by position, and K a given point
                    without it; let any number of lines KD, KD ’, &amp;c. be drawn to meet AE in D,
                    D ’, &amp;c.; and let perpendiculars DC, D ’ C ’, &amp;c. be drawn to these
                    lines; it is required to find the nature of the curve ACC ’, to which these
                    perpendiculars are tangents.</p>
                <p>Without attending to the particular case, we shall resolve the general problem,
                    and suppose AE to be the axis of the curve, A being the origin of the
                    co-ordinates, and CD any position of the tangent, which meets the axis in D.
                    From the point of contact C draw the perpendicular CB; and, considering C as a
                    point in the curve, put AB = <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> BC = <hi rend="italic"
                    >y;</hi> but again considering C as any point whatever in the tangent, put AB =
                    at’, BC = <hi rend="italic">ιj.</hi> Then, whatever be the conditions that
                    determine the position of the tangent, the relation of A ’ and y ʹ, the
                    co-ordinates of any point in it, may be expressed by the equation <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> = Pa∕ -ļ-Q, where P and Q are put to denote generally
                    certain functions of constant quantities, and some quantity <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> which has the same value for any given position of the tangent, but
                    which changes its value if the tangent changes its position. For example, <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> may express the angle which the tangent makes with the
                    axis, or it may represent the subtangent BD, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that the variable quantity <hi rend="italic">p</hi> changes
                    its value, and becomes <hi rend="italic">p</hi>-ļ- <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and
                    that C ’ D ’ is the new position of the tangent corresponding to <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi>-j- <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then,
                    considering P and Q as functions of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> by Taylor’s

                <p>Now, as this equation holds true of every point in the <pb break="no"

                    two tangents, both equations must be true at the same time; therefore at <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> we have and, dividing by A, + + KΛ -f- &amp;c. = 0.</p>
                <p>Conceive now the two tangents to approach to coinci∙ dence; when C' comes to C,
                    then c will also fall at C; and A, and all the terms into which it enters,
                    vanish; also x ’ and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> become <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">y:</hi> and, to determine the nature ol the curve, we have

                <p>By eliminating <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> from these, the resulting equation will
                    express the nature of the curve.</p>
                <p>Ex. 1. Let us now recur to the particular case of AE, a straight line given by
                    position, K a given point, and KDC a right angle: Draw KA perpendicular to AE;

                    examples, is very comprehensive. We may evidently find, by the formulae (1) and
                    (2), <hi rend="italic">cata∙ caustic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">diacaustic</hi>
                    curves in all cases whatever. These, and an infinite number of other geometrical
                    problems, are contained in the following more general problem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Problem</hi> 3.</p>
                <p>Determine the nature of a curve which touches an infinite number of lines of a
                    given kind, described upon a plane according to some determinate law. For
                    example, suppose the lines to be parabolas described by a projectile thrown from
                    an engine with a given velocity, at every possible elevation in a vertical
                    plane.</p>
                <p>Let HCD be any one of the lines of a given kind (a para bola, for example), and
                    suppose it referred to an axis AB, by the rectangular co-ordinates AB = x <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> and BC =y ’. Let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> denote some
                    quantity belonging to the line or curve HCD, which has always the same value in
                    the same curve, but which has different values in different curves. Thus, if the
                    curve be a circle, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> may be its radius; or if the curve
                    be a parabola, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> may be its parameter, &amp;c. This
                    quantity <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> may also by analogy be called the <hi
                    rend="italic">parameter</hi> of the curve HCD. Let us suppose the nature of this
                    curve to be expressed by the equation <hi rend="smallcaps">W</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript smallcaps"> p</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">) = o</hi> (i)</p>
                <p>that is, let some function of α&lt;, .y ’, and <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> be

                    and become <hi rend="italic">p + It,</hi> then the curve HCD will change its
                    figure, and have some other position H ’ C ’ D ’. Let AB ’ = <hi rend="italic"

                    proposed to find the curve PCQ whic⅛ touches them all. Let EF be the axis of any

                    to enter into this branch of the subject, which, although interesting, is yet
                    not elementary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Investigation of the Properties of the Catenary.</hi></p>
                <p>Suppose a chain or thread of uniform thickness, and perfectly flexible, but
                    inextensible, to be fastened by its extremities at two points A, B in a vertical
                    plane; by the action of gravity it will take the form of a curve ACPB, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">catenary.</hi></p>
                <p>The curve will evidently be all in one plane, and a horizontal line CD, in that
                    plane, at C its lowest point, will manifestly touch the curve, which is retained
                    at rest by a mutual balancing of the forces produced by the weight of the
                    particles of the chain.</p>
                <p>If we suppose its lowest point to be fixed at C, it is easy to understand that
                    the part BC will not on that account change in the least its figure, because the
                    tension of the chain at C, when it was free, is now replaced by the reaction of
                    the force exerted in the horizontal direction CD.</p>

                <p>The forces exerted on the points B, C will evidently be the same in quantity and
                    in direction, whether the chain be considered as flexible, or rigid like a solid
                    wire; hence it may be regarded as kept at rest by three forces, viz. its gravity
                    acting vertically, and the re-actions of the tensions at B and C; the former
                    exerted in the direction of a tangent to the curve at B, and the latter in the
                    direction CD, the tangent at the lowest point C.</p>
                <p>In like manner any portion PC between P and its lowest point may be considered as
                    kept at rest by the joint action of the gravity of the mass PC, the tension of
                    the chain at C, which is constant, and the tension at P, which is variable; and

                    forces will be to each other as the sides of any triangle which are parallel to

                    axis, meeting the vertical through C in 0, which may be taken as an origin of
                    co-ordinates; draw PQ perpendicular to OX, and PT touching the curve and meeting
                    the axis in T. From what has been explained, the tension of the curve at C will
                    be to the weight of the matter in PC as TQ to PQ, that is, as radius to the
                    tangent of the angle which PT makes with any horizontal line.</p>

                <p>Thus it appears that the ąŗc CP is always proportional to the conterminous area
                    CPQA. It is evident that the catenary, if inverted, would form an equilibrated
                    arch. From this property it appears that if a wall, whose height above the crown
                    of the arch is equal to the line CO, be horizontal at the top, the structure
                    thus formed will constitute an equilibrated arch with a straight roadway. (See
