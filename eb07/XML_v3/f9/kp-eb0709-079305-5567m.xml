                <p><label type="entry">FOURCROY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Antony Francis
                    de</hi></label>, a celebrated chemist and physician, born at Paris on the 15th
                    June 1755, was the son of John Michael de Fourcroy, by his marriage with Jane
                    Laugier. His family had been long established in the capital; several of them
                    had been distinguished at the bar, and Fourcroy de Ramcourt was well known as an
                    engineer of considerable talent, and a member of the Academy of Sciences.</p>
                <p>His father was an apothecary attached to the household of the Duke of Orleans,
                    and was a great sufferer by the abolition of places of this kind, which was
                    procured by the corporation of apothecaries, some time before the Revolution.
                    Young Fourcroy was sent to the college of Harcourt, but made no progress in his
                    learning there, and underwent great hardships, from the cruelty of an unjust
                    master. He was afterwards obliged to subsist by his labour in copying, and by
                    taking pupils as a writing master. He was, however, fortunate in the patronage
                    and assistance of Vicq d’Azyr, who had been a friend of his father, and under
                    whose auspices he resolved to study physic; obtaining his support in the mean
                    time by giving his assistance to richer persons than himself in their literary
                    labours, and by a few translations, for which he wan very ill paid. When he had
                    gone through the regular course of study, he became a candidate for a gratuitous
                    diploma,-upon a foundation established by Dr Diest; but he failed of success,
                    from a party quarrel. His own party, however, which was that of Vicq d’Azyr,
                    indemnified him for the loss, by making a collection to discharge the fees,
                    amounting to about L.250; but the highest degree, that of doctor regent, was
                    still refused him; and he was therefore incapable of holding a professorship
                    under the Parisian faculty of physic. He resolved to apply himself to science as
                    the readiest way of acquiring medical reputation; but he seems to have been
                    little known, at any time of his life, as a practical physician. The
                    determination, however, like that of the countryman in the fable, was still a
                    beneficial one; and though be failed of discovering the golden treasure for
                    which he dug, he profited by the increased fertility of the soil, and by the
                    abundant fruits which it bore him.</p>
                <p>In natural history he soon distinguished himself as a pupil worthy of Geoffroy,
                    by an entomological publication; and in anatomy, by his description of the
                    tendons and their sheaths, which appears to have procured his admission into the
                    Academy of Sciences in 1785. He stood at first in the capacity of an anatomist,
                    though he was afterwards removed to the section of chemistry. His favourite
                    pursuit, .however, from the beginning, was chemistry; and in this he derived
                    considerable assistance from Buequet, who was then a professor in great esteem;
                    and having once undertaken to deliver a lecture in his place, on occasion of a
                    temporary indisposition of Buequet, though wholly unprepared, he found himself
                    capable of speaking for two hours with great fluency, to the delight and
                    astonishment of his audience. The reputation of Buequet was soon transferred to
                    Fourcroy; and he was enabled, by an advantageous marriage, to purchase the
                    apparatus of his predecessor, and to succeed to his lectures.</p>
                <p>In 1784, upon the death of Macquer, then professor of chemistry in the Royal
                    Garden, the Count de Buffon found the claims of Fourcroy so strong, that he
                    thought it right to appoint him to the vacant chair, though no less a chemist
                    than Lavoisier was a rival candidate; the competition not being wholly decided
                    either by talent or by depth of learning, but probably, in a great measure, by
                    the reputation in the art of teaching which Fourcroy had already acquired. His
                    success in this new situation was brilliant and universal; and he continued for
                    twenty-five years to absorb the whole attention of a numerous audience<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193755580" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5580-0794"/>, by his
                    eloquence, and by the perspicuity of his mode of explaining some of the most
                    important novelties that have ever appeared in any age. The science which he
                    taught was then making its most rapid progress. It was then that Bergman and
                    Scheele had introduced into analytical chemistry a precision almost geometrical;
                    that Priestley had discovered the aeriform elements of the animal and vegetable
                    world; that Black and Wilcke had methodised the phenomena of heat; that
                    Cavendish had discovered the composition of water and of the nitric acid; that
                    Monge had repeated and extended his experiments; and that Lavoisier had reduced
                    the whole of chemistry to a uniform system, which, though founded on a
                    generalization somewhat too hasty, has still been of important service to the
                    science, by concentrating the attention of the philosophic reasoner on various
                    classes of phenomena, which could not so easily have been comprehended in one
                    view, without the aid of some such hypothesis. Μ. de Fourcroy was particularly
                    happy in his tact of perceiving whether or not all his audience were fully in
                    possession of the ideas he wished to communicate to them, and he was never tired
                    of explaining himself, till he was satisfied that he had said enough. His manner
                    was energetic, and such as an Englishman might perhaps have thought pompous and
                    affected; but we must recollect that there is no fixed standard of propriety in
                    matters of taste, and that, as the common conversation of the French is
                    naturally accompanied with more of emphasis and gesture than our own, it is very
                    possible that, without any greater proportional exaggeration than is introduced
                    in similar cases in Great Britain, an actor, a lecturer, or a preacher, may
                    exhibit what to us would appear a caricature, while it only affects his own
                    countrymen as a natural, though impressive, style of public speaking. The
                    chemical amphitheatre of the Public Garden was crowded by students from all
                    countries, and from all quarters of the globe, some prompted to visit Paris by
                    their own love of learning only, some assisted in their pursuits by their
                    respective governments; and it was twice in succession necessary to provide more
                    extensive accommodations for the overflowing numbers that sought for
                    admittance.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Fourcroy’s political life, though not unsuccessful, seems to have
                    contributed less materially to his happiness than his scientific career. He was
                    chosen a supplementary member of the National Convention, and entered on the
                    functions of the office in the dreadful period of 1793. He had, however, the
                    wisdom to refrain from employing the eloquence that he possessed under
                    circumstances so dangerous, and he almost entirely confined his exertions to
                    some attempts to soften the cruel tyranny of the times. Darcet was one of the
                    destined victims that he had the good fortune to save; but he soon found it too
                    dangerous to persist in such interferences. Μ. Cuvier, however, very fully
                    acquits him of any approbation of the judicial murders which were committed, and
                    of any connivance at such proceedings as it might have been possible for him to
                    avert; declaring, that if, upon the strictest inquiry, he could have discovered
                    that there was the least foundation for charging him with having been
                    indifferent to the fate of his great rival Lavoisier, no consideration on earth
                    could have induced him to become the biographer of a person so odious and
                    contemptible. It was at a later period that Fourcroy acquired some little
                    influence as a director of the public instruction; and in this capacity he had
                    great scope for the exertion of his talents, in the re-establishment of the many
                    public institutions connected with science, which the madness of the Revolution
                    had destroyed. The <hi rend="italic">Ecole de Médecine</hi> was one of the first
                    that was restored; but the name of Médecine seeming to carry with it too much of
                    respect and authority for the levelling spirit of the day, the new institution
                    was at first called <hi rend="italic">Ecole de Santé.</hi> Μ. de Fourcroy was
                    also very essentially concerned in the organization of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecole Polytechnique,</hi> as well as of the central schools of the departments,
                    and of the <hi rend="italic">Normal</hi> schools of Paris; nor was he an
                    indifferent spectator of the establishment of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institute,</hi> which was at first intended to be as much immediately
                    subservient to public instruction, as to making known the results of private
                    study. He had also considerable influence in obtaining the adoption of a law
                    calculated greatly to facilitate the formation of a museum of natural history on
                    a magnificent scale. If, in the pursuit of these objects, he sometimes appeared
                    to forget the dignity of language most appropriate to his subject, it must be
                    remembered that he lived in times when the choice of expressions was by no means
                    at the option of the speaker. He was once denounced by the Jacobins, merely for
                    his silence in the assembly; but he excused himself, by pleading the absolute
                    necessity of applying himself to chemical pursuits for the support of his
                    family.</p>
                <p>In 1798 his duties as a senator were terminated; but he was made a counsellor of
                    state under the consular government, and again employed in the department of
                    public instruction, with less liberty to pursue his own ideas than before, but
                    with more effectual means of attaining the objects of his appointment. In this
                    capacity he directed, in the course of five years, the establishment of twelve
                    schools of law, and of more than thirty lyceums, afterwards called royal
                    colleges, and three hundred elementary schools; exhibiting, in the performance
                    of this laborious duty, the greatest possible judgment and attention in
                    overcoming the local difficulties which perpetually occurred in the details of
                    the undertaking, and depending on none but himself for the whole of the required
                    arrangements. He conducted himself with great impartiality in his choice of the
                    persons to be employed, though he sometimes found himself obliged to pay a
                    certain degree of deference to the arbitrary power under which he acted, or even
                    to his own political connexions. Remembering the difficulties which he had
                    himself encountered in the early part of his career, he was particularly kind
                    and benevolent in his intercourse with those young men to whom he was the
                    dispenser of public munificence, in admitting them to a gratuitous
                    education.</p>
                <p>The great number and extent of Μ. de Fourcroy’s scientific labours may be
                    considered as paramount to a more immediate participation in the discovery of
                    some of the new facts which changed the aspect of the science of chemistry. His
                    ideas were, however, often rather enlarged than profound; and he was not
                    uncommonly somewhat too precipitate in his conclusions; but he was generally
                    methodical in the mode of conducting his researches, and clear in relating their
                    results. His pursuits and projects were sometimes varied a little capriciously,
                    though he prosecuted them all with equal warmth and eloquence. He was too much
                    the slave of public opinion for his own comfort; and even the slightest
                    expression of censure that occurred in private society, or the most unimportant
                    criticism that appeared in a periodical work, became, a heavy misfortune to him,
                    and deprived him of his tranquillity for a considerable time. But the desire of
                    universal approbation acted upon him as a strong incentive to continued
                    exertion; and, amongst all his political and official labours, he continued his
                    experiments, his memoirs, and his lectures, with as much eagerness as if they
                    had constituted his whole occupation. His nerves seem ultimately to have
                    suffered by his unremitting application, and he became subject to palpitations,
                    which, as he waswell aware, rendered the duration of his life extremely
                    precarious<pb break="no" facs="nls:193755593" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5593-0795"/>. At
                    last, on the 16th of December 1809, at the age of fifty-four, as he was signing
                    some dispatches, he exclaimed suddenly, “I am dead ;” and his words were true.
                    It happened, that on that dayΙιis family were about to assemble for the
                    celebration of an anniversary in which they were particularly interested; the
                    assembly actually met, though only to mourn his loss; and their disappointment
                    was rendered the greater, upon the receipt of some distinguished marks of the
                    imperial favour, which arrived too late to be of any use to his spirits or to
                    his health, but which would have been of the more value to him, as he had before
                    been passed over, when some of his colleagues had received considerable
                    gratifications. He had, however, been made a count of the empire, and a
                    commander of the legion of honour, in addition to his various literary and
                    scientific titles; and he must have had the heartfelt satisfaction of
                    reflecting, that he had been of use to the promotion of knowledge by his
                    experiments and his writings; to his country by the public institutions which he
                    had established; and to many deserving individuals by the benefits which he had
                    bestowed on them, without the remorse of having done injury to any one.</p>
                <p>He left a son by his first marriage with Mlle. Bettinger, the Count de Fourcroy,
                    an officer of artillery, who was afterwards killed in the campaign of 1813 in
                    Saxony, and a daughter, Mad. Foucaud. Byhis second marriage with Mad.
                    Belleville, the widow of Μ. de Wailly, he had no children. His two maiden
                    sisters also survived him, though by no means in a state of affluence; but they
                    received great kindness from his friend and assistant Μ. Vauquelin. His place at
                    the Institute was very ably filled by Μ. Thénard; Μ. Laugier succeeded him at
                    the Museum, and Μ. Gay Lussac at the Ecole Polytechnique.</p>

                <p>Besides his separate works, Μ. de Fourcroy was the author of more than a hundred
                    and sixty memoirs, printed in different publications, the principal of which it
                    will be sufficient to enumerate in a very cursory manner, adding a few of Dr
                    Thomson’s able criticisms on the respective articles. The most important of his
                    later researches were published jointly in his own name and in that of his pupil
                    Vauquelin; and it is supposed that the processes were generally conducted and
                    often suggested by Vauquelin, but that the investigations were set on foot and
                    directed, and the results described and methodized, with inferences and
                    theoretical reasoning, by Fourcroy.</p>

                    and that it may be obtained by means of a low heat, from the oxide of manganese.

                    had conceived some hopes that the observation might be applied with advantage to
                    similar diseases in the human subject. His investigations respecting calculi,
                    however, notwithstanding their importance, were in a great measure anticipated
