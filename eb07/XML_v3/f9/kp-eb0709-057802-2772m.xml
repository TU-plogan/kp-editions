                <p><label type="entry">FILICAIA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Vincenzo da</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated Italian poet, descended of a noble family of Florence, was born in
                    that city on the 30th of December 1642. He commenced his studies under the
                    Jesuits at Florence, and completed them in the university of Pisa. Grecian and
                    Roman antiquity, philosophy, theology, and jurisprudence, were successively the
                    objects of his study; poesy served merely as a relaxation from severer pursuits.
                    Like most young devotees of the muses, he began with amatory verses; but the
                    lady whom he loved and celebrated having died in the flower of her age, he
                    burned all the verses which he had inscribed to her, and resolved henceforth to
                    sing only heroic or sacred themes, a resolution which he most religiously
                    observed. Having returned to Florence, after a residence of about five years at
                    Pisa, he was received into the academy Della Crusea, and, in a short time,
                    married a daughter of the senator Scipio Caponi; but as this lady brought him
                    little fortune, and his own means were limited, he withdrew entirely from the
                    world, on the death of his father, and established himselí in the country, where
                    he divided his time between his studies, the education of his children, and the
                    contemplation of the wonders of nature and its author. He every day composed
                    verses either in Latin or Italian, which he submitted to the judgment of his
                    friends, and improved according to the advice which they gave, without any
                    desire for publication, or indeed any other object than that of exercising his
                    own powers. But a memorable occurrence drew him from the voluntary obscurity in
                    which he had buried himself. Vienna, besieged by an army of two hundred thousand
                    Turks, was delivered by John Sobieski, king of Poland, and by the Duke of
                    Lorraine, afterwards Charles V. This great event, which saved Christendom from
                    the most imminent danger, excited the enthusiasm of Filicaia, who, in a
                    magnificent <hi rend="italic">canzone</hi> or ode, celebrated the victory of the
                    Christian armies; he also addressed a second to the Emperor Leopold I., a third
                    to the King of Poland, a fourth to the Duke of Lorraine, and a fifth to the god
                    of armies; and the Ottomans, having been entirely defeated in another battle, he
                    celebrated this new triumph in a sixth ode, which is perhaps the most beautiful
                    of all. These six triumphal odes excited universal admiration. The grand duke,
                    of his ow n accord, sent copies of them to the princes whose exploits were
                    commemorated, and from the latter the author received the most flattering
                    acknowledgments. But as the copies of his odes became daily deformed by new
                    errors, in proportion as they were multiplied, his friends at length obtained
                    permission to print them. They accordingly appeared at Florence, in 1684, in
                    4to; and Filicaia was, almost in spite of himself, placed in the first rank of
                    Italian lyric poets. Another great ode, which he addressed the same year to
                    Queen Christina of Sweden, fully supported the reputation which he had gained by
                    his former productions. This princess, who then exhibited in private life the
                    generosity of a sovereign, did not confine herself to a mere expression of her
                    satisfaction, or corresponding with the author, or admitting him into the
                    academy, which she had formed at Rome, of men most distinguished in poetry and
                    letters; being informed of the depressed state of his circumstances, she in some
                    sort adopted his two sons, undertook to defray the expense of their education,
                    and exacted from their father, as the only expression of his gratitude, that he
                    would maintain the most profound silence, not chusing, as she said, to have to
                    blush before the public for having done so little to serve a man who had so many
                    claims to her esteem. But a severe malady with which he was seized some years
                    afterwards, was followed by another subject of affliction, which he felt much
                    more sensibly; he lost his eldest son, who had been appointed page to the grand
                    duke after the death of the queen his benefactress. This bereavement, which he
                    bore with Christian fortitude, fixed on him the particular attention of the
                    prince, who, interested in his fortune, conferred on him the dignity of senator,
                    and soon afterwards appointed him ducal commissary of Volterra, then commissary
                    of Pisa, and, lastly, secretary <hi rend="italic">au tirage</hi> to the
                    magistrates, an important office, which gave him immediate access to the prince,
                    and initiated him in the secrets of the government. Filicaia, in all his
                    employments, secured at once the gratitude of the public, the attachment of
                    those under him, and the esteem of his sovereign. Neither the multiplicity of
                    his occupations, nor the progress of age, however, prevented him from dedicating
                    several hours each day to the cultivation of letters and the exercise of his
                    poetical talent; but as his piety, which had always been great, increased with
                    his years, he at length confined his reading to religious books, and treated
                    only of sacred subjects. Nevertheless, he had resolved to collect all his
                    pieces, to revise and correct them of new, and to publish himself a complete
                    edition of his lyrical composition; but, whilst occupied with this undertaking,
                    in which he had made considerable progress, he was seized with a violent
                    affection in the chest, which in a few days put a period to his life· He died at
                    Florence, on the 24th of September 1707, in the sixty-fifth year of his age, and
                    was interred in the famι y vault in the church of St Peter, where his son Scipio
                    erected a monument to his memory. The edition of his poetica works in Italian,
                    which he was preparing, and had even begun to print at the time of his death,
                    was also spee J published by the same son, who dedicated it to the Cran Duke
                    Cosmo III. under the title of <hi rend="italic">Poesie</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    life of the author, by Thomas Bonaventuri, a Florentine; which life had
                    previously appeared in the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Vite
                    degli</hi><hi rend="italic">Arcadi Illustri.</hi> But a more valuable though
                    less beautiful edition, from which all the subsequent editions have been taken,
                    is that of Venice, 1762, in two volumes 8vo; the first of which contains the <hi
                    rend="italic">Poesie</hi><hi rend="italic">Toscane,</hi> and the second, the
                    Latin verses of the same author, there for the first time collected from the
                    different publications in which they had been previously scattered. There are
                    subjoined some pieces in prose of inferior interest, if we except a literary
                    correspondence of Filicaiawith Francesco Redi, Menzini, and Gori, who shared
                    with him the glory of having, in a corrupt age, remained faithful to the
                    principles of good taste and sound literature. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >canzoni,</hi> to which we have above referred, are perhaps the most remarkable
                    compositions in this collection; but some of the other pieces are not inferior
                    to these either in the dignity of the subject or the majesty and force of the
                    style; and several of his <hi rend="italic">Sonnets</hi> are worthy of these
                    beautiful odes. Is there an Italian heart that can be insensible to the deep
                    patriotic feeling, expressed with such a mournful and affecting sublimity, in
                    the well-known sonnet commencing</p>
                <p>Italia, Italia, 0 tu cui feo la sorte Donno infelice di Bellezza, etc; one of the
                    most perfect compositions of the kind in existence, and which, though it
                    consists of only fourteen verses, will sustain a comparison with the most
                    celebrated lyrical effusions, ancient or modern?</p>
