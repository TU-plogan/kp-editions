                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    known by his assumed name of <hi rend="italic">Merlin Cocaio,</hi> an eccentric
                    genius, and burlesque poet, was descended of a noble family of Mantua, and born
                    at a place called Cipada, beyond the suburb of St George on the lower lake, in
                    the year 1491.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Folengo,
                    in his verses, has several times mentioned the place of his birth in his own
                    peculiar vein: Magna suo veniat Merlino parva Cipada— Mantua Yirgilio gaudet,
                    Yerona catulio, Dante suo florens urbs Tusea, Cipada Cocajo— Nec Merlinus ego,
                    laus, gloria, fama Cipadae, etc.</p></note> From his infancy he showed great
                    quickness and vivacity of mind, a decided taste for poetry, and a singular
                    facility of turning everything which occurred into verse. According to Tomasini
                    and others, he completed his studies at Bologna, and at the age of sixteen
                    entered the order of Benedictines of the congregation of Monte Cassino, near
                    Brescia, where his elder brother had taken the vows about three months before.
                    He then assumed the name of Theophilus instead of Jerome, which was his
                    baptismal name, and eighteen months afterwards he made profession as
                    Benedictine. At first his life was regular: but a new superior of the monastery
                    of Brescia, where he had become professed, having permitted or introduced great
                    disorders there, Folengo, led away by bad example, forgot his vows, and ended by
                    quitting the monastery and his habit together, to stroll about with a pretty
                    woman who had captivated his fancy. This young person, who is said to have been
                    well born, is not directly mentioned by him in his works; but as he has put the
                    letters of her name to a species of canzone or ode, consisting of thirteen
                    verses, we thence collect that she was called Girolama Dieda. With this female
                    he wandered about for ten years, having, as appears, no other resource for
                    procuring a livelihood than his talents and his verses. He had commenced a poem
                    in Latin, which, as far as it went, displayed much elegance; but he soon quitted
                    serious poetry, in which he could at most only hope to obtain a secondary rank,
                    for a kind which he called Macaronic, and in which he conceived himself
                    qualified to occupy the first place. The basis of the language employed by him
                    is Latin, mixed with Italian words, and still more with the Mantuan patois,
                    which was his mother tongue, and to which he gave Latin terminations. In his
                    poem he recounts the ridiculous adventures of a hero called Baldus, among which
                    are several which had happened to himself; and under the mask of burlesque and
                    buffoonery may be found thoughts and maxims instinct with good sense, ųot to
                    mention original and piquant touches of satire on the conduct of the great, the
                    vanity of titles, and the different pursuits of men. It has been alleged that he
                    gave the name of Macaronic to this strange species of composition, in which
                    Latin is intermixed with Italian and Mantuan, because macaroni is seasoned with
                    a mixture of flour, butter, and cheese; and in fact, to a mind like his, this
                    fanciful and grotesque resemblance was sufficient. Instead of dividing his poem
                    into books or cantos, he accordingly divided it into macaronis <hi rend="italic"
                    >(macaronea</hi><hi rend="italic">prima,</hi><hi rend="italic">macaronea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">secunda,</hi> etc.), of which there were seventeen in the first
                    edition and twenty-five in the subsequent ones; and’ he published the whole
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Merlinus Cocajus,</hi> which afterwards
                    became famous. In a few years several editions were published; but the success
                    of these facetious productions did not prevent their being bitterly criticised.
                    The author was severely censured, botiι for the style in which he wrote, and the
                    license of ideas and expressions in which he indulged; a circumstance which
                    irritated him so much that, changing his style, or rather language and name, he
                    composed in three months a satirical Italian poem, in eight cantos, on the
                    infancy of Roland, to which he gave the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlandino,</hi> and affixed the name of <hi rend="italic">Limerno
                    Pitocco</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Limemo</hi> being the
                    anagram of <hi rend="italic">Merlino,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pitocco</hi> or
                    mendicant being significative of the state to which he Was occasionally reduced.
                    He hail nevertheless made many friends in the world by the reputation which he
                    had acquired, the extent of his knowledge, and the agreeable qualities of his
                    mind; and he had even retained some in the cloister, into which, when tired of a
                    wandering and miserable life, he was received back with open arms. He signalized
                    his return by a work on the subject of his conversion, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">11 Chaos del Triperuno,</hi> or The Chaos of Three for One,
                    meaning himself, who had been successively Theophilus Folengo, Merlin Cocaio,
                    and Limemo <pb break="no" facs="nls:193754553" xml:id="kp-eb0709-4553-0715"
                    />Pitocco. The work is a medley of verses, songs, and narrations, in Latin,
                    Italian, and the Macaronic dialect, in short, a veritable chaos, divided into
                    three parts, called, after Statius, <hi rend="italic">Sylv&lt;ε.</hi> He then
                    applied himself to correct his other works, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlandino</hi> appeared in seven cantos instead of eight, with corrections and
                    considerable suppressions, especially in the seventh canto. He also undertook to
                    chasten the Macaronies; and having completed this labour, he entrusted the
                    publication of the purified edition to his brother Francisco Folengo. But
                    although these two works were thus rendered less exceptionable and more
                    orthodox, the corrected editions have fallen into oblivion. Folengo appears to
                    have remained during several years at Capri, a country-house belonging to his
                    order, between Brescia and Bergamo, and, in fact, to have divided his time
                    between this retreat and Brescia till 1536 or 1537, in one or other of which
                    years he composed his Italian poem on the Humanity of the Son of God, the most
                    orthodox of all his works, and which would be the most edifying if one could
                    really be edified by that which is unreadable. He was then sent into Sicily to
                    the monastery of St Martin <hi rend="italic">delle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Scale,</hi> where he appears to have remained till 1543, when he returned into
                    Italy, and retired to the convent of the Holy Cross of Campesa, near Bassano, on
                    the banks of the Brenta, where he died in little more than a year afterwards,
                    9th December 1544, in the fifty-third year of his age. The following is a list
                    of his works: 1. <hi rend="italic">Merlini Cocaji Po'ėtoe</hi><hi rend="italic"
