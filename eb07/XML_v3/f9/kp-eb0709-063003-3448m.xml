                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">FLUTE</label>, an instrument of music, the simplest of all
                    those of the wind kind. It is played on by blowing it with the mouth; and the
                    tones or notes are changed by stopping and opening the ventiges arranged along
                    its side. There is a very ancient instrument. It was at first called the flute
                    <hi rend="italic">a bec,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">bee,</hi> an old Gaulish
                    word signifying the beak of a bird or fowl, but more especially of a cock; the
                    term <hi rend="italic">flute a bee</hi> therefore signifies the <hi
                    rend="italic">beaked flute,</hi> which appears a very proper appellation in
                    comparison with the traverse or German flute. The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >flute</hi> is derived from <hi rend="italic">fluta,</hi> the Latin for a
                    lamprey or small eel found in the Sicilian Seas, and having seven holes
                    immediately below the gills on each side, the precise number of those in the
                    front of the flute.</p>
                <p>By Mersenne this instrument is called the <hi rend="italic">fistula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dulcis seu</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglica;</hi> and, according to
                    him, the lowest note for the treble flute is <hi rend="italic">C fa ut,</hi> and
                    the compass of the instrument fifteen notes. 1here is however a flute known by
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">concert fl</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    u</hi><hi rend="italic">te,</hi> the lowest note of which is r. Indeed ever
                    since the introduction of the flute into concerts, the lowest note of the
                    instrument, of what size soever it may be, has been called F; when in truth its
                    pitch is determinable only by its correspondence in respect of acuteness or
                    gravity with one or other of the chords in the <hi rend="italic">scala</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">maxima</hi> or great system.</p>
                <p>Besides the true concert flute, others of a less size were soon introduced into
                    concerts of violins; in which case the method was to write the flute part in.a
                    key corresponding to its pitch. This practice was introduced in 1710 b <hi
                    rend="subscript"> v</hi> one 5 oodcock, a celebrated performer on this
                    instrument, and William Babell, organist of the church of All-Hallows, Bread
                    Street, London. They failed, however, in procuring for the flute a reception
                    into concerts of various instruments; for which reason Thomas Stanesby, a
                    curious maker of flutes and other instruments of the like kind, having about the
                    year 1732 adverted to the scale of Mersenne, in which the lowest note is C,
                    invented what he called the <hi rend="italic">new system,</hi> in which, by
                    making the flute of such a size as to be a fifth above concert pitch, the lowest
                    note became <hi rend="italic">C sol fa ut.</hi> By this contrivance the
                    necessity of transposing the flute part was taken away; for a flute of this
                    size, adjusted to the system above mentioned, became an octave to the violin. To
                    further this invention of ' Stanesby’s, Louis Merci, performer on the flute,
                    published, about the year 1735, six solos for this instrument, three of which
                    are said to be accommodated to Stanesby’s new system; but the German flute had
                    now become a favourite instrument, and Stanesby’s ingenuity failed to produce
                    the effect intended. Indeed one great objection against this instrument, which
                    equally affects all perforated pipes, is, that they are never perfectly in tune,
                    or cannot be made to play all their notes with equal exactness. The utmost that
                    the makers of them can do is to tune them to some one key; and to effect this
                    truly, is a matter of no small difficulty. The English flutes made by the
                    younger Stanesby came the nearest to perfection; but those of Bressan, though
                    excellent in their tone, were all too flat in the upper octave. For these
                    reasons some are induced to think that the utmost degree of proficiency on any
                    of those instruments is not worth the labour of attaining it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">German</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Flute</hi> is an
                    instrument entirely different from the common flute. It is not, like the latter,
                    put into the mouth to be played; but the end is stopt with a tompion or plug,
                    and the lower lip is applied to a hole about two inches and a half or three
                    inches distant from the end. This instrument is usually about a foot and a half
                    in length; rather larger at the upper end than the lower; and perforated with
                    holes, besides that for the mouth, the lowest of which is stopped and opened by
                    the little finger pressing on a brass or sometimes a silver key, like those in
                    hautboys, bassoons, and other similar instruments. Itssound is exceedingly sweet
                    and agreeable; and it serves as a treble in a concert.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Flute,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Fluyt,</hi> is a kind of
                    long vessel, with flat ribs or floor timbers, round aft, and swelled in the
                    middle, which serves chiefly for carrying provisions in fleets or squadrons of
                    ships, though it is often used in merchandise. The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >flute,</hi> signifying a sort of boat or vessel, is, according to Borel,
                    derived from the ancient <hi rend="italic">flotte,</hi> a little boat. In the
                    verbal process of the miracles of St Catherine of Sweden, in the twelfth
                    century, we meet with the following words: “Unus equum suum una cum mercibus
                    magni ponderis introduxit super instrumentum de lignis fabricatum, vulgariter
                    dictum <hi rend="italic">flutaΓ</hi></p>
