                    celebrated for íiis valuable works on political economy and legislation, was
                    born at Naples on the 18th of August 1752. He was the third son of Cesar prince
                    of Araniello, by Marianne Montalto, daughter of the Duke of Fragnito. His family
                    was ancient, and rose to distinction at the first establishment of the
                    Neapolitan monarchy. Angerio,. its founder, was the son of one of those brave
                    Normans who landed in Italy about the beginning of the eleventh century, and
                    accompanying Count Roger in all his military expeditions, received from him
                    ample domains as the reward of his exploits. His descendants were allowed to
                    take the honourable title of <hi rend="italic">Filii</hi><hi rend="italic">An-gerii,</hi> and hence the name Filangieri. Gaétan from his infancy was
                    destined for the profession of arms; when he was seven years of age he was
                    enrolled in one of the royal regiments, and he commenced actual service at the
                    age of fourteen. His education was at first neglected, from a misconception of
                    his character, which was supposed to be averse to all literary or speculative
                    pursuits. The injudicious methods adopted at that time in the teaching of Latin
                    had, it seems, disgusted him, and alienated his mind from the study of this
                    language; and hence an impression lŗad been hastily taken up of his general
                    unfitness for all literary exercises. A lucky accident, however, not only
                    removed this apprehension, but showed that his former impatience of the modes of
                    tuition then in use arose from the clearness and vigour of his judgment. It
                    happened that his brother’s preceptor had one day mistaken the solution of some
                    geometrical problem. Gaétan immediately perceived the source of this error,
                    which he demonstrated to the master. This incident, apparently trivial,
                    determined his future destiny. Encouraged by his success, he quitted the
                    military service, and determined to follow his natural taste for science and
                    philosophy. So diligent was he in repair- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ∩g the
                    defects of his education, that at twenty years of <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    S <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>.he had acquired a knowledge of Greek and Latin,
                    of ancient and modern history, of the great principles both of il and of public
                    law, and was besides well initiated in •mathematical science. Although his
                    genius inclined him <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> °Lly to the study of
                    legislation and policy, he sacrificed his views to the wishes of his friends,
                    and entered on the: piotession of the law, which was then the certain road both
                    to honour and fortune. His eloquence and his extensive knowledge soon obtained
                    him success; and, about this period, a circumstance happened which greatly
                    conduced to his celebrity. Enormous abuses prevailed in the administration of
                    justice at Naples, arising from the uncertainty of the law, which occasioned
                    constant misconceptions, and almost always led to arbitrary judgments. By a wise
                    ordinance of the king, passed in the year 1774, at the suggestion of the
                    minister Tanucci, those abuses were reformed; the law was restored to its proper
                    authority; its judgments were freed from the control of precedents; and the
                    judges were ordained in every case to publish the grounds of their decisions.
                    Although this reform was generally applauded, it excited the murmurs of the bar.
                    Filaņgieri now became the advocate of the court, and published a defence of the
                    royal decree, founded upon the most enlarged views of equity and reason. The
                    extensive knowledge and matured judgment displayed in this performance attracted
                    the attention of the ministers, and Filangieri was encouraged to pursue the
                    course in which he had already acquired so much distinction. Through the
                    influence of his uncle, the Archbishop of Palermo, he was in 1777 placed in an
                    honourable office at court; and almost at the same time he was named officer of
                    the royal corps of marine volunteers, who were more particularly attached to the
                    king’s person. But his abode at court neither broke in upon his regular habits
                    of life, nor interrupted the course of his studies; nor did he allow it to
                    interfere with the composition of the great work on legislation and government
                    in which he was engaged, and to which for several years past he had devoted all
                    his inquiries. About the commencement of the eighteenth century a great school
                    of philosophy had been formed at Naples, in which the principles of the civil
                    law, of the law of nations, and of legislation, were established on the solid
                    and comprehensive basis of general utility. From this school numerous works of
                    celebrity have proceeded; amongst others, the great work of Beccaria,· which,
                    though confined to one branch of legislation, contains principles which are of
                    universal application. There was still wanting, however, a general treatise on
                    legislation, for the purpose of examining the science in all its relations, and
                    of laying down some common and universal principles of equity and expediency as
                    its only true basis; and it was to this important undertaking that Filangieri’s
                    philosophical mind was now directed. His subject he proposed to divide into
                    seven books. The first, in which he demonstrates the general rules of
                    legislation, and the second, which treats on political laws, and on those laws
                    also which are connected with the general structure of society, appeared at
                    Naples in 1780; and such was its popularity, that not only in Italy, but
                    throughout Europe at large, the author was ranked among the most celebrated
                    writers on public law. According to his theory, the goodness of laws is either
                    absolute or relative. It is absolute when they are agreeable to those great and
                    universal principles of equity and expediency which are obligatory on man under
                    every diversity of country, climate, government, or manners; it is relative,
                    according as the laws agree with the nature of the government, with the genius
                    and character of the people, with the climate, with the fertility or sterility
                    of the soil, with the physical circumstances of the country, with the religion
                    of the inhabitants, and with the degree of civilization to which they have
                    advanced. In his second book, which treats of political laws, and of those laws
                    also which are connected with the general economy of society, he examines two
                    points; namely, the state of population and of wealth. With respect to the first
                    point, the great question which he considers is, whether Europe is as populous
                    as it might be? This question he resolves in the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193752746" xml:id="kp-eb0709-2746-0576"/>negative, and
                    he proceeds to explain the causes of this deficient population. According to his
                    hypothesis, the state of agriculture affords in every country the surest
                    evidence as to the state of the population; but the backwardness of agriculture
                    in most parts of Europe sufficiently indicates that the population is deficient;
                    therefore he infers the defective state of European legislation on these two
                    capital points. The great obstacles to the improvement of agriculture, and,
                    consequently, to the increase of population, he considers to be, Isí, the small
                    number of proprietors, and the great number of non-pro-prictors; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> too many large, and too few small properties; 3<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> the exorbitant and inalienable possessions of the church
                    in several states; 4√∕z⅞∕, the excess of the public imposts, and the violent
                    modes of levying them; <hi rend="italic">bthly,</hi> to these he adds other
                    causes of less importance, such as the state of most of the regular troops of
                    the European states; also public corruption, and the dissoluteness of private
                    morals. The progress of agriculture, the great source of wealth as well as of
                    population, may also be obstructed by a bad political administration, by bad
                    laws, or by those causes which occasion a great influx of inhabitants to the
                    respective capitals of the different states. It belongs to a pure system of
                    legislation to remove some of those obstacles, and to counterbalance such others
                    as are inevitable, by suitable encouragements. Having discussed those momentous
                    questions, he next enters into a comprehensive survey of the other sources of
                    riches, namely, arts, manufactures, and commerce, and points out how these may
                    be obstructed by a faulty legislation, and, at the same time, the means by which
                    such obstructions may be removed. In order fully to comprehend the merits of
                    these performances, we must consider that all the faults which the author
                    reprehends were committed by his own government; a circumstance which imposed on
                    him the delicate task of stating obnoxious truths with freedom and boldness,
                    and, at the same time, without giving unnecessary offence. So well, however, did
                    he appreciate the views.of those whom it was his wish to enlighten, that he was
                    immediately promoted by the king to a commandery in the royal order of
                    Constantine. In 1783 he married a Hungarian lady of noble birth, who was
                    entrusted with the education of the second daughter of the king, and who to
                    outward attractions united the gift of a sound judgment and an agreeable
                    disposition. That he might the more freely enjoy domestic happiness, and, at the
                    same time, have leisure for the composition of his work, on which he became
                    every day more intent, he resigned, with the consent of the king, all his
                    military employments and his office at court, and retired to a country-seat
                    about twenty miles from Naples. In the same year he published his third book,
                    relating entirely to the principles of criminal jurisprudence. In these
                    discussions he maintains the same tone of decision and independence as before.
                    Abuses are freely pointed out, and the defects of the penal code, and the forms
                    of criminal procedure, are fairly exposed. In thus pointing out those defects in
                    the domestic administration of his government, Filangieri excited the hatred of
                    an interested and powerful class; and a proposition which he made in his third
                    book, for the reformation of abuses in the Roman Catholic church, drew down upon
                    his work the censure of some of the ecclesiastical tribunals. In 1785, however,
                    he published the fifth, sixth, and seventh volumes of his work, which
                    comprehended his fourth book. These were devoted to the consideration of
                    education, morals, and public instruction; and though on these important points
                    we may be occasionally disposed to question his views, we must nevertheless
                    admire his mild and philosophical spirit still opposed to every excess, his
                    extensive knowledge, and his happy talent of arranging and combining it for the
                    illustration of his argument; his animated, flowing, and perspicuous style; and,
                    above all, that rectitude and philanthropy which are diffused over all his
                    reasonings. His fifth book, which treated of the laws relative to religion, was
                    soon afterwards published. But his health was now considerably impaired, owing
                    to an excess of application, so that the remainder of his work advanced but
                    slowly; and other interruptions soon followed. In the year 1787 he was called by
                    the new king, Ferdinand IV., to the supreme council of finance. He returned to
                    Naples, and from that time was wholly engrossed with the important business of
                    this office. His health, already injured, was soon completely broken by severe
                    and active application; and several domestic misfortunes operating upon a mind
                    of deep sensibility, at last threw him into a state of melancholy. He finally
                    retired from all business into the country, where he soon afterwards became
                    seriously ill, and on the 21st of July 1788 he expired. Before his death he had
                    finished the eighth volume of his work, containing the first part of the fifth
                    book, in which he treats of the different systems of religion that preceded
                    Christianity. Of the second part of the same book he had only made a rude
                    sketch, in which were noted down the principal subjects of discussion; namely,
                    the advantages of Christianity and the dangers of superstition; the
                    inconveniences of mixing spiritual with temporal concerns; the excessive riches
                    of the clergy, and the immense increase of their power. He was also to examine
                    the foundation of ecclesiastical rights, and to present, in a new system of
                    legislation, a remedy for the abuses which he pointed out. A chapter on
                    toleration would have terminated this book. In his sixth book he proposed to
                    treat of the laws relative to property; and in his seventh and last, of the
                    nature of the paternal power and the government of families. He had also other
                    important works in contemplation when his course was terminated by death. This
                    eminent person, besides some of the rarest gifts of genius, was endowed by
                    nature with the additional advantage of a most imposing presence. His manners
                    were eminently graceful and dignified. His countenance bore the traces of
                    habitual reflection, and of deep sensibility, mingled with an expression of soft
                    melancholy. In private life nothing could exceed the simplicity of his
                    character, except the animation and interest of his conversation. See <hi rend="italic">La Seienza della Legislazione,</hi> Livorno, 1807, 5 tomes 8vo.
                    This is the last Italian edition of Filangieri’s great work. There is a French
                    translation in 7 vols. 8vo, published at Paris in 1798, from the Neapolitan
                    edition of 1784. The first two books have been translated into English, under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">The Science of Legislation,</hi> from the Italian
                    of Filangieri, and published in 2 vols. 8vo, Lond. 1806.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
