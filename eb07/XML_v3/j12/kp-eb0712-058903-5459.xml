                    into a desert, where he lived on locusts and wild honey; and about the year 29
                    began to preach repentance, and to declare the coming of the Messiah. He
                    baptized his disciples, and the following year Christ himself was baptized by
                    him in the river Jordan. Some time afterwards, having reproved Herod Antipas,
                    who carried on a criminal correspondence with Herodias, his brother Philip’s
                    wife, he was cast into prison, where he was beheaded. His head was brought to
                    Herodias, who, according to St Jerome, to revenge herself after his death for
                    the freedom of his reproofs, pierced his tongue with the bodkin with which she
                    used to fasten her hair.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">John,</hi><hi rend="italic">St,</hi> the Apostle or
                    Evangelist, was the brother of St James the Great, and the son of Zebedee. He
                    quitted the business of fishing to follow Jesus, and became his beloved
                    disciple. He was witness to the actions and miracles of his Master, was present
                    at his transfiguration on Mount Tabor, and attended him in the garden of olives.
                    He was the only apostle who followed him to the. cross, and to him Jesus left
                    the care of his mother. He was also the first apostle who knew him again after
                    his resurrection. He preached the faith in Asia, and principally resided at
                    Ephesus, where he maintained the mother of our Lord. He is believed to have
                    founded the churches of Smyrna, Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and
                    Laodicea. He is also said to have preached the gospel amongst the Par-thanis,
                    and to have addressed his first epistle to that people. It is related that, when
                    he was at Rome, the Emperor Domitian caused him to be thrown into a caldron of
                    boiling oil, but that he came out unhurt; upon which he was banished to the isle
                    of Patmos, where he wrote his Apocalypse. After the death of Domitian he
                    returned to Ephesus, where he composed his Gospel, about the year^ 96; and died
                    there, in the reign of Trajan, about the year 100, at the age of 94.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Gospel of St</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> John,</hi> a
                    canonical book of the New Testament, containing a recital of the life, actions,
                    doctrine, and death, of our Saviour Jesus Christ, written by St John the apostle
                    and evangelist. At the desire of the Christians of Asia, St John wrote his
                    Gospel at Ephesus, after his return from the isle of Patmos. St Jerome says he
                    would not undertake it, except upon condition that they should appoint a public
                    fast to implore the assistance of God; and that, the fast being ended, St John,
                    filled with the Holy Ghost, broke out into the words, “In the beginning was the
                    Word,” &amp;c. The ancients assign two reasons for this undertaking. The first
                    is, because, in the other three Gospels, there was wanting the history of the
                    beginning of Jesus Christ’s preaching till the imprisonment of John the Baptist,
                    which therefore he applied himself particularly to relate. The second is, that
                    it was written in order to remove the errors of the Cerinthians, Ebionites, and
                    other sects. But Mr Lampe and Dr Lardner have urged several reasons to show that
                    St John in his Gospel did not write against Cerinthus, or any other heretic.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Revelation of St</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> John.</hi>

                    bishop of Chartres, in France, was born at Salisbury, in Wiltshire, in the
                    beginning of the twelfth century. Where he received the rudiments of his
                    education is unknown; but we learn, that in the year 1136, being then a youth,
                    he was sent to Paris, where he studied under several eminent professors, and
                    acquired considerable reputation for his application and proficiency in
                    rhetoric, poetry, divinity, and particularly in the learned languages. From
                    Paris he travelled into Italy; and, during his residence at Rome, he rose into
                    high favour with Pope Eugenius III. and his successor Adrian IV. After his
                    return to England, he became the intimate friend and companion of the renowned
                    Thomas-a-Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, whom he attended in his exile; and he
                    is said to have been present when that haughty prelate was murdered in his
                    cathedral. What preferment he obtained in the church during this time does not
                    appear; but in 1176 he was promoted by King Henry II. to the bishopric of
                    Chartres in France, where he died in 1182. This John of Salisbury was one of the
                    first restorers of the Greek and Latin languages in Europe, a classical scholar,
                    a philosopher, a learned divine, and an elegant Latin poet. He wrote several
                    books, the principal of which are, his Life of St Thomas of Canterbury, a
                    collection of Letters, and Polycratico.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Pope</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> John</hi><hi rend="italic">XII.</hi> a native of Cahore, originally called James d’Euse, was

                    Clement V. on the 7th of August 1316. He published the constitutions called <hi rend="italic">Clementine,</hi> which were framed by his predecessor; and drew up
                    the other constitutions called <hi rend="italic">Extravagantes.</hi> When Louis

                    Avignon, where he begged pardon of the pope with a rope about his neck, and died
                    in prison some <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945472" xml:id="kp-eb0712-5472-0590"/>years afterwards. Under this pope arose the
                    celebrated question among the Cordeliers, called “the bread of the Cordeliers ;”
                    which was, whether those monks had the property of the things given them, at the
                    time they were making use of them; that is, whether the bread belonged to them
                    when they were eating it, or to the pope, or to the Roman church. This frivolous
                    dispute gave great employment to the pope, as also did those which turned upon
                    the colour, form, and stuff, of their habits, whether they ought to be white,
                    gray, or black; whether the cowl ought to be pointed or round, large or small;
                    whether their robes should be full, short, or long; of cloth, or of serge. The
                    disputes on these minute trifles were carried so far between the minor brothers,
                    that some of them were burned upon the occasion. Pope John died at Avignon in
                    1334, aged ninety.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> John</hi><hi rend="italic">of Eordιm. See</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Fordun.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> John</hi><hi rend="italic">of Gaunt,</hi> duke of Lancaster, a renowned general, father of
