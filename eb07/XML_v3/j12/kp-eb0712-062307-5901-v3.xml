                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">JUBA</label>, king of Numidia, who succeeded to the throne on
                    the death of his brother Hiempsal, about <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 50. In
                    the war between Caesar and Pompey, we find Juba espousing the cause of the
                    latter, and proceeding to the assistance of Varus, who was besieged in Utica by
                    Curio. He gained a victory over Curio; and when many of the partisans of Caesar
                    had surrendered to Varus, on condition of their lives being preserved, Juba,
                    disregarding the promise made to them, put thegreater parttodeath. (Caes.Zte <hi
                    rend="italic">Bello</hi><hi rend="italic">Civili,</hi> ii. 26, 42.) After the
                    battle of Pharsalia, Caesar proceeded into Africa to crush the remains of
                    Pompey’s party; but Juba, thinking this a favourable opportunity of destroying
                    the troops of his opponent, collected a large army. He was soon, however,
                    obliged to retire to the protection of his dominions, which were threatened by
                    Sittius, the chief <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a band of banditti. Appointing
                    Sabura to the command of the troops against Sittius, he proceeded to rejoin
                    Scipio at the head of a numerous army. The pride of Juba could not tolerate that
                    Scipio should wear a purple cloak like his own, and Scipio did not think proper
                    to offend his powerful ally on such a trivial point. A battle was fought, in
                    which Caesar defeated the allied army; and the Numidian prince fled to his own
                    dominions, where he found Sabura had been defeated by Sittius. He wished to shut
                    himself up inZama; but the inhabitants gained by Caesar having shut the gates of
                    their city, Juba caused himself to be put to death <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.
                    c.</hi> 46) by Petreius, one of his companions in misfortune (Liv. <hi
                    rend="italic">Epit.</hi> 114; Flor. iv. 2), or by a slave (Caes. <hi
                    rend="italic">Afr.</hi> 94). Caesar reduced the kingdom of Juba into the form of
                    a province, and the historian Sallust was the first governor. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Afr.</hi> 97.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Juba</hi> IE, the son of the former, was carried to Rome by
                    Julius Caesar on the defeat and death of his father, and formed one of the
                    principal ornaments of the triumph which Caesar enjoyed. At Rome the young
                    prince received the benefit of an excellent education; and being naturally of an
                    intelligent and thoughtful disposition, he soon equalled in learning and
                    knowledge the wisest philosophers of Greece and Rome. (Plut. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caes. 55.)</hi> Augustus became attached to him from his excellent qualities,
                    and gave him in marriage Selene, or Cleopatra, the daughter of Antony and
                    Cleopatra. <hi rend="italic">(Anton.</hi> 87 ) He was restored to the kingdom of
                    his father by Augustus, and some parts of Gaetulia were added to it. The
                    Gaetulians, unwilling to acknowledge themselves tributary to a prince imposed
                    upon them by the Romans, made incursions into his territory, which he was unable
                    to repel until he received assistance from Augustus. (Dion Cass. li. liii.) He
                    was more fortunate in peace than in war, and made himself so much beloved by his
                    subjects, that they placed him in the number of their gods, and erected statues
                    to his honour. Pliny states, that the profound knowledge of Juba made him more
                    illustrious than even his crown. He wrote many historical works of great value:
                    the Antiquities of Assyria <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945914"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-5914-0624"/>and of Rome; a History of Arabia, which he
                    dedicated to the young Caius Caesar; a History of Painting and of Painters; a
                    History of Theatres, many fragments of which still remain; on the Nature and
                    Qualities of different Animals; a Treatise on the Plant Euphorbia; and an Essay
                    on the source of the Nile.</p>
