                <p><label type="entry">JUPITER</label>, the supreme god of the ancient Pagans. The
                    theologists, according to Cicero, reckoned three Jupiters, the first and second
                    of whom were born in Arcadia; and of these two, the one sprang from Aether, and
                    the other from Coelus. The third Jupiter was the son of Saturn, and born in
                    Crete, where they pretended to show his sepulchre. Cicero in other places speaks
                    of several Jupiters, who reigned in different countries. The Jupiter by whom the
                    poets and mythologists understand the supreme god, was the son of Saturn, king
                    of Crete. He would have been devoured by his father as soon as born, had not his
                    mother Rhea substituted a stone instead of the child, which Saturn immediately
                    swallowed. Saturn took this method to destroy all his male children, because it
                    had been foretold by Coelus and Terra that one of his sons would deprive him of
                    his kingdom. Jupiter, being thus saved from his father’s jaws, was brought up by
                    the Curetes in a den on Mount Ida. Virgil tells us that he was fed by the bees;
                    and, out of gratitude for this service, he changed them from an iron ιo a golden
                    colour. Some say that his nurses were Amalthaea and Melissa, who gave him goat’s
                    milk and honey; and others, that Amalthaea was the name of the goat which
                    nourished him, and which, as a reward for her great services, was changed into a
                    constellation. According to others, he was fed by wild pigeons, which brought
                    him ambrosia from Oceanus; and by an eagle, which carried nectar in his beak
                    from a steep rock; services for which he rewarded the former, by making them the
                    foretellers of winter and summer; and the latter, by giving him immortality, and
                    making him his thunderbearer. When grown up, he drove his father out of heaven,
                    and divided the empire of the world with his brothers. For himself, he reserved
                    heaven and earth; Neptune had allotted to him the sea and waters; and Pluto the
                    infernal regions. The Titans undertook to destroy Jupiter, as he had done his
                    father. These Titans were giants, the sons of Titan and the Earth. They declared
                    war against Jupiter, and heaped mountains upon mountains in order to escalade
                    heaven; but their efforts were unsuccessful, Jupiter overthrew them with his
                    thunder, and shut them up under the waters and mountains, from which they were
                    not able to escape. Jupiter had several wives. The first of these, named Metis,
                    he is said to have destroyed in a most extraordinary manner. His second was
                    Themis; the name of his third is not known; but his fourth was the celebrated
                    Juno, whom he deceived under the form of a cuckoo, which, to shun the violence
                    of a storm, fled for shelter to her lap. He was the father of the Muses and
                    Graces, and had a prodigious number of children by his mistresses. He
                    metamorphosed himself into a satyr to enjoy Antiope; into a bull, to carry off
                    Europa; into a swan, to abuse Leda; into a shower of gold, to corrupt Danae; and
                    into several other forms to gratify his passions. He had Bacchus by Semele,
                    Diana and Apollo by Latona, and was the father of Mercury and the other gods.
                    The heathens in general believed that there was but one supreme God; but when
                    they considered this one great being as influencing the affairs of the world,
                    they gave him as many different names; and hence proceeded their variety of
                    nominal gods. When he thundered or lightened, they called him <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192946031" xml:id="kp-eb0712-6031-0633"/>Jupiter; when he calmed the
                    sea, Neptune; when he guided their councils, Minerva; and when he gave them
                    strength in battle, Mars. In process of time they used different representations
                    of this Jupiter, and considered them, vulgarly at least, as so many different
                    persons. They afterwards regarded each of them in different views; thus, the
                    Jupiter who showered down blessings was called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kind</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the Jupiter who punished, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Terrible.</hi> There was also one Jupiter for Europe, and another
                    for Africa. In Europe, there was one great Jupiter who was the particular friend
                    of the Athenians, and another who was the special protector of the Romans; nay,
                    there was scarcely a town or hamlet perhaps in Italy that had not a Jupiter of
                    its own; but the Jupiter of Terracina, or Jupiter Anxur, represented in medals
                    as young and beardless, with rays round his head, resembled Apollo more than the
                    great Jupiter of the Capitol. In this way Jupiter at length had different
                    temples and different characters almost everywhere. At Carthage, he was called
                    Ammon; in Egypt, Serapis; at Athens, the Olympian Jupiter; and at Rome, the
                    Capitoline Jupiter, who was the guardian and benefactor of the Romans, and whom
                    they called the best and greatest, <hi rend="italic">Jupiter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">optimus maximus.</hi> The figure of this Jupiter was represented,
                    in his chief temple on the Capitoline Hill, as sitting on a curule chair, with
                    the <hi rend="italic">fulmen</hi> or lightning in one hand, and a sceptre in the
                    other. This <hi rend="italic">fulmen,</hi> in the figures of the old artists,
                    was always adapted to the character under which they required to represent
                    Jupiter. If his appearance was to be mild and calm, they gave him the comic <hi
                    rend="italic">fulmen,</hi> or bundle of flames wreathed close together, held
                    down in his hand; when punishing, he held up the same figure, with two
                    transverse darts of lightning, sometimes with wings added to each side of it to
                    denote its swiftness (this was called by the poets the three-forked bolt of
                    Jove); and when he was going to do some exemplary execution, they put in his
                    hand a handful of flames, all let loose in their utmost fury, and sometimes
                    filling both his hands with flames. The superiority of Jupiter was principally
                    manifested in that air of majesty which the ancient artists endeavoured to
                    express in his countenance; particular attention being paid to the head of hair,
                    the eyebrows, and the beard. There are, on ancient seals, several heads of the
                    mild Jupiter; where his face has a mixture of dignity and ease in it, admirably
                    described by Virgil <hi rend="italic">(Aen.</hi> i. ver. 256). The statues of
                    the Terrible Jupiter were generally of black marble, as those of the former were
                    of white; the one sitting with an air of tranquillity, the other standing, more
                    or less disturbed. The face of the one is pacific and serene, of the other angry
                    or clouded. On the head of the one the hair is regular and composed; in the
                    other it is so dishevelled that it falls half way down the forehead. The face of
                    the Jupiter Tonans resembles that of the Terrible Jupiter; he is represented on
                    gems and medals as holding up the triple bolt in his right hand, and standing in
                    a chariot which seems to be whirled on impetuously by four horses. Thus he is
                    also described by the poets (Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Deian. Here.</hi> v. 28;
                    Horace, lib. i. od. 4, V. 8). Jupiter, as the intelligence presiding over a
                    single planet, is represented only in a chariot and pair; upon all other
                    occasions, if represented in a chariot, he is always drawn by four horses.
                    Jupiter is well known as the chief ruler of the air, whose particular province
                    it was to direct the rains, the thunders, and the lightnings. As the dispenser
                    of rain, he was called <hi rend="italic">Jupiter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pluvius,</hi> under which character he is exhibited seated in the clouds,
                    holding up his right hand, or extending his arms almost in a straight line each
                    way, and pouring a stream of hail and rain from his right hand upon the earth,
                    whilst the <hi rend="italic">fulmen</hi> is held down in his left. The wings
                    that are given to him relate to his character of presiding over the air; his
                    hair and beard in the Antonine pillar are all spread down by the rain, which
                    descends in a sheet from him, and falls for the refreshment of the Romans;
                    whilst their enemies are represented as struck with the lightnings, and lying
                    dead at their feet.</p>
                <p>Some are of opinion that the fable of Jupiter includes a great part of the
                    history of Noah and his three sons, and that Saturn is Noah, who saw all mankind
                    perish in the waters of the deluge, and who, in some sort, swallowed them up, by
                    not receiving them into the ark. Jupiter is Ham; Neptune, Japheth; and Shem,
                    Pluto. The Titans, it is thought, represent the old giants, who built the tower
                    of Babel, and whose pride and presumption God had confounded, by changing their
                    language, and pouring out the spirit of discord and division amongst them. The
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Jupiter,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Zeus,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Jovis</hi><hi rend="italic">Pater,</hi> is thought to be derived
                    from Jehovah; and in medals we meet with <hi rend="italic">Jovis</hi> in the
                    nominative as well as oblique cases, thus, <hi rend="italic">Jovis custos, Jovis
                    propugnator, Jovis stator.</hi> To the name <hi rend="italic">Jovis</hi> was
                    added <hi rend="italic">pater -,</hi> and afterwards, instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">Zeus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Jovis Pater,</hi> they used <hi
                    rend="italic">Jupiter</hi> by abbreviation.</p>
                <p>The name of Jupiter was not known to the Hebrews till the reign of Alexander the
                    Great, and the kings his successors. Antiochus Epiphanes commanded the idol of
                    Jupiter Olympius to be placed in the temple at Jerusalem; and that of Jupiter
                    the defender of strangers in the temple on Mount Gerizim (2 Macc. vi. 2). Whilst
                    St Paul and St Barnabas were at Lystra, they were taken for gods, because they
                    cured one who had been lame from his birth, and that by an expression only; St
                    Paul was taken for Mercury, by reason of his eloquence, and St Barnabas for
                    Jupiter (Acts, xiv. 11, 12), on account of his goodly mien.</p>
