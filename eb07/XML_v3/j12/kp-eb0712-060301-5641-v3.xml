                <p><label type="entry">JOHNSTONE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, is a
                    Scotish historian of considerable reputation, but his personal history is very
                    imperfectly known. We are however informed that he was the son of an honest
                    burgess of Edinburgh, and that he was educated in the university of his native
                    city.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Crawford’s History
                    of the University of Edinburgh, p. 140.</p></note> He took the degree of A. Μ.
                    in the year 1587. His father may perhaps have been a native of Annandale, where
                    Johnstone is still a prevalent name. The son bequeathed legacies to some of his
                    cousins in Annandale, L.500 sterling in trust to Lord Johnstone for building a
                    bridge over the river Annan, and L.1000 in trust to the same nobleman for the
                    maintenance of a grammar school at Moffat. Whether he prosecuted his studies in
                    some foreign university, and there took his degree of LL. D., we are not
                    informed. He appears to have fixed his residence in London, and to have
                    inherited or acquired a considerable fortune. Dempster, to whom we are indebted
                    for many scattered notices of Scotish writers, has stated that he was
                    particularly esteemed by Lord Bruce of Kinloss, and, although not a courtier,
                    that he was acceptable to King James.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of the prerogative court of Canterbury, has lately been printed, and reflects
                    some additional light upon his history.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of St Anne, Blackffy-ers, London, Esquire.” The codicil is dated on the 12th of
                    October 1639, and probate was granted to one of his executors six days
                    afterwards; so that the testator must have died in that interval. The greatest
                    part of his property he bequeathed to charitable and benevolent purposes. It is
                    however to be suspected that his laudable intentions were in some cases
                    frustrated: the bridge was never built over the Annan, nor did Moffat school
                    derive much benefit from his legacy. He had been appointed one of the executors
                    of George Heriot; and he bequeathed L.1100 to the hospital. He bequeathed L.1000
                    “towards the maintenance of eight poor scholars” in the university of Edinburgh.
                    The destination of his library is thus expressed: “As for my books, l’do appoint
                    the books of humanity, Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, and Lexico Graecum, to be sent
                    unto Moffat in Annandale, when the aforesaid school is ereckted, with the Latin
                    poets and commentaries: as for the Italian, French, and Spanish books, 1 would
                    have them changed for books of philosophy, to be sent unto the College of
                    Edinburgh: for my civil law books, and books of <pb break="no"

                    said College of Edinburgh; and my English books I give unto my said servant
                    Hendry Heron.”</p>
                <p>Dr Johnstone had prepared a history of his own time; and the earliest part of it,
                    consisting of two books, appeared under the title of “Historiarum libri duo,
                    continentes Rerum Britannicarum vicinarumque Regionum Historias maxime
                    memorabiles. Sunt praeter hos adhuc xx. libri, qui typographe nondum in manus
                    venere.” Amst. 1642, 12mo. It contains the author’s dedication to King Charles,
                    and the subsequent epigram, “Ad Robertum Johnstonum Scoto-Britannum,” written by
                    John Owen:</p>
                <p>Ingenii, Johnstone, tui sum factus amator, Ilistoriae legerem dum monumenta
                    tuae.</p>
                <p>Nil magis ingenuum, nihil ingeniosius extat Tergeminae Britonum gentis in
                    historia:</p>
                <p>Excipias unum Morum de rege Ricardo, Nemo Britannorum dignior invidia.</p>
                <p>Such portions of the volume as relate to Scotish history were soon afterwards
                    translated into English: “The Historie of Scotland during the Minority of King
                    Iames: written in Latine by Robert Johnston: done into English by T. Μ.”<note

                    Thomas Middleton, author of the Appendix to Spotswood’s History. The identity of
                    the historian and of the individual who died in 1639, is established by the
                    testimony of the translator, who mentions his author’s bequest to the university
                    of Edinburgh. He has however magnified the eight exhibitions into eight
                    fellowships. The entire history at length made its appearance in an ample
                    volume: “Historia Rerum Britannicarum, ut et multarum Galli carum, Belgicarum,
                    et Germanicarum, tam politicarum quam ecclesiasticarum, ab anno 1572 ad annum
                    1628.” Amst. 1655, fol. The editor, under the signature of J. S. has prefixed a
                    very brief notice, which contains an erroneous statement of the author having
                    himself published the first two books. Buchanan’s history, according to the
                    opinion of Nicoson, has been “continu’d in the same fine language” by
                    Johnstone;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nicoson’s
                    Scottish Historical Library, p 121.</p></note> and Lord Woodhouselee describes
                    this continuation as “a work of great merit, whether we consider the judicious
                    structure of the narrative, the sagacity of the reflections, the acute
                    discernment of characters, or the classical tincture of the style. In those
                    passages of his history where there is room for a display of eloquence, he is
                    often singularly happy in touching those characteristic circumstances which
                    present the picture strongly to the mind of the reader, without a vain parade of
                    tvords, or artificial refinement of sentiment.”<note anchored="true"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Johnstone,</hi> a modern and thriving village of Scotland,
                    in the county of Renfrew, at the distance of about three miles west from
                    Paisley. It owes its origin entirely to manufactures, as about forty years ago
                    only a few cottages stood where now is seen a town consisting of two large
                    squares, many considerable streets, and public works. It is regularly laid out,
                    there being one main street, which is crossed by others at right angles. The
                    houses are substantially built, and for the most part two stories high. There
                    are within the precincts of the place seventeen cotton mills of various extent,
                    and other three in the neighbourhood. There are also in the town two brass and
                    two extensive iron founderies; five machine manufactories, and a public
                    gas-work. Besides a chapel of ease belonging to the Scotch church, there is here
                    a United Secession and Relief church, a Universalist, and Methodist chapel. In
                    Johnstone are also a town school, a subscription library, two news-rooms, a
                    mechanics’ institution and library, and sundry benevolent and religious
                    societies. The Ardrossan Canal from Glasgow terminates in a basin at the east
                    end of the town. In its neighbourhood are four collieries, which are of great
                    advantage to a place to which coal is of essential importance. The population in
                    1811 amounted to 3647, and in 1818 to 5000.</p>
