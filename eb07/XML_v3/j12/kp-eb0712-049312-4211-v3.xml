                <p><label type="entry">JAEN</label>, an ancient kingdom of the south of Spain, now
                    forming one of the four portions into which the province of Andalusia is
                    divided. The extent of this province is 268 square leagues, and its population
                    amounts to 206,807 souls. La Mancha bounds it on the north, Cordova on the west,
                    and Granada on the east and south. It is surrounded on every side by lofty
                    mountains, which almost exclude it from intercourse with the surrounding
                    provinces. Its surface is a constant alternation of hills and valleys; and as
                    from the surrounding mountains innumerable rivulets issue, its lower levels of
                    land are abundantly irrigated, and therefore highly productive, whilst the
                    hills, from want of moisture, are barren, or yield little except some sheep
                    pasture in the winter season, when the merino flocks, driven from the north,
                    seek food in the southern provinces. It produces wheat and barley, but not
                    sufficient for its consumption. It has abundance of oil, and a full supply of
                    wine, and its fruits are exquisite and plentiful.</p>

                <p>The principal river is the Guadalquivir, which runs through the centre of the
                    province, and receives additions to its copious stream from the junction of the
                    Guadali-mar, the Jandula, the Jaen, and the Escobar. There are some mines of
                    lead in this province, in which sometimes considerable quantities of silver are
                    found. These mines were of some celebrity whilst the Romans governed Spain; and
                    though the silver has been less sought for since the discovery of the mines of
                    America, yet, for the sake of the lead, they are now carried on by the
                    government, and furnish sheet lead, shot, and musket balls, to the southern part
                    of the kingdom. The manufacture of earthen jars, called alcarrazas, for keeping
                    liquors in a cool state in the warmest weather, is the most considerable
                    production of Jaen that is sent out of the province; and they are much esteemed
                    in every part of Andalusia. The celebrated university of Alcala la Real, founded
                    by Cardinal Ximenes, still exists in this province, and is attended by a number
                    of students in divinity. The biblical scholar recognises it as having been the
                    scene of the labours of the editors of the Complutensian edition of the Old
                    Testament. In this province is the celebrated field, called the Plain of Tolosa,
                    on which, six centuries ago, the most sanguinary battle was fought that the
                    history of Spain has recorded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jaen,</hi> a city of Spain, capital of the ancient kingdom
                    of the same name, in latitude 37. 4S. and now forming one of the divisions of
                    Andalusia, is situated on the declivity of a mountain, between some lofty
                    sierras, in a fertile and productive country, which yields some wine and
                    abundance of oil, for which there are twenty-seven mills. It stands on the left
                    bank of a small river, now of the same name, but called by the Moors
                    Guadalbullon, which, after proceeding about six leagues beyond this city, falls
                    into the Guadalquivir below Mengibar. The city is deemed very healthy. The
                    situation being elevated about 1400 feet above the level of the sea, renders it
                    temperate; and the sierras which surround it, by the breezes that descend from
                    them, tend to refresh the air in the most sultry seasons. The inhabitants amount
                    to about 9000, who are not distinguished by their industry; and the only
                    manufactures that are carried on are those of leather and soap. It is a bishop’s
                    see; and the cathedral, of great antiquity, has no peculiar beauty to render it
                    deserving of notice.</p>
