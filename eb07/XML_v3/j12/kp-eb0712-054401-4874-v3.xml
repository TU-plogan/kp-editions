                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jerusalem,</hi> one of the most ancient and renowned cities
                    of which we have any account, formerly the capital of the Jewish empire, and now
                    that of modern Palestine. It is situated on unequal ground, on a range of high
                    hills, some few eminences of which overtop those on which the city stands, and
                    the adjacent country is remarkably rocky and barren. The city, which is
                    surrounded with a wall fifty feet in height, occupies an irregular square,
                    facing the four cardinal points, and is about two and a half miles in
                    circumference. I he eastern wall, which is not quite so longas the other sides,
                    runs straight along the brow of Mount Moriah, with the deep valley of
                    Jehoshaphat below. The southern side is extremely irregular, taking a zigzag
                    direction; the south-west extreme being terminated by a mosque built over the
                    supposed sepulchre of David, on the summit of Mount Zion. The southern wall is
                    quite straight and regular, and runs over slightly-declining ground. The side
                    facing the west is the longest of the whole. The wall appears to be a modern
                    work, all executed at the same time. It is flanked at irregular distances by
                    square towers, and is guarded by battlements all around, with loop-holes for
                    arrows or musketry. On the north the citv is bounded by a level and apparently
                    fertile space, covered with olive trees, particularly near the north-eastern
                    angle. On the south is seen the steep acclivity of Mount Zion, and the Valley of
                    Hinnom, on which are some cultivated spots and small garden enclosures. On the
                    west the sterile summits of the hills scarcely rise above the dwellings; whilst
                    eastward, the deep valley of Jehoshaphat, at the foot of the Mount of Olives,
                    though partially relieved by spots with trees, presents, in general, a
                    forbidding and barren appearance. The first aspect of Jerusalem has been
                    variously described by different writers, and the city appears to be seen to
                    more or less advantage according to the quarter from which it is approached. Dr
                    Clarke was impressed with its grandeur when he first obtained a distant prospect
                    of it. “Instead,” he observes, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    a wretched and ruined town, by some described as the desolated remnant of
                    Jerusalem, we beheld as it were a flourishing and stately metropolis, presenting
                    a magnificent assemblage of domes, towers, palaces, churches, and monasteries,
                    all of which, glittering in the sun’s rays, shone with inconceivable splendour.”
                    “I can now account,” says Chateaubriand, “for the surprise expressed by the
                    crusaders and pilgrims at <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944887"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4887-0545"/>the first sight of Jerusalem, according to the
                    reports of historians and travellers. I can affirm, that whoever has, like me,
                    had the patience to read nearly two hundred modern accounts of the Holy Land,
                    the rabbinical compilations, and the passages in the ancient writers, respecting
                    Judaea, still knows nothing at all about it. I paused with my eyes fixed on
                    Jerusalem, measuring the height of its walls, reviewing at once all the
                    recollections of history from the patriarch Abraham to Godfrey of Bouillon,
                    reflecting on the total change accomplished in the world by the mission of the
                    Son of Man, and in vain seeking that temple, not one stone of which is left upon
                    another. Were I to live a thousand years, never should I forget that desert,
                    which yet seems to be pervaded by the greatness of Jehovah, and the terrors of
                    death.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Clarke, however, observes that there is another point from which Jerusalem is
                    not seen to so much advantage; and accordingly Mr Browne, who approached it by
                    the road from Jaffa, observes, that the first aspect of Jerusalem did not
                    gratify his expectation; and Buckingham declares, that, independently of the
                    feelings and recollections which the approach to this city cannot fail to
                    awaken, its appearance disappointed his expectations, and “had certainly nothing
                    of grandeur or beauty, of stateliness or magnificence, about it. It appeared
                    like a walled town of the third or fourth class, having neither towers, nor
                    domes, nor minarets within it; but strong, large, flat-roofed buildings, of the
                    most unornamented kind, seated amid rugged hills, on a stony and forbidding
                    soil, with scarcely a picturesque object in the whole compass of the surrounding
                    view.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Travels through Palestine,</hi> p. 174.</p></note> In like manner Sir Frederick
                    Henniker asks, “Is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty and the
                    joy of the whole earth? The town, which appears to me not worth possession, even
                    without the trouble of conquest, is walled entirely round, is about a mile in
                    length and half a mile in width, so that its circumference may be estimated at
                    three miles. In three quarters of an hour I performed the circuit. It would be
                    difficult to conceive how it could ever have been larger than it now is; for,
                    independent of the ravines, the four outsides <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the city
                    are marked by the brook of Siloam, by a burial-place at either end, and by the
                    hill of Calvary; and the hill of Calvary is now within the town, so that it was
                    formerly smaller than it is at present. The best view of it is from the Mount
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Olives; it commands the exact shape, and nearly every
                    particular, namely, the church <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Holy Sepulchre, the
                    Armenian convent, the mosque of Omar, St Stephen’s Gate, the round topped
                    houses, and the barren vacancies of the city. The mosque of Omar is the St
                    Peter’s of Turkey. The building itself has a light pagoda appearance; the garden
                    in which it stands occupies a considerable part of the city, and, contrasted
                    with the surrounding desert, is beautiful; but it is forbidden ground, and Jew
                    or Christian entering within its precincts must, if discovered, forfeit either
                    his religion or his life.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    contradiction, which prevails in the accounts of different travellers respecting
                    Jerusalem, will be still further illustrated by Μ. de Lamartine’s description of
                    the exterior aspects of the holy city.</p>
                <p>“This city,” says he, “is not, as it has been represented, an unshapely and
                    confused mass of ruins and ashes, over which a few Arab cottages are thrown, or
                    a few Bedouin tents pitched; neither is it, like Athens, a chaos of dust and
                    crumbling walls, where the traveller seeks in vain the shadow of edifices, the
                    trace of streets, the phantom of a city; but it is a city shining in light and
                    colour, presenting nobly to view her intact and battlemented walls, her blue
                    mosque with its white colonnades, her thousand resplendent domes, from which the
                    rays of the autumnal sun are reflected in a dazzling vapour; the façades of her
                    houses, tinted by time and heat, of the yellow and golden hue of the edifices of
                    Paestum or of Rome; her old towers the guardians of her walls, to which neither
                    one stone, one loop-hole, nor one battlement is wanting; and, above all, amidst
                    that ocean of houses, that cloud of little domes which cover them, is a dark
                    elliptical dome, larger than the others, overlooked by another and a white one.
                    These are the churches of the Holy Sepulchre and of Calvary; from hence they are
                    confounded, and appear drowned in the immense labyrinth of domes, edifices, and
                    streets, which encompass them; and one finds it difficult to credit such a
                    situation for Calvary and the Sepulchre, which, according to the ideas we derive
                    from the gospel history, should be placed on a separate hill without the walls,
                    and not in the centre of Jerusalem. The city, confined on the side <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Mount Sion, has no doubt enlarged herself on the north, to
                    embrace within her circuit those two sites which make her shame and glory, that
                    of the murder of the just man, and the resurrection of the incarnate Deity.</p>
                <p>“Such is the city from the height of the Mount of Olives. She has no horizon
                    behind her to the west nor to the north. The line of her walls and her towers,
                    the points of her numerous minarets, the arches of her shining domes, stand out
                    in bold relief against the deep blue of an orient sky; and the town, thus
                    exhibited on its broad and elevated platform, seems again to shine in all the
                    antique splendour of its prophecies, or to be only waiting the word to rise in
                    dazzling glory from its seventeen successive ruins, and to be transformed into
                    that New Jerusalem which is to come out of the bosom of the desert radiant with
                    brightness.</p>
                <p>“The view is the most splendid that can be presented to the eye, of a city that
                    is no more; for she still seems to exist as one full of life and youth: but on
                    contemplating the scene with more attention, we feel that it is really no more
                    than a fair vision of the city of David and Solomon. No noise arises from her
                    squares and streets, no roads lead to her gates from the east or from the west,
                    from the north or from the south, except a few paths winding among the rocks, on
                    which you may meet only half-naked Arabs, some camel drivers from Damascus, or
                    women from Bethlehem or Jericho, carrying on their heads a basket of raisins
                    from Engaddi, or a cage of doves, to be sold on the morrow under the
                    trebinthnses beyond the city gates. No one passed in or out; no mendicant even
                    was seated against her curbstones; no sentinel showed himself at her threshold;
                    we saw, indeed, no living object, heard no living sound; we found the same void,
                    the same silence, at the entrance of a city containing 30,000 souls, during the
                    twelve hours of the day, as we should have expected before the gates of Pompeii
                    or Herculaneum.</p>
                <p>“We saw nothing pass the gate of Damascus, except four funeral processions,
                    silently winding their way along the walls to the Turkish cemetery; nor the gate
                    of Sion, while we were within view, except a poor Christian, who had died in the
                    morning of the plague, and was carried by four grave-diggers to the Grecian
                    burial-place. They passed close by us, stretched the infectious corpse upon the
                    ground, wrapped in its own garments, and in silence commenced digging its last
                    bed under our horses’ feet. The earth all around the city was freshly disturbed
                    by similar sepultures, which the plague multiplied daily; and the only sensible
                    noise outside the walls of Jerusalem was the monotonous plaints of the Turkish
                    women bewailing their dead. I know not whether the plague was the only cause of
                    the emptiness of the roads and the profound silence that reigned<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944900" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4900-0546"/> within and around Jerusalem,
                    but I think not; for the Turks and Arabs turn not away from the inflictions of
                    Omnipotence, which they are convinced may everywhere reach them, and that there
                    is no road by which to escape; a sublime idea, but which often leads to the most
                    fatal consequences.</p>
                <p>“To the left of the platform, the temple, and the walls of Jerusalem, the hill
                    which supports the city suddenly sinks, stretches itself, and descends in gentle
                    slopes, sometimes broken by terraces of falling stones. On its summit, at some
                    hundred paces from Jerusalem, stand a mosque, and a group of Turkish edifices,
                    not unlike a European hamlet, crowned with its church and steeple. This is Sion,
                    the palace, the tomb of David; the seat of his inspiration and of his joys, of
                    his life and his repose. A spot doubly sacred to me, who have so often felt my
                    heart touched and my thoughts rapt by the sweet singer of Israel,—the first poet
                    of sentiment,—the king of lyrics. Never have human fibres vibrated to harmonies
                    so deep, so penetrating, so solemn. Never has the imagination of poet been set
                    so high, never has its expression been so true. Never has the soul of man
                    expanded itself before man, and before God, in tones and sentiments so tender,
                    so sympathetic, and so heartfelt. All the most secret murmurs of the human heart
                    found their voice and their note on the lips and the harp of this minstrel. And
                    if we revert to the remote period when such chaunts were first echoed on the
                    earth; if we consider that at the same period the lyric poetry of the most
                    cultivated nations sang only of wine, love, war, and the victories of the muses,
                    or of the coursers at the Elcian games; we dwell with profound astonishment on
                    the mystic accents of the prophet king, who addresses God the Creator as friend
                    talks to friend; comprehends and adores His wonders, admires His judgments,
                    implores His mercies, and seems to be an anticipatory echo of the evangelic
                    poetry, repeating the mild accents of Christ before they had been heard. Prophet
                    or not, as he is contemplated by the philosopher or the Christian, neither of
                    them can deny the poet king an inspiration bestowed on no other man. Read Horace
                    or Pindar after a psalm! For my part I cannot.</p>
                <p>“I, the feeble poet of an age of silence and decay, had I domesticated at
                    Jerusalem, should have selected for my residence and abiding place precisely the
                    spot which David chose for his at Sion. Here is the most beautiful view in all
                    Judaea, Palestine, or Galilee. To the left lies Jerusalem with its temple and
                    its edifices, over which the eyes of the king or of the poet might rove at large
                    without his being seen from thence. Before him, fertile gardens, descending in
                    steep declivities, lead to the bed of that torrent, in the roar and foam of
                    which he delights. Lower down, the valley opens and extends itself; fig-trees,
                    pomegranates, and olives, overshadowing it. On one of these rocks, suspended
                    over the rolling tide; in one of these sonorous grottoes, refreshed by the
                    breeze and by the murmur of the waters; or at the foot of a trebinthus, ancestor
                    of that which shelters me; the divine poet doubtless awaited those inspirations
                    which he so melodiously poured forth. And why will they not here also visit me,
                    that I might recount in song the griefs of my heart, and of the hearts of all
                    men, in these days of perplexity, even as he sang of his hopes in an era of
                    youth and of faith? Song, alas, no longer survives in the heart of man, for
                    despair sings not. And until some new beam shall descend upon the obscurity of
                    our times, terrestrial lyres will remain mute, and mankind will pass in silence
                    from one abyss of doubt to another, having neither loved, nor prayed, nor
                    sang.</p>
                <p>“But to return to the palace of David. Here the eye rests upon the once verdant
                    and watered valley of Jehoshaphat; a large opening in the eastern hills conducts
                    it from steep to steep, from height to height, from undulation to undulation,
                    even to the bason of the Dead Sea, which, in the far distance, reflects the
                    evening sun-beams in its dull and heavy waters, giving, like the thick Venetian
                    crystal, an unpolished and leaden tint to the light which gleams upon it. This
                    sea is not, however, what the imagination may picture it, a petrified lake,
                    amidst a dull and colourless horizon. It resembles one of the most beautiful
                    lakes of Switzerland or Italy as it is seen from hence, reposing its tranquil
                    waters beneath the shadow of the lofty mountains of Arabia (which stretch like
                    the Alps as far as the eye can reach behind its waves), and amidst the
                    projecting, pyramidical, conical, unequal, jagged, and sparkling ridges of the
                    most distant mountains of Judaea. Such is the view from Sion. We will now
                    proceed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> There is another feature in the landscape of
                    Jerusalem, which I could wish to have indelibly engraven on my memory, although
                    I neither draw nor paint. It is the valley of Jehoshaphat. That valley,
                    celebrated in the traditions of three religions, in which Jews, Christians, and
                    Mahommedans unite to place the terrible arena of Supreme judgment. That valley
                    which has already witnessed on its confines the grandest scene of the
                    evangelical drama; the tears, the groans, and the death of Christ. That valley
                    which all the prophets have successively visited, sending forth a cry of
                    bitterness and horror, with which it seems still to vibrate. That valley through
                    which shall one day pour the awful sound of a torrent of souls about to present
                    themselves before their God for final judgment.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>What follows is part of an interior view of the holy city by the same gifted
                    writer, and it appears to us to be instinct with devout feeling and high
                    genius.</p>
                <p>•‘ Having walked down some other streets similar to those I have already
                    described, we found ourselves in a little square, open at the north to a point
                    of the heavens and to the Mount of Olives. A descent of a few steps to the left
                    brought us to an open court, in which <hi rend="italic">↑he</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">façade</hi> of the church of the Holy Sepulchre was displayed.
                    This church has been so often and so well described, that it is needless for me
                    to enter upon the subject anew. It forms, especially in its exterior, a vast and
                    beautiful monument of the Byzantine age; its architecture is severe, solemn,
                    grand, and rich, for the period in which it was built; and it is a temple worthy
                    of being erected, by the piety of man, over the tomb of the Son of Man. In
                    comparing this church with others which the same epoch produced, it will be
                    found superior to them all. St Sophia, much more colossal, is also much ruder in
                    its structure; outwardly it is but a mountain of stone, flanked by little hills
                    of stone. The Holy Sepulchre, on the contrary, presents an aerial and carved
                    cupola; its scientific and graceful figure, with its doors, its windows, its
                    capitals and cornices, displays, in addition to its massiveness, the
                    incalculable cost of that ingenious fret-work, by which stone seems converted
                    into lace, to render it worthy of a place in this monument erected to the
                    grandest of human conceptions; and it bears impressed, no less on its details
                    than on its aggregate effect, the idea to which it is dedicated. It is no
                    longer, indeed, that church of the Holy Sepulchre constructed by Saint Helena,
                    the mother of Constantine; the kings of Jerusalem successively retouched it, and
                    embellished it with architectural ornaments in that half western, half Moorish
                    style, of which the East furnished them both with the taste and with the models.
                    But, such as it now stands, the exterior, in its Byzantine mass, its Greek,
                    Gothic, and Arabesque decorations—even its fractures, the impress of time <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192944913" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4913-0547"/> and barbarism
                    upon its <hi rend="italic">façade—</hi> offers no revolting contrast to the
                    thoughts we bring to it, the thoughts it expresses. Its aspect excites no
                    painful perception of a grand idea inadequately represented; of an exalting
                    reminiscence profaned by the hand of man: on the contrary, the involuntary
                    feeling inspired by it equals what I expected; man has done his best. The
                    monument is not worthy of the tomb, but it is worthy of the human agents whose
                    wish has been to do honour to this illustrious sepulchre; and we enter the
                    vaulted and sombre vestibule of the nave under the influence of this first and
                    serious impression.</p>
                <p>“On the left of the entrance to the vestibule, which opens upon the same court as
                    the nave, in a large deeply-hollowed niche, the Turks, the present guardians of
                    the Holy Sepulchre, to whom belongs exclusively the privilege of opening or
                    closing it, have established their divan, which is covered with rich Aleppo
                    carpets; and there, when I passed, were squatted five or six venerable Turkish
                    figures, with long white beards, their coffee-cups and pipes placed before them
                    on the carpet. They saluted us with dignity and grace, and ordered one of the
                    superintendents to accompany us to all parts of the church. I saw no trace in
                    their countenances, their discourse, or their gestures, of the irreverence of
                    which they are accused. They do not enter the church, but content themselves
                    outside its doors, and address Christians with a seriousness and respect
                    becoming the place and the object of visiting it. Possessors, by the vicissitude
                    of war, of the sacred monument of the Christians, they do not destroy it and
                    cast its ashes to the winds; they preserve it, they maintain around it an order,
                    a police, a reverential silence, which the Christian communities, who contend
                    for it, are far from observing themselves. They watch over the preservation of a
                    relic common to all who bear the name of Christians, for the benefit of all,
                    that every communion may enjoy in its turn the worship which all would gladly
                    offer at the holy tomb. But for the Turks, that tomb, disputed by the Greeks,
                    the Catholics, and the innumerable ramifications of the Christian world, would
                    already have been a hundred times an object of strife between those rival and
                    hostile communities; would have passed alternately into the exclusive possession
                    of either party, and have been interdicted doubtless by each, during their hour
                    of triumph, to all professors of the common faith who come not within their own
                    pale. I see no justice in the calumnies heaped upon the Turks; the pretended
                    brutal intolerance with which they are charged was manifested to my observation
                    only in respect for what other men venerate and adore. Wherever a Mussulman secs
                    the image of God in the opinions of his fellow-creatures, he bows down and he
                    respects, persuaded that the intention sanctifies the form. They are the only
                    tolerant people. Let Christians examine themselves, and ask in sincerity how
                    they would have acted if the fortune of war had placed Mecca and Kaaba in their
                    hands. Would the Turks then resort thither from all parts of Europe and of Asia,
                    to revere, in peace, the carefully preserved monuments of Islamism?</p>
                <p>“At the end of the vestibule we stood under the large cupola of the church, the
                    centre of which, deemed by local tradition the centre of the earth, is occupied
                    by a small monument enclosed within a larger, as a precious stone is enchased in
                    other minerals. It is an oblong square, adorned with pilasters, a cornice, and a
                    cupola, all of marble; the whole of a laboured and eccentric design, and
                    executed in bad taste. It was rebuilt in 1817, by an European architect, at the
                    expense of the Greek church, now in possession of it. All around this interior
                    pavilion of the sepulchre extends the space of the external cupola, within which
                    we walk freely, and find in the intervals between the piers chapels of great
                    depth, each assigned to one of the mysteries of Christ’s passion, and all
                    containing some testimonies, real or supposed, of the scenes of the
                    redemption.</p>
                <p>That part of the church which is not under the cupola is divided from it by a
                    partition of painted wood, hung with pictures of the Greek school, and is
                    exclusively reserved for the schismatic Greeks. In spite of the singular
                    profusion of bad paintings and ornaments of every description, with which the
                    walls and altars are overloaded, the general effect is solemn and religious,
                    conveying the assurance that prayer under every form has taken possession of
                    this sanctuary, and that pious zeal has accumulated within it every object which
                    generations of superstitious but sincere worshippers have deemed precious in the
                    sight of God. From hence a flight of steps, cut in the rock, conducts to the
                    summit of Calvary, where the three crosses were posted; so that Calvary, the
                    tomb, and several other sites of the drama of redemption, are united under the
                    roof of a single edifice of moderate dimensions; a circumstance that appears but
                    ill to accord with the gospel histories. We are not prepared by them to find the
                    tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, which was cut in the rock, outside the walls of
                    Sion, fifty paces from Calvary, the scene of executions, and enclosed within the
                    circumference of the modern walls; but such is tradition, and it has prevailed.
                    The mind cannot dispute over a scene like this the difference of a few paces
                    between historical probability and tradition. Whether it were here or there, it
                    is certain the events occurred at no great distance from the points marked out.
                    After a few moments of deep and silent meditation devoted in each of these
                    sacred spots to the remembrances awakened, we re-descended to the body of the
                    church, and penetrated within the interior monument, which serves as a sort of
                    stone curtain or envelope to the sepulchre itself. This is divided into two
                    small sanctuaries; the first containing the stone on which the angels were
                    seated when they answered the holy women, “<hi rend="italic">He is not here, he
                    is risen</hi> the second and last sanctuary enclosing the sepulchre itself, but
                    covered with a sort of sarcophagus of white marble, which surrounds and entirely
                    conceals from the eye the actual substance of the primitive rock in which the
                    sepulchre was cut. This sacred chapel is lighted by lamps of gold and silver,
                    perpetually maintained; and perfumed incense is burnt there night and day,
                    warming and embalming the air. We suffered none of the temple officials to
                    penetrate it with us, but entered one by one, separated by a curtain of crimson
                    silk from the first sanctuary; we chose that no witness should disturb the
                    solemnity of the place, and the privacy of the Impressions each might experience
                    according to his individual notions, and the measure and nature of his faith in
                    the great event which the tomb commemorates. We staid each about a quarter of an
                    hour, and none of us left it with dry eyes. Whatever form religious sentiments
                    may have assumed in the soul of man; whether influenced by private meditation,
                    by the study of history, by years, or the vicissitudes of the heart and mind;
                    whether he have retained Christianity in its literal interpretation, and in the
                    doctrines imbibed from his parents, or is only a philosophical and spiritual
                    Christian; whether Christ be to him a crucified God, or no more than a holy man
                    deified by virtue, inspired by supreme truth, and dying to bear testimony to his
                    father; whether Jesus be in his eyes the Son of God or the Son of Man, divinity
                    incarnate or humanity deified; Christianity is still the religion of his memory,
                    of his heart, and of his imagination; and will not have so wholly evaporated
                    before the winds of time and life as that the soul on which it was shed shall
                    preserve no vestige of its primitive odour, or that its fading impressions can
                    resist the revivifying and awfully affecting influence of its birth-place, and
                    of the visible monuments of its earliest profession. To the Christian or to the
                    philosopher, to the moralist or to the historian, this tomb is the boundary of
                    two worlds, the ancient and the modern. From this point issued a truth that has
                    renewed the universe; a <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944926"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4926-0548"/>civilization that has transformed all things; a
                    word which has echoed over the whole globe. This tomb is the sepulchre of the
                    old world, the cradle of the new; never was earthly stone the foundation of so
                    vast an edifice; never was tomb so prolific; never did doctrine, inhumed for
                    three days or three centuries, so victoriously rend the rock which man had
                    sealed over it, and give the lie to death by so transcendent, so perpetual a
                    resurrection.</p>
                <p>“In my turn, and the last, I entered the Holy Sepulchre, my mind filled with
                    these stupendous reflections, my heart touched by impressions yet more sacred,
                    which remain a mystery between man and his soul, between the reasoning insect
                    and his Creator. Such impressions admit not of words; they exhale with the smoke
                    of the holy lamps, with the perfume of the censers, with the vague and confused
                    murmur of sighs; they fall with those tears that spring to the eyes from
                    remembrance of the first names we have lisped in infancy—of the father and the
                    mother who inculcated them—of the brothers, the sisters, the friends with whom
                    we have whispered them. All the pious emotions which have affected our souls in
                    every period of life; all the prayers that have been breathed from our hearts
                    and our lips in the name of him who taught us to pray to his Father and to ours;
                    all the joys and griefs of which those prayers were the interpreters; are
                    awakened in the depths of the soul, and produce, by their echoes, by their very
                    confusion, a bewildering of the understanding, and a melting of the heart, which
                    seek not language, but transpire in moistened eyes, a heaving breast, a
                    prostrate forehead, and lips glued in silence to the sepulchral stone. Long did
                    I remain in this posture, supplicating the Father of heaven, in that very spot
                    from whence the most pathetic and comprehensive of prayers ascended for the
                    first time to his throne; praying for my father here below, for my mother in
                    another world, for all those who live or are no more, but our invisible link
                    with whom is never dissolved: the communion of love always exists: the names of
                    all the beings I have known and loved, or by whom I have been beloved, passed my
                    lips on the stones of the Holy Sepulchre. I prayed last for myself, but ardently
                    and devoutly. Before the tomb of him who brought the greatest portion of truth
                    into the world, and died with the greatest self-devotion for that truth of which
                    God has made him the word, I prayed for truth and courage. Never can I forget
                    the words which I murmured in that hour, so critical to my moral life. Perhaps
                    my prayer was heard; a bright ray of reason and conviction diffused itself
                    through my understanding, giving me more clearly to distinguish light from
                    darkness, error from truth. There are moments in the life of man, in which his
                    thoughts, long fluctuating like the waves of a bottomless sea in vague
                    uncertainty, touch at length upon a shore against which they break, and roll
                    back upon themselves with new forms, and a current contrary to that which has
                    hitherto impelled them. Was such a moment then mine? He who sounds all thoughts
                    knows, and the time will perhaps come when I shall comprehend it. It was a
                    mystery in my life which will hereafter be made plain.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The ancient city of Jerusalem, with the splendid structures by which it was
                    adorned during the brilliant period of the Jewish empire, has entirely
                    disappeared in the course of successive conquests; and although many ancient
                    monuments, the scenes of Scripture history, are shown to travellers, it is
                    certain that no traces remain of Jerusalem excepting the surrounding scenery,
                    those natural features which triumph alike over time and the rage of war. One of
                    the. most splendid edifices in the modern city is the mosque of Omar already
                    alluded to, which is said to stand on the site of Solomon’s temple. It was
                    erected in the seventh century, by the caliph whose name it bears. It is an
                    octagonal building, with numerous windows, surmounted by a dome in form
                    resembling that of St Paul’s in London, and about half the size. It is by far
                    the most splendid and richest monument of architectural art in Jerusalem, or,
                    according to Dr Clarke, in the Turkish empire, and, “considered externally,” he
                    adds, “far superior to the mosque of St Sophia in Constantinople. It has an
                    imposing effect when seen from a distance, from the commanding situation which
                    it occupies; and it relieves in a great degree the dull, monotonous aspect of
                    the other streets and buildings.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    round window of coloured glass in each of its sides; and is surmounted by a
                    dome, formerly of gilded copper, but now of lead.<note anchored="true"

                    “The lofty Saracenic pomp,” says Dr Clarke, “so nobly displayed in the style of
                    the building, its numerous arcades, its capacious dome, with all the stately
                    decorations of the place; its extensive area paved and variegated with the
                    choicest marbles, the extreme neatness observed in every avenue towards it; and,
                    lastly, the sumptuous costume observable in the dresses of all the eastern
                    devotees, passing to and from the sanctuary, make it altogether one of the
                    finest sights the Mahommedans have to boast.”<note anchored="true"

                    allowed to Christians, under pain of death; and when Dr Clarke urged his
                    attendant to permit his entrance, he replied that his life would be the price of
                    his compliance. In earlier times, however, when Jerusalem was in possession of
                    the Crusaders, the interior of the mosque was visited by Europeans, who have
                    described its architecture and decorations. It is entered by four large gates,
                    richly ornamented, facing the four cardinal points’, with six columns of marble
                    and porphyry. The interior is of white marble, and the pavement inlaid with
                    marble of different colours. Thirty-two columns of gray marble, in two rows,
                    support the arched roof and the dome; around these columns are chandeliers
                    gilded or of bronze, on which are seven thousand lamps which burn from Thursday
                    at sun-set to Friday at mid-day, and constantly during the feast of Ramadan. The
                    church of the Holy Sepulchre is another of the remarkable monuments of
                    Jerusalem. It is said to be the scene of the crucifixion, entombment, and
                    resurrection of our Saviour, though no evidence appears to identify the spot.
                    Buckingham, who visited it in 1816, mentions that it was burned down in the year
                    1806, and has since been rebuilt in a style of architecture and decoration
                    greatly inferior to the original. The general plan of the whole building,
                    however, says Buckingham, and the arrangement of the holy station which it
                    contains, are so exactly preserved, that the descriptions of the earliest
                    visitors apply as correctly to its present state as to its former. In its
                    appearance it resembles, according to Dr Clarke, who saw the original edifice,
                    an ordinary Roman Catholic church. It presents in form a singular mixture of
                    eastern and western architecture; a combination which, though it offends against
                    the critical rules of taste, produces, according to this traveller, an agreeable
                    effect. It is 300 feet long and nearly 200 broad, and was built by Helena, the
                    mother of Constantine. Over the door there was in the first edifice a
                    bas-relief, representing the entrance of Christ into Jerusalem, and the
                    multitude strewing palm branches in the way. On entering the church, Dr Clarke
                    was shown a slab of white marble in the pavement, surrounded by a rail, which he
                    was told was the spot where our Saviour<pb break="no" facs="nls:192944939"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4939-0549"/>’s body had been anointed by Joseph of Arimathea.
                    There is not the slightest proof of the identity of any of these holy places;
                    but the authority of these legends is still kept up as a device forexacting
                    money from the travellers and pilgrims who visit this celebrated city. The
                    interior of this strange fabric is divided into two parts. The first is a kind
                    of ante-chapel, on entering which, the visitors are shown, before the mouth of
                    the sepulchre, a block of white marble, on which it is affirmed that the angel
                    sat after the Saviour was laid in the tomb. The sepulchre itself is composed of
                    thick slabs of that beautiful breccia commonly called verd-antique marble; and
                    the entrance is rugged and broken, owing to so many fragments being carried off
                    as relics. The interior of the original edifice was adorned with Corinthian
                    columns of fine marble; but these being destroyed by the fire, the dome is now
                    supported by tall and slender square pillars of masonry, plastered on the
                    outside, and placed so thickly together as to produce the worst effect. The mean
                    architecture of the central dome, and of the whole rotunda which surrounds the
                    sepulchre itself, can only, says Buckingham, be exceeded by the wretched taste
                    of its painted decorations. The attention of this last traveller was attracted
                    by the capitals of two very large pillars, evidently very ancient. They were
                    placed on two short, thick shafts, and serve to support the roof of a grotto in
                    which the holy cross is said to have been found by St Helena. For every incident
                    in the history of the Saviour’s death and resurrection there is in this church a
                    suitable locality. The place is pointed out where Christ was derided by the
                    soldiers; where the soldiers divided his garments; where he was nailed to the
                    cross, &amp;c.; to all which miserable inventions implicit credit is attached by
                    the credulous multitude who seek admission to the Holy Sepulchre. This place is
                    the scene of the most impious extravagancies and absurdities, in which the Greek
                    and Latin Christians equally participate during their festivals at Easter; and
                    they frequently contend with each other, even to the shedding of their blood,
                    for the privilege of first entering in to celebrate mass. In the galleries round
                    the church are small buildings, containing apartments for the reception of
                    friars and pilgrims; and almost every Christian nation maintained here a society
                    of monks. But these, owing to the severe extortions of the Turks, have many of
                    them deserted the holy city, though the Greeks and Latins, and also some
                    Armenians, Copts, and Abyssinians still remain. Lamps are continually kept
                    burning in the sepulchre. The last and most important monument which is shown is
                    the tomb itself where Christ’s body is said to have lain, another of those
                    delusions which seem to form the staple manufacture of the holy city. Vast
                    crowds nevertheless resort to visit the sepulchre; and Buckingham observes that
                    his stay there was very short. “The crowds,” he says, “pressing at the door; the
                    smallness of the aperture at the entrance; the confined space within, hung round
                    with crimson damask, and ornamented with silver lamps and painting; the hurry
                    and bustle occasioned by the worshippers searching for their shoes left at the
                    door, as every one went in barefooted; the struggles to be the first to get near
                    enough to kiss the marble; and sometimes the forcibly putting off the turbans of
                    those who might have forgotten to uncover their heads; presented altogether a
                    scene of such confusion, that, added to the risk of suffocation in so impure an
                    atmosphere, it drove us by rapidly to make room for others.” The Holy Sepulchre,
                    after having been for some time the most honoured sanctuary of the Christians,
                    became a heathen altar, where pagan rites were celebrated. The Turks, who now
                    possess it, suffer the tomb of the Messiah to remain unmolested, in
                    consideration of the money paid to them by the Christian pilgrims for the
                    privilege of visiting it. About forty paces from the sepulchre, beneath the roof
                    of the same church, and on the same level, are shown two rooms, one above
                    another. Close by the entrance into the lower chamber or chapel, were formerly
                    the tombs of Godfrey of Bouillon, and of Baldwin, kings of Jerusalem. But these,
                    we are informed by Buckingham, have been spitefully destroyed by the rival sect
                    of the Greeks, so that not a vestige of them remains to mark even the spot on
                    which they stood. At the extremity of the chapel is a fissure or cleft in the
                    natural rock, said to have taken place in consequence of the earthquake that
                    occurred at the crucifixion. This spot is narrated as Mount Calvary, the place
                    of our Saviour’s passion; and here, upon a contracted piece of masonry, are
                    shown the marks of the three crosses on which Christ suffered, along with the
                    two thieves. “After this,” says Dr Clarke, “the traveller may be conducted
                    through such a farrago of absurdities, that it is wonderful the learned men who
                    have described Jerusalem should have filled their pages with any serious detail
                    of them.”</p>
                <p>There is no evidence, however, to prove the identity of these holy places with
                    the events of which they are supposed to have been the scene. It cannot, as is
                    said, be Mount Calvary, for there is no mount; and in order to explain away this
                    glaring inconsistency, it is affirmed that Mount Calvary was levelled to make
                    way for the foundations of a church; that the sepulchre of Christ alone remained
                    after the levelling had taken place, in the centre of the area; and that this
                    was encased with marble; “not a syllable of which,” says Dr Clarke, “is
                    supported by any existing evidence offered in the contemplation of what is now
                    called the tomb.” Dr Clarke, denying that the places described to be Mount
                    Calvary and the scene of the crucifixion had any claim to be so considered, was
                    of opinion that he had discovered the real site where these great events took
                    place. Having quitted the city of Jerusalem by the seven gates, and descended
                    into a dingle or trench called Tophet or Gehinnom, he discovered, as he reached
                    the bottom of the narrow dale, upon the sides of the opposite mountains, a
                    number of excavations in the rock, which exhibited a series of subterranean
                    chambers hewn with marvellous art, and containing repositories for the dead
                    carved upon the sides of the solid rock. The doors were so low that it was
                    necessary to stoop in order to procure an entrance, and to creep, in some
                    instances, on the hands and knees; the doors were also grooved for the reception
                    of immense stones, once squared and fitted for the grooves, by way of closing
                    the entrances. These cemeteries are works of such labour and magnificence, that
                    they might justly be considered as the sepulchres of kings. One, however,
                    appears to have been constructed for a single individual; and from this
                    circumstance, and from their being situated without the city, Dr Clarke
                    concludes that here was the sepulchre of Joseph of Arimathea, and the place
                    where our Lord was crucified; which was, according to the concurring testimony
                    of all the evangelists, “the place of a skull,” or a public cemetry, in the
                    Hebrew, <hi rend="italic">Golgotha.</hi> There are Greek inscriptions over the
                    doors of these sepulchres, one of which is “of the Holy Sion.” Continuing his
                    researches further eastward along this dingle, and in the place called Aceldama,
                    other ancient sepulchres were discovered by Dr Clarke, containing inscriptions
                    and ancient paintings, executed after the manner of those found on the walls of
                    Herculaneum and Pompeii; excepting that the figures represented were those of
                    the apostles, the virgin, &amp;c. with circular lines as symbols of glory
                    encompassing their heads. These paintings were on the sides and on the roof of
                    each sepulchral chamber; and although much injured by the Arabs or Turks, they
                    still preserved a wonderful freshness of colour. These tombs are not nearly so
                    ancient as those that were first noticed, being evidently constructed by
                    Christians, after the dispersion, as Dr Clarke conjectures, of the Jews during
                    the reign of Hadrian<pb break="no" facs="nls:192944952"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4952-0550"/>. At the foot of the Mount of Olives, on the east
                    side of the brook Kedron, are the “sepulchre of the virgin,” and those of the
                    “patriarchs.” The first is a cave hewn out with surprising skill and labour, in
                    a rock of hard limestone, and is of great antiquity. The descent into this
                    receptacle for the dead is by a flight <hi rend="italic">of</hi> fifty marble
                    steps, each of them twenty feet wide; within is a lofty and spacious vault, the
                    largest of die <hi rend="italic">cryptae</hi> near Jerusalem, containing the
                    tombs, real or imaginary, of the Virgin, of Joseph, of Anna, and of Caiaphas,
                    with appropriate chapels to each. History throws no light upon the origin of
                    this monument of human labour; and Dr Clarke, after the most careful
                    examination, confesses himself unable to assign any probable era for its
                    construction. The “sepulchres of the patriarchs” face that part of Jerusalem
                    where the temple of Solomon was formerly erected. No representation has ever
                    been given of these remarkable monuments that conveys an adequate idea of their
                    grandeur. Their massive structure, the boldness of their design, and their
                    sombre hue, as well as that of the surrounding rocks, impart to them a certain
                    air of grandeur and sublimity, which is lost in the representation. In order to
                    form two of these sepulchres, namely, those which are called the sepulchres of
                    Absalom and Zechariah, the solid substance of the mountain has been cut away,
                    and a sufficient area having in this manner been excavated, two monuments of
                    prodigious size appear in the midst, cut out of an entire block of stone, and
                    adorned with columns that appear to support the edifice. These columns are in
                    the ancient style of the Doric order. The date of them has never yet been
                    determined, nor by what people they have been erected. They are a continuation
                    of one vast cemetery, extending along the base of all the mountainous elevations
                    which surround Jerusalem on its southern and eastern sides; and whilst they are
                    monuments of prodigious labour, such as were erected in those times by despotic
                    kings, who could command labour to any extent, they also evince great progress
                    in the arts, and, according to Dr Clarke, must have been the work of a powerful
                    and flourishing people. There are other sepulchres to the northwest of
                    Jerusalem, by the Damascus gate, which are minutely described by Maundrell.<note

                    entrance cut out of the natural rock leads into an open court of about forty
                    paces square; at the end of this court is a portico nine paces long and four
                    broad, hewn out of the natural rock. An architrave running along its front, and
                    sculptured with fruits and flowers in a light and airy style, is still
                    discernible, though much defaced. At the end of the portico is the passage into
                    the'sepulchres, which consist of seven chambers cut out of the natural rock, and
                    about seven or eight yards square, and exactly regular and just. In one of these
                    was found the lid of a white marble coffin, exquisitely sculptured. It is
                    mentioned by Maundrell, that he found one of the doors of the chambers of ash
                    and of stone, and about six inchesthick, still hanging; and it turned upon its
                    hinges, which were also of stone. All knowledge of the origin of these singular
                    structures is lost in remote antiquity, and the conjectures of travellers on the
                    subject seem to be futile and vain.</p>
                <p>their remains preserve their original form, and wnat parts have been subsequently
                    altered or ornamented by later hands.” Such are the different impressions made
                    by the same objects, that the last traveller, in reference to the observations
                    of Dr Clarke, remarks, “that though this is the largest, the most extensive, and
                    the most interesting of the monumentshe had visited, there is not one which can

                    without the strangest abuse of terms.” “The Jews,” says Μ. de Lamartine, “had no
                    architecture of their own; they borrowed from Egypt, from Greece, but more
                    particularly, I think, from India. The key of every thing is in India; the
                    generation of ideas and arts appears to me to go back there; they created
                    Assyria, Chaldea, Mesopotamia, Syria; the great cities of the desert, as Balbec;
                    then Egypt, then the islands of Crete and Cyprus; then Etruria, then Rome; then
                    night came on, and Christianity, cradled at first by the Platonic philosophy,
                    and afterwards by the barbarous ignorance of the middle ages, gave birth to our
                    civilization and our modern arts.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the tetrarch. Buckingham, however, considers his reasons as being far from
                    conclusive; and, objecting also to the theories of Pococke and Clarke, he
                    observes, “that, consider ingpthe changes of masters which Jerusalem has
                    suffered, and the consequent variation in the taste of its possessors^ it is at

                    not only imaginative poets, but even sober, matter-of-fact travellers, are
                    sometimes prone to indulge.</p>
                <p>The ancient city of Jerusalem was so entirely destroyed that nothing remained by
                    which the original plan could be traced, and hence the controversies still
                    maintained among the learned respecting its localities. The more durable
                    features of nature, however, still remain. From history we learn that the
                    ancient city stood upon four eminences, with one very deep valley and two
                    smaller ones dividing them. The most conspicuous of these eminences was that of
                    Sion, called the Holy Hill, and the citadel of David to the south of the city.
                    To the north of Sion was the hill of Aera; and on the east the third eminence,
                    Mount Moriah, upon which was built the temple. It was bounded by the sepulchral
                    caves on the north, by Mount Sion on the south, by the brook Kedron, which runs
                    through the valley of Jehoshaphat, on the east, beyond which was the Mount of
                    Olives, and by the hill of Acra on the west. There seems to be considerable
                    uncertainty about the identity of these hills, though the Mount of Olives,
                    covered with olive trees, still vindicates its origin; and the brook Kedron,
                    receiving from its fountains, which yet abound in excellent water, the rivulet,
                    or the dirty little brook, as Buckingham calls it, of Siloam, flows through the
                    valley of Jehoshaphat; and the valley of Hinnom divides Mount Sion from Mount
                    Moriah.</p>
                <p>Jerusalem has long been celebrated as one of the holy places of the Christians,
                    and has not only been the resort of numerous pilgrims, but the permanent
                    residence of monks and Christians from various countries, such as the Latins,
                    Greeks, Armenians, and Copts, who each of them have here a monastery and a
                    church. The Latin convent of St Salvador is a large, irregular building, like a
                    fortress, with courts and galleries within, and some small spaces of garden-land
                    without, forming a safe retreat in time of intestine trouble. It is entered from
                    a hilly street, by a large iron-cased door, beneath an overhanging building,
                    which darkens the passage, and gives an air of gloom to the whole. Beyond this
                    is a small open paved court below, with other still darker passages leading to
                    the first flight of stairs. These being ascended, a range of galleries, winding
                    in various directions, leads to the private apartments and domestic offices of
                    the convent; and courts beyond, and terraces above, afford sufficient space for
                    walks both morning and evening, with a commanding view of all Jerusalem and the
                    surrounding country. In this edifice, Dr Clarke mentions that he was received by
                    a body of the most corpulent friars he had ever beheld, who resembled the
                    figures brought in <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944965"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-4965-0551"/>this country upon the stage by way of burlesquing
                    the monkish character.</p>
                <p>The friars are of the Franciscan order, who are under a vow of perpetual poverty,
                    and live by alms. They are furnished with a bed and bedding, a table, wash-hand
                    basin and jug, a lamp, a crucifix, and a chair, at the expense of the church, to
                    which they may add other conveniences from their own funds. This convent of
                    Jerusalem is called, by way of distinction, “Il Convento della Terra Santa/’ and
                    is at the head of all the Catholic establishments throughout the Holy Land. It
                    is recruited with monks from Naples, Sicily, and from the south of Spain, who,
                    according to the account of Buckingham, are extremely discontented, and complain
                    much of their banishment to this remote spot. The superior is immediately
                    dependent on the pope; and the funds of the institution are supplied chiefly
                    from Rome, aided by donations from other Catholic countries. The liberality of
                    Ferdinand, king of Spain, was particularly extolled; and even the prince regent
                    of England, afterwards George IV., had sent a gift of L.1500. The establishment
                    of the convent consists of eighty-eight persons, who all mess together. The
                    fast-days of the church are regularly observed; and the daily services of
                    prayers and of masses, which are frequent and tedious. The morning hour of
                    service is five; coffee is made at this hour, of which they all partake; they
                    dine at ten, and sleep till past noon. There is no restriction at any time in
                    the allowance of bread, wine, and vegetables, all of which are excellent. The
                    monks are clothed once in two years, with an under garment, and outer cloak of
                    dark-brown cloth, with the white knitted cord of St Francis, with which it is
                    understood that they are to flagellate themselves for their sins. Strangers
                    properly recommended, and especially if it is thought they can protect the
                    convent, by their influence, from the exactions of the Turks, which are often
                    heavy, arc hospitably entertained in a room allotted for them. The monastery
                    possesses considerable funds and stores. Dr Clarke was regaled with coffee,
                    lemonade, and excellent tea, which was served profusely in bowls. The apartments
                    are all paved with stone; and there are no less than twenty-two wells of
                    excellent water within the walls. The discipline is strict, and implicit
                    obedience is exacted by the superior, under pain of excommunication. All the
                    inferior convents in Palestine and Syria are subject to this metropolitan
                    convent: they are supplied from its funds when voluntary contributions fail; and
                    all appointments are made by the superior. The church of the convent is not
                    remarkable for size or beauty, though it is gaudily furnished with gilded
                    candlesticks, censers, images, &amp;c. and has a fine altar and an organ. The
                    Greek monastery consists of many small establishments, which are said to be well
                    supported. The church is partly subterranean, and is small and mean, the Greeks
                    bestowing all their wealth on the decoration of the Holy Sepulchre. The Armenian
                    convent is distinguished above all others for neatness and comfort, and for the
                    cheerful aspect of the place. This edifice, with its church and gardens,
                    occupies that point of the supposed Mount Zion that is within the city. The
                    establishment is well provided with every comfort; its funds, contributed
                    entirely by rich individuals, are superior to those of the other convents; and
                    all Armenian worshippers and pilgrims are maintained here during their stay in
                    the holy city. The church, which is supposed, according to the traditions
                    current in Jerusalem, to be built on the spot where James the brother of John
                    was killed with the sword, has a gorgeous and imposing appearance. Though small,
                    it is lofty; the walls are everywhere covered with pictures, executed in the
                    worst taste, yet, from their profusion and gay colouring, producing an agreeable
                    effect. The pillars, as well as the portals of the door and the inner walls, are
                    all cased with porcelain tiles, painted blue, with crosses and other devices;
                    and the mosaic pavement is the most beautiful of its kind. The whole is
                    carefully covered with rich Turkey carpets, excepting only a small space before
                    the altar. To the left is a small recess, the pretended spot where St James was
                    beheaded. It is ornamented with white marble sculpture, massy silver lamps,
                    gilding and painting, which produces a surprising richness of effect. The door
                    is even more beautiful, being composed entirely of tortoise-shell,
                    mother-of-pearl, gold, and silver, all so exquisitely inlaid, that the skill of
                    the workman seems to vie with the costliness and beauty of the materials. The
                    altars, which front the door of the entrance, are all splendid; and the massy
                    vessels, crosses, mitres, and candlesticks, of gold and silver, flowers, gems,
                    and precious stones, have an appearance of splendour and richness which cannot
                    be excelled. The Jews have a synagogue in a low and obscure street near the
                    centre of the town, which is a large suit of subterranean rooms lighted by small
                    windows. Here Mr Buckingham and Mr Bankes saw worship performed on the Jewish
                    sabbath.</p>
                <p>The population of Jerusalem is estimated, though not upon any accurate data, at
                    between 20,000 and 30,000. The Mahommedans are the most numerous; and these
                    consist of nearly equal portions of Osmanlee Turks from Asia Minor, descendants
                    of pure Turks by blood, but Arabians by birth; a mixture of Turkish and Arab
                    blood by intermarriages; and pure Syrian Arabs of an unmixed race. The few
                    Europeans in Jerusalem consist only of the monks of the Catholic convent, and
                    the still fewer Latin pilgrims who visit them. The Greeks are the most numerous.
                    The Armenians are the next in order; and the inferior sects of Copts,
                    Abyssinians, Syrians, Nestorians, Maronites, Chaldeans, &amp;c. are scarcely
                    perceptible in the crowd. The Jews amount to 1000 males and 3000 females; a
                    great number of widows resorting to the holy city, where they are maintained by
                    their own community. Their great happiness is to die at Jerusalem, and to be
                    buried in the valley of Jehoshaphat. Though the Jews come from the most distant
                    parts, they arc easily distinguished by their dress and their physiognomy,
                    which, says Buckingham, is “strikingly natural.” The city is most populous from
                    Christmas to Easter, and at the latter festival it is crowded, and exhibits a
                    singular variety of costumes and languages. The only manufacture which
                    flourishes at Jerusalem is that of crucifixes, chaplets, beads, crosses, shells,
                    and relics, of which whole cargoes are shipped off for Italy, Portugal, and
                    Spain. From the general sterility of the surrounding country, during the
                    parching droughts of summer, every article of food is dear, and wages are high.
                    The force usually maintained here consists of a thousand troops, Turks, Arabs,
                    and Albanians.</p>
                <p>Jerusalem is said to have been founded in the year of the world 2023, and at that
                    time to have occupied only the two hills of Moriah and Aera. Fifty years after
                    its foundation, it was taken by the Jebusites, descendants of Jebus, the son of
                    Canaan, who built a fortress on Mount Zion, and gave to it the name of their
                    father. Joshua made himself master of the lower town of Jerusalem, whilst the
                    Jebusites remained masters of the citadel, from which they were dislodged by
                    David, 824 years after the building of the city. David enlarged the citadel, and
                    built a palace near it; and during the prosperous reign of Solomon the city was
                    embellished by the celebrated temple. Palestine was afterwards invaded by the
                    kings of Egypt, of Assyria, and, finally, by the king of Babylon; and by the
                    latter, after having been previously plundered, it was utterly destroyed, and
                    the Jews were carried away captive to Babylon. This happened in the year of the
                    world 3513, about 600 years before the. Christian era, 466^ years after the
                    foundation of the temple "by Solomon. After the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus,
                    permission was given to the Jews to return to their <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944978" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4978-0552"/>own country. The work of
                    rebuilding the city and temple of Jerusalem was begun, after seventy years of
                    captivity, by Zerubbabel, and finished by Nehemiah. After the conquest of Persia
                    by Alexander, and the division of his empire among his generals, the Jews
                    endeavoured to regain their independence, which they with difficulty maintained
                    against powerful neighbours. Jerusalem was taken by Ptolemy, and afterwards by
                    Antiochus Epiphanes, who sacked the city, and placed an idol of Jupiter in the
                    temple. The country was afterwards invaded by the kings of Asia, the successors
                    of Alexander, who attempted to subjugate the country, and to impose on the Jews
                    the idol worship of the Greeks. The patriotism and bravery of the Maccabees
                    enabled the Jews successfully to resist these invaders. Jerusalem was at last
                    subdued by the Romans, after which Jesus Christ appeared, and suffered in the
                    city. The Jews rebelling against the tyranny of the Roman pro-consuls in the
                    reign of Nero, the city was taken by Titus after a long siege, and given up to
                    pillage, and the inhabitants were mostly taken and carried into slavery. A
                    remnant was left till the reign of Adrian, who, incensed by repeated
                    disturbances, razed the city completely to the ground, and on its ruins erected
                    the Roman town of Aelia Capitolina. Jerusalem retained this name till the end of
                    the seventh century, when Christianity, having been embraced by Constantine,
                    became the established religion of the empire. The name of Jerusalem was then
                    resumed, and the Empress Helena, the mother of Constantine, overthrew the idols
                    that had been placed on the tomb of the Saviour, and caused to be erected the
                    church which still remains, and which has been already described. Thirty years
                    afterwards, in the year 363, the Emperor Julian, with a view of disproving the
                    Christian prophecies, attempted to rebuild the temple, which attempt was,
                    however, frustrated, according to the traditions of that age, by a miraculous
                    interposition. During the progress and establishment of Christianity in the
                    Roman empire, Jerusalem was enlarged and embellished, and became the resort of
                    numerous pilgrims from all countries. About the year 636 the city was taken by
                    the Caliph Omar, after a siege of four months, and was still a pious resort of
                    numerous pilgrims, who w ere encouraged by the Turks to visit the Holy
                    Sepulchre, as they derived a considerable profit from the tax which they imposed
                    on them. Palestine was overrun by an inroad of the Turks in the year 1076, after
                    which the defenceless pilgrims w ere exposed to continual outrage and violence
                    from this barbarous people. The intelligence of their sufferings being carried
                    to Europe, inflamed the zeal of the Christian world, and gave rise to those
                    remarkable expeditions, the Crusades, for the deliverance of the Holy Land.
                    Jerusalem was re-captured by the army under Godfrey of Bouillon, who was created
                    king of Jerusalem, which city was held upwards of sixty years by five Latin
                    kings, when it was again conquered by the Turks under Saladin, and was finally
                    annexed to the Ottoman empire in 1517. Long. 35. 20. E. Lat. 31. 47. 47. N. <hi
