                    philosophers, one of whom was a native of Chalcis, and the other of Apamea in
                    Syria. The first, whom Julian compares to Plato, was the disciple of Anatolius
                    and Porphyry, and died under the reign of the Emperor Constantine. The second
                    also enjoyed great reputation. Julian wrote several letters to him; and it is
                    said he was poisoned under the reign of Valens. It is not known to which of the
                    two we ought to attribute the works which have reached us in Greek under the
                    name of Jamblicus. These are, 1. Pro-trepticus, seu adhortatio ad philosophiam,
                    Leipsig, 1813, in 8vo; 2. De Vita Pythagorae, Amsterdam, 1707, in 4to, Greek and
                    Latin, with the corrections and notes of Ludolf Kuster; 3. In Nicoachi Geraseni
                    Arithmeticam Introductionem et De Fato liber, nunc primum editus Graece, in

                    4to; 4. De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum, Venet. Aldus, 1497, in folio, a work filled
                    with theurgic and extravagant notions. Hebenstreit has published a learned
                    dissertation <hi rend="italic">De Jamblichi</hi><hi rend="italic">philosophi
                    Syri</hi><hi rend="italic">doctrina,</hi><hi rend="italic">Christines</hi><hi rend="italic">religioni quam imitari studete noxia,</hi> Leipsig, 1764, in 4to.
                    The system of the Neo-Platonists was built on the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">emanation,</hi> according to which all beings are destined, after undergoing
                    several degrees of purification, to return to the Deity, whence they emanated.
                    By this system, the sage may, even in this life, attain to the <hi rend="italic">intuition of</hi> the divinity, the most sublime end or aim of philosophy. This
                    school admitted the existence from thirty to forty leagues north-north-west from
                    Point Negrill, to the westward of Jamaica, the Grand Cayman being the most
                    remote. Cayman-braque, and Litth Cayman, he within five miles of each other, and
                    about thirty-four miles north from the Grand Cayman. These islands were
                    discovered by Columbus, but they were never permanently settled until after the
                    conquest of Jamaica by Great Britain. Grand Cayman, the only one of them
                    occupied, is about one mile and a half long, one mile broad, and contains about
                    1000 acres. It is ver; low, but towards the middle of the island vegetation is
                    abundant. These islands are favourite breeding places for turtles, immense
                    shoals of which animals cross the ocean from the Bay of Honduras, to deposit
                    their eggs on the low, sandy shore of the Caymans. The present race <hi rend="italic">of</hi> inhabitants, of whose numbfers accurate accounts have not
                    been given, are said to be descended from the English Buccaneers, and, from
                    being inured to the sea. form excellent pilots and seamen. The bishop of Jamaica
                    estimated their numbers in 1827 at 1600. They are very healthy, and attain to a
                    great age. Justices of the peace are sent from Jamaica, but in no way are the
                    inhabitants interfered with by the chief settlement to which they belong. They
                    have a chief or government officer of their own choosing, and they frame their
                    own regulations.</p><p>With regard to the working of the emancipation bill, by which, from the 1st of
                    August 1834, the slaves aged six and upwards became apprenticed labourers,
                    without any formal indentures, nothing as yet can be said with certainty. Any
                    disturbances which have broken out were anticipated, even by those who were most
                    sanguine as to the success of the measure; but when the negroes shall have
                    become familiar with their change of condition, their transition from a state of
                    slavery to that of freedom, every thing will probably go on prosperously. At all
                    events, from the accounts received, we are entitled to indulge in a less gloomy
                    augury for the future, than has been but too general!)' entertained by those who
                    investigated the subject, or were interested in the change, <hi rend="smallcaps">(r.</hi> a. <hi rend="smallcaps">r.)</hi> of a class of demons, or spirits of
                    an inferior order, mediators between God and man. To enter into communication
                    with them required great purity of maimers, and a holiness which disengaged man
                    from every thing terrestrial. Fallen souls inhabit bodies which serve as their
                    prison; and if, during their lives, they have not laboured to divest themselves
                    of their vices, they are, after death, sent back to other bodies still more
                    vile, until they be entirely purified; a doctrine which approximates closely to
                    metempsychosis. The Neo-Platonists also admitted a species of trinity; the soul,
                    according to them, emanated from the intelligence, or second divine essence
                    (r¢u¢), which again emanates from the infinite and perfect being. In order to
                    oppose the progress of Christianity, which began to ruin all established
                    religions, it was believed necessary to envelope in obscurity this doctrine of
                    emanations; and hence they affected to regard as the authors of this system
                    Zoroaster in Persia, Orpheus in Thrace, and Hermes in Egypt. (Schoell, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Abreg. de la Litter.</hi><hi rend="italic">Grecque,</hi>
