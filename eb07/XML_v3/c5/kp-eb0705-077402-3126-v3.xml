                <p><label type="entry">CAESALPINUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Andrew</hi></label>, one of
                    those great and daring geniuses who, contending with the mists of a dark age,
                    elicit the most brilliant truths on the one hand, whilst they sometimes wander
                    into great absurdities on the other, was born at Arezzo in Tuscany in 1519. Of
                    his family nothing is recorded, nor does he appear to have left any progeny, or
                    to have been ever married. Devoted to the studies of physic and natural
                    philosophy, be attained at length the honour of being physician to Pope Clement
                    VIII., during the chief part of whose pontificate, from 1592 till his own death
                    in 1603, at the age of eighty-four, Caesalpinus lived at Rome, in the highest
                    credit and celebrity; for which, as we trace the circumstances of his history,
                    and inquire into his opinions, it seems at first sight difficult to account.
                    Eminent talents have seldom proved a shield against persecution. On the
                    contrary, by adding fear to its malice, they have generally tended to exasperate
                    its fury. How then could Caesalpinus, a professed Aristotelian, and an open
                    unbeliever of revealed religion, whose opinions nearly approached those of
                    Spinosa, exist in the holy court of Rome, which was then beginning to persecute
                    the immortal Galileo? This mystery will but too readily unravel itself.</p>
                <p>Caesalpinus seems to have been furnished with two distinct philosophical
                    intellects, which, like a good and evil genius, directed him by turns. Under the
                    influence of the one he discovered the circulation of the blood, the sexes of
                    plants, and the only true principles of botanical classification; under the
                    guidance of the other he became entangled in the metaphysics of the schools, the
                    dreams of Aristotle, and a philosophic contempt for every thing, good or bad,
                    connected with the nonsense he was obliged publicly to respect. It is scarcely
                    necessary to remind the reader, that, however brilliant the reign of literature
                    and taste in the golden age of Leo X. and the times which immediately succeeded,
                    true science and experimental philosophy were as yet in the cradle. In this
                    respect the time of Caesalpinus was “dark as Erebus,” and the light he struck
                    out was altogether his own.</p>
                <p>We have no account of this great man till we find him seated in the botanical
                    chair of the University of Pisa, where also he studied, if he did not teach,
                    anatomy and medicine. His first publication was entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Speculum Artis Medicae Hypocraticum,</hi> in which it were too much to expect
                    he should have released himself from the shackles of his venerable guide; but he
                    has left evident proofs, in a passage often quoted, of his having a clear idea
                    of the circulation of the blood, at least through the lungs. In botany his
                    inquiries were conducted on a more original plan, and their result was one of
                    the most philosophical works in that science, which issued from the press at
                    Florence in 1583, in one volume quarto. The title-page runs thus: <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantis libri</hi><hi rend="italic">XVI.
                    Andreoe Caesalpini Aretini, Medici</hi><hi rend="italic">clarissimi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">docüssimique,</hi><hi rend="italic">atque Philosophi celeberrimi
                    ac subtilissimi;</hi> yet he appears to have been himself the editor of the
                    work, to which is prefixed, in his own name, an elegant and learned epistle
                    dedicatory to Francis de’ Medici, grand duke of Tuscany. This book, now rarely
                    to be met with, is not only the unacknowledged source froiń which various
                    subsequent writers, and especially Morison, derived their ideas of botanical
                    arrangement; but it was a mine of science to which Linnaeus himself gratefully
                    avowed his obligations. His own copy evinces the great assiduity with Which he
                    studied the book. He has laboured throughout to remedy the defect of which
                    Haller complains, of the want of synonyms; and has subjoined his own generic
                    names to nearly every species. He has particularly indicated those remarkable
                    passages, in pages 13 and 15, where the germination of plants and their sexual
                    distinctions are explained. In the former we trace the first rudiments of a
                    natural classification of plants by the differences in their cotyledons; or, in
                    other words, we find the origin of the natural systems of Linnaeus and Jussieu:
                    in the latter passage we detect the fundamental principle of the Linnaean
                    artificial system. Nor were these merely incidental suggestions of the
                    illustrious author. He has pursued his inquiries to a conclusion on which the
                    existence of botany as a science depends, and which the no less eminent Conrad
                    Gesner detected about the same time, though his ideas respecting it were not
                    then made public. The principle to which we allude is the classification of
                    plants by their parts of fructification alone. This was afterwards extended, by
                    the greatest writers on the subject, as Ray and Tournefort, and more completely
                    by Linnaeus, to the discrimination of their genera by the same parts, more
                    particularly considered and contrasted. To this more extensive conclusion,
                    indeed, the principle of Caesalpinus directly and inevitably leads. He pursued
                    it himself to such a length, as to develop some of the most important characters
                    for generic distinctions, such as the flower being superior or inferior with
                    respect to the fruit; the heart of the seed situated at its summit or base; the
                    seeds, or the cells of the seed vessels, solitary or otherwise; the partitions
                    of certain pericarps parallel or contrary to their valves. Linnaeus remarks that
                    this author, though the first systematical botanist, found out as many natural
                    classes, or orders, as any of bis followers. He did not indeed define well the
                    philosophical limits of genera in the vegetable kingdom, and therefore his work
                    cannot be regularly quoted throughout for generic synonyms. The want of plates
                    of his own, and of references to other authors, render, as we have already
                    hinted, some of his names and descriptions unintelligible. Yet Linnaeus has in
                    manuscript filled up many blanks which he had been obliged to leave in his own
                    <hi rend="italic">Classes Plantarum,</hi> where the system of Caesalpinus first
                    assumed a synoptical form. This author might probably have adopted a more clear
                    and methodical mode of arranging and explaining the botanical part of his
                    subject, had he not had in view the vague and desultory manner of Pliny, whom he
                    closely imitates in the materials of his numerous chapters, as well as in his
                    style of description. A small and unimportant <hi rend="italic">Appendix</hi> to
                    this work, of nineteen pages, appeared at Rome in 1603, which is of very rare
                    occurrence, but may be found reprinted in Boccone’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Museo</hi><hi rend="italic">di</hi><hi rend="italic">Plante</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pare,</hi> p. 125.</p>
                <p>Caesalpinus printed at Rome, in 1596, a quarto volume of above two hundred pages,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Metallicis,</hi> dedicated
                    to Pope Clement VIII. which, like his botanical publications, is now extremely
                    rare. In the philosophy of this work Aristotle is his guide; in its method and
                    composition, Pliny. A prefatory address to the pope declares it to have been
                    undertaken in opposition to a certain treatise on the same subject, which,
                    though written with diligence and elegance, contained many things inconsistent
                    with the principles of philosophy, and subversive of the peripatetic doctrines;
                    and with the author of which, as being excommunicated by the holy church of
                    Rome, no measures were to be kept.</p>
                <p>In our author’s <hi rend="italic">Quoestionum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Peripateticarum libri</hi><hi rend="italic">quinque,</hi> published at Rome in
                    1603, it appears that he scrupled not to stand forth as an open defender of the
                    Aristotelian philosophy, without any concealment of his own peculiar opinions
                    and hypotheses derived from thence. By these he incurred the charge of atheism,
                    preferred by a physician <pb break="no" facs="nls:193743139"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3139-0775"/>named Taurel, who, punning on the name of his
                    antagonist, entitled his book <hi rend="italic">Alpes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >caesae, hoc</hi><hi rend="italic">est,</hi><hi rend="italic">Andreae Caesalpini
                    monstrosa dogmata</hi><hi rend="italic">discussa et excussa.</hi> This attack,
                    however, met with little or no countenance; and the learned Aristotelian died in
                    the course of the year, receiving, no doubt, in the very focus of sanctity
                    itself, the funeral honours due to an orthodox physician of his holiness.</p>
                <p>Of the medical publications of Caesalpinus, entitled <hi rend="italic">Praxis
                    Universae Medicinae,</hi> and 7+ <hi rend="italic">Medicamentorum
                    Facultatibus,</hi> we have had no opportunity of forming an opinion for
                    ourselves. By what is to be gathered from his other writings, his ideas of the
                    medical qualities of plants and fossils seem adopted from ancient writers rather
                    than from any considerable portion of actual experiment. Like other physicians
                    of his time, he was too much occupied in ascertaining the articles of the <hi
                    rend="italic">materia</hi><hi rend="italic">medica,</hi> to find leisure for
                    doubt, or for practical inquiry, respecting the truth of their reputed virtues.
                    He did, however, promulgate some original ideas relative to the investigation of
                    the properties of plants by their taste and smell. With botany he was not only
                    theoretically but practically conversant. He left behind him a collection of
                    above 760 dried specimens, one of the earliest upon record, which is said to
                    have come into the hands of Micheli, and therefore is doubtless still preserved
                    in the museum of Dr Targioni Tozzetti at Florence. A catalogue of this venerable
                    herbarium is reported to have been prepared for the press, but we do not find
                    that it ever appeared.</p>
                <p>Caesalpinus having been settled at Pisa when the great Galileo first presumed to
                    doubt the infallibility of the Aristotelian philosophy, and, most likely, when
                    that rising character became, at the age of twenty-six, professor of mathematics
                    in the same university, we cannot presume him to have been free from the
                    party-spirit which so disgracefully manifested itself there. He must have
                    concurred in the measures which his own associates, leagued with the ruling
                    powers, thought proper to adopt. The ancient school philosophy, derived from the
                    Peripatetics, whether it was considered as a mere abstract speculation, or
                    whether, as being equally absurd and unintelligible with the orthodox
                    establishment, it did not excite alarm, was, as every body knows, allowed to go
                    on very lovingly with that establishment; nor did it, in general, raise any more
                    suspicion than the heathen mythology, studied and exemplified in the same and
                    other schools. But when a spirit of truth and inquiry arose, when principles and
                    opinions were to be submitted to the tests of reason and experiment, the same
                    fatal results which the preceding age had witnessed in what was called religion,
                    were justly apprehended for what was now with scarcely more propriety
                    denominated philosophy. Hence the papal authority, which had suffered shipwreck
                    in the one case, wanting the wisdom to avoid a similar disgrace in the other,
                    gladly clung for support to any ally. These two celebrated occasions, the
                    divorce of Henry VIII. and the base persecution of Galileo, are almost the only
                    ones in which the authority of the pope has been exerted about any matter that
                    human reason could determine, or that much signified, except to his own
                    immediate dependents, how it might be determined. It is a memorable fact, that
                    his decision was no less just in one case than unjust in the other; yet both
                    proved equally ruinous, the former to his power, the latter to his credit. So
                    hazardous is the exercise of usurped or overstrained authority, and so
                    infallibly, thanks to the Author of all Good, do truth and justice rise, with
                    renovated vigour, from such contests.</p>
                <p>By this view of our subject the mystery above alluded to becomes clearly
                    unravelled. Caesalpinus, though a known heretic and infidel, professing to be an
                    obedient son, and even a champion, of the church, tried to rise by the ruin of
                    equally learned and more honest men than himself. On the side on which he was
                    absurd and censurable, and on that side only, he was unjust and unprincipled;
                    nor is such a character uncommon. Where he exercised his unbiassed judgment, and
                    honestly sought for truth, he, like Galileo, enlarged the bounds of human
                    knowledge, and made discoveries which will for ever claim the gratitude and
                    admiration of mankind. (x. x.)</p>
