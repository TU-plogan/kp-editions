                <p><label type="entry">CABUL, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Caubul</hi></label>, a
                    province of Afghanistan, which sometimes gives its name to the whole kingdom,
                    with which its limits are frequently confounded. It is estimated to extend 250
                    miles in length by 150 in average breadth. It is situated between the 33d and
                    35th degrees of north lat. and is bounded on the north by Kuttore or Caffristan,
                    on the east by Peshawer or the Indus, on the south by Ghizni and Candahar, and
                    on the west by Hazarch. The country is divided into two parts by a ridge of very
                    high mountains, which run from east to west, and are covered with snow the
                    greater part of the year, whilst the valleys are scorched with excessive heat;
                    the country contains, besides, hills of moderate height, and extensive plains
                    and forests. But from the Indus to the city of Cabul there is a great scarcity
                    of wood, and a want or fuel in the winter season for the poorer classes. Near
                    Baramow is a sandy uninhabited valley, twenty miles in length; the tract lying
                    to the north of the dividing ridge of mountains is named</p>
                <p>Lumghanat, that to the south Bungishshat. There are valleys, each inter sected in
                    its whole length by one or more considerable streams running through it. The
                    valley of Cabul lies between the Hindoo Coosh Mountains on the north and the
                    Soliman ridge on the south, and is in many places about twenty-five miles in
                    breadth. Towards the east the valley is occupied by hills of inferior elevation,
                    that connect the mountainous ridges. West of these hills is the town of
                    Jellalabad, and farther west the country still rises. The river Cabul runs
                    through the centre of this province, which is principally occupied by pastoral
                    tribes, who constantly live in tents, migrating periodically with the seasons;
                    during the summer months occupying the mountains, and in winter returning to the
                    valleys. These vagrant tribes attend little to agriculture, and it is in the
                    vicinity of the towns only that the country is well cultivated. The chief towns
                    are Cabul, Peshawer, Ghizni, Jellalabad, &amp;c. A considerable trade is carried
                    on by the inhabitants of the towns. To Cabul resort merchants from the most
                    distant countries. A number of horses are brought here from Tartary, which are
                    exported to Hindustan; also furs and hides, which are exchanged for the indigo
                    and other productions of Hindustan. To Candahar are exported iron, leather, and
                    lamp-oil, whence the returns are made in the manufactures of Persia and
                    Europe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cabĳl,</hi> a very ancient city, and at present the capital
                    of Afghanistan, surrounded by a brick wall about a mile and a half in
                    circumference, with towers at the angles, and scarcely any ditch. It stands on
                    the eastern side of two united hills of a semicircular form, in the midst of an
                    extensive and fertile plain, well watered, and interspersed with walled
                    villages. A stream runs through the town, and has a small bridge over it.
                    Through the plain runs the Cabul river, over which, at the distance of four or
                    five miles to the southward of the city, is a bridge of brick. The houses are
                    built of rough stones and clay, and make but a mean appearance. Four spacious
                    bazars were erected here in the centre of the city, by Ali Murdan Khan, a
                    celebrated Persian nobleman, who for many years governed these western
                    provinces. These are now occupied by the meanest order of mechanics, and the
                    fountains with which they were supplied are choked up with filth. The citadel,
                    called Bala-Hissar, or Upper Fort, is situated on a rising ground in the eastern
                    quarter of the city, and it contains the palace and other public buildings. The
                    climate, from the vicinity of the great central range of the Hindoo Coosh
                    Mountains, covered with perpetual snow, inclines to cold, and is liable also to
                    sudden variations. Cabul is a great resort of trade, and the great bazar is
                    frequently crowded with Usbeck Tartars, and with Hindoos from Peshawer. This
                    city is mentioned by the Arabian historians in the seventh century as the
                    residence of a Hindoo prince. It was for some time the capital of the Emperor
                    Baber, and in the year 1739 was taken by Nadir Shah, who, after abandoning it to
                    plunder, annexed it, along with the province, to his Persian dominions. On his
                    death Ahmed Shah Abdally took possession of it, and in the year 1774 it was
                    constituted the capital of Afghanistan by his son Timour Shah. The travelling
                    distance from Delhi is S39 miles, from Agra 976, from Lucknow 1118, and from
                    Calcutta 1815 miles.</p>
