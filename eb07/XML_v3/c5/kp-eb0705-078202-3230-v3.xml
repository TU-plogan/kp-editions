                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    >Keye</hi>, Dr <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, the founder of Caius
                    College in Cambridge, was born at Norwich in 1510. He was admitted very young a
                    student in Gonville Hall in the above-mentioned university; and at the age of
                    twenty-one translated from Greek into Latin some pieces of divinity, and into
                    English Erasmus’s paraphrase on Jude, and other works. From these his juvenile
                    labours, it seems probable that he first intended to prosecute the study of
                    divinity. But be this as it may, he travelled into Italy, and at Padua studied
                    physic under the celebrated Montanus. In that university he continued some time,
                    where we are told he read Greek lectures with great applause. In 1543 he
                    travelled through part of Italy, Germany, and France; and returning to England,
                    commenced doctor of physic at Cambridge. He practised first at Shrewsbury, and
                    afterwards at Norwich; but removing to London in 1547, he was admitted fellow of
                    the college of physicians, of which he was several years president. In 1557,
                    being then physician to Queen Mary, and in great favour, he obtained a license
                    to advance Gonville-hall, where he had been educated, into a college, which he
                    endowed with several considerable estates, adding an entire new square at the
                    expense or L.1834. Of this college he accepted the mastership, which he held
                    till within a short period of his death. He was physician to Edward VI., Queen
                    Mary, and Queen Elizabeth. Towards the latter end of his life he retired to his
                    own college at Cambridge, where having resigned the mastership to Dr Legge of
                    Norwich, he spent the remainder of his life as a fellow commoner. He died in
                    July 1573, aged sixty-three, and was buried in the chapel of his own college. Dr
                    Caius was a learned, active, and benevolent man. In 1557 he erected a monument
                    in St Paul’s, to the memory of the famous Linacre. In 1563 he obtained a grant
                    for the college of physicians to take the bodies of two malefactors annually for
                    dissection; and he was the inventor of the <hi rend="italic">insignia</hi> which
                    distinguish the president from the rest of the fellows. He wrote, 1. Annals of
                    the College from 1555 to 1572. 2. Translation of several of Galen’s works,
                    printed at different times abroad. 3. <hi rend="italic">Hippocrates de</hi><hi
