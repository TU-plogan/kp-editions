                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CAERNARVONSHIRE</label>, a county in North Wales, is divided
                    by the Conway from Denbighshire, from part of Merionethshire by a rivulet, from
                    Anglesey by the Straits of Menai; and the residue is bounded by the sea.' In
                    figure it is very irregular, a great peninsulated point running out from it to
                    the south-west. From the extremity of this point the length is forty-five miles;
                    the breadth varies extremely; its circumference is about 150 miles. According to
                    a late survey, it contains 300,000 acres of land, of which, by one account,
                    about 200,000, and, by another account, only 160,000, are in a state of
                    cultivation.</p>
                <p>This county is the most mountainous in Wales. Its central part is entirely
                    occupied by Snowdon, and its subordinate mountains extend from near Conway in
                    the north-east to the shore that bounds the Perthorian road, including the
                    Rhifel ridges. The Snowdon Mountains are connected with another chain of hills,
                    which approach the sea at Aberdaron. Among these are very deep passes, forming
                    narrow valleys, through which numerous streams, issuing from various lakes, rush
                    in some places with great violence. The highest region of the mountainous
                    district is covered with snow during the greater part of the year; the middle
                    region affords fuel and pasturage, though the woods which once clothed it are
                    nearly exhausted. The bases of the mountains, and the valleys, are in general
                    temperate and fertile. The vale of Conway is the most extensive in the county;
                    it is a long and narrow tract, equally romantic and beautiful, through which the
                    river of the same name runs. At first it is very narrow, but it gradually widens
                    to the breadth of a mile. Its extent is about twenty miles, terminating at the
                    town of Conway. It affords rich pasturage, especially near Llanwost, where it is
                    formed into the finest meadows, corn-fields, and groves, and exhibits a striking
                    and pleasing contrast to the bleak regions of Snowdon frowning above it.</p>
                <p>The general escarpment of the mountains, which rise from the sea towards the
                    centre of this county, fronts the sea; but the particular escarpment of the
                    detached groups depends upon the course of the streams. The mountain of Snowdon
                    is composed of various cliffs of different heights; the altitude of the highest
                    point of the mountain is about 3600 feet from the high-water mark on Caernarvon
                    quay. Snow lies all the year in the hollows near the top of Snowdon, the
                    temperature here being very low, even in the middle of summer. On the morning of
                    the 5th of July 1795, just after sunrise, Mr Aikin observed the thermometer at
                    34, whereas in the vale of Beddge-lest, at seven in the morning, it was at 62;
                    at one in the afternoon it had reached only forty-eight on the top of
                    Snowdon.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers in Caernarvonshire are the Conway and the Seiont. The first
                    rises from a lake on the confines of Denbigh, Merioneth, and Caernarvon. Its
                    course is nearly in a northerly direction, along the east side of the county,
                    for about twenty-four miles, when it empties itself into the sea at the town of
                    the same name; it is half a mile wide at the Tash at high water, and not above
                    fifty yards at low, the remaining space being sand-banks, which at high water
                    are covered to the depth of twelve feet. These sands still abound in the pearl
                    muscle, as they did in the time of the Romans; but they have been long
                    neglected. The Conway is navigable for about twelve miles. The Seiont rises from
                    a lake near Snowdon; its course is westward, and it runs into the Menai Strait
                    at Caernarvon. The bar admits vessels of about 300 tons into the haven.</p>
                <p>The sea-coast of this county presents many objects worthy of notice. Traeth Bach
                    and Traeth Mawr are two inlets of the sea having one entrance, and each
                    receiving a little river. The greater part of them are dry at low-water, and
                    become quicksands. They lie between Caernarvonshire and Merionethshire, but as
                    they seem more properly to belong to the latter county, the attempts of Mr
                    Maddocks to embank the sands of Traeth Mawr will more properly be noticed under
                    Merionethshire. Passing from this county into Caernarvonshire, the first
                    sea-port is Pwllheli, on an inlet which receives three or four rivulets. It has
                    a considerable coasting trade in small vessels. St Tudwell’s bay is sheltered by
                    two small islands. To it succeeds the bay named Hell’s Mouth, from the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193743113" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3113-0773"/> height and form
                    of the shores, which cause the wind to blow continually into it, while there is
                    also a constant indraught of the current. The promontory of Lyn extends to the
                    west of the mass of mountains that occupy the space between the west entrance of
                    the Menai and Traeth Mawr. At the extremity of this promontory lies the Isle of
                    Bardsey, two miles long and one mile broad. The tides run with great rapidity
                    between this island and the promontory. The gulf between the peninsulated
                    hundred of Lyn and Anglesey is called the bay of Caernarvon. It is lined by the
                    high ridge of Snowdon. The only port on this coast is Porthyn Lyn, formed by a
                    long point of land jutting into the sea, and sheltering a cone on the west. Port
                    Penryhn, on a small rivulet, has been recently enlarged into a haven for vessels
                    of 300 or 400 tons; and by it are exported immense quantities of slate, from
                    Lord Penryhn’s estate in this county, to the amount of 500 tons a-week when the
                    demand is great. About seven miles to the west-south-west of Conway, on the road
                    from that town to Bangor, is the stupendous precipice of Penmaen Mawr, the last
                    of the long Caernarvon chain. It is 1400 feet perpendicular from its base, and,
                    according to Mr Caswell, who was employed by Mr Flamstead the astronomer to
                    measure it, 1545 feet above the beach at low water. In 1772 application was made
                    to parliament to improve and secure the road across this precipice, which was
                    accordingly done; and there is now a good road on a ledge of the rock, defended
                    by a wall five feet high. The county of Caernarvon is terminated by the lofty
                    round promontory called Llandudno, or the Great Orme’s Head, on the east of the
                    Conway river. It is a fine sheep-walk, ending in a steep precipice over the sea,
                    which is hollowed into various inaccessible caverns.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the elevated surface of the greater part of the county, and its
                    cold, piercing, and damp atmosphere, there is little corn grown in it. Near the
                    sea, however, and in some of the vales, barley of fine quality is raised; and,
                    in some of the higher districts, oats are cultivated. The vales yield a little
                    meadow grass for hay, which is got in without the aid of wheel-carriages, the
                    uneven surface of the ground not admitting their use. Sheep and black cattle,
                    however, constitute the principal agricultural stock of the Caernarvonshire
                    farmers. The former are pastured on the mountains, which in general are commons;
                    and the latter on the lower grounds. A considerable quantity of cheese, made
                    from the mixed milk of ewes and cows, is made. From the peninsulated hundred of
                    Lyn, which is in general flat, oats, barley, cheese, and black cattle are
                    exported; of the last about 3000 annually. The numerous herds of goats which
                    used to frequent the rocky districts of this county are now nearly extinct.
                    There are some profitable orchards in the vales, but in general the climate is
                    very unfavourable to fruit trees.</p>
                <p>Caernarvonshire is an interesting county to the mineralogist; but we can only
                    notice very briefly the principal features of its mineralogy. The highest and
                    interior re gions of the Snowdon Mountains are composed of granite, porphyry,
                    whin, and other primitive aggregate rocks, inclosing considerable blocks of
                    quartz. The western side of Snowdon itself consists of ironstone, on which are
                    placed basaltic columns of different lengths, and about four feet in diameter.
                    On each side of the primitive rocks there are mountainous banks of slate, the
                    coarsest on the eastern, and the finest invariably on the western side of the
                    central ridge. At Nantfrancon are ‘the slate quarries of Lord Penryhn, who has
                    constructed admirable railways from them to Port Penryhn. The banks of slate,
                    becoming finer as they descend, occupy the country between Snowdon and the
                    Menai, usually terminating within a few hundred yards of its banks. The channel
                    of the Shast, as well as its banks, consists of limestone; breccia, or the
                    fragments of the Snowdon Mountains in a calcareous cement; and hard marl,
                    inclosing shells. The general dip of the strata in the promontory of Lyn is to
                    the south-west; on the north coast are found chlorite slate and coarse
                    serpentine. On the former rest beds of primitive argillaceous schistus. The
                    argillaceous schistus in some places is largely mixed with carbon, forming a
                    kind of hard drawing slate; and in others it is penetrated by carbon and
                    pyrites, forming alum slate. No mines have been opened in this district. A hard
                    stone, used instead of brass for supporting the pivots of light machinery,
                    andanother stone something resembling the French burr, have been found in this
                    county. There are some lead mines near Gwydir; but the most important and
                    valuable metal found in this county is copper. The richest mines of it are in
                    the vicinity of Llanberis; it is also found in various parts of the Snowdon
                    Mountains; and the green carbonate of copper lies between the limestone strata,
                    in the promontory of Orme’s Head. There are also mines of calamine on the
                    Caernarvon side of the river Conway.</p>
                <p>Many rare vegetables, met with only on the most elevated spots, grow in this
                    county. Some of the steepest crags of the Great Orme’s Head are inhabited by the
                    peregrine falcon. Considerable quantities of fish, particularly herrings, are
                    caught on the shores of this county; and lobsters and oysters are met with in
                    great abundance. In some of the lakes are found the char, and the gwyniad,
                    another alpine fish. Foxes are the chief wild animals.</p>
                <p>The monéy raised for the poor in 1803 was L.9137, being at the· rate of 4s. 0∙∣d.
                    in the pound. In the year ending the 25th of March 1815, there was paid in
                    parochial rates the sum of L.15,776. 17s. 6d. In 1800 there were 8304 inhabited
                    houses, and 41,521 inhabitants; 19,586 males, and 21,935 females, of whom 12,808
                    were employed in agriculture, and 4234 in manufactures, trade, and handicrafts.
                    The inhabitants live in a state of the utmost simplicity, manufacturing their
                    clothes from the wool of their own flocks, and dyeing them with lichens; while a
                    little oatmeal added to the produce of their dairies constitutes their food. In
                    1811, 1821, and 1831, the results of the population returns were as follows:</p>
