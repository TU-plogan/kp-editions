                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">QUESNAY, <hi rend="smallcaps">François</hi></label>, a
                    physician of considerable eminence, but who is chiefly known in the history of
                    philosophy as a profound and ingenious inquirer into the constitution of
                    society, and as the founder of the sect of the Economists.</p>
                <p>The accounts of the life of this distinguished person, which, unlike that of most
                    literary men, abounded in incident and adventure, are exceedingly meagre and
                    contradictory. Neither the place of his birth nor the condition of his parents
                    has been well ascertained; but the accounts apparently most entitled to credit
                    state that he was born at the village of EcquiVilly, in the Isle de France, in
                    1694; and that his father was either a common labourer, or a small proprietor
                    who cultivated his own little property.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is stated in the <hi rend="italic">Eloge Historique</hi>
                    of Quesnay, in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    1/74, that he wa⅞ the son of an <hi rend="italic">advocat</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >en Parlement</hi> at Montfort, and that he was born at Mercy. But it is
                    difficult to suppose, had his father been in such a station, that his education
                    should have been so entirely neglected. In the brief but interesting notice of
                    Quesnay, ςiven by Mr Crawfurd in a note to the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> of
                    Madame du Hausset, femme de-chambre of Madame de Pompadour, et <hi rend="italic"
                    >l’amie</hi> de Quesnay, in the <hi rend="italic">Mélanges d’HÌstoire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et de Littérature</hi> (p. 276), he is stated to have been the son
                    of a labourer. This also is the statement of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie</hi><hi rend="italic">Àîí-t!ιodique.</hi> According to the <hi
                    rend="italic">notice</hi> prefixed by Dupont to the <hi rend="italic">Eloge</hi>
                    of Μ. Gournay, in the third volume of the <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Turgot,</hi> Quesnay was the son <hi rend="italic">d’un
                    propriétaire cultivateur.</hi></p></note> His humble origin is indeed evident
                    from the fact mentioned by all his biographers, of his early education having
                    been almost entirely neglected, and of his being constantly occupied, until his
                    fourteenth or sixteenth year, in the sports or labours of the fields, without
                    being either sent to school or taught to read. But although placed in such
                    unfavourable circumstances, young Quesnay was imbued with an ardent love of
                    knowledge, and with a strong desire to emerge from the obscure station in which
                    he had been brought up. The <hi rend="italic">Maison</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rustique</hi> of Liebaut was the first book that came into his hands; and he is
                    said to have learned to read it by the assistance of lessons given him by a
                    gardener of the village. The perusal of this book, which seems to have had a
                    material influence over his future studies, awakened his latent powers, and
                    stimulated him to make further efforts to extend his information. Having
                    acquired a competent knowledge of his vernacular tongue, by the eager reading of
                    such French books as came into his hands, he next applied himself to the study
                    of the dead languages; and speedily attained, partly by the slender assistance
                    of a self-dubbed surgeon of the village, but chiefly by his own extraordinary
                    industry and sagacity, to a tolerable proficiency in Latin and Greek.</p>
                <p>Quesnay now resolved, in opposition to the wishes of his parents, and especially
                    of his mother, to devote himself to the profession of surgery, and received the
                    rudiments of his instruction in that art from the village-doctor who had
                    assisted him in his philological studies. But the pupil very soon surpassed the
                    master; and when the latter applied to be admitted into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maitrise,</hi> or Corporation of Surgeons, he presented, as testimonials of his
                    skill in his profession, and of his capacity to practise it with advantage, some
                    Essays written by Quesnay, and which were received with very great applause.
                    Quesnay was not privy to this <hi rend="italic">ruse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but soon after its occurrence he left his paternal village, and set out
                    to prosecute his studies at Paris. We are not informed by what means he
                    supported himself in that city, nor how long he remained there; but his
                    indefatigable industry and zeal enabled him to make great progress in his
                    studies, whilst his merit and modesty procured him several friends. Besides
                    attending prelections on the various branches of surgery, and the different
                    hospitals, he found leisure to devote some portion of his time to metaphysical
                    researches, and the study of philosophy, for which the perusal of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Recherche de la Vérité</hi> of Malebranche had given him a very
                    decided taste. Nay, such was the almost unparalleled activity and vigour of his
                    mind, that having accidentally met, during his stay in Paris, with the
                    celebrated Μ. Cochin, of the Royal Academy of Painting, he put himself under his
                    tuition; and we are told, that he profited so well by the few lessons he
                    received, as to be able not only to take remarkably good likenesses, but to
                    design and <hi rend="italic">engrave,</hi> with his own hand, the various bones
                    of the human skeleton, in a manner which would not have disgraced the most
                    skilful artists.</p>
                <p>On finishing his studies at Paris, Quesnay formed the design of establishing
                    himself as a surgeon in Mantes, a considerable town of his native province, and
                    presented himself to the surgeons of its <hi rend="italic">Maitrise</hi> for
                    examination. But they refused, from jealousy, as is alleged, of his talents, to
                    admit him to trial. He was thus laid under the necessity of returning to Paris,
                    where he passed his examinations with éclat; and in 1718 received letters
                    ordering him to be admitted into the <hi rend="italic">Maitrise</hi> of
                    Mantes.</p>
                <p>Having established himself at Mantes, his reputation soon extended itself. He was
                    employed by some of the first <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542632"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0718-2632-0789"/>families of the neighbourhood, and, amongst
                    others, by that of the Marshal de Noailles, Duc de Villeroi, who persuaded him
                    to leâve his residence in the country, and to accompany him to Paris as his
                    surgeon, as nearly as we can collect in 1729 or 1730. An incident not long
                    afterwards, occurred, which had the most material influence over his future
                    prospects and life. Having accompanied the Duc de Villeroi to the house of the
                    Comtesse d’Estrades, Quesnay remained behind in the carriage whilst the duke
                    went in to visit that lady, who, during the interview, was suddenly seized with
                    an epileptic fit. Quesnay being called in, and perceiving the nature of the
                    attack, with singular presence of mind ordered the duke and the other attendants
                    out of the room, and managed so well as to succeed in concealing the nature of
                    the malady. The comtesse was so much pleased with this dexterity and address,
                    that she lost no time in recommending Quesnay to her all-powerful friend, Madame
                    d’Es-tioles, afterwards Madame de Pompadour, who made him her physician; and,
                    besides obtaining for him apartments at Versailles, procured him, in 1737, the
                    place of surgeon in ordinary to the king.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This incident is related by Mr Crawford, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mélanges,</hi> p. 276, and is referred to by Marmontel.</p></note></p>
                <p>Quesnay was shortly afterwards appointed secretary to the Royal Academy of
                    Surgery, established in 1731; and, besides several articles on particular
                    branches of surgéry, he contributed the preface to the first volume of its <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> which has always been reckoned peculiarly valuable
                    for its profound and discriminating observations on the respective uses of
                    theory and observation in the physical sciences, and on the assistance they
                    reciprocally lend to each other.</p>
                <p>Having from an carly period been much subject to the gout, and becoming in
                    consequence less able to discharge his duties as surgeon, Quesnay took the
                    degree of doctor of medicine in 1744; and was soon afterwards appointed, through
                    the influence of his powerful patroness, to the important place of consulting
                    physician to the king. In this capacity he attended Louis in the campaigns of
                    1744 and 1745, and, amid the distractions of a camp, collected and prepared the
                    greater part of the materials for his <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Fièvres,</hi> published in 1753.</p>
                <p>His appointment as physician to the king was preceded by the grant of letters of
                    nobility, issued on the recovery of the dauphin from an attack of small-pox.
                    Louis, who was much struck with the justice and solidity of Quesnay’s remarks,
                    familiarly called him <hi rend="italic">son</hi><hi rend="italic">penseur,</hi>
                    and gave him, in allusion to this title, three pansey flowers (in French, <hi
                    rend="italic">pensées),</hi> for his arms, with the motto <hi rend="italic"
                    >Propter</hi><hi rend="italic">cogitationem</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mentis.</hi></p>
                <p>The leisure Quesnay now enjoyed enabled him to prosecute his studies with greater
                    assiduity. In 1747 he republished an enlarged edition, in three tomes 12mo, of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Essai</hi><hi rend="italic">Physique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Economic Animale,</hi>
                    originally published in 1736; in 1748 he published an <hi rend="italic">Examen
                    Impartiel</hi><hi rend="italic">des Contestations</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Médécins et des Chirurgiens de Paris;</hi> in 1749 he published a <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoire sur la Sagesse de VAncienne Législation de la Chirurgie en
                    France,</hi> and two separate treatises in 12mo, the one on Suppuration, and the
                    other <hi rend="italic">De lα Gangrene</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in 1750 he
                    republished his <hi rend="italic">Traité des Effets et</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    l’Usage</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Saigné,</hi> written during his residence at
                    Mantes, and originally published in 1730; and in 1753 he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité des Fièvres Continués,</hi> two tomes 12mo.</p>
                <p>These works have all been held in very high estimation; and an excellent judge
                    has given it as his opinion, tb at</p>
                <p>“the <hi rend="italic">Traité de la Gangrène</hi> is by far the most valuable
                    publication which we yet possess upon this subject.” Every page of this work, he
                    adds, “is distinguished by the same talent for accurate observation and
                    perspicuous arrangement, which are so remarkable in all the other writings of
                    this celebrated author.” (Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Lectures on
                    Inflammation,</hi> p. 502.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Traité des Fièvres</hi> was the last of Quesnay’s
                    professional works. He appears to have thenceforth comparatively abandoned his
                    medical studies. At no period, indeed, had he allowed them to occupy exclusively
                    his attention; and he now devoted himself, in* preference, to other, and, if
                    possible, still more interesting inquiries. He had always entertained a strong
                    predilection for agricultural pursuits, the effect, perhaps, of his situation in
                    early life; and this, combined with the speculative and metaphysical cast of his
                    mind, seems to have led him to those peculiar notions respecting the paramount
                    importance of agriculture as a source of wealth, and the constitution of
                    society, which have rendered his name so justly celebrated in the history of
                    economical science. The articles <hi rend="italic">Fermier</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Grains</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi> published
                    in 1756 and 1757, contain the earliest development of his views on this subject.
                    They are both written with great ability, and display an intimati' acquaintance
                    with the subject, considerable reading, and great powers of analysis. In the
                    article <hi rend="italic">Grains</hi> the distinction between the <hi
                    rend="italic">produit</hi><hi rend="italic">total</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >produit</hi><hi rend="italic">net</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> between the
                    productiveness of agriculture and the supposed unproductiveness of other
                    employments, with the doctrine of the unrestricted freedom of commerce, and most
                    of the other leading principles in the theory of the economists; are distinctly
                    stated, and illustrated with much ingenuity. The <hi rend="italic"

                <p>We have elsewhere entered at considerable length into an examination of the
                    speculations of Quesnay and his followers, with respect to the constitution of
                    political societies and the sources of public wealth. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Economists</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Political Economy.)</hi> That there is
                    a good deal of error in them must be allowed; but this is far more than coun -
                    tervailed by the many just, discriminating, and original views and important
                    discoveries which they contain. Perhaps, however, the principal merit of Quesnay
                    and his followers does not consist so much in the discoveries they made, as in
                    their having been the first philosophers who distinctly perceived that the
                    institutions of society should always harmonize with the natural principles on
                    which it is founded, or, as they termed it, with the <hi rend="italic">ordre

                    rend="italic">Ephé-mérides du Citoyen,</hi> 1769, No. II. p. 13.) It is to be
                    regretted that, in investigating these laws, they proceeded too much upon
                    abstract and speculative principles, without sufficiently attending to the
                    effects of particular institutions, and to the various phenomena manifested in
                    the progress of society. But notwithstanding the defective mode in which they
                    conducted their researches, they succeeded in establishing and elucidating many
                    important principles; and there is certainly much more reason to wonder at the
                    general correctness of their conclusions, than to feel surprised at the errors
                    into which they fell. Quesnay and his disciples established, that society either
                    is or should be formed to secure the greatest possible advantage to its members;
                    that the security of property and the freedom of industry are its essential
                    bases; and that, instead of interfering to regulate the pursuits of individuals,
                    the proper business of the politician is to protect the equal rights and
                    liberties of all, and to secure the utmost freedom of competition in every
                    department of industry. And though it be undoubtedly true that most of these
                    principles had been pointed out by previous writers, Quesnay and his school have
                    the merit of being the first who showed their dependence on each other, and who,
                    by presenting them in a systematic and consecutive form, were enabled to give a
                    scientific demonstration of the injustice and impolicy of such institutions as
                    ignorance or mistaken views of national interest had established in opposition
                    to them.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Political Economy</hi> an attempt has been
                    made to show the fallacy of Quesnay’s opinion with respect to agriculture being
                    the only source of wealth; and the experience of all ages sufficiently proves
                    that the <hi rend="italic">despotisme légal,</hi> in the hands of an hereditary
                    monarch, without <hi rend="italic">eon-treforces</hi> of any kind, which he

                    worst.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We are at a loss

                <p>Notwithstanding his great age, and the sufferings he experienced from almost
                    incessant attacks of the gout, the activity of Quesnay’s mind continued
                    unimpaired. “<hi rend="italic">Il a,”</hi> said one of his friends, “<hi
                    rend="italic">une</hi><hi rend="italic">tele</hi><hi rend="italic">de trente ans

                    He contributed subsequently to the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physiocratic,</hi> many acute and able articles to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ephemerides</hi><hi rend="italic">du Citoyen,</hi> and continued wholly
                    occupied with these studies, and with mathematics, to which he latterly began to
                    pay considerable attention, until his death, which took place at Versailles in
                    December 1774, in the eightieth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Quesnay possessed inflexible integrity, a nice sense of honour, and great
                    prudence and discretion. Though highly esteemed by the king, and long resident
                    at court, he never intermixed in the intrigues of which it was the constant
                    theatre. No one ever scrupled to express himself freely in his presence; nor was
                    this confidence ever betrayed. “Il réeevoit chez lui des personnes de tous les
                    partis, mais en petit nombre, et qui toutes avoient une grande confiance en lui.
                    <hi rend="italic">On y parlait très hardiment de tout; et ce qui fait leur éloge

                    <hi rend="italic">Melanges,</hi> &amp;c. p. 277∙ A striking instance of the
                    confidence placed by the most opposite parties in Quesnay is given in the second
                    volume of MarmonteΓs Memoirs.</p></note> To the utmost frankness and sincerity
                    he added the easy address and polish of a courtier, and the intelligence of a
                    philosopher. No man could be less solicitous of distinguishing himself; or more
                    careful not to offend the self-esteem of others.</p>
                <p>His conversation was animated, without the least effort at brilliancy. So much
                    indeed was he averse from every appearance of pretension, that he was in the
                    habit of veiling the most profound remarks and observations under the form of
                    apologues, which generally referred to some subject connected with rural
                    affairs, to which he was always particularly attached. He was most indulgent to
                    the faults and errors of others, provided they were unalloyed by any taint of
                    artifice or baseness, for which he never hesitated, whatever might be the rank
                    of the party, to express the utmost contempt. Quesnay was truly a patriot and a
                    philosopher; and it would be difficult to produce another instance of one who,
                    having lived long in a profligate and luxurious court, unsullied by its vices,
                    and aloof from its contentions, preserved to an extreme old age all those
                    generous and kindly feelings, with that unobtrusive but ardent zeal in the cause
                    of humanity, and that love of speculation and profound inquiry, which
                    distinguished his earlier years.</p>
                <p>“Quesnay,” says Madame du Hausset, “étoit un grand génie, suivant l’opinion de
                    tous ceux qui l’avoit connu, et de plus un homme fort gai. Il aimoit causer avec
                    moi de la campagne; j’y avois été élevée, et il me faisoit parler des herbages
                    de Normandie et du Poitou, de la richesse des fermiers, et de la manière de
                    cultiver. C’étoit le meilleur homme du monde, et la plus éloigné de la plus
                    petit intrigue. Il étoit bien plus occupé à la cour de la meilleure manière de
                    cultiver la terre que de tout ceque s’y passoit.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mélanges,</hi> p. 343.)</p>
                <p>“Tandis,” says Marmontel, “que les orages se formoi-ent et se dissipoient
                    au-dessous de l’entresol de Quesnay, il griffonnoit ses axiomes et ses calculs
                    d’économic rustique, aussi tranquille, aussi indifférent à ees mouvemens de la
                    cour, que s’il en eût été à cent lieues de distance. Là bas, on déeidoit de la
                    paix, de la guerre, du choix des généraux, du renvoi des ministres; et nous,
                    dans l’entresol, nous raisonnions d’agriculture; nous calculions le <hi

                    venoit elle-même les voir à table, et causer avec eux.”</p>
                <p>Dr Smith was well acquainted with Quesnay. He frequently met him during his
                    residence at Paris in 1766; and whilst he bears the most honourable testimony to
                    the “modesty and simplicity” of his character, he has pronounced his system to
                    be, “with all its imperfections, the nearest approximation to the truth that has
                    yet been published on the subject of political economy.” (Wealth of Nations, p.
                    307.) So highly, indeed, was Smith impressed with a sense of his merits as a man
                    and a philosopher, that it was his intention, had he not been prevented by
                    Quesnay’s death, to have inscribed to him the Wealth of Nations. (Dugald
                    Stewart’s Account of the Life and Writings of Dr Smith.)</p>
                <p>Quesnay had a son by his wife, to whom he was united when at Mantes. He gave him
                    an excellent education; and exhibited a striking proof of his disinterestedness,
                    by constantly refusing to solicit for him any place or situation under
                    government. This son ultimately settled in the country, on an estate near
                    Beauvoir. T urgot gave one of Quesnay’s grandsons a place in the administration;
                    and another entered the army, and aeted as captain of infantry at the battle of
                    Jemmappes.</p>
                <p>Few men have been more esteemed by their friends than Quesnay, or more ready to
                    do all in their power to advance their interests. Mcreier de la Rivière, the

                    the chief place in his esteem, and was looked upon by him as the only person in
                    France qualified to conduct the administration of, the finances. He was also
                    much attached to the Marquis de Mirabeau, Turgot, Dupont, the Abbé Bandeau, St
                    Péravy, and other leading economists, who willingly acknowledged him for their
                    master, and enthusiastically exerted themselves to defend and to propagate his
                    doctrines. “The economists were in reality, and not merely in appearance, a sect
                    of philosophers.</p>

                    improve mankind; and to them, amongst political inquirers, belongs the rare
                    praise of having first pointed out the natural order of things, or the observed
                    course of nature in the conduct of the world, as the example and guide of human
                    policy.” (c. c.)</p>
