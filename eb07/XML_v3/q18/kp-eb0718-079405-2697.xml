                    Quintilianus)</hi></label>, a celebrated rhetorician and critic, who flourished
                    in the first century of the Christian era. His life, written by an unknown
                    author, is prefixed to several editions of his works. From it we learn that he
                    was born at Rome, though under what consuls, or in what reign, is unknown; and
                    that no credit is due to the tradition which makes him a native of Calagurris or
                    Çalahorra, in Spain, since he is not amongst the number of the Iberians whom
                    Martial has celebrated. In fact, that poet names him apart from any others, and,
                    in the homage which he pays, clearly intimates that he was a Roman.</p><p>Quintiliane vagae moderator summe juventae, Gloria Romanae, Quintiliane,
                    togae.</p><p>Quintilian calls himself the son of an advocate, and informs us besides that, in
                    his youth, he was acquainted with Domitius Afer and Seneca, who both perished
                    under Nero. Seneca speaks of Quintilian, a deςlaimer, the grandfather of him who
                    so long taught rhetoric at Rome. Domitian intrusted the instruction of his
                    grand-nephews to Quintilian; and another pupil of his, C. Caelius, became the
                    best orator of the time. Having married a lady of a noble family, Quintilian had
                    the grief to lose her, as well as one of the sons she had brought him; an
                    affliction which he experienced soon after he had composed his book on the
                    causes of the corruption of eloquence. He then wrote his books of rhetoric, but
                    whilst engaged in the composition of the work, he lost his other son. His
                    daughter, whom he had by a second wife, married Novius Celer, a mari of
                    distinction. The anonymous author concludes by stating that he does not know in
                    what year Quintilian died.</p><p>According to the calculations of Dodwell, he rriust have been born in the year 42
                    of our era, and must have died under Hadrian, some time between the years 117
                    andT38. Those who hold him to have been a Spaniard, say that he was brought to
                    Rome by Galba; and the same thing is stated in the chronicle of Eusebius. But
                    Quintilian himself assures us that at Rome he was acquainted with Domitius Afer;
                    and the death of this orator took place in the year 55 of our era. Dodwell,
                    therefore, conjectures that in 61 Quintilian followed Galba into Spain, where he
                    taught rhetoric pleaded causes, and in the year 68 returned to Rome with the
                    same émperor. From this time until the year 88 he gave lessons in rhetoric, a
                    public provision having been attached to this function by Galba, according to
                    Dodwell; by Domitian, according to the chronicle of Eusebius; by Vespasian,
                    according to Suetonius. At the same time, Quintilian shone at the bar, where his
                    pleadings attracted so much notice that they were written out and sold. He
                    enjoyed an honourable degree of credit, and, according to Juvenal, a
                    considerable fortune; which, howevèr, accords but indifferently with the present
                    that he received from Pliny the younger, as a portion to his daughter. It is
                    possible, indeed, that Pliny, in mentioning this fact, may be speaking of a
                    different Quintilian; but it may be observed, that no other rhetorician of the
                    name is known at the time here referred to. Dodwell supposes that the author of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Oratoriae</hi> was
                    consul in the year 117,‘and others that he held this dignity either before or
                    after this date.* Some words of Ausonius and∖Invenal have led to this
                    conclusion, but neither of these writers has expressly mentioned the fact.</p><p>If it be difficult, however, to ascertain the details of his <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> life, it is easy enough to recognise the eminent merit of his work,
                    forming, as it does, the most complete course of rhetoric which the ancients
                    have left us. Of this work Gibert and Laharpe have both given very ample
                    analyses. The first book treats of the education of the orator; the second, of
                    the art of oratory in general; the following, of invention, arrangement,
                    elocution, memory, and action; the twelfth and last, of the manners and
                    character of the orator, or rather of the advocate. The author loves to descend
                    to details of all sorts, sometimes even to those relating to grammar; and,
                    besides, he intermingles with his precepts so many observations, and, above all,
                    so many facts, that his work is indispensable for acquiring a competent
                    knowledge of the literary history of antiquity. The gravest fault which has yet
                    been detected in the work, consists in the praises lavished upon Domitian; a
                    deformity which, in the eyes of Bayle, Dodwell, and even Gibert, is alike
                    disgusting and inexcusable. In a literary point of view, it may be observed that
                    Quintilian, in citing and contradicting the rhetoricians who have preceded him,
                    particularly Aristotle, does not always seize the true import of their words,
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and consequently ascribes to them doctrines they
                    never maintained, and precepts they never inculcated. In other respects, if his
                    work be long, it is also full; and all the obscurity we find in it is reduced to
                    some details of which all trace was effaced soon after his time, and which he
                    does not explain sufficiently for us, because they were familiar to his Roman
                    readers. The enumeration which he has made of more than a hundred figures is of
                    more importance than is commonly supposed to the theory of language and of
                    thought. Nevertheless, Rollin took the trouble of abridging this rhetoric, in
                    order to render it more accessible and more useful to youth, and retrenched
                    nearly a fourth of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193542710" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2710-0795"/>original work; but, in our opinion, it would be
                    much better to leave classical books as they are, especially when they inspire
                    only pure tastes and virtuous sentiments.</p><p>In point of style, the work of Quintilian has no pretensions to equal or be
                    compared with the treatises of Cicero on the art of oratory; but it is
                    nevertheless written with much sagacity and elegance. Severe censors have
                    thought that the preface of the sixth book savours of declamation. The author
                    therein deplores the loss of his second son, which he had just sustained, and
                    retraces the recollections of another son, and of a young wife, whom death had
                    also removed. But,, to say the truth, the expression of his grief is not so
                    simple or so natural as could be wished; and, in the concluding part, we
                    perceive almost as much of the rhetorician as. of the father. This preface,
                    however, is read with interest, and has no resemblance to the Declamations, of
                    which a long and useless collection has been published under the name of
                    Quintilian. They are distinguished into great and small; the former, nineteen in
                    number, and the latter, a hundred and forty-five, being all that remain of three
                    hundred and eighty-eight. Philelphus, Vives, and especially Erasmus, have shown
                    that the nineteen great declamations could not have proceeded from the pen of
                    Quintilian. In fact, there are manuscripts which assign them to Μ. Florus; and a
                    text of Trebellius Pollio would authorize the belief that they were the work of
                    Postumus the younger, one of the thirty tyrants: “Postumus...ita in
                    declamationibus disertus, ut ejus controversiae Quintiliano dicantur insertae.”
                    Notwithstanding the authority of several manuscripts, and that of Lactantius,
                    Ennodius, and Vincent de Beauvais, we cannot discover in. them a trace of
                    Quintilian. The difference is too sensible, even in the diction; he never could
                    have written <hi rend="italic">dilectio, discretio, impaenitens,
                    lenocinamentum,</hi> and other expressions belonging to a class which he must
                    have strongly condemned. As to the hundred and forty-five smaller declamations,
                    if they were really his, they might have been extracts from his pleadings,
                    collected by the tachygraphers. Perhaps they belonged to his father or his
                    grandfather, or some other person of the same name; perhaps they were the
                    productions of different authors and different ages, which the inequalities
                    observed in them seem almost to indicate. But the circumstance which has most
                    puzzled the learned, is the distinction of these pieces into two kinds; the <hi rend="italic">coloratae,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tractatae.</hi> May not
                    this second qualification have been applied to those the subjects of which had
                    really been treated, and the first to such as invested imaginary themes with all
                    the colours of rhetorical embellishment? or, if another supposition be
                    admissible, may not the <hi rend="italic">tractatae</hi> have been the simple
                    expositions of causes, whilst the <hi rend="italic">coloratae</hi> were such as
                    admitted of embellishment?</p><p>A production, however, which would do much more honour to Quintilian, were he
                    really the author of it, is the dialogue <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Causis</hi><hi rend="italic">oorruptae Eloquxntiae.</hi> He had
                    certainly composed a treatise bearing this title; for, in the preface to the
                    sixth book of his Institutions, he expressly mentions the fact; but on referring
                    to the same treatise at the end of the eighth,-he, says that he has there spoken
                    more at large of tropes, and particularly of hyperbole, which is not in
                    accordance with the dialogue, the interlocutors in which are Aper, -Maternus,
                    Julius Secundus, and Vipsanius Messala. Pierre Pithon, Colomies, Dodwell, and
                    many other learned men, have preferred ascribing it to Tacitus; and one of the
                    grounds on which this opinion rests is the character of the political
                    observations scattered throughout this little work. Besides, in several
                    manuscripts, Tacitus is dis-tinqtly pointed out as its author. But it .may not
                    be the production either of the one or of the other. It has sometimes been
                    ascribed to Suetonius, who, in his ascertained writings, has not the same force
                    of thought and expression; and, in Vitogsbprne’s Letters^ a very strong case
                    has* been made out in favour of Pliny the younger, although the latter has
                    produced nothing under his own name which can be compared with this admirable
                    dialogue. The treatise which Quintilian had composed on the causes of the
                    corruption of eloquence, is not the only one of his productions which has
                    perished.. We have also lost his elementary rhetoric, in two books; and there
                    remains no other authentic work of his but the Institutions, which had
                    themselves nearly disappeared. This treatise existed in the middle ages, when it
                    was known to and cited by Cassiodorus, Isidore of Seville, Loup de Ferrière, and
                    Vincent de Beauvais. The manuscript which Petrarch consulted appears to have
                    been in several respects defective; but that which, in 1419, Poggio discovered
                    in the Abbey of Saint Gall, restored Quintilian to the light of day. Amongst the
                    eminent services which Poggio rendered to letters, the discovery in question is
                    not one of the least important. It is beyond a doubt, however, that the literati
                    of the fifteenth century possessed at least defective copies of Quintilian; in
                    proof of which wè may refer to that letter of Leonardo Aretino, where he speaks
                    with so much emphasis of the new apparition of this classic, at the same time
                    declaring that he had long read and admired the half of the <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Orettoriae.</hi> These two manuscripts of
                    Saint Gall and Leonardo Aretino were the sources of all those since made, as
                    well as of the copies printed.</p><p>The first two editions of the Institutions of Quintilian appeared at Rome in
                    1470, the one printed by Udalricus Gallus, the other by Sweynheym and Pannartz,
                    and both in folio. The fifteenth century produced tén others; and amongst the
                    great number of the sixteenth may be distinguished, at Venice, thosé of the
                    Aiduses, 1514, in 4to, and at Paris, those of Vacosan, 1538, in folio; of Simon
                    de Colincs, 1541, in 4to; of Robert Etienne, 1542, in 4to; and of Mamert
                    Patisson, 1580, in 8vo. This last was revised by Pierre Pithou, who added to it
                    various readings, notes, and the hundred and forty-five small Declamations, of
                    which there had yet appeared only a hundred and thirty-six. Schrevelius, and
                    after him J. Frederic Gronovius, took charge of the edition which appeared at
                    Leyden and Rotterdam, *1665, in 8vo, <hi rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">notis</hi><hi rend="italic">variorum.</hi> Here all the
                    Declamations are joined to the Institutions, as in that of Strasbourg, which
                    appeared in 1698, in 4to. In 1715, Rollin published his Quintilian abridged,
                    Paris, <hi rend="italic">apud</hi> the Etiennes, in two vols. 12mo. In the
                    edition of 1720, which appeared at Leyden, in two vols. 4to, Peter Burmann
                    profited by the labours of his predecessors on this author, including the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">Quintilianei</hi> of Dodwell.
                    Capronnier published at Paris, 1725, an edition in folio, with a selection of
                    notes, and some critical observations, which offended Burmann, who replied, with
                    all the intemperance of an enraged grammarian. But the edition of Mathias
                    Gesner, Göttingen, 1738, in 4to, is more esteemed than either of the two
                    preceding. Then followed that of Barbou, 1769, in 12mo; that of Deux-Ponts,
                    1784, in four vols. 4to; and that of Leipzig, 1719-1815, in four vols. 8yo,
                    under the care of G. L. Spalding. .The Institutions have been translated into
                    the principal modern languages of Europe; into French, first by the Abbé de
                    Pure, and second by Gédoyn; into Italian by Orazio Toscanella; into English,
                    first by Guthrie, and next by Pastal; into German by Henke; into Spanish by two
                    professors of the Charitable Schools in Madrid; and into Danish by Schlegel. Of
                    the dialogue <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Causis</hi><hi rend="italic">corruptae Eloquentiae</hi> there are also several translations,
                    all of them French. The principal notices to be consulted respecting the life
                    and works of Quintilian are, the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">Quintilianei</hi> of Dodwell; Baylc⅛ Dictionary; Fabricius, <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Latina</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Gibert, <hi rend="italic">Jugements</hi><hi rend="italic">des Savants</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les lìhétenrs</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lycée</hi><hi rend="italic">of Laharpe.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
