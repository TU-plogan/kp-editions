                    the city of that name, and of the territory around it, though some portions are
                    encompassed by the dominions of Denmark and of Hanover. It has also, in union
                    with the state of Lubeck, the bailiwick of Bergedorf, with the town of that
                    name, containing 2000 inhabitants. The bailiwick of Ritzebuttel, of which
                    Hamburg is the sovereign, contains the town of that name, and also Cruxhaven,
                    and extends between the mouths of the rivers Elbe and Weser, over about
                    thirty-four square miles, and contains 4000 inhabitants.</p><p>The city of Hamburg, one of the greatest emporiums of foreign commerce on the
                    continent of Europe, is situated on the north bank of the river Elbe, about
                    seventy-five miles from its mouth, by which the larger class of merchant vessels
                    can reach it with facility. It was strongly fortified both on the land and the
                    river sides, but during the revolutionary wars its defences were found to
                    require so large a garrison, that since peace has restored it to independence,
                    the walls have been converted into pleasant gardens and promenades. It has two
                    lakes on its eastern side, the Great and Little Alster, on one of which a row of
                    trees forms a pleasant walk, called the Junfersteign or Young Lady’s Walk, which
                    is the scene of the recreation of the inhabitants, and on which are the best
                    hotels of the city.</p><p>The city, like other ancient towns, consists of narrow and crooked streets, of
                    houses large, lofty, and gloomy, and of canals communicating with the river, by
                    which the craft can convey goods from the ships on the river to the various
                    stores of the merchants. None of the public buildings display remarkable taste.
                    The stadthouse is large and heavy; and under it are those large wine-cellars
                    belonging to the city, which, before the French seized it, were filled with
                    nearly 400 large casks, containing about , sixty hogsheads each of Rhenish wine
                    of all ages, from 160 to one year old. There are in Hamburg sixteen Lutheran,
                    two Calvinist, and one Catholic church, besides chapels for the English, and for
                    some small sects. St Michael’s church is the most striking, and has a tower 450
                    feet in height. The bank, the exchange, the admiralty, the house of industry,
                    and other public buildings, are appropriated for their specific purposes, but
                    exhibit nothing peculiar in their architecture. During the French possession,
                    the military commandant compelled the city to construct a bridge across the
                    Elbe, which is near seven miles in breadth, at a vast expense; but upon
                    recovering their independence, it was taken down, and the timber of which it was
                    composed was sold. The intercourse with Harburg on the opposite bank is now
                    maintained by means of barques, steam-boats, and other craft, which pass to and
                    fro almost hourly. The government of Hamburg resides in the senate, which is
                    composed of thirty-six members, four of whom are termed burgomasters, four
                    syndics, one the prothonotary, one the keeper of the archives, and two
                    secretaries. They are chosen by the body of the citizens, who for this purpose
                    are formed into five divisions or classes. The administration of civil as well
                    as of criminal law is confided to three graduated courts, with a power of appeal
                    from the lower to the higher courts. The principles of the Roman law are acted
                    upon in the several courts. The police is well regulated, and maintains what is
                    called a city guard of 400. It maintains a regular military body of 1850 men,
                    besides an organized corps of city militia. The revenue is derived from personal
                    imposts on the different classes of burghers, and from tolls on foreign ships,
                    and slight duties on importation, amounting to about L. 150,000 yearly. The debt
                    owing by the state is about L.650,000, but it is annually diminishing. The
                    commerce of the city is carried on with other countries, both by Hamburg and
                    foreign-built ships. The former, constructed in their own ship-yards, are
                    commonly well built, of great strength and burden, and generally proceed to sea
                    well equipped. Many of them repair to the Greenland fishery, and return with
                    blubber, which is converted into oil at appropriate places on the verge of the
                    city. Other Hamburg ships repair to America, Asia, and the Mediterranean. The
                    greater part, however, of the ships that convey cargoes to Hamburg are
                    foreigners; the largest number are British, next to them are the North American,
                    and some are of almost every maritime country, all of whom have consuls to
                    protect their several interests. From the position of Hamburg, near the mouth of
                    a river navigable more than five hundred miles above its embouchure, it enjoys a
                    prodigious internal trade. It is the necessary entrepôt for a great part of
                    Prussia, for the whole of the kingdom of Saxony, for Bohemia, and for several
                    portions of other states in the interior of Germany. As these have no other
                    channel of intercourse with the sea, they obtain their sugar, coffee, rice,
                    tobacco, cotton, wine, rum, fruits, tea, besides articles of clothing, from the
                    stores deposited in Hamburg. They export also through the same channel their
                    corn, flax, linen yarn and cloths, wax, honey, rags, feathers, and the various
                    products of the soil. Thus in Hamburg, as in London, the commodities of every
                    country, and of every climate, may at all times meet both purchasers and
                    sellers.</p><p>The manufacturing industry of Hamburg is likewise very considerable. It is
                    exhibited in sugar refineries, in spinning-mills, hat-making, in linen, silk,
                    and velvet weaving, in calico-printing, snuff and tobacco preparing, whalebone
                    cutting, in making gold and silver articles, and in several other ways. The
                    schools are conducted in a beneficial manner for the education and improvement
                    of the inhabitants. A gymnasium or high school, a kind of college, has five
                    professors; and the Johanneum, of the same kind, has one director and seventeen
                    tutors, and both are well regulated, as are also the schools for the rudiments
                    of learning. The institutions for the relief of poverty, sickness, and old age,
                    are benevolently and economically supported. There are both French and German
                    theatres, and the gratifications of music and dancing are amply provided for.
