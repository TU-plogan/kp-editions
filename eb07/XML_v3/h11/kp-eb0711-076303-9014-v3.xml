                <p><label type="entry">HUTTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr James</hi></label>, physician
                    and naturalist, was the son of Mr William Hutton, a respectable merchant in
                    Edinburgh. He was born on the 3d of June 1726, and having lost his father while
                    he was very young, the charge of his education devolved on his mother, who
                    determined that it should be very liberal. Having finished his grammarschool
                    education at the high school of Edinburgh, he entered the university at the age
                    of fourteen, in the year 1740. He always considered himself as greatly indebted
                    to Professor Stevenson’s lectures on logic, not because they made him a
                    logician, but because they accidentally gave him a predilection for chemistry,
                    which he retained and cherished to the close of life. As an illustration of some
                    particular doctrine, the professor observed, that whilst the acids can singly
                    dissolve the baser metals, they must unite their strength before they can have
                    any influence upon gold; that metal is only to be dissolved by nitro-muriatic
                    acid, formerly denominated <hi rend="italic">aqua regia.</hi> From this remark
                    he found his thirst for chemical knowledge daily increase, and sought for
                    information from every quarter.</p>
                <p>He always evinced talents sufficient to encourage the prosecution of his studies;
                    but it was the wish of his friends that he should turn his attention to
                    business, and with this he complied, though contrary to his own inclinations. In
                    1743 he was put as an apprentice to Mr George Chalmers, writer to the signet,
                    where he soon discovered the ruling propensity of his mind; for when he should
                    have been transcribing law papers, he was amusing his fellow apprentices with
                    experiments in chemistry. Mr Chalmers perceiving this, generously freed him from
                    his obligations to serve him, desiring him to turn his attention to some other
                    employment more congenial to his views. He fixed his choice on the study of
                    medicine, as nearly related to his favourite pursuits; and after spending about
                    three years at Edinburgh, he studied two years at Paris; and returning home by
                    the Low Countries, took his degree of doctor of medicine at Leyden, in September
                    1749. The subject of his thesis was, <hi rend="italic">De Sanguine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Circulatione</hi><hi rend="italic">in Microcosmo.</hi></p>
                <p>When he arrived in London, about the end of 1749, he conceived the design of
                    settling in the world. He justly conjectured that Edinburgh did not hold out for
                    him any flattering prospects in the capacity of physician, as the principal
                    practice was in the hands of a few eminent physicians who had been long
                    established. He accordingly wrote to his friends in Edinburgh with much anxiety
                    as to the subject of his future prospects in life. To Mr James Davie, a young
                    man of nearly his own age, with whom he contracted a friendship which death only
                    could extinguish, he also communicated the perplexed state of his mind. Their
                    mutual knowledge of the nature of salammoniac led them to establish this
                    manufacture, which afterwards became a most lucrative concern to both. The
                    sentiments of Mr Davie were communicated to Dr Hutton while yet in London, which
                    probably was the chief reason why he resolved to abandon entirely the practice
                    of physic.</p>
                <p>On his return to Edinburgh, in the year 1750, he resolved to devote all his
                    attention to agriculture, which might probably be occasioned by his having
                    succeeded to a small property in Berwickshire on the death of his father.
                    Professor Playfair of the university of Edinburgh has ascribed it, and we
                    apprehend with great propriety, to the native simplicity of his character, and
                    the moderation of his views, which were always free from ambition. His
                    attachment to the life of a farmer was increased by his acquaintance with Sir
                    John Hall of Dunglass, a gentleman who was very ingenious, a friend and lover of
                    science, and one who well understood agriculture. Determined <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193649027" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9027-0764"/>to make himself master of
                    rural economy, Dr Hutton went into the county of Norfolk, where he continued for
                    some time in the house of a farmer, who was at once his preceptor and his host.
                    The farmer’s name was John Dybold, whose practical knowledge of agriculture Dr
                    Hutton always mentioned in terms of the highest respect.</p>
                <p>During his residence in this county, which was to him a paradise, he made
                    frequent excursions into different parts of England; and although information
                    respecting rural economy was the great and primary object of his pursuit, yet it
                    was here that he first commenced the study of mineralogy, to serve him as an
                    amusement on the road. He acquainted his friend Sir John Hall that he had become
                    remarkably fond of studying the surface of the earth, and was narrowly examining
                    every pit, or ditch, or bed of a river that fell in his way. The agricultural
                    knowledge he acquired in Norfolk increased his desire to pay a visit to
                    Flanders, the only place in Europe where husbandry can boast of very great
                    antiquity. He set out accordingly in the spring of 1754, and returned to England
                    during the summer of the same year. Soon after his arrival in London he
                    observed, in a letter to Sir John Hall, “had I doubted of it before I set out, I
                    should have returned fully convinced that they are good husbandmen in
                    Norfolk.”</p>
                <p>About this time he returned to his native country, and was for some time at a
                    loss what place to fix upon for the purpose of carrying into effect his
                    agricultural improvements. His own farm at length became his choice, and a
                    ploughman whom he had brought with him from Norfolk gave the first specimen of
                    excellent tillage ever exhibited in that part of Scotland. To Dr Hutton the
                    country is indebted for the introduction of the new husbandry into a county
                    where it may be said to have made more astonishing progress than in almost any
                    other part of the British empire. In the year 1764 he made an excursion into the
                    north of Scotland, in company with Commissioner, afterwards Sir George Clerk, a
                    man of singular worth and abilities. They proceeded to Crieff, Dalwhinnie, Fort
                    Augustus, and Inverness, and returned along the coast by Aberdeen to Edinburgh.
                    To increase his knowledge of geology was Dr Hutton’s chief aim in this tour, to
                    which he had now determined to pay the most unremitting attention. About the
                    year 1768 he devoted his whole time to scientific pursuits, and having met with
                    a favourable opportunity of letting his farm to advantage, he took up his
                    residence in Edinburgh. He now turned his attention very much to the study of
                    chemistry, and we believe he was the first who discovered that mineral alkali is
                    contained in zeolite. The same fact has since been confirmed by the experiments
                    of that celebrated mineralogist Μ. Klaproth, as well as by those of Dr Kennedy,
                    which have led to others of a similar nature.</p>
                <p>Dr Hutton gave to the world his first publication in 1777, which was a small
                    pamphlet of thirty-seven pages, entitled <hi rend="italic">Considerations on the
                    nature, quality, and distinctions of Coal and Culm.</hi> It was designed to
                    answer a question which began to be much agitated, whether the small coal of
                    Scotland is the same with the culm of England; and whether it ought to be
                    carried coastwise free of all duty. This created a keen contest between the
                    proprietors and revenue officers, the one insisting that it should, and the
                    other that it should not pay any duty. It was discussed before the board of
                    customs in Scotland, and even occupied the attention of the privy council. The
                    small coal of Scotland was finally exempted from the payment of duty, to which
                    the pamphlet of Dr Hutton greatly contributed.</p>
                <p>During a period of thirty years the attention of the doctor was turned towards
                    geological studies, to qualify him for writing on his favourite topic, a new
                    theory of the earth. Long before that theory made its appearance in the world,
                    he had completed the outline of it, which, however, was shown only to a few
                    confidential friends. He was first induced to publish it by communicating an
                    abridgment of it to the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Of the merits or defects of
                    this celebrated theory this is not the place to speak. It found a very able
                    advocate in Professor Playfair, whose Illustrations must ever be regarded as one
                    of the finest specimens of philosophical writing that our language can boast <hi
                    rend="subscript"> ¼</hi> of.</p>
                <p>A theory of rain from the same author appeared in the first volume of the
                    Edinburgh Transactions. He had made meteorology his study for a considerable
                    time; and his theory has been pronounced one of the few to be met with in that
                    department of knowledge which is deserving of consideration. Soon after this
                    publication, Dr Hutton gave the world, in three volumes quarto, An Investigation
                    of the Principles of Knowledge, and of the Progress of Reason from Sense to
                    Science and Philosophy. This work never attracted any notice. His elements of
                    agriculture, the result of much study and long experience, was the last work
                    which he seemed anxious to publish; but it was left in manuscript at his death,
                    which took place in 1797.</p>
                <p>To the name of philosopher Dr Hutton was most justly entitled, by reason of his
                    natural talents, acquisitions, and temper. The direction of his studies was
                    rather uncommon and irregular; but for that very reason it was peculiarly fitted
                    to develope that quick penetration and originality of thought, by which his
                    intellectual character was strikingly marked. The greatest acquisitions of
                    wealth and fortune never excited more lively sensations of pleasure in the minds
                    of men, than those which arose in the mind of Dr Hutton on hearing of a new
                    invention, or on being made acquainted with a new truth. This pleasure, which
                    appeared almost ridiculous to those who could not enter into his views, was not
                    confined to any one branch of science; for, in the language of Professor
                    Playfair, “he would rejoice over Watt’s improvements on the steam-engine, or
                    Cook’s discoveries in the South Sea, with all the warmth of a man who was to
                    share in the honour or the profit about to accrue from them.” Dr Hutton was not
                    exclusively attached to the company of men of letters, whose conversation was
                    entirely directed to subjects of literature; for he could occasionally unbend
                    himself, and enjoy the innocent hilarity of promiscuous company, when he freely
                    indulged in the gratification of his native pleasantry. An admirable account of
                    his life, written by Professor Playfair, was published in the Transactions of
                    the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</p>
