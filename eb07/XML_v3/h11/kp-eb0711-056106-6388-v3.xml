                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">HORAEA</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Antiquity,</hi> were
                    solemn sacrifices, consisting of fruits and other products of the earth, offered
                    in spring, summer, autumn, and winter, that heaven might grant mild and
                    temperate weather. These, according to Meursius, were offered to the goddesses
                    called *∩cα∕, or <hi rend="italic">Hours,</hi> who, being three in number,
                    attended upon the sun, presided over the four seasons of the year, and had
                    divine honours paid them at Athens.</p>
                <p>∏ORAPOLLO, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Horus Apollo,</hi> was, according to Suidas, a
                    grammarian of Panoplus in Egypt, who taught first at Alexandria, and afterwards
                    at Constantinople, under the reign of Theodosius, or about the year 380 of our
                    era. But as there were several persons of this name, it is uncertain whether the
                    grammarian of Panoplus, or some other Horus Apollo, was the author of the two
                    books still extant, “concerning the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians,” which Aldus
                    first published in Greek, 1505, in folio. These books have often been
                    republished since, with a Latin version and notes; but the best edition of them
                    is that of</p>
                <p>Cornelius de Pauw, which appeared at Utrecht in the year 1727, in 4to. Fabricius
                    is of opinion that the <hi rend="italic">Hieroglyphica</hi> did not emanate from
                    the grammarian of Panoplus, to whom indeed Suidas does not attribute it, but
                    that it is the production of another Horus Apollo, who flourished about fifteen
                    hundred years before Christ, and wrote upon hieroglyphics in the Egyptian
                    language, and from whose work an abstract was afterwards made, and translated
                    into the Greek language. And this much seems certain, that, Whatever may have
                    been the epoch of the original author, the two books of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hieroglyphics</hi> contain the substance of an older work, interspersed with
                    the fancies and conceits of a later age, when the true import of many of the
                    Egyptian symbols was no longer understood. These books, however, besides being
                    exceedingly curious in themselves, have derived a new and unexpected interest
                    from the discoveries of Dr Young and Μ. Champoilion; and though the former
                    somewhat hastily treated the explanations of Horus Apollo as mere puerilities,
                    the latter showed, in a very satisfactory manner, that some of them at least
                    were well founded, and susceptible of confirmation from the interpretation of
                    the hieroglyphical texts on the monuments; in other words, assuming these
                    explanations as correct, and combining such assumptions with the values of other
                    characters ascertained by different means, he found that the whole led to
                    results, the truth of which was either self-evident or demonstrable. At the same
                    time, it cannot be disputed that, in the abridged Greek version, there are many
                    absurdities that could never have had a place in the Egyptian original from
                    which it was made, and which must therefore be regarded as the interpolations of
                    an age when the knowledge of hieroglyphics had declined, and the values of the
                    more recondite symbols, particularly the tropical and aenigmatical, had been
                    lost. Besides, the analogies on which Horus Apollo endeavours to explain the
                    original employment and secondary import of the signs, are, many of them,
                    fanciful and remote, though sometimes ingenious; they proceed upon assumptions,
                    the truth of which cannot now be ascertained, and which are occasionally too far
                    fetched and ridiculous not to startle the most credulous. It is highly probable,
                    indeed, that, in the course of ages, the primary analogies were forgotten; that,
                    in practice, many of the signs were employed arbitrarily, without reference to
                    their precise original import, whether kuriological or tropical, usage
                    prevailing over strict principle; and that abbreviated forms, though possessing
                    in use a known and determinate value, were no longer susceptible of being
                    resolved and re-expanded into their original elements. But, with all these
                    drawbacks, this abridgment is highly curious in itself, and, in several
                    instances, has afforded a clue to explanations which, but for the assistance
                    afforded by it, might never have been discovered. See the article <hi
