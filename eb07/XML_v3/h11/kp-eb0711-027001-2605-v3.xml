                <p><label type="entry">HERCULES</label>, in fabulous history, a most renowned
                    Grecian hero, who after his death was ranked amongst the gods, and received
                    divine honours. According to the ancients, there were many persons of the same
                    name. Diodorus mentions three, Cicero six, and some authors extend the number to
                    more than forty. Of all these, one generally called the Theban Hercules is the
                    most celebrated; and to him, as may easily be imagined, the actions of the
                    others have been attributed. He is reported to have been the son of Jupiter by
                    Alemena, wife to Amphitryon, king of Argos, whom Jupiter enjoyed in the shape of
                    her husband whilst he was absent; and, in order to add the greater strength to
                    the child, made that amorous night as long as three. Amphitryon having soon
                    afterwards accidentally killed his uncle and father-in-law Electryon, was
                    obliged to fly to Thebes, where Hercules was born. The jealousy of Juno, on
                    account of her husband’s amour with Alemena, prompted her to attempt destroying
                    the infant. For this purpose she sent two serpents to kill him in the cradle,
                    but the young Hercules strangled both of them. He was early instructed in the
                    liberal arts, whilst Castor the son of Tyndarus taught him how to fight, Eürytus
                    how to shoot with a bow and arrows, Autolycus to drive a chariot, Linus to play
                    on the lyre, and Eumolpus to sing. Like the rest of his illustrious
                    contemporaries, he soon afterwards became the pupil of Chiron the centaur, and
                    under him rendered himself the most valiant and accomplished of the age. In the
                    eighteenth year of his age he resolved to deliver the neighbourhood of Mount
                    Cithaeron from a huge lion which preyed on the flocks of Amphitryon his supposed
                    father, and which laid waste the adjacent country. He went to the court of
                    Thespius, king of Thespis, who, sharing in the general calamity, received him
                    kindly, and entertained him during fifty days. The fifty daughters of the king
                    became mothers by Hercules during his stay at Thespis, and some say that it was
                    effected in one night. After he had destroyed the lion of Mount Cithaeron, he
                    delivered his country from the annual tribute of a hundred oxen which it paid to
                    Er-ginus. Such public services became universally known; and Creon, who then sat
                    on the throne of Thebes, rewarded the patriotic deeds of Hercules by giving him
                    his daughter in marriage, and intrusting him with the government of his
                    kingdom.</p>
                <p>Eurystheus, the son of Amphitryon, having succeeded his father, soon became
                    jealous of Hercules; and fearing lest he might be deprived of his crown, left no
                    means untried in order to get rid of him. Of this Hercules was not insensible,
                    because he was perpetually engaging him on some desperate expedition; and
                    therefore went to consult the oracle. But being answered that it was the
                    pleasure of the gods that he should serve Eurystheus twelve years, he fell into
                    a deep melancholy, which at last ended in furious madness. Among other desperate
                    actions which he perpetrated whilst afflicted with this disease, he put away his
                    wife Megara, and murdered all the children he had by her. As an expiation of
                    this crime, the king imposed upon him twelve labours surpassing the power of all
                    other mortals to accomplish, but which nevertheless our hero performed with
                    great ease. The favour of the gods had indeed completely armed him when he
                    undertook his labours. He had received a coat of armour and helmet from Minerva,
                    a sword from Mercury, a horse from Neptune, a shield from Jupiter, a bow and
                    arrows from Apollo, and from Vulcan a golden cuirass and brazen buskin, with a
                    celebrated club, of brass, according to the opinion of some writers.</p>
                <p>The first labour imposed upon him was the killing a lion in Nemea, a wood of
                    Achaia, the hide of which was prooí against any weapon, so that he was forced to
                    seize him by the throat and strangle him. He carried the dead beast on his
                    shoulders to Mycenae, and ever afterwards clothed himself with the skin.
                    Eurystheus was so astonished at the sight of this beast, and at the courage of
                    Hercules, that he ordered him never to enter the gates of tħe city when he
                    returned from his expeditions, but to wait for his orders without the walls. He
                    even made himself a brazen vessel into which he retired whenever Hercules
                    returned. The second labour was to destroy the Lernaean hydra, which had seven
                    heads according to Apollodorus, fifty according to Simonides, and a hundred
                    according to Diodorus. This <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642618"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2618-0271"/>. celebrated monster he first attacked with his
                    arrows; but soon afterwards he came to a close engagement, and by means of his
                    heavy club he destroyed the heads of his enemy. This, however, was productive of
                    no advantage; for as soon as one head was beaten to pieces by the club, two
                    immediately sprang up; and the labour of Hercules would have remained
                    unfinished, had he not commanded his friend Iolas to burn with a hot iron the
                    root of the head which he had crushed to pieces. This succeeded; Hercules became
                    victorious, and opening the belly of the monster, he dipped his arrows in the
                    gall, to render the wounds which he inflicted incurable. He was ordered in his
                    third labour to bring alive and unhurt into the presence of Eurystheus a stag,
                    famous for its incredible swiftness, its golden horns, and its brazen feet. This
                    celebrated animal frequented the neighbourhood of Oenoe; and Hercules was
                    employed for a whole year in continually pursuing it; but at last he caught it
                    in a trap, or when tired, or, according to others, by slightly wounding it and
                    lessening its swiftness. The· fourth labour was to bring alive to Eurystheus a
                    wild boar which ravaged the neighbourhood of Erymanthus. In this expedition he
                    destroyed the centaurs, and caught the boar by closely pursuing him through the
                    deep snow. Eurystheus was so frightened at the sight of the boar, that,
                    according to Diodorus, he hid himself for some days in his brazen vessel. In his
                    fifth labour Hercules was ordered to clean the stables of Augeas, where three
                    thousand oxen had been confined for many years. For his sixth labour he was
                    enjoined to kill the carnivorous birds which ravaged the country near the lake
                    Stymphalis in Arcadia. In his seventh labour he brought alive into Peloponnesus
                    a prodigious wild bull, which laid waste the island of Crete. In his eighth
                    labour he was employed in obtaining the mares of Diomedes, which fed upon human
                    flesh. He killed Diomedes, and gave him to be eaten by his mares, which he
                    brought to Eurystheus. They were sent to Mount Olympus by the king of Mycenae,
                    where they were devoured by the wild beasts; or, according to others, they were
                    consecrated to Jupiter, and their breed still existed in the age of Alexander
                    the Great. For his ninth labour die was commanded to obtain the girdle of the
                    queen of the Amazons. In his tenth labour he killed the monster Geryon, king of
                    Gades, and brought to Argos his numerous flocks, which fed upon human flesh.
                    This was in Iberia or Spain, in the furthest parts of which he erected his two
                    pillars, as the utmost limits of the then known world. These ten labours he
                    achieved, as the fable says, in about eight years. In this last expedition he is
                    likewise affirmed to have killed Antaeus, a famous giant of a monstrous size,
                    who, when weary with wrestling or labour, was immediately refreshed by touching
                    the earth. Hercules overcame him in wrestling, and slew him; and afterwards, on
                    his way through Egypt, the tyrant Busiris. This bloody man used to sacrifice all
                    his guests and strangers upon his altars; and designing to have done the same by
                    Hercules, was slain by him, together with all his attendants. His eleventh
                    labour was the carrying away the Hesperian golden apples kept by a dragon. The
                    last and most perilous of his labours was to bring upon earth the three-headed
                    dog Cerberus. Descending into hell by a cave on Mount Taenarus, he was permitted
                    oy Pluto to carry away his friends Theseus and Pirithous, who were condemned to
                    punishment in hell; and Cerberus also was granted to his prayers, provided he
                    made use of no arms but force only to drag him away. Hercules, as some report,
                    carried him back to hell after he had brought him before Eurystheus.</p>
                <p>Many other exploits are said to have been performed by Hercules. In particular,
                    he accompanied the Argonauts to Colchis before he delivered himself up to the
                    king of Mycenae. He assisted the gods in their wars against the giants; and it
                    was through him alone that Jupiter obtained a victory. He conquered Laomedon,
                    and pillaged Troy. When Iole, the daughter of Eurytus, king of (ĭchalia, of whom
                    he was deeply enamoured, was refused to his entreaties, he became the victim of
                    a second fit of insanity, and murdered Iphitus, the only one of the sons of
                    Eurytus who favoured his addresses to Iole. He was some time afterwards purified
                    of the murder, and his insanity ceased ,∙ but the gods persecuted him, and he
                    was visited by a disorder which obliged him to apply to the oracle of Delphi for
                    relief. The coldness with which the Pythia received him irritated him, and he
                    resolved to plunder Apollo’s temple and carry away the sacred tripod. Apollo
                    opposed him, and a severe conflict began, which nothing but the interference of
                    Jupiter with his thunderbolts could have prevented. He was upon this told by the
                    oracle that he must be sold as a slave, and remain three years in the most
                    abject servitude, to recover from his disorder. He complied; and Mercury, by
                    order of Jupiter, conducted him to Omphale, queen of Lydia, to whom he was sold
                    as a slave. Here he cleared all the country from robbers; and Omphale, who was
                    astonished at the greatness of his exploits, married him. Hercules had Agelaus
                    and Lamon by Omphale, from whom Croesus king of Lydia was descended. He also
                    became enamoured of one of Omphale’s female servants, by whom he had Alaeus.
                    After he had completed the years of his slavery he returned to Peloponnesus,
                    where he re-established on the throne of Sparta Tyndarus, who had been expelled
                    by Hippocoon. He became one of Dejanira’s suitors, and married her after he had
                    overcome all his rivals. He was obliged to leave Calydon, his father-in-law’s
                    kingdom, because he had inadvertently killed a man with a blow of his fist; and
                    it was on account of this expulsion that he was not present at the hunting of
                    the Calydonian boar. From Calydon he retired to the court of Ceyx, king of
                    Trachinia. The king received him and his wife with great marks of friendship,
                    and purified him of the murder which he had committed at Calydon. Hercules was
                    still mindful that he had once been refused the hand of Iolc; he therefore made
                    war against her father Eurytus, and killed him, with three of his sons. Iole
                    fell into the hands of her father’s murderer, and found that she was beloved by
                    Hercules as much as before. She accompanied him to Mount Oeta, where he was
                    going to raise an altar and offer a solemn sacrifice to Jupiter. As he had not
                    then the shirt and tunic in which he arrayed himself to offer a sacrifice, he
                    sent Lichas to Trachin to his wife Dejanira, in order to provide himself a
                    proper dress. Dejanira had some time before been attempted by the centaur
                    Nessus, as he was ferrying her over the river Euenus; and Hercules beholding it
                    from the shore, had given him a mortal wound with an arrow. The monster finding
                    himself dying, advised her to mix some oil with the blood which flowed from his
                    wound, and to anoint with it her husband’s shirt, pretending that it would
                    infallibly secure him from loving any other woman; and she, too well apprised of
                    his incon-staincy, had actually prepared the poisoned ointment accordingly.
                    Lichas coming to her for the garments, unfortunately acquainted her with his
                    having brought away lole; upon which Dejanira, in a fit of jealousy, anointed
                    his shirt with the fatal mixture. This had no sooner touched his body than he
                    felt the poison diffuse itself through his veins; the violent pain of which
                    caused him to disband his army, and to return to Trachin. His torment still
                    increasing, he sent to consult the oracle for a cure; and was answered, that he
                    should cause himself to be conveyed to Mount Oeta, and there rear up a great
                    pile of wood, and leave the rest to Jupiter. By the time he had obeyed the
                    oracle, his pains having become intolerable, he dressed himself in his martial
                    habit, flung himself upon the pile, and desired the bystanders to set fire to
                    it. Others say that he left the charge of it to his son Philoctetes, who, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642631" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2631-0272"/> having performed
                    his father’s command, had his bow and arrows given him as a reward for his
                    obedience. At the same time Jupiter, to be as good as his word, sent a flash of
                    lightning, which consumed both the pile and the hero; insomuch that Iolas,
                    coming to take up his bones, found nothing but ashes; from which they concluded
                    that he had passed from earth to heaven, and joined the gods. His friends showed
                    their gratitude to his memory by raising an altar where the burning pile had
                    stood. Menoctius the son of Actor offered him a sacrifice of a bull, a wild
                    boar, and a goat, and enjoined the people of Opus yearly to observe the same
                    religious ceremonies. His worship soon became as universal as his fame; and
                    Juno, who had once persecuted him with the utmost fury, forgot her resentment,
                    and gave him her daughter Hebe in marriage. Hercules has received many surnames
                    and epithets, either from the place where his worship was established, or from
                    the labours which he achieved. His temples were numerous and magnificent, and
                    his divinity revered. No dogs or flies ever entered his temple at Rome; and that
                    of Gades, according to Strabo, was always forbidden to women and pigs. The
                    Phoenicians offered quails on his altars; and as it was supposed that he
                    presided over dreams, the sick and infirm were sent to sleep in his temples,
                    that they might receive in their dreams the agreeable presages of their
                    approaching recovery. The white poplar was particularly dedicated to his
                    service.</p>
