                <p><label type="entry">HOMER</label>, the greatest, and perhaps also the least
                    known, of all poets. After so many ages, all the details of his life are still
                    an object of doubt, and even his existence is a problem. Some represent him as a
                    native of Egypt, the son of Damasgoras and Echras, whilst his nurse, a daughter
                    of Horus, priest of Isis, was a prophetess; according to these persons, he
                    played in his cradle with nine turtle doves, and the first accents of his voice
                    resembled the warbling of nine different kinds of birds. Others give him an
                    origin still more illustrious, and seek to ennoble the birth of the poet on whom
                    the far higher distinction of genius had conferred immortality. But whilst his
                    admirers compose for him these splendid genealogies, and even make him descended
                    in the right line from Apollo himself, his detractors see in him only a wretched
                    mendicant, who begged from town to town; a plagiary, who strolled about through
                    the world in quest of the authors who had, before his time, written on the war
                    of Troy; a man of slender parts, easily vanquished in the poetical contest with
                    Hesiod, and other poets. The most celebrated and the least ridiculous of these
                    pretended histories is that which, notwithstanding the doubts and conjectures of
                    several learned men, continues to be attributed to Herodotus; probably because
                    there is something piquant in the notion that the father of history had written
                    the life of the father of poetry. But, however this may be, since Strabo has not
                    disdained to cite as an authority this historical romance, nor the learned
                    Larcher to translate it, we conceive it necessary to exhibit a rapid analysis of
                    its contents.</p>
                <p>A certain Menalippus, by birth an Athenian, but settled at Cumae in Ionia, having
                    married the daughter of a citizen called Homyres, had by her a daughter named
                    Critheis, who after the death of her parents passed under the guardianship of
                    Cleonax, the friend of her father. This Cleonax abused the trust which had been
                    reposed in him, and Critheis became pregnant by her guardian. But the latter,
                    being anxious to conceal the condition of his ward, sent her to Smyrna, where
                    she gave birth to Homer, whom she called <hi rend="italic">Melesigenes</hi>
                    (from the river Meles, on the banks of which he was born), and where also she
                    was reduced to the necessity of spinning wool for subsistence. After this
                    misfortune, Phemius, who taught literature and music with credit at Smyrna,
                    having frequent occasion to see Critheis, who resided near him, conceived a
                    passion for the lady, married her, and adopted her child. Homer, having become
                    an orphan by the death of Phemius, succeeded to the fortune and the school of
                    his adoptive father, and in the capacity of teacher soon acquired great
                    reputation. But a shipmaster called Mentes, a lover of learning and poetry,
                    having become acquainted with Homer, persuaded the poet to abandon the school at
                    Smyrna, and to accompany him in his voyages. Homer, who already meditated the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> and wished to acquire personally the knowledge of
                    different countries, particularly those which he might have occasion to
                    describe, eagerly embraced the opportunity thus offered; and, during several
                    voyages, he failed not to treasure up in his mind whatever he deemed worthy of
                    being remembered. After having visited Italy and Spain, he landed on the island
                    of Ithaca, where he learned many particulars respecting Ulysses; he also visited
                    Egypt, whence he brought into Greece the names of the gods of that country, with
                    the chief ceremonies of their worship; and having finished his travels, he
                    returned to Smyrna, and there completed his <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> It was
                    his intention to remain in that place; but public favour having abandoned him,
                    he left the ungrateful country, and wandered through several cities in Asia
                    Minor, reciting his verses, and experiencing in turn good and evil fortune. At
                    length he established himself at Chios, where he opened a school, acquired some
                    property, married, became the father of two daughters, and was at last struck
                    with blindness. It was in this retreat that he composed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but being desirous to pass into Greece,
                    that he might display his genius upon a larger theatre, he died on his passage,
                    at Ios, one of the Sporades, the inhabitants of which raised on the sea-shore a
                    tomb to his memory.</p>
                <p>If in all this narrative there be little that is true, it contains nothing which
                    shocks in the recital; and if, in fact, it be merely a romance, it has at least
                    a certain degree of verisimilitude. Of all the cities which disputed the honour
                    of having given birth to Homer,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of which he is said to have been born. But, amidst so many different opinions,
                    the most probable seems to be that Homer first saw the light near Smyrna; that
                    his life was wandering, like that of the poets of his time; that, in the course
                    of his travels, he visited the Greek cities, composing hymns for the festivals
                    of the gods, and reciting his poems in the religious and public assemblies ∙,
                    that he lost his sight, a deprivation which he felt acutely, and deplored with
                    mournful pathos; and that he lived for some time at <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646141" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6141-0542"/>Chios, and died, at an
                    advanced age, in the smallnsland of Ios. But if he was reduced to indigence, and
                    sometimes compelled to beg an asylum during his life, the Smyrneans, Ptolemy
                    Philopator, and others, consecrated temples to him after his death, and the
                    Argives paid him divine honours.</p>
                <p>The epoch in which this great poet was born is not less obscure than the history
                    of his life. If we may believe some Greek writers, he was contemporary with the
                    siege of Troy, and had actually witnessed the events which he celebrated in
                    song. But Others place his birth at an epoch nearer to ours by eighty, a
                    hundred, and even upwards of three hundred years. Velleius Paterculus, who wrote
                    towards the close of the reign of Tiberius, or about the year 37 of our era,
                    affirms that nine hundred and fifty years had elapsed between the age of Homer
                    and his own time. Pliny and Juvenal, who flourished under Vespasian and
                    Domitian, reckon nearly a thousand years; and Solinus, with some degree of
                    confidence, assigns the epoch of the death of Homer by fixing it in the
                    seventy-second year after the capture and destruction of Troy. According to the
                    Arundelian marbles, he flourished in the tenth century before Christ, whilst
                    other authorities assign the eighth as the period to which he belonged. In this
                    conflict, or rather chaos, of different opinions, the learned Larcher, whose
                    judgment is an authority in matters of chronology, gives a calculation from
                    which it follows that Homer must have been born 884 years before our era; and
                    this epoch appears more reconcileable with the details of the brilliant and
                    sumptuous arts of a refined luxury, which he sometimes retraces, and which
                    appear but little compatible with the rudeness of an age approximating more
                    closely to the time of the Trojan war. The age of Homer indeed is pretty clearly
                    indicated by the following considerations: 1. At the funeral of Patroclus,
                    Achilles celebrates almost all the games which were subsequently in use at
                    Olympia in the most refined period of Greece. 2. The arts of casting in
                    bas-relief, and of engraving on metals, had already been invented, as is proved,
                    amongst other things, by the shield of Achilles; but neither Homer nor Moses
                    makes any mention of painting. 3. The delicious gardens of Alcinous, the
                    magnificence of his palace, and the sumptuousness of his table, prove that the
                    Greeks had already learned to admire luxury and splendour. 4. The Phoenicians
                    had already introduced ivory, purple, and incense from Arabia (as in the
                    description of the grotto of Venus in the Odyssey), <hi rend="italic"
                    >byssus</hi> or fine linen (perhaps cotton), and rich robes. 5. The carriage in
                    which Priam goes to seek Achilles is made of cedar; and the grotto of Calypso is
                    fragrant with that odoriferous wood. 6. The voluptuous baths of Circe indicate a
                    great advancement in luxury. 7. The young slaves of the suitors are described as
                    beautiful, graceful, and fairhaired, such precisely as the fastidiousness of
                    modern times requires as servants. 8. Men dress their hair as carefully as
                    women; a habit with which Hector and Diomede reproach Paris. 9. The Homeric
                    heroes eat nothing but roast meat, the most simple mode of cookery, demanding
                    only a brasier; and this custom continued in sacrifices. Boiled meat came into
                    use afterwards. 10. Lastly, Homer seems to have lived in an age when the strict
                    heroic or feudal right had fallen into disuse in Greece, and popular liberty had
                    begun to appear; for his heroes contract marriages with foreign women, bastards
                    succeed to their fathers’ thrones, and many other circumstances unite to show
                    that the heroic or feudal right had expired. From all these authorities, then,
                    we incline to the opinion of those who place the age of Homer long subsequent to
                    that of the Trojan war, though probably not so late as the reign of Numa, with
                    whom he is thought by some to have been contemporary.</p>
                <p>But the admitted difficulty, or rather impossibility, of arriving at any thing
                    positive in this respect, induced several writers to fly to the opposite
                    extreme; and whilst some assigned bases to the Homeric chronology which they
                    considered as certain, others called in question the very existence of Homer
                    himself, and supported their opinion with what they deemed incontestable
                    authorities and unanswerable reasonings. The boldest and most singular of these
                    paradoxes is that of Jacob Bryant, who does not, it is true, deny the existence
                    of Homer, but who makes him a native of Thebes in Egypt. In the view of this
                    learned person, Homer was a superstitious poet, who, after having grown old on
                    the banks of the Nile, purloined the poems of the ingenious <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phantasia</hi> deposited amongst the archives of the temple of Isis. According
                    to him, the events of the Iliad and Odyssey were, in the original, mere
                    reminiscences of Egyptian annals; but the adroit plagiary, it seems, transported
                    the scene into the Troad, and disguised under Greek names the gods and heroes of
                    the monarchy of the Pharaohs. Nor was this a solitary extravagance. A learned
                    Dutchman, Croesius, discovered, in the Odyssey, the history of the Israelites
                    under the patriarchs, and detected the capture of Jericho in the Iliad; whilst
                    another went still further, and gravely maintained that Homer and Hesiod were
                    natives of Belgium. But the hypothesis of Wolf is one of a far higher order; and
                    the weight of such a name must always command a serious consideration of those
                    opinions to which its sanction is deliberately attached.</p>
                <p>This distinguished critic and scholar, to whom we are indebted for the best
                    edition of Homer which has yet appeared, attempts, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prolegomena ad Homerum,</hi> to prove that the author of the Iliad and Odyssey
                    is an imaginary being; in Homer he sees a rhapsodist, and nothing more, a
                    minstrel who laid the foundations of that fabric which his successors from age
                    to age slowly raised until it obtained the elevation, symmetry, and unity which
                    we now admire in its general structure. This sceptical hypothesis had not the
                    merit of novelty; but it made little or no impression upon the learned until it
                    borrowed from the talent and erudition of Wolf all the authority necessary to
                    excite general attention, and to call for rigorous examination. Two Frenchmen,
                    of no great distinction, Hedelin and Perrault, are supposed to have led the way
                    in questioning the personal existence of Homer as the author of the Iliad, and
                    to have first suggested some hints of a theory respecting the composition of
                    that poem, which have since been developed with profound learning and wonderful
                    talent by Wolf and Heyne. Hedelin’s book, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conjectures</hi><hi rend="italic">Academiques, ou</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur l’Iliade,</hi> was published in 1715;
                    and that of Perrault appeared not long afterwards, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Parallèle des Anciens et des Modernes.</hi> Hedelin had the
                    exquisite judgment to compare the rhapsodies to the <hi rend="italic">chansons
                    du Pont-Neuf,</hi> and to maintain that the Iliad was made up “ex tragediis et
                    variis canticis de trivio, mendicoum et circulatorum,” in the manner of these
                    Parisian ballads. Not long afterwards Bentley expressed a similar opinion
                    respecting the history and compilation of the Iliad. “Homer,” says he, “wrote a
                    sequel of songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself, for small earnings and
                    good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment: the Iliad he made for the
                    men, and the Odysseis for the other sex. These loose songs were not collected
                    together in the form of an epic poem till about five hundred years after.” But a
                    still bolder theory was promulgated in the <hi rend="italic">Scienza Nuova</hi>
                    of Giambattista Vico the second and complete edition of which appeared at Naples
                    in 1730; a work which, from its enigmatical style and form, is one of the most
                    obscure books of modern times, but which was intended by its author to form a
                    <hi rend="italic">Novum Organon</hi> of <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>

                    e dividere i poemi dOmero nell’ Iliade e nell’ Odissea; onde s’ intenda, quanto

                    that the Homer of the Odyssey belonged to the west, and the Homer of the Iliad
                    to the north-east of Greece; and, in his <hi rend="italic">Discoverta del

                    Homer himself is an ideal personage, but that his poems are, if we may so
                    express it, the collective voice of the heroic age, in which all history was
                    poetry, and all poetry founded on history. “E certamente,” says this modern

                <p>The substance of this theory, as stated by Wolf and Heyne, is, that whether any
                    such person as Homer ever existed or not, the Iliad and the Odyssey were not
                    composed entirely by him or by any other person, but are compilations,
                    methodised by successive editors, of minstrelsies, the effusions of various
                    poets of the heroic age, and all having one common subject or theme; namely, the
                    war of Troy, and the exploits and adventures of the Grecian chiefs engaged in
                    it. The question as to whether ever lived or not, does not enter as an essential
                    ingredient into the theory so ably elucidated by Wolf and Heyne. That Homer
                    lived and Homer sung, is indeed denied by both, as it had previously been by
                    Giambattista Vico but, even if the fact of his personal existence were admitted
                    to the fullest extent desired by his unitarian admirers, the material question
                    as to the dispersion of the separate books or rhapsodies, and their
                    rein-corporation, or rather their primary construction, into one uniform whole,
                    would still remain to be settled. The theory of which we have traced the origin
                    and development may no doubt appear at first view startling and paradoxical;
                    but, however unlike to any thing of which we may have heard, and however
                    impossible it may be thought in the age in which we now live, there are
                    arguments in its favour, which, with all unprejudiced inquirers, will ever save
                    it from neglect or contempt, and which, in any view, merit the most serious
                    consideration. Of these we shall now proceed to lay a condensed abstract before
                    our readers.</p>
                <p>Wolf, Heyne, and their numberless followers in Germany, contend that the argument
                    derived from the apparently undoubting belief of the earliest as well as the
                    greatest writers of Greece, after the Homeric age, and from the general consent
                    of all mankind in the same faith ever since, proves a great deal too much: That,
                    besides the Iliad, Odyssey, Batrachomyomachia, Hymns, and Epigrams, at least
                    twenty other poems<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These
                    were, <hi rend="italic">Amazonia, Thebaid, Arachnomachia, Geranomachia,

                    Homer: That many passages of these poems which are still preserved, contain
                    variations from, and even direct contradictions of, the tenor of the Iliad:
                    That, in the age of Herodotus, the Cyprian verses, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epigoni,</hi> were commonly considered as Homeric poems: That Thucydides quotes
                    the Hymn to Apollo exactly in the same tone in which he quotes or speaks of the
                    Iliad: That nevertheless the general opinion now is that these hymns are not by
                    the author of the Iliad: That Plato expels Homer from his republic, on account,
                    amongst many others, of a well-known passage in the Odyssey:<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">A</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> xi. 487∙</p></note>
                    That nevertheless many of the ancients, as well as moderns, who admitted the
                    genuineness of the Iliad, doubted or denied that of the Odyssey: That there is
                    nothing in this weakness of critical discernment, even when imputed to
                    Herodotus, Thucydides, and Plato, which should surprise a Hellenist, seeing
                    that, in the times of republican independence, the investigation of the
                    genuineness of the national compositions formed no part of scientific criticism,
                    much less of the general duties of the philosopher and historian: That as
                    Herodotus and Thucydides quote Homer merely as an historical authority, so Plato
                    censures him for moral or political reasons; and hence a reference to his poems
                    was equally necessary for both purposes, whether the common belief as to their
                    origin were well founded or the contrary: That, in modern Europe, at the period
                    of the revival of letters, this branch of criticism became of paramount
                    importance, and conferred the greatest benefits on awakening learning, by
                    rescuing the genuine relics of ancient Greece and Rome from the mass of fiction
                    and interpolation which had been accumulated on them during seven centuries of
                    barbarism: That, in fact, the early Greeks knew no literature but their own;
                    and, considering how little attention even we, with our different habits and
                    capabilities, ever paid to the mere external history of our earliest works,
                    until a very recent period, we have no reason to think it unaccountable that a
                    chronicler, historian, or philosopher of ancient Greece, should either never
                    have doubted, or but hinted doubts, as to the genuineness of a body of popular
                    poetry, supposed to be of Asiatic growth, and of an antiquity open to nothing
                    but conjecture.</p>
                <p>The Wolfian hypothesis rests also upon grounds of external probability. “It is
                    further said,” observes Mr Coleridge, “that the art of writing, and the use of
                    manageable materials, were entirely, or all but entirely, unknown in Greece and
                    its islands at the supposed date of the composition of the Iliad and

                    man, with no other help but his own and others’ memory, than that it should in

                <p>This is undoubtedly a strong case; nor is it easy to see how the force of the
                    argument urged by Wolf and his followers can be resisted, unless the facts upon
                    which it mainly depends be disproved. We may be powerfully impressed with the
                    grandeur and <hi rend="italic">unity</hi> displayed in the Iliad; this
                    impression may be strengthened by more frequent study of the general effect of
                    the poem; and we may feel reluctant to abandon the ancient faith, with which so
                    many interesting recollections and associations are entwined: But, as long as
                    the external facts remain unrefuted, “the internal evidence of the unity of
                    design” will never prevail over the conclusion deduced from them. Mr Milman,
                    indeed, seems to think, that, on the general question of the origin of letters,
                    the mass of authorities collected with great industry, and the arguments urged
                    with equal ingenuity by Kreuser,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    recent introduction of writing into Greece, that is, scarcely prior to the time
                    of Solon. But he admits it to be “undoubtedly embarrassing that, if writing was
                    common in the days of Homer, no allusion, except in one doubtful passage,<note

                    might at first sight appear to be necessarily mingled up with all the
                    transactions of war or pacification, of public and private life.” Besides, the
                    precise fact, whether alphabetical characters were absolutely unknown in Greece
                    in the age of Homer, is declared by Heyne to be immaterial to the argument;
                    because, whether known or not, it is certain that down to a period later by two
                    centuries than the latest date assigned as the era of Homer, there were no
                    materials which a Greek author could have employed for the ordinary purposes of
                    composition. It is of no avail to prove that some Greeks had the art of carving
                    on marble or on wood; nor is the difficulty removed by presenting a blind poet
                    with a pen of iron and some plates of lead. If there be any weight in the
                    objection, that no one person could have composed the Iliad and the Odyssey by
                    the force of mere mental retention alone, nothing will ever dispose of it except
                    a demonstration that the poet had some manageable substance upon which to write.
                    The main point, as Mr Coleridge has most justly observed, is not whether poems
                    of such length might not be preserved by memory, <hi rend="italic">when once
                    composed,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">whether they could have been constructed,
                    in the mind of the bard, without the assistance of letters and writing
                    materials,</hi> to record the fleeting thoughts which passed in quick
                    succession, and were succeeded by others hurrying forward in unceasing and
                    inexhaustible rapidity. The preservation of poems by memory, when once composed,
                    and their oral transmission from age to age, may at once be conceded, because it
                    leaves unimpaired the force of the argument founded upon the moral impossibility
                    of any one person having both composed and retained in his mind, as well as
                    communicated to others, as many as thirty thousand verses.</p>
                <p>The more sagacious and candid of those who maintain the unity and authorship of
                    Homer have accordingly felt and acknowledged the force of Wolf’s argument. It is
                    indeed admitted by Milman, one of the ablest of his opponents, that even
                    Kreuser’s argument in favour of the early introduction of letters and writing
                    into Greece leaves the main question undecided; and, besides, Kreuser himself is
                    a follower of Wolf upon the fundamental point in dispute. In an essay read to
                    the academy of Berlin, the author, Μ. de Mérian, adopts the same position as
                    Wolf; he denies to Homer the use of writing materials, but says the poet might
                    have done very well without them. This, however, is cutting the knot, not
                    resolving it. The material issue is, Could the poet do at all without them? Of
                    the cases cited by Μ. Mérian, one is not in point, and the other is unsupported
                    by authority. After many irrelevant instances of learning by heart from book or
                    recitation, he alleges the example of the Italian improwisatori, and that of
                    Tasso, who, he says, composed four hundred stanzas of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gierusalernme</hi><hi rend="italic">Liberata,</hi> equal to 3200 verses,
                    without ever writing them down. The story, however, is not authenticated by any
                    kind of evidence; and unless there be Tasso’s own word for it, who will believe
                    that he never tried one of those stanzas in a written form? Besides, it is well
                    known that, during many years of learned leisure, Tasso meditated and arranged
                    the plan of his poem, of which he drew up numerous sketches; so that these four
                    hundred stanzas were, at most, but the filling up of a picture, the outline of
                    which had already been prepared. As for the improwisatori, it is sufficient to
                    observe that, with a tolerable stock of common-places in their heads, and with a
                    language on their tongues, one half, of which rhymes to the other, these people
                    may, with a little practice and a very small exertion of skill, pour forth
                    verses, as they are called, to almost any extent. But what, we would ask, has
                    such a trick as this to do with the mental composition and correction of thirty
                    thousand hexameters of the Iliad and Odyssey? Cesarotti, it is true, talks
                    gravely of Macpherson’s <hi rend="italic">Ossian,</hi> which he translated, as
                    an instance of poetry of considerable extent, composed by a poet to whom writing
                    was unknown. This, however, is producing one hypothesis which, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193646180" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6180-0545"/>to say the least of it, is
                    doubtful, to prove another the truth of which is denied. In fact, all
                    unprejudiced critics are pretty well agreed as to the history and character of
                    the English Ossian; and it is now generally understood and believed, that
                    Macpherson treated the legendary poems ascribed to the Celtic bard, much in the
                    same fashion as the Pisistratidae are supposed to have done in the case of those
                    attributed to Homer, fusing a number of detached fragments into one mass,
                    filling up interstices and vacuities with a sort of cement prepared by himself,
                    and thus imparting to the whole (as in <hi rend="italic">Temora)</hi> an <hi
                    rend="italic">unity,</hi> which certainly could not have been predicated of the
                    materials with which he worked. The Ossian of Macpherson is, in truth, an
                    instance in point against the principle stated by Ccsarotti, or rather in favour
                    of its opposite. In the affecting narrative of the imprisonment of Silvio

                    we are indeed informed that he and his friend Maroncelli, during their
                    confinement, composed many thousand verses, without the use of writing
                    materials, and with nothing but the power of memory upon which to rely for the
                    preservation of their compositions. This is no doubt one of the best
                    authenticated instances of the power of memory in composition which is anywhere
                    to be found. But still, before even this can be admitted as a pertinent example,
                    it will be necessary to see the verses so composed, and to determine the
                    relation which they bear to the poetry of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for it is
                    evident that the point in dispute cannot be affected by the mere fact of any
                    number of loose lines having been composed under circumstances so extraordinary,
                    by men entirely separated from the living and active world. Improvisation by
                    itself is nothing. The question is, could a couple of epics, possessing all the
                    qualities requisite in the very highest species of poetry, have been composed
                    and preserved without the aid of writing materials? This is the real issue.
                    Milton was struck with blindness as well as Homer; but the verses which <hi
                    rend="italic">he</hi> dictated, after he had been deprived of his sight, were
                    immediately committed to writing by faithful and devoted amanuenses. Would they
                    ever have been heard of, if Milton had been as destitute and helpless as Homer
                    is represented to have been?</p>
                <p>Further, it is urged that the artificial construction of the plots of the Iliad
                    and Odyssey, so commonly relied on as an argument for the unity of these poems,
                    is in fact a complete demonstration that their present form cannot be genuine.
                    That the cyclic poets who were contemporary with Homer, or followed in the order
                    of time his age, all composed their works on a plan the very reverse of that
                    which the critics praise so highly in the Iliad and Odyssey, is established by
                    the censure of Horace, and the testimony of all antiquity. This may be seen, as
                    well from the poem of Quintus Smyrnaeus, which is founded on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aetliiopis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ilias Parva,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ilii Excidium</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Aretinus and Lesches,
                    as from the epitomes of many other old cyclic poems still preserved in the
                    fragments of the <hi rend="italic">Chrestoma-thia</hi> of Proclus, if such
                    evidence be not superfluous. The authors of the Dionysiacs, Thebaids,
                    Epigoniads, Nanpac-tica, Genealogies, and other works of that sort, never
                    dreamed of rushing <hi rend="italic">in medias res,</hi> as it is said that
                    Homer does; never laid distant trains for future catastrophes; never carried on
                    parallel lines of narrative; never concerned themselves about the critical canon
                    of a beginning, a middle, and an end. They uniformly commence <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab ovo,</hi> and conclude when the war or the pedigree is at an end. They have
                    no hero in favour of whose dramatic superiority all others are depressed; they’
                    have no single primary action, relieved by episodes; they arc ignorant of
                    concealments, recognitions, windings-up, and all other cognate artifices. One
                    story follows another, in the order of mere history, just as in the Indian and
                    Persian epics, in the northern Eddas, in the Spanish poem of the Cid, and in the
                    early chronicles of every nation with which we are acquainted; the skill and
                    fire of the poet are shown, not in the artifice of grouping a multitude of
                    figures into one picture, but in raising admiration by the separate beauty of
                    each successive image or delineation. They tell the tale as the tale had been
                    told to them, leaving out nothing. Now, if the Iliad and the Odyssey, such as we
                    actually have them, were previously in existence, or if any poems so constructed
                    were publicly known, soon after the latest date assigned to Homer, how are we to
                    account for the undeniable fact that this splendid example did not find a single
                    imitator amongst the contemporarics or the followers of Homer for centuries
                    afterwards? It can scarcely be said that no poet arose of sufficient genius to
                    effect this. The names of many of the old heroic poets were celebrated in the
                    best ages; and to rival the plots must certainly have been round an easier task
                    than to equal, far less excel, the poetry of the Homeric epics. Some attempt of
                    this sort might at least have been expected; and what the lowest poetaster now
                    does first, and sometimes does best, could not certainly exceed the powers of
                    Hesiod and the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Theogonia.</hi> Yet we mc⅛t with
                    nothing of the kind. “Quintus Smyrnaeus, or Calaber,” says Mr Coleridge,
                    “composed his books as a supplement to the unfinished Iliad. We may not rate
                    Quintus very highly as a poet; but have we any right to set him down for such a
                    heavy fool as to have ventured upon the completion of a divine poem, which
                    Aristotle had declared absolutely perfect in its plot, if the numerous examples
                    of former writers of supplements had not been lying before his eyes? Suppose,
                    for a moment, that the Iliad handed down to us had ended, as surely it might
                    have ended, in the death of Hector, and the return of Achilles in triumph to the
                    Grecian camp; and that the substance of the last two books had been added by
                    Quintus in the beginning of his supplement; should we have commended him the
                    more for sagaciously detecting the want of finish, and the premature termination
                    of the narrative? And is it not possible that Aristotle might have lauded the
                    plot of the Iliad nothing the less, if the catalogue of the ships and troops had
                    never been inserted ?”</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, then, Homer, according to this hypothesis, was the ideal or
                    heroic character of the Greek people, relating its own history. This is the
                    general deduction from all the reasonings of Wolf and his followers, who contend
                    that every thing which is absurd and improbable in Homer, as hitherto conceived,
                    becomes appropriate and even necessary in the Homer thus supposed. 1. In
                    reference to the uncertainty respecting the country of Homer, they observe, that
                    if the people of Greece contended amongst themselves for the honour of having
                    given birth to him, and if all claimed him as a citizen, it was because they
                    were themselves Homer. 2. The poverty and blindness of Homer were those of the
                    rhapsodists, who, being blind (whence their Ionian name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ομr,οοi),</hi> had the more powerful memories. 3. Homer composed the Iliad in
                    his youth, that is to say, in the infancy of Greece, when she was all burning
                    with sublime passions, with pride, resentment, and revenge. Greece, therefore,
                    in her infancy, would admire <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646193"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6193-0546"/>Achilles, the type or hero of force. 4. But Homer
                    composed the Odyssey in his old age, when the passions of the Greeks began to be
                    cooled by reflection, the mother of prudence. Greece would, therefore, naturally
                    admire Ulysses, the type or hero of wisdom. In the youth of Homer, the pride of
                    Agamemnon, the insolence and violence of Achilles, pleased the Greeks; in his
                    old age they had begun to take pleasure in the delights of Calypso, the
                    voluptuousness of Circe, the songs of the Sirens, and the sports of the suitors
                    of Penelope. 5. The individual character of Homer having thus disappeared, the
                    poet, or rather the poetry, becomes at once justified from all critical censures
                    respecting the lowness of the thoughts, the grossness of the manners, the
                    barbarism of the comparisons, the idioms, the licenses of versification, the
                    discrepancy of dialects, and finally, for having elevated men to the rank of
                    gods, and degraded gods below the level of men. 6. To Homer is assigned the
                    privilege of having alone possessed the faculty of inventing the poetical
                    fictions of Aristotle and the heroic characters of Horace; the privilege of an
                    incomparable eloquence in his savage similes, his terrible pictures of the dying
                    and the dead, and his sublime delineation of the passions, with the merit of a
                    style at once simple, grand, and picturesque. All these qualities belonged to
                    the heroic age of Greece. 7. Homer is henceforth assured of three immortalities;
                    of having been the founder of civilisation in Greece, the father of all the
                    other poets, and the source of the different systems of philosophy afterwards
                    promulgated in his country; titles which could not possibly belong to Homer such
                    as the world has hitherto imagined him. The Homer of the schools could not be
                    regarded as the founder of Greek civilisation, because, from the epoch of
                    Deucalion and Pyrrha, that civilisation had been commenced by the institution of
                    marriage. He could not be regarded as the father of poets, because Orpheus,
                    Amphion, Linus, and Musaeus, to whom some chronologers add Hesiod, had
                    flourished before his time. According to Cicero, there were many heroic poets
                    prior to Homer; and Eusebius names Philammon, Thamyris, Demodocus, Epimenides,
                    Aristeas, and others. Nor, finally, could he be the source of the Greek
                    philosophy; for the philosophers did not derive their doctrine from, but
                    engrafted them upon, the Homeric fables. Homer only afforded to the philosophers
                    an occasion of meditating on the highest truths of metaphysics and morals,
                    giving them, in addition, great facility in illustrating their
                    speculations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To the
                    praise here bestowed on Homer, may be subjoined that of having been the most

                    our times. “His poems,” says Mr Coleridge, “are two great treasure-houses, in

                    Homeric poems has been similar to that of the laws of the Twelve Tables. On the
                    <hi rend="superscript"> one</hi> hand, the world has ascribed those laws to the
                    Athenian legislator, from whom, it is said, they passed to Rome, whilst no one
                    has seen in them the history of the common law of the heroic tribes of Latium;
                    on the other, the world has believed the poems of Homer to have been the work of
                    the rare genius of an individual, instead of discovering in them the history of
                    the common law of the heroic people of Greece.” <hi rend="italic">(General

                <p>The more we read the more we admire the two immortal poems of Homer, and the less
                    are the generality of persons inclined to doubt that they were conceived by one
                    and the same mind; whilst the infinite art by which the innumerable parts are
                    connected and arranged forms perhaps the most remarkable feature in the Iliad
                    and Odyssey, as well as the best argument for the unity of their authorship, and
                    the individuality of Homer. In these poems, according to Mr Milman, “there is
                    nothing of the elaborate art of a later age; it is not a skilful compiler
                    arranging his materials so as to produce the most striking effect; the design
                    and the filling up appear to be evidently of the same hand; there is the most
                    perfect harmony in the plan, the expression, the versification; and we cannot,
                    by any effort, bring ourselves to suppose that the separate passages, which form
                    the main interest of the poem, the splendid bursts, or more pathetic episodes,
                    were originally composed without any view to their general effect; in short,
                    that a whole race of Homers struck, as it were by accident, all these glorious,
                    living ' fragments, which lay in a kind of unformed chaos, till a later and
                    almost mightier Homer commanded them to take form, and combine themselves into a
                    connected and harmonious whole.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    154.</p></note> Another circumstance to which the advocates of the unity and
                    authorship of Homer attach very great importance, is the perfect consistency of
                    the characters in the different parts of the poem. It is quite inconceivable,
                    they think, that there should have been a sort of conventional character
                    assigned to different heroes by the minstrels of Greece. “To take Mr Coleridge’s
                    illustration of the ballads on Robin Hood,” says Mr Milman; “in all these, bold
                    Robin is still the same frank, careless, daring, generous, half-comic
                    adventurer: So Achilles may have been by prescription,</p>

                <p>Ajax heavy and obstinate, Ulysses light and subtle; but can we thus account for
                    the finer and more delicate touches of character, the sort of natural
                    consistencies, which perpetually identify the hero, or even the female, of one
                    book, with the same person in another ?”</p>
                <p>Some of those persons who have written upon the same side of the question as Mr
                    Milman, and indeed Mr Milman himself, are inclined to doubt whether the poems of
                    Homer, consistent and harmonious as they now appear, could have been! preserved
                    by tradition alone; and an able French critic has condemned the opinion “qui, en
                    admettant qu’Homère soit l’auteur de l’Iliade et de l’Odyssée, veut qu’il en
                    avait jamais écrit un seul vers, et que restés, en dépôt, dans sa mémoire, il
                    les allait réciter de ville en ville, afin d’obtenir de la pitié et de
                    l’admiration publique, les secours que sollicitait sa profonde indigence.
                    Supposer,” adds the same writer, “ &lt;jue la tradition orale a scule conserve
                    deux poèmes aussi étendus, pendant le long espace de temps écoulé entre Homère
                    et les premières editions connues; attribuer aux rhapsodes une portion
                    considerable de ses ouvrages, c’est franchir toutes les bornes d’une critique
                    raisonablc. Comment se flatter, d’ailleurs, d’avoir fait une découverte echappée
                    aux critiques de l’antiquité les plus célèbres, et qui ont apporté un soin si
                    religieux à la révision des poèmes d’Homère, depuis Aristote jusqu’à cet
                    Aristarque, dont le nom est devenu synonyme de critique par excellence?” All
                    this, however, seems to be more plausible than sound. For, in the first place,
                    if the art of writing was unknown in Greece in the age of Homer, or at least
                    confined to carving on wood, or engraving on stone or metal, it follows that,
                    for a certain period, the poems of Homer must have been preserved by oral
                    tradition, because there practically existed no other method by which they could
                    be handed down from one age to another. If it be impossible that two poems so
                    extensive could have been preserved by oral tradition, then it is at least
                    equally so that they could have been composed at the period to which they are
                    commonly referred. Secondly, it is no argument whatever against a discovery in
                    criticism to tell us that, if it were well founded, it could not have escaped
                    the most celebrated critics of antiquity, from Aristotle to Aristarchus, who
                    had. applied themselves, with religious care, to the revision of Homer. This
                    kind of argument, if sound, would cut down almost every discovery. Bacon
                    discovered and explained the method of reasoning by induction, which had escaped
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646206" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6206-0547"/>Aristotle and
                    all his successors; Newton discovered the law of gravitation, which, in its
                    application to explain the motions of the heavenly bodies, and connect the whole
                    solar system, had never been so much as suspected even by the most illustrious
                    of his predecessors; Young, with rare sagacity, found out the method of
                    interpreting the Egyptian writings, monumental and civil, which so many persons
                    had, through a long tract of ages, sought for in vain. But were it now to be
                    said, in objection to these discoveries, as Μ. Durivier has said in opposition
                    to the hypothesis of Wolf and his followers, how could their authors flatter
                    themselves with having found out what so many illustrious men had failed to
                    discover? the answer would be, that each of these discoveries must be judged of
                    by the direct evidence produced in support of it; that the increase of knowledge
                    is progressive; and that, with regard to the particular case in question, the
                    science of criticism is, in a great measure, one of modern growth.</p>
                <p>To this succinct analysis of the different opinions entertained respecting Homer,
                    succeeds naturally the critical history of his works. He had composed, or at
                    least the ancients attributed to him, a large number, of which a catalogue may
                    be found in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Groeca</hi> of Fabricius, and in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathia</hi> of Proclus. Of the greater part there
                    remain only the titles, about which even the learned are not always agreed. We
                    should doubtless have little to regret in the loss of the Batrachomyomachia, a
                    burlesque production, in which, with the exception of some details and verses,
                    we find no traces of the genius and style of Homer; or in that of the Hymns,
                    which are twenty-four in number, amongst which two or three have been supposed
                    to belong to Homer. On this subject the reader may consult two critical letters
                    of Rhunken, in his second edition of the Hymn to Ceres, Leyden, 1782;
                    Mitscherlich, Ilgen, Matthiae, and Hermann, have also published editions of
                    these Hymns, which are valuable for the critical accuracy of the text, and the
                    conjectures as to their supposed dates and authors. The epigrams and smaller
                    poems bear no stamp of authenticity, and hence we may dispense with entering
                    into any particular statement concerning them. It is in the Iliad and the
                    Odyssey alone where we must seek for, and where we will find, the genius of
                    Homer in all its force, and in all its splendour and originality.</p>
                <p>If we can credit the statements of Aelian and Plutarch, it was Lycurgus, the
                    celebrated Lacedaemonian lawgiver, who first collected, in Ionia, the scattered
                    fragments of the poems of Homer, united them together, and introduced them into
                    the Peloponnesus. But the glory of arranging them in the order in which they
                    have reached us was, it seems, reserved for Pisistratus, who brought them to
                    Athens, and for his son Hipparchus, who ordained that they should be recited
                    annually during the Panathenaic festival. This fact, related in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hipparchus,</hi> a dialogue attributed to Plato, is confirmed by
                    the authority of Cicero, who concedes to Pisistratus, seconded by the
                    poet-philosopher Solon, the merit of having put into order the verses of Homer,
                    which he found in a state of confusion. After the edition of Hipparchus may be
                    mentioned that which Aristotle revised by the advice of Alexander, and which the
                    conqueror, an enlightened friend of letters, deposited in the precious casket
                    which he had found amongst the treasures of Darius. But notwithstanding the
                    authority of Plutarch, who sometimes placed too much reliance on memoirs
                    evidently unworthy of confidence, this famous edition of the casket had,
                    according to Strabo, been revised by Calisthenes and Anaxarchus, and was only
                    presented to Alexander by his illustrious instructor. It is possible, however,
                    that a second revision, enriched with the remarks of Aristotle himself, may have
                    been made under the eyes of the Macedonian conqueror. Before Aristotle, Cynethus
                    of Chios, Stesimbrotus, Theagenes, and Antimachus of Colophon, had already
                    undertaken to comment on the text of Homer. The scholia of Venice, published by
                    the learned Villoison, leave no doubt whatever as to this fact. We have not the
                    same certainty respecting the editions of Cassander king of Macedonia, and
                    Ptolemy Evergetes II. king of Egypt, whatever may have been said by Athenaeus,
                    Casaubon his learned interpreter, and the second Burmann. But it was the school
                    of Alexandria which began to give truly classical editions of the works of
                    Homer; Zenodotus of Ephesus, Aristophanes of Byzantium, Aristarchus, and Crates,
                    occupied themselves not only with the revision, but also with the critical
                    explanation, of the text; and Aristarchus is said to have first divided the
                    Iliad and the Odyssey each into twenty-four books, a division which appears so
                    natural and judicious that it has been constantly adopted ever since. So much
                    for the Greek editors of Homer; let us now pass on to his interpreters.</p>
                <p>At their head stands Didymus, a grammarian of Alexandria, who flourished under
                    the reign of Augustus. He had enriched several poems with his commentaries; but
                    the scholia on the Iliad and Odyssey printed with his name are evidently not
                    his, and are neither of the same epoch nor by the same hand; in fact, he is
                    often cited in them himself, and mention is made of writers who flourished at a
                    subsequent period. With regard to their literary merit, the remarks, purely
                    grammatical, are only simple glosses on the text; but those which relate to the
                    subject-matter are not without ability, and may be consulted with advantage.
                    This compilation, extracted partly from Didymus, and partly from various other
                    commentators whose names are not mentioned, contains what are usually called the
                    <hi rend="italic">lcs'ser scholia.</hi> Those on the Iliad were published, for
                    the first time, at Rome, in 1517, folio, and those on both poems united, at
                    Venice, in 1528, in two vols. 8vo. Soon afterwards,, that is, from 1542 to 1550,
                    appeared the great work of Eustathius on Homer, which was printed at Rome, in
                    four vols. folio, and included the beautiful table of Devaris. This work, which
                    is merely a compilation from the scholiasts and commentators who had preceded
                    the learned archbishop of Thessalonica, presents nevertheless an immense
                    repertory of literary and grammatical erudition. But it could have been wished
                    that a more severe criticism had directed this vast compilation, or that an able
                    and practised hand had made from it a judicious extract, which might have put
                    into circulation riches almost unknown, or only accessible to the small number
                    of persons who are profoundly skilled in the Greek language. The same
                    observation may be applied to the valuable scholia discovered and published at
                    Venice by Villoison.</p>
                <p>We shall not attempt here to give a detail of the numerous editions of Homer. His
                    works complete, including the Iliad, the Odyssey, the Batrachomyomachia, and the
                    Hymns, were printed for the first time at Florence, in 1488, in two vols. folio,
                    under the superintendence of Demetrius Chalcondylas, assisted by another
                    Demetrius from the island of Crete. The printer, Bernardo Nerli, dedicated the
                    collection to Pietro, son of Lorenzo de’ Medicis. This rare and precious edition
                    was faithfully reproduced, with a few corrections, in 1504, by the Aldine
                    presses, at Venice, in two vols. 8vo. But the second Aldine edition of 1517
                    presents sensible differences in the text, which the subsequent editions
                    reproduce, till that of 1528 inclusively. This is what may be called the first
                    age of the editions of Homer. The second dates from Henri Etienne, who, with the
                    assistance of an ancient manuscript, and the commentaries of Eustathius,
                    collected a certain number of various readings, which he gave upon the margin,
                    or developed, along with his own conjectures, in the notes of his beautiful work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Poetae Grceci</hi><hi rend="italic">principes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Heroici</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193646219"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6219-0548"/><hi rend="italic">Carminis,</hi> Paris, 1566. With
                    Barnes the Hellenist, who was celebrated in his own time, but whose reputation
                    must necessarily diminish with the progress of philological criticism, commences
                    a third epoch, which may be denominated that of Clarke, or perhaps of Ernesti,
                    who improved upon the labours of Clarke, as Clarke had improved upon those of
                    his predecessor Barnes. But he did not dissemble that his edition still left
                    much to be desired; and he modestly admitted that he had only prepared materials
                    for future editors. Sueh an editor as Ernesti appears to have contemplated was
                    found in the person of Wolf, who, in 1784 and 1785, published at Halle, in
                    Saxony, a complete edition of Homer, the superiority of which, in regard to
                    correctness, was soon generally acknowledged. This edition was distinguished for
                    an exact and severe revision of the text; and in it the learned professor had
                    already announced the system afterwards developed and adopted by him, when
                    Villoison published his famous edition <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Iliad, in
                    folio, Venice, 1788. This edition occupies too important a place in modern
                    philology, and, as some think, concerns too deeply the glory of Homer
                    individually, to be passed by with a simple notice, or without entering into
                    some details. Villoison was busily occupied at Venice with the publication of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Anecdota Grecea,</hi> when, by accident, he discovered, in
                    the library of St Mark, a manuscript of Homer, which, in his judgment, belonged
                    to the tenth century, and was consequently anterior by two hundred years to the
                    Commentaries of Eustathius. This manuscript contained the Iliad entire,
                    accompanied with an immensity of scholia, abridged from those of Zenodotus,
                    Aristophanes, Aristarchus, Crates Mallotes, Ptolemy of Asealon, and several
                    other celebrated grammarians. But that which particularly struck him, was
                    observing the margins filled with asterisks, daggers, and all the different
                    signs adopted to distinguish verses supposed to have been altered or transposed,
                    from those the authenticity of which was universally recognised. The publication
                    of the work did not fail to realise the great hopes which the learned of Europe
                    had conceived from its mere announcement, and the success of the edition was
                    complete. But it confirmed Wolf more than ever in the opinion that it was to the
                    critics of Alexandria that recourse must be had in order to recover and
                    reconstitute the true text of Homer; and, fortified by the new proofs of the
                    truth of his assertion which he conceived to have under his eyes, he ably
                    profited by the assistance which these ancient scholia afforded him, and made no
                    difficulty in substituting for the ordinary readings of the text the variations
                    which appeared to him to be demonstrated. Thus, by a singular chance, the
                    beautiful monument elevated to the glory of Homer by one of the most famous
                    Hellenists of his age, became the basis of a system calculated to deprive Homer
                    of the admiration which, for ages, had been lavished on him. Villoison was so
                    much affected by this circumstance that he repented of having ever published his
                    Iliad. That of Wolf, accompanied with the Odyssey and the Hymns, re-appeared at
                    Leipsig in 1804, in four vols. small 8vo. This edition adds to its other merits
                    that of a typographical execution which does much honour to the press of M.
                    Goschen. The edition of the Iliad by Heyne, in eight vols. 8vo, which appeared
                    at Leipsig in 1802, has not completely justified the expectations which might
                    have been entertained of such an editor. His principal merit consists in
                    presenting a clear and exact interpretation of the text, and in collecting, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Excursus</hi> and Commentaries which accompany it, all
                    that is important to be known for the perfect understanding of Homer. The
                    doctrine of ĬIeyne on the <hi rend="italic">spirits</hi> rough and smooth <hi
                    rend="italic">(asper</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">lews),</hi>
                    which, according to him, were much more strongly aspirated in the time of Homer,
                    and pronounced like the Aeolie digamma, has met with more adversaries than
                    partisans; although it explains very well how certain syllables, naturally
                    short, become long at the end of a word, when the following one begins with a
                    vowel, and causes to disappear the hiatuses which are of so frequent occurrence
                    in the verses of this great poet.</p>
                <p>From the commeneement or towards the middle of the sixteenth century, Homer was
                    translated into prose and verse amongst the Italians, the English, the French,
                    the Spaniards, and other nations; but we shall only notice those versions which
                    occupy a place more or less distinguished in literature. In Italy the most
                    esteemed are those of Salvini, Cerutti, Cesarotti, and Monti; Salvini, however,
                    translated all that remains of Homer, but the others confined themselves to the
                    Iliad. In England, the translation of Pope threw into the shade those of
                    Chapman, Ogilvy, and Hobbes; but many, nevertheless, prefer to it thatof Cowper,
                    as more exact, and preserving better the simple and natural colour of the
                    original; whilst some are of opinion that the recent version of Sotheby, the
                    accomplished translator of Wieland’s <hi rend="italic">Oberon</hi> and Virgil’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Georgies,</hi> is, in several respects, superior to all its
                    predecessors. The French have, in prose, Madame Dacier, Bitaubé, Lebrun, and
                    Dugal-Mont-bel, each of whom is distinguished for some particular merit. Of the
                    French translations in verse we shall only notice two; those of Roehefort and of
                    Μ. Aignan, which are both considered excellent. The Germans attach much
                    importance to the versions of Bodmer, of the Count de Stolberg, brother of the
                    translator of Sophocles, and of Voss, all of whom have translated Homer into
                    hexameter verses; a system of versification which prevailed in that school, and
                    which was applied to the ancients, with what success we shall not venture to
                    pronounce. Spanish literature contains no good translation of Homer. The most
                    recent, and, comparatively speaking, the best, is that of Don Saverio Malo, a
                    gentleman employed in the Royal Library at Madrid.</p>
                <p>We shall not expatiate here on the literary merit of the prince of poets. It is
                    too generally known, and too deeply felt, to require any exposition at our
                    hands. Besides, what addition could we hope to make to the admirable Essay of
                    Pope on the Life and Writings of Homer; to the <hi rend="italic">Discours
                    Préliminaire</hi> of Roehefort; and, above all, to the eloquent eulogium which
                    the Abbé Barthélemy puts in the mouth of the Seythian Anacharsis? The
                    dissertations of Lamotte are also, in their kind, so much more honourable to the
                    author or authors of the Iliad and Odyssey, that the number and severity of the
                    criticisms contained in them give to the praise a character more solid and less
                    equivocal. The authority of genius is powerful, nay universal. That of Homer
                    has, for thirty centuries, presided over the destinies of almost every
                    literature of the world. It was from the works of the first and greatest of
                    poets that Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and others, derived not only the
                    subjects of their tragedies, but the spirit and sentiments by which these are
                    animated, and the varied charms of that style of which Homer possessed the
                    secret, and left them a model. It was to his genius that the epie poets, as
                    Virgil and Tasso, were indebted for their sublime beauties; it was from his
                    works that the greatest artists of ancient and modern times borrowed their
                    finest conceptions; and both are the more elevated in proportion as they
                    approach nearer to their great model. In a word, as Homer has been denominated
                    %ατ iξo%W <hi rend="italic">the Poet,</hi> so the expression <hi rend="italic"
                    >Homeric beauties,</hi> having passed into a proverb, has become amongst men of
                    letters the appropriate qualification of the grand and the beautiful in
                    poetry.</p>
