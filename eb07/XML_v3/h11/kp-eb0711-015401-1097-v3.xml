                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HARRIOT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, an eminent
                    mathematician, was born at Oxford in 1560. Having been instructed in grammar, he
                    entered St Mary Hall as a commoner, and took his bachelor’s degree in 1579. He
                    then distinguished himself by his skill in the mathematics, and became preceptor
                    in that science to Sir Walter Raleigh. In 1585, he accompanied the first colony
                    sent out to Virginia; and having surveyed that country, ascertained its natural
                    productions, and observed the manners and customs of the aboriginal population,
                    he published an account of it, which was afterwards reprinted in Hackluyt’s
                    Voyages. On his return to England, after an absence of two years, he resumed his
                    mathematical studies with such zeal and success, that Henry carl of
                    Northumberland, the liberal and enlightened protector of the learned, assigned
                    him a yearly pension of L.120. The same nobleman also pensioned Robert Hues,
                    known by his Treatise on the Globes, and Walter Warner, who is supposed to have
                    communicated to Harvey the first hint concerning the circulation of the blood.
                    Both these persons were mathematicians; and, in 1608, when the earl was
                    committed to the Tower for life, they, along with Harriot, were his constant
                    companions, and usually styled his magicians. They had a table at the charge of
                    the earl, who constantly conversed with them, to beguile the tedium of his
                    confinement, as did also Sir Walter Raleigh, who was then a prisoner in the
                    Tower. Harriot lived for some time at Sion College, and died at London on the 2d
                    of July 1621, at the age of sixty, after having suffered much from a cancer in
                    the lip, occasioned by a habit he had contracted of holding in his mouth
                    instruments of brass often charged with verdigris. He was universally esteemed
                    on account of his learning. A manuscript of his entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ephemeris Chrysometria</hi> is preserved in Sion College; and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">resolvendas</hi> was published
                    at London in 1631, folio. Descartes has been charged with taking from this book
                    many improvements in algebra, which he afterwards published to the world as his
                    own; but notwithstanding all that has been said by Wallis in his account of the
                    discoveries of Harriot, and by Zach in the Astronomical Ephemeris for 1788,
                    there seems to be no good ground for the charge; and it would even appear that
                    much that incontestibly belongs to Vieta or Descartes has been ascribed to
                    Harriot. Montucla has reduced to their just value the services of the English
                    mathematician, and shown that these, when truly estimated, are sufficiently
                    important to entitle him to a place, in the second rank, amongst those men who
                    have contributed to the progress of the mathematical sciences. (See
                    Dissertations Third and Fourth, prefixed to this work). From some papers of
                    Harriot, discovered in 1784, it appears that he had either procured a telescope
                    from Holland, or divined the construction of that instrument; and that he
                    coincided, in point of time, with Galileo in discovering the spots on the sun’s
                    disc, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
