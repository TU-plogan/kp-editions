                    Lanark. It is pleasantly situated upon the banks of the Clyde and Avon, near
                    their confluence, in the midst of a highly fertile and cultivated district. The
                    town originated in the fifteenth century,' under the protecting influence of the
                    lords of Hamilton, who constituted a place called the Orchard, between this
                    point and the Clyde, the principal messuage of the barony, and which is still
                    the chief seat of the Hamilton family. There may however have been a hamlet here
                    prior to this transaction. In the vicinity was situated the church of the
                    parish, which in 1451 was elevated to the dignity of a collegiate foundation. In
                    17*32, when anew church was built, the old one was almost entirely pulled down.
                    East from the modern church, which occupies an eminence, and is an elegant
                    structure, the present town of Hamilton has been reared. It consists of several
                    streets of well-built houses, somewhat irregularly dispersed, but handsome in
                    appearance. There is a neat town-house and a commodious market-place. Besides
                    the parish church, there are four meeting-houses for dissenters. The weaving of
                    cotton goods is here carried on to a considerable extent; and there is also a
                    good inland trade, Hamilton being the capital of a populous agricultural
                    district. It possesses two academies, three hospitals, and several other
                    charitable institutions. The town is governed by a provost, three bailies, and
                    eight councillors. The justices of peace hold regular courts; and the town has a
                    stamp-office, taxoffice, and post-office. In the vicinity are spacious cavalry
                    barracks, which are generally occupied. The great objects of attraction in this
                    quarter are the palace of the Duke of Hamilton, and the surrounding
                    pleasure-grounds. This <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640707" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0707-0124"/>magnificent mansion, which was rebuilt in the
                    years 1695- 1696, is finely situated on a flat expanse of ground between the
                    town and the river Clyde. It has recently been greatly modernized, and increased
                    in size and accommodation. Several of the rooms are large, particularly the
                    gallery, which contains a splendid collection of pictures. Hamilton is situated
                    at the distance of about ten miles and a half from Glasgow, fifteen from Lanark,
                    and thirty-six from Edinburgh. The population amounted in 1821 to 6000, and in
                    1831 to 9513. Hamilton is attached to the Falkirk district of burghs in sending
                    a member to parliament.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hamilton,</hi><hi rend="italic">Anthony, Count,</hi> was
                    descended from a younger branch of the great family of Hamilton, and born in
                    Ireland about the year 1646. His mother was sister of the Duke of Ormond, then
                    viceroy of that country. The troubles of that period compelled his family to
                    retire to France whilst he was only an infant, and he was brought up in the
                    language and religion of that country. He made different visits to England in
                    the reign of Charles II., but he was prevented from obtaining any public
                    employment in consequence of his religious opinions, to which he constantly
                    adhered. He received from James II. a regiment of infantry in Ireland; but when
                    that monarch’s affairs became ruined, Count Hamilton accompanied him to France,
                    which he never afterwards quitted. He was very much admired on account of his
                    wit and politeness, as well as for the many estimable qualities of his heart.
                    His writings are lively, yet his conversation was serious, and he perhaps
                    indulged too much his propensity to satire. He died in the year 1720 in the
                    seventy-fourth year of his age. The works of the Count, written in the French
                    language, were printed in 1749, in six vols. 12mo., and consist of poems, fairy
                    tales, and the Mémoires de Grammont, the best of all his compositions. Of this
                    production Voltaire remarked, “It is of all books that in which the most slender
                    groundwork is set off with the gayest, most lively, and agreeable style.” A
                    splendid edition, adorned with fine engravings from original portraits, was
                    published by Lord Orford, at his own private press.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hamilton,</hi><hi rend="italic">George,</hi> Earl of
                    Orkney, and a brave warrior, was the fifth son of William earl of Selkirk, and
                    early betook himself to the profession of arms. Being made colonel in 1689-1690,
                    he distinguished himself by his bravery at the battle of the Boyne; and soon
                    afterwards at those of Aghrim, Steinkirk, and Landen, and at the sieges of
                    Athlone, Limerick, and Namur. His eminent services in Ireland and Flanders,
                    through the whole course of the war, recommended him so highly to King William
                    III. that, in 1696, he advanced him to the dignity of peer of Scotland, by the
                    title of Earl of Orkney; and his lady, the sister of Edward Viscount Villiers,
                    afterwards Earl of Jersey, had a grant made to her, under the great seal of
                    Ireland, of almost all the private estates of King James, which were of any
                    considerable value. Upon the accession of Queen Anne to the throne, he was
                    promoted to the rank of major-general, and, in the year 1703, to that of
                    lieutenant-general, and was likewise made knight of the Thistle. His lordship
                    afterwards served under John duke of Marlborough, and contributed by his bravery
                    and conduct to the glorious victories of Blenheim and Malplaquet, and to the
                    taking of several towns in Flanders. In the beginning of 1710, his lordship, as
                    one of the sixteen peers of Scotland, voted for the impeachment of Dr
                    Sacheverel; and the same year he was sworn of the privy council, and made
                    general or infantry in Flanders. In 1712, he was appointed colonel of the royal
                    regiment of fusileers, and served in Flanders under the Duke of Ormond. In 1714,
                    he was made gentleman-extraordinary of the bed-chamber to King George I. and
                    afterwards governor of Virginia. At length he w⅞s appointed constable, governor,
                    and captain of Edinburgh Castle, lord-lieutenant of the county of Clydesdale,
                    and . field-marshal. He died at his house in Albemarle Street in the year
                    1737.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hamilton,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> the
                    twenty-fourth bishop of St Andrews, to which he had been translated from
                    Dunkeld. He was natural son of James, the first Earl of Arran, and was in great
                    favour at court whilst his friends remained in power. He was one of Queen Mary’s
                    privy council, and a steady friend of that unfortunate princess. He performed
                    the ceremony of christening her son, and was at different times lord privy seal
                    and lord treasurer. The queen had reason to lament her not following the advice
                    of this prelate, after the fatal battle of Langside, when he urged her not to
                    trust her person in England. By the Earl of Murray, the regent, he was declared
                    a traitor, and obliged to seek shelter amongst his friends. But being
                    unfortunately in the castle of Dumbarton when that fortress was taken by
                    surprise, he was carried thence to Stirling, where, on the 1st of April 1570, he
                    was executed, with the unceremonious barbarity peculiar to the time.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hamilton,</hi><hi rend="italic">Robert,</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> distinguished mathematician, and author of several works on
                    finance and political economy, was born at Edinburgh on the 11th of June 1743.
                    Dr Hamilton’s family was a branch of that of Preston, the eldest cadet of the
                    ducal house of Hamilton. His grandfather was Dr William Hamilton, professor of
                    divinity, and principal of the University of Edinburgh. His father was Gavin
                    Hamilton, an eminent publisher, and distinguished by his loyalty to the House of
                    Hanover during the rebellion in 1745, at which time he acted as chief magistrate
                    of Edinburgh. His mother was Helen Balfour, daughter of James Balfour, Esq. of
                    Pilrig, and the subject of this notice was the eighth child.</p><p>Like many other men who have distinguished themselves by the strength and vigour
                    of their mental powers in afterlife, Dr Hamilton was very delicate in his youth;
                    yet though never robust, he lived to a very advanced age. This may in some
                    degree be attributed to the great regularity of his life, and to his moderation
                    in all things, and not a little to the admirable control under which he had
                    brought every inclination and passion, being thus exempted from those violent
                    emotions which wear out our mortal frames.</p><p>His education was entirely conducted in Edinburgh; he was an excellent scholar,
                    and gave complete satisfaction to his teachers, applying himself with diligence
                    and success to the various branches of study usually taught in Scotland. He
                    appeal’s to have had from his earliest years an earnest desire after every sort
                    of learning; .and even late in life, when his professional duties and his
                    studies in finance and political economy would have seemed more than enough to
                    occupy all his time, he was able to keep himself acquainted not only with all
                    the discoveries of science, but also with the modern literature of his own and
                    other countries.</p><p>His habits and inclinations led him to desire to pass his life in literary
                    pursuits; but the circumstances of his father’s numerous family obliged him to
                    devote himself to mercantile business. To prepare himself for this, he spent
                    some time in a banking-house in Edinburgh, a circumstance which he doubtless
                    regretted at the time, but which probably proved of the utmost value to him in
                    after-life; for the accurate habits of business he then acquired were never
                    lost, but were most useful to himself and to others on many occasions, and
                    perhaps even laid the foundation of his work on finance. Whilst a clerk in the
                    banking-house he pursued his studies as far as his leisure permitted. He and
                    some of his companions formed themselves into a literary society, which
                    subsisted for several seasons, and eventually gave rise to the Speculative.</p><p>Lord Kaimes was at that time the leading literary man in Edinburgh, and Dr
                    Hamilton became personally ac- ' quainted with him, in a manner equally
                    creditable to both. He had written an anonymous criticism on one of Lord <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640720" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0720-0125"/>
                    Kaimes’s works, with which his lordship was so much pleased that he expressed an
                    anxious wish to become acquainted with the author. He was with some difficulty
                    persuaded to reveal himself, and Lord Kaimes expressed much surprise at the
                    youth of his able critic. He gave him a general invitation to his house, then
                    the resort of all the literary characters of the day, which proved to him a
                    source both of pleasure and improvement.</p><p>The life of a man devoted to literary pursuits rarely furnishes much matter for
                    the biographer, and that of Dr Hamilton is unusually devoid of incident. In the
                    year 1766 the mathematical chair in Marischal College, Aberdeen, became vacant
                    by the death of Professor Stewart. Although only twenty-three years of age, Dr
                    Hamilton’s friends were so well aware of his talents and acquirements, that they
                    prevailed upon him, against his own inclination, to become a candidate. He was
                    not successful; but the appearance which he made at the various examinations did
                    him great credit. Two of his rivals were men of great eminence, viz. Dr Trail,
                    who obtained the chair, but after a short period resigned it, and entered the
                    English church (his high attainments in mathematics appear from his life of
                    Simpson); and Professor Playfair, whose name deservedly ranks amongst the
                    greatest of whom Scotland can boast. An account of the comparative trial has
                    been preserved, by which it appears that the questions embraced almost every
                    branch of mathematics; and the sum of the merits of the candidates is thus
                    stated, Trail 126, Hamilton 119, Playfair 90, Fullarton 58, Stewart 47, Douglas
                    16. The talent he displayed on this occasion was not forgotten, and eventually
                    led to his obtaining the situation of which he was at this time
                    disappointed.</p><p>On his return from Aberdeen he entered into partnership with his father in a
                    paper-mill near Edinburgh; but his father died soon afterwards, and as the
                    management of this concern was wholly foreign to his habits and inclinations, he
                    took the first opportunity of placing himself in a more congenial situation, and
                    in 1769 obtained the rectorship of the academy of Perth. In 1771 he married
                    Anne, daughter of Alexander Mitchell, Esq. of Ladath, who died in 1778, leaving
                    him three daughters, who still survive. In 1779 he was appointed by the crown to
                    the chair of Natural Philosophy in Marischal College, Aberdeen. At the same time
                    that Dr Hamilton received this appointment, Dr Copland obtained that of
                    professor of Mathematics. They taught their respective classes for one session;
                    but each feeling the subject, allotted to the other to be more congenial to his
                    talents, they agreed to exchange classes; and in future Dr Hamilton taught
                    mathematics, and Dr Copland natural philosophy; an arrangement which was as
                    beneficial to the students, and acceptable to the University, as it was
                    agreeable to the two professors.</p><p>In this situation Dr Hamilton remained till the close of his life, although much
                    pressed by some of his friends, at least on one occasion, to remove to what they
                    considered a wider field of usefulness, by accepting a chair in another
                    university. In 1782 he married Jane, daughter of James Morison, Esq. of Elsick.
                    In 1814, finding the duty of teaching his three mathematical classes rather too
                    much for him, he was allowed by the Senatus to employ an assistant. His choice
                    fell on Mr, now Professor Cruickshank, who was soon afterwards appointed by the
                    patrons to be also his successor; Dr Hamilton himself at the same time being
                    regularly inducted into the chair of mathematics, the classes of which he had so
                    long taught. In 1825 he had the misfortune to lose his second wife, by whom he
                    had no family, and from that period he withdrew very much from his active
                    employments and from general society, and spent most of his time at his country
                    house, where he expired on the 14th of July 1829, in the eighty-seventh year of
                    his age.</p><p>The first work which Dr Hamilton gave to the public was his Merchandise, the
                    first edition of which appeared in 1777. It has gone through many editions, the
                    last of which, not long before his death, was, with the author’s approbation,
                    edited by Mr E. Johnstone of Edinburgh. In 1790, he printed, for the use of his
                    pupils, a set of mathematical tables, which were reprinted with great accuracy
                    and care in 1807. The labour of preparing and correcting such tables for the
                    press is most irksome, and every student of mathematics can well appreciate
                    their value. In 1796 he published his Arithmetic, which has gone through several
                    editions; and in 1800 he published, for the use of his pupils, Heads of a Course
                    of Mathematics. These are his published works on what may be called professional
                    subjects. It is known that he also prepared a work of considerable extent on
                    Practical Astronomy; but no trace of it was found among his papers after his
                    decease.</p><p>In 1790 he published anonymously, an Essay on Peace and War. The object of this
                    work was to show the trifling grounds on which wars are often undertaken, and
                    how seldom, at least comparatively speaking, the avowed object for which they
                    were undertaken has been attained, even by their successful termination; and the
                    inadequacy of the advantages which are obtained to compensate for the
                    expenditure of blood and treasure necessarily incurred. But Dr Hamilton’s most
                    important work, the publication of which places him amongst the greatest
                    benefactors to his country, appeared in 1813, under the title of an Inquiry
                    concerning the Rise and Progress, the Redemption and Present State, and the
                    Management, of the National Debt of Great Britain. Up to the period of the
                    appearance of this work, the efficacy of the Sinking Fund system was received by
                    all parties almost as an axiom. It was brought forward for the public advantage
                    by Mr Pitt, with perfect good faith; and it continued to be acted upon by his
                    successors, without being called in question even by political antagonists. Dr
                    Hamilton’s work at once showed the unsoundness of the whole system, and that so
                    clearly, that soon after its publication it would have been difficult to find
                    any one who would defend the plans so long pursued. The work immediately
                    attracted notice in all quarters, and though the readers of such books are not
                    very numerous, it passed through three editions in a few years. But to the
                    author the most satisfactory approval was that which he received from the
                    gradual but complete adoption of his principles by the British government. It is
                    not a little remarkable, that no one ever attempted fairly to refute his work,
                    although many able men had every inducement to do so if they could. Every thing
                    connected with the fund was so enveloped in technical jargon, that, to all but
                    the initiated, they were an unintelligible mystery. Dr Hamilton divested the
                    subject of this encumbrance; he gave a distinct detail of the progress of our
                    debt, explaining the origin and nature of the different stocks in plain and
                    simple language.</p><p>He commences his work by laying down twelve general principles of finance, each
                    of which is so incontrovertible, as hardly to require the support of argument.
                    The second part of it is occupied by the history of our debt, and the different
                    plans proposed or adopted for its discharge, and their operation; and the third
                    part is devoted to the application of the twelve principles to these schemes,
                    and an examination of the different methods adopted in conducting our financial
                    concerns. The scope of the whole work may be summed up in two plain statements:
                    first, that, as with private individuals, so with nations, the only really
                    effectual sinking fund is a surplus of income over expenditure, and therefore
                    that no nation whose finances are managed on opposite principles can avoid ruin
                    in the end, however skilfully its affairs may be conducted; secondly, that to
                    raise money at a low nominal rate of interest, by promising to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640733" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0733-0126"/>repay a larger
                    sum than is received, is a trifling advantage at first, but incurs a large
                    certain loss on redemption of the debt. These appear so self-evident that it
                    might have been thought a waste of time to prove them, had not long and fatal
                    experience shown that they were neither believed nor acted upon by those men who
                    conducted the finances of the nation. Now, however, they are universally
                    admitted, and no financier of the present day is found bold enough to propose
                    the redemption of our national debt by any other means than keeping the income
                    above the expenditure.</p><p>In 1822, Dr Hamilton published a small pamphlet on the Poor Laws; a subject by
                    which he was deeply interested. This pamphlet contains a brief but distinct
                    exposition of the principles on which relief to the poor ought to be afforded in
                    a Christian country. It had probably little circulation beyond the town of
                    Aberdeen, as great part of it is occupied by local details; but the publication
                    of it may fairly be considered as having at least for a number of years delayed
                    the infliction of poor-rates on that city. The last work of Dr Hamilton’s which
                    was given to the public is entitled The Progress of Society; this was left by
                    the author ready for the press. He had been occupied in the preparation of it
                    for many years, and continued to correct it till within a few days of his death.
                    It consists of twenty-one essays on different branches of political <hi rend="italic">economy,</hi> published at a time (1830) when the minds of all
                    thinking men in this country were directed to those most momentous political
                    changes which absorbed the public attention, to the almost total exclusion of
                    every other subject.</p><p>This work attracted less attention than his National Debt. It is written in his
                    usual plain and perspicuous style, and his deductions from admitted facts appear
                    to be in general incontrovertible, though they lead at times to conclusions
                    widely different indeed from those of most modern writers on political economy.
                    But when the time shall come that a greater number of fixed principles on
                    political economy shall be established, and the subject shall thus be brought in
                    truth to be a science, then it is expected that this work will be found to
                    contain more sound doctrine than most of its precursors. Much of the author’s
                    benevolence appears in its pages, and of his desire for the general good, and
                    not that of particular classes of society. The whole is pervaded by his
                    favourite doctrine, that the object of government should be the moral good, and
                    not the wealth or the grandeur, of a people. In 1831 Dr Hamilton’s family
                    reprinted privately his Essay on Peace and War, which had become very scarce, as
                    well as that on the Poor Laws, omitting the local details; and to these were
                    added an unfinished fragment of an essay on Government. It cannot now be
                    ascertained at what time it was written; but probably it was during the progress
                    of the French Revolution, of which Dr Hamilton always spoke in terms of the
                    strongest reprobation. In 1814 Dr Hamilton was elected one of the three judges
                    for awarding the Burnet prize, for the best essay on the Being of a God. The
                    large amount of the prizes (L.1200 and L.400) attracted many competitors, and
                    rendered the duty of the judges laborious. Dr Hamilton applied himself to the
                    work with his wonted care, and wrote out a full abstract of each of the fifty
                    treatises, to enable him to come to a right decision on their respective merits;
                    a labour which occupied many hours a day for several months.</p><p>His work of finance brought him into correspondence with several of the leading
                    members of both houses of parliament, and also with some foreign economists who
                    were interested in the subject, particularly J. B. Say, who notices the Inquiry
                    in terms of strong commendation, in his <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Economic Politique</hi> (vol. ii. p. 381).</p><p>He was also frequently consulted on mathematical questions by his former pupils;
                    and as he never ceased to feel an interest in their progress through life, so he
                    had much pleasure in assisting them when in his power, as many still remember
                    with gratitude. In like manner, his advice was sought and obtained as to the
                    various schemes for equalizing weights and measures, for supplying the town of
                    Aberdeen with water, for calculating the invaluable fund for the widows of the
                    clergy of the church of Scotland, and a similar institution for the widows of
                    advocates in Aberdeen. To the management of the poor’s funds, and the various
                    charitable institutions in Aberdeen, and of the funds of the college of which he
                    was a member, much of his time and attention were devoted. He was never idle,
                    and all his talents were ever ready to be employed for the service of those who
                    required them.</p><p>Dr Hamilton’s personal appearance was striking: he was naturally tall and thin,
                    but with a considerable stoop, which increased with his years: his countenance
                    was mild and very intelligent, often with a certain air of abstraction; but when
                    animated, as it often was, particularly in conversation, it was remarkably
                    expressive. His habits and pleasures were completely domestic, and he enjoyed
                    the society of his friends with the keenest relish. For many years he made
                    annually a tour to some part or other of Britain, and at the age of
                    seventy-eight visited the Low Countries and the north of France. From these
                    tours he acquired much information of immediate use to his studies on political
                    economy, and he was in the habit of noting down every day whatever came before
                    him worthy of remembrance.</p><p>In pursuing his studies he followed a similar plan, rarely reading a work of
                    importance without committing to writing his remarks upon it; and the result
                    was, that he possessed a fund of solid information rarely to be met with. His
                    natural diffidence prevented his displaying his resources in general society,
                    where he was more anxious to hear than to speak; but in the circle of his
                    intimate friends his conversation was in the highest degree pleasing and
                    instructive. His favourite relaxation was the cultivation of flowers, a taste in
                    perfect unison with the simplicity of his whole character. Dr Hamilton was no
                    party man, although he was often unjustly regarded as such. He used his strong
                    powers of mind to judge of public measures by their own merits, Without regard
                    to party; and it is pleasing to remark the gentleness and candour with which in
                    his works he animadverts on those from whose opinions and principles he
                    dissents.</p><p>It is not necessary to add much on his private character; he was full of
                    benevolence, active as well as speculative. Amongst his papers were found «
                    Regulations for his future conduct,” drawn up at the early age of twenty-two;
                    and on reviewing the long course of his subsequent life, it is clear that he
                    never lost sight of the high standard which he had then proposed for himself.
                    His piety was always sincere, though unostentatious; it became more and more
                    fervent as his earthly career approached its termination; and for some time
                    previous to his decease, it was his practice to retire to his closet three times
                    a day for private devotion. His faculties continued unimpaired to the last, and
                    his end was perfect peace. Soon after his death a subscription was proposed, to
                    erect a monument to his memory; and so general was the respect· entertained for
                    him, that a large sum was immediately raised. The monument has been lately
                    erected in the burying-ground of St Nicholas, Aberdeen, not far from his grave.
                    It consists of a solid basement, six feet high, on which are placed four fluted
                    Doric columns, each of one block of granite, supporting an entablature of the
                    same order, above which rises a low roof. Under this roof stands an urn, and on
                    the last side of the basement is a tablet with the following inscription:</p><p>Memoriae Sacrum</p><p>Roberti Hamilton, LL.D.</p><p>In Academia Mariscallana <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640746" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0746-0127"/>Mathesis Professoris, Qui XIV. die Julii A. D.
                    MDCCCXXIX. et actatis suae LXXXVII. obiit.</p><p>Cives, Amici, et Discipuli, Hoc Monumentum posuere.</p><p>The height of the whole structure is twenty-one feet six inches. The design is
                    correctly classical, and the execution of it is the best specimen we have seen
                    of any modern work in granite.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
