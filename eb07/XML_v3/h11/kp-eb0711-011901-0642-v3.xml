                <p><label type="entry">HALLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr Edmund</hi></label>, an
                    eminent astronomer, was the only son of a soap-boiler in London, and was born in
                    1656. He first applied himself to the study of the languages and sciences, but
                    at length gave himself up wholly to that of astronomy. In 1676 he went to the
                    island of St Helena to complete the catalogue of fixed stars, by the addition of
                    those situated near the south pole; and having delineated a planisphere, in
                    which he laid them all down in their exact places, he returned to England in
                    1678. In the year 1680 he performed what is called the grand tour, accompanied
                    by his friend Mr Nelson. About halfway between Calais and Paris, Halley obtained
                    a sight of a remarkable comet, as it then appeared a second time that year, in
                    its return from the sun. In the preceding November he bad seen it in its
                    descent; and now hastened to complete his observations by viewing it from the
                    royal observatory of France. His design in this part of his tour was to
                    establish a friendly correspondence between the two astronomers royal of
                    Greenwich and Paris, and in the mean time to improve himself under so great a
                    master as Cassini. From France he proceeded to Italy, where he spent the greater
                    part of the year 1681, and then returned to England. In 1683 he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Theory of the Variation of the Magnetical Compass,</hi> in
                    which he supposes the whole globe of the earth to be a great magnet, with four
                    magnetical poles or points of attraction; but afterwards <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640655" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0655-0120"/>conceiving that this theory
                    was liable to great exceptions, he caused an application to be made to King
                    William, who appointed him commander of the <hi rend="italic">Paramour,</hi>
                    with orders to seek by observations the discovery of the rule of variations, and
                    to lay down the longitudes and latitudes of his majesty’s settlements in
                    America. He set out on this attempt on the 24th of November 1698; but on
                    crossing the line his men grew sickly, and his lieutenant having mutinied, he
                    returned home in June 1699. Having got the lieutenant tried and cashiered, he
                    set sail a second time in September following, with the same ship, and another
                    of less size, of which he had also the command. He now traversed the Atlantic
                    Ocean from one hemisphere to the other; and having made his observations at St
                    Helena, Brazil, Cape Verd, Barbadoes, Madeira, the Canaries, the coast of
                    Barbary, and in many other latitudes, he returned in September 1700, and the
                    next year published a general chart, showing at one view the variation of the
                    compass in all those places. Captain Halley, as he was now called, had been at
                    home little more than half a year, when he was sent by the king to observe the
                    course of the tides, with the longitude and latitude of the principal headlands
                    in the British Channel; and having executed this task with his usual expedition
                    and accuracy, he published a large map of the British Channel. Soon afterwards
                    the emperor of Germany having resolved to construct a harbour for shipping in
                    the Adriatic, Captain Halley was sent by Queen Anne to survey the different
                    ports on the coast of Dalmatia. He embarked on the 22d of November 1702, passed
                    over to Holland, and travelling through Germany to Vienna, proceeded to Istria;
                    but as the Dutch opposed the design, it was laid aside. The emperor, however,
                    made him a present of a rich diamond ring from his finger, and honoured him with
                    a letter of recommendation, written with his own hand, to Queen Anne. Soon after
                    his return he was again dispatched on the same business. Upon his arrival at
                    Vienna he was the same evening presented to the emperor, who sent his chief
                    engineer to attend him to Istria, where they repaired and added new
                    fortifications to those of Trieste. Mr Halley returned to England in 1703; and
                    the same year he was appointed professor of geometry in the university of
                    Oxford, in the ’ room of Dr Wallis, and had the degree of doctor of laws
                    conferred on him by that university. He is said to have lost the professorship
                    of astronomy in that university because he would not profess his belief of the
                    Christian religion. He was scarcely settled at Oxford, when he began to
                    translate into Latin from the Arabic, <hi rend="italic">Apollonius de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sectione Rationis,</hi> and to restore the two books of the same
                    author, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Sectione Spatii,</hi> which
                    are lost, from the account given of them by Pappus; and he published the whole
                    in 1706. He had afterwards a share in preparing for the press the Conics of
                    Apollonius, and he ventured to supply the whole of the eighth book, the original
                    of which is also lost. He likewise added Serenus on the section of the cylinder
                    and cone, printed from the original Greek, with a Latin translation, and
                    published the whole in folio. In 1713 he was made secretary of the Royal
                    Society; in 1720 he was appointed the king’s astronomer at the royal observatory
                    at Greenwich, in the room of Mr Flamsteed; and in 1729 he was chosen as foreign
                    member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. He died at Greenwich in 1742. His
                    principal works are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Catalogus Stellarum Australium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Tabulae Astronomicae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> 3. An Abridgment of the Astronomy of Comets. We are also
                    indebted to Halley for the publication of several of the works of Sir Isaac
                    Newton, who had a particular friendship for him, and to whom he frequently
                    communicated his discoveries.</p>
