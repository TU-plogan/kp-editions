                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    >Just,</hi> a celebrated mineralogist, was born at St Just, a small country town
                    of France, in the department of the Oise, on the 28th of February 1743. He had a
                    younger brother, who became celebrated as the inventor of a method of
                    instructing the blind. Their father was a small linen manufacturer, and his
                    means were so slender, that but for the generosity of others, it is doubtful if
                    his children would ever have learned any other profession than his own. Early in
                    life the subject of this memoir evinced a singularly pious disposition; and from
                    this circumstance arose the improvement of his fortune. Whilst yet a mere child,
                    he took remarkable pleasure in religious ceremonies, especially in church music,
                    a taste for which was blended with his devotional feelings. His regular
                    attendance at church service attracted the attention of a prior, who placed the
                    youthful devotee under the care of some monks, for the purpose of instructing
                    him; and under their tuition he made so rapid progress, that his mother was
                    induced to take him to Paris to complete his studies. Her means were scarcely
                    sufficient to enable her to live a few months in the capital; but she preferred
                    submitting to severe privations rather than relinquish the hopes which she had
                    cherished respecting her son. For some time, young Haiiy held the humble
                    situation of a singing boy in a church, and by this means he gained a
                    subsistence, limited indeed., but sufficient for him whose wants were so few and
                    whose ardour was so great, whilst he also gratified his propensity for music. By
                    the influence of his protectors at St Just, he at length procured a bursary in
                    the college of Navarre, where he was enabled to prosecute his studies without
                    interruption. His application and good conduct procured him the esteem of his
                    superiors; and when the period of his probation as a scholar had terminated, he
                    became a teacher in the establishment. He took his degrees, and commenced
                    teaching at twentý-one years of age. Some time afterwards he was appointed
                    preceptor to a higher class, and to this humble but honourable office his
                    ambition seems to have been limited. His leisure hours were occupied in the
                    study of botany; but by a fortunate accident his attention was withdrawn from
                    plants to examine the structure of minerals. His mind had for some time been
                    filled with ideas relative to the contrast presented by the vegetable and
                    mineral kingdoms, inasmuch as in the complicated forms of flowers, fruits, and
                    other organised bodies, a never-failing unity of form pertained to each
                    individual plant or herb, whilst the same stone or salt, without its composition
                    being changed in the slightest degree, exhibited itself in cubes, prisms, and
                    other shapes. Occupied with these reflections, he accidentally dropt from his
                    hand a beautiful specimen of calcareous spar, crystallized in prisms, one of
                    which was broken in such a manner as to present a new crystal, differing in form
                    from the prism, but having the surfaces not less smooth. On examination, the
                    inclinations and angles were found to be similar to the rhomboid crystals of
                    Iceland spar. He further examined pieces of spar crystallized in other forms,
                    and he still found the same rhomboid which had first struck him, the fragments
                    which fell from it being also small rhomboids. The importance of the discovery
                    at once flashed upon his mind, and, like Archimedes starting from the bath, he
                    exclaimed, “All is found.” The important conclusion at which he arrived was
                    simply this, that the molecules, or, as it were, component parts, of calcareous
                    spar, have invariably the same geometrical figure; the variety of external forms
                    which the masses assume arising from the manner in which the smaller crystals
                    composing it are arranged. By examining a number of substances, Haüy completely
                    established the fact that this was a law of nature which obtained universally.
                    Each mineral was found to have identical constituent molecules, a nucleus always
                    similar to itself, and laminae, or accessory layers, producing all the varieties
                    of external form.</p>
                <p>Another condition, however, was to be fulfilled before the theory could be
                    admitted as certain. If the nucleus and constituent molecule have each a certain
                    invariable form, geometrically determinable in its angles, and in the relations
                    of its lines, each law of decrement ought also to produce determinable secondary
                    faces; and likewise, when the nucleus and the molecules are once given, the
                    angles and lines of all the secondary faces which the decrements would produce,
                    should be susceptible of calculation beforehand. Before Haüy could accomplish
                    this, however, he required to study geometry, which he had almost forgotten.
                    This he quickly learned, and having invented a method of measuring and
                    describing the forms of crystals, he established beyond all doubt the true law
                    of crystallization. This subject is treated of at length in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Crystallization.</hi></p>
                <p>Haüy first made known his discoveries to his master Μ. Daubenton, by whom they
                    were communicated to the celebrated Laplace. The young philosopher received the
                    most flattering invitations to join the academy, but' his modesty for some time
                    kept him back. His scruples, however, having been at length overcome, he, on the
                    10th of January 1781, read his first memoir, in which he treated of the garnets
                    and of calcareous spars. The members of the academy showed great eagerness to
                    acquire him; and, on the 12th of February 1783, he was elected to the situation
                    of adjunct in the botanical class, in preference to several learned botanists,
                    who were candidates for the honour. His new colleagues bore flattering testimony
                    to his merits, by requesting him to give oral explanations and demonstrations of
                    his theory; and be also read a course of lectures on the subject, at which were
                    present the most distinguished French philosophers of the day. The modes of
                    calculation which he had invented, and the formulae he employed, representing
                    all the possible combinations of crystallography, will be found in the volumes
                    of the academy for 1788 and 1789.</p>
                <p>Objections were started to the theory of Μ. Haüy; but the only reply which he
                    made to them consisted in more extended researches, and a more ample induction
                    of facts. He also applied his principle in a new and remarkable manner to the
                    discovery of the composition of minerals. If, reasoned he, each substance has a
                    characteristic nucleus and constituent molecule, then the component parts of
                    minerals, whose composition is unknown, may be discovered by the form of their
                    crystals; and thus a new and powerful instrument of analysis may be employed in
                    mineralogical and chemical investigations. His practical researches established
                    the correctness of the conclusions at. which he had arrived. At this time the
                    most distinguished mineralogists confounded under the name of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193641305" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1305-0170"/><hi rend="italic">schorl</hi>
                    a number of minerals, which, although possessing some characteristics in common,
                    did not bear so remarkable a resemblance to one another as to warrant their
                    being classified together as belonging to the same species. M. Haiiy, therefore,
                    suspecting that distinctive differences existed amongst them, commenced a series
                    of experiments conducted on his own principle. He mechanically divided the
                    substance called white schorl, and found in it the nucleus and molecule of
                    felspar. By chemical analysis, it was found to be actually one of the felspars.
                    Encouraged by his success, he continued his researches, and discovered amongst
                    the schorls no less than fourteen species. From this moment Μ. Haiiy ceased to
                    be a mere experimenter in physics, and stood prominently forward as the great
                    legislator of mineralogy. A new era in the science dates from the period of
                    these researches; and, by the study of the crystalline structure of minerals,
                    each year has produced some unexpected discovery.</p>
                <p>It is, or at least was, a regulation in the university with which Μ. Haiiy was
                    connected, that when a professor had served twenty years, he was entitled to a
                    retiring pension. With this, joined to the produce of a small benefice, although
                    barely sufficient for his wants, he resolved to retire from public duty, and
                    devote himself wholly to philosophical pursuits. His designs, however, were
                    frustrated by the breaking out of the Revolution. After the overthrow of the
                    monarchy, one of the first measures taken by the democratical party was the
                    imprisonment of the priests; and Μ. Haiiy, being naturally identified with them
                    on account of his scrupulous piety, became a participator in their sufferings.
                    He was surprised in his humble retreat by a body of armed men, who rudely
                    demanded if he had any fire-arms. ' None but these, said he, drawing a spark
                    from his electrical machine. This for a moment disarmed the intruders, but only
                    for a moment. Fortunately, however, he did not share the fate of Archimedes.
                    They spared his life, but he was ultimately thrown into prison. His confinement,
                    however, was of short duration. The members of the academy, and other
                    influential individuals, so interested themselves in his behalf, that they
                    procured his deliverance just the day before the massacres of September. From
                    this period he was no more disturbed, although, as a priest, he continued to
                    perform his sacerdotal functions daily, and had even the courage to write in
                    behalf of some individuals, amongst whom was the celebrated Lavoisier, who had
                    been arrested by order of the Convention.</p>
                <p>At the cabinet of the Conseil des Mines, and by the aid of that administration,
                    Μ. Haüy prepared for the press his celebrated work on mineralogy, which appeared
                    in 1801, in four vols. 8vo, with a quarto volume of plates. “This book,” says
                    Cuvier, “possesses in the highest degree two advantages which are very rarely
                    found combined; the first of which is, that it is founded upon an original
                    discovery, entirely resulting from the genius of the author; the second, that
                    this discovery is folĮowed out in it, and applied with incredible perseverance
                    even to the varieties of minerals. Every thing is grand in the plan, precise and
                    rigorous in the details; it is completed like the doctrine itself of which it
                    contains the exposition.”</p>
                <p>In his determinations of mineral species, Μ. Haüy gave the chief rank to
                    crystallization, although of course it was never intended by the author that
                    chemical analysis should be neglected. He only maintained that it was inadequate
                    to the determination of their species, “because,” observes Cuvier, “it has no
                    sure means of distinguishing the accidental from the essential substances;
                    because it is not in a condition, with respect to certain classes of stones, to
                    affirm that it knows their elements; and because it every day discovers elements
                    which were previously concealed from it.” - By his indefatigable industry, Μ.
                    Haüy determined the nucleus and molecules, with the measure of their angles, and
                    the proportion of their sides, of almost every crystallized mineral at present
                    known. In a word, he may be said to have placed mineralogy amongst the precise
                    and methodical sciences, and to have done for it what Newton did for astronomy.
                    On the demise of the professor of mineralogy to the Museum of Natural History,
                    Dolomieu was promoted to the chair in preference to Μ. Haüy. But imprisonment,
                    and afterwards a premature death, prevented that individual from occupying the
                    chair; and on the 9th of December 1802, Haüy was appointed to the vacant
                    professorship. A new life was now infused into the mineralogical department.
                    Large additions were made to the collections, and every thing was arranged in
                    the most perfect order, according to his own principles of classification. To
                    the students he showed the utmost condescension and kindness, conversing
                    familiarly with them, and even taking them to his own house, and opening up his
                    private collections to their inspection. When the university was founded, Haüy’s
                    name was placed on the list of one of its faculties. Lectures were not expected
                    from him; but, unwilling to bear a title without fulfilling its duties, he made
                    the pupils of the normal school come to him; and, in conversation, he
                    communicated to them his discoveries. By order of the government, he drew up a
                    treatise on physics for the colleges. He had previously established a claim to
                    be employed in the execution of such a work, by the ingenious manner in which he
                    had applied physics to mineralogy, by the publication of several interesting
                    memoirs on the electricity and double refraction of minerals, by his elegant
                    exposition of Aepinus’s theory respecting electricity and magnetism, and by the
                    success which had attended a course of physics delivered by him at the normal
                    school instituted in 1795 by the Convention, and which lasted only a few months.
                    He was averse, however, to abandon his favourite mineralogical researches; and
                    it was only after much hesitation that he consented to undertake the task. The
                    treatise added little to his scientific reputation, but it did no injury to his
                    literary fame. The same clearness and purity of style for which his Mineralogy
                    was distinguished characterise this little work. It is calculated to inspire
                    into the young a taste for the natural sciences, and it has passed through
                    several editions.</p>
                <p>Μ. Haüy was repeatedly urged to communicate to government what he wished to be
                    done for him; and when he consented to petition, his humble request was, that
                    things might be arranged so as to bring his family near him, in order that he
                    might enjoy their society, as the solace of his old age and infirmities.
                    Napoleon instantly complied with his wishes, by conferring a place upon the
                    husband of his niece. The emperor likewise granted him a pension, and, on his
                    return from Elba, decorated the crystallographer with the cross of the legion of
                    honour. This was alike honourable to both parties, for Haüy had opposed the
                    assumption of the imperial dignity by Napoleon. When the subsequent changes in
                    the French government took place, the husband of Μ. Haüy’s niece lost his
                    situation; and he himself, when no longer capable of active exertion, was
                    deprived of his well-merited pension. To add to his perplexities, his brother,
                    who had gone to Russia for the purpose of gaining information relative to the
                    instruction of the blind, returned without attaining his object, and with a
                    constitution so completely broken, that he became a charge to his family. Thus,
                    in his old age, Μ. Haüy was reduced to the extreme indigence which had been his
                    lot during the early part of his career. A compensation, however, was afforded
                    him in the kind attentions of his friends, and in the applause of Europe; whilst
                    the enlightened of all ranks who visited Paris paid their respects to him. But
                    these flatteries never corrupted the simplicity of his manners, and his
                    benevolence continued conspicuous to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641318"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-1318-0171"/>close of his life. Notwithstanding his feebleness,
                    he attained the age of seventy-nine, having died on the 3d of June 1823.</p>
                <p>The intellectual powers of Μ. Haiiy are sufficiently attested by his works. In
                    his moral character he was sincerely pious, and eminently benevolent. He seems
                    to have regarded wealth only as the means of gratifying those sentiments of
                    benevolence with which he was penetrated; and although the most beautiful gems
                    of Europe passed under his review, they were by him considered valuable only as
                    crystals which illustrated his theory. The works of Μ. Haüy are as follow :—1.
