                <p><label type="entry">HERALDRY</label>,</p>
                <p>Is the science which teaches how to blazon, or explain in proper terms, all that
                    belongs to coats-of-arms, and how to marshal, or dispose regularly, different
                    arms on a field; and it also teaches whatever relates to the marshallinġ of
                    solemn cavalcades, processions, and other public ceremonies, at coronations,
                    installations, creations of peers, nuptials, christening of princes, funerals,
                    and the like. Arms, or coats-of-arms, are hereditary marks of honour, composed
                    of fixed and determined colours and figures, granted by sovereign princes as a
                    reward for military valour, shining virtue, or signal public service, and which
                    serve to denote the descent and alliance of the bearer, or to distinguish
                    states, cities, societies, or orders, civil, ecclesiastical, and military.</p>
                <p>Thus heraldry is the science of which <hi rend="italic">arms</hi> are the proper
                    object; but yet they differ much both in their origin and in their antiquity.
                    Heraldry, according to Sir George Mackenzie, “as digested into an art, and
                    subjected to rules, must be ascribed to Charlemagne and Frederick Barbarossa,
                    for it did begin and grow with the feudal law.” Sir John Feme is of opinion that
                    we borrowed <hi rend="italic">arms</hi> from the Egyptians, meaning probably
                    from the hieroglyphics of that people. Sir William Dugdale mentions that arms,
                    as marks of honour, were used by great commanders in war, necessity requiring
                    that their persons should be notified to their friends and followers. Nisbet, in
                    his System of Heraldry, says that arms owe their rise and beginning to the light
                    of nature, and that signs and marks of honour were made use of in the first ages
                    of the world, and by all nations, however simple and illiterate, to distinguish
                    the noble from the ignoble. We find from Homer, Virgil, and Ovid, that the
                    ancient heroes had different figures on their shields, by which their persons
                    were distinctly known. Alexander the Great, desirous to honour those of his
                    captains and soldiers who had done any glorious action, and also to excite
                    emulation amongst the rest, granted them certain badges to be borne on their
                    armour, pennons, and banners; and at the same time ordained that no person or
                    potentate throughout his empire should attempt or presume to give or tolerate
                    the bearing of those signs upon the armour of any other man, but that it should
                    be a power reserved to himself, which prerogative has ever since been claimed
                    and exercised by all other kings and sovereign princes within their
                    dominions.</p>
                <p>From these and many other opinions, it may with some confidence be inferred that
                    in all ages men have made use of figures of living creatures, or symbolical
                    signs, to denote the bravery and courage either of their chief or nation, to
                    render themselves more terrible to their enemies, and also to distinguish
                    themselves or families, as names do individuals. Agrippa, in his treatise on the
                    vanity of sciences (c. 81), has collected many instances of these marks of
                    distinction, anciently borne by kingdoms and states which were any way
                    civilized. Thus the Egyptians bore an ox, the Athenians an owl, the Goths a
                    bear, the Romans an eagle, the Franks a lion, and the Saxons a horse, which last
                    is still borne in the arms of his Britannic majesty. As to hereditary arms of
                    families, Camden, Spelman, and others agree that they began towards the end of
                    the seventeenth century. According to Menestrier, a French writer whose
                    authority is of great weight in this matter, Henry l’Oiseleur, or the Falconer,
                    who was raised to the imperial throne of the West in 920, by regulating
                    tournaments in Germany gave occasion to the establishment of family arms, or
                    hereditary marks of honour, which are undeniably more ancient and better
                    observed amongst the Germans than in any other nation. Menestrier likewise'
                    asserts, that with tournaments came coats-of-arms, which, were a sort of livery,
                    made up of several lists, fillets, or narrow pieces of stuff of different
                    colours, whence came the fess, the bend, the pale, and other devices, which were
                    the original charges of family arms; for they who had never been at tournaments
                    had not such marks of distinction. Those who engaged in the crusades also took
                    up several figures hitherto unknown in armorial ensigns; such as alerians,
                    bezants, escalop-shells, martlets, and the like, but more particularly crosses,
                    of different colours for the sake of distinction. From this it may be concluded
                    that heraldry, like most human inventions, was insensibly introduced and
                    established; and that, after having been rude and unsettled for many ages, it
                    was at last methodised, perfected, and fixed, by the crusades and
                    tournaments.</p>
                <p>These marks of honour are called <hi rend="italic">arms,</hi> from their being
                    principally worn in war and in tournaments by military men, who had them
                    engraved, embossed, or depicted on shields, targets, banners, or other martial
                    instruments. They are also called <hi rend="italic">coats-of-arms,</hi> from the
                    custom of the ancients embroidering them on the coats which they wore over their
                    arms, as heralds do to this day. Arms are distinguished by different names, to
                    denote the causes of their bearing; such as, arms of <hi rend="italic"
                    >dominion,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">pretension, of concession,</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">community,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">patronage,</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">family,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">alliance,</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">succession.</hi> Arms of <hi rend="italic">dominion</hi> or
                    sovereignty are those which emperors, kings, and sovereign states constantly
                    bear, and which are, as it were, annexed to the territories, kingdoms, and
                    provinces they possess. Thus the three lions are the arms of England, the
                    fleurs-de-lis those of France, and so on. Arms of <hi rend="italic"
                    >pretension</hi> are those of kingdoms, provinces, or territories, which a
                    prince or lord has some claim to, and which he adds to his own, although these
                    kingdoms or territories be possessed by a foreign prince or other lord. Thus the
                    kings of England have quartered the arms of France with their own ever since
                    Edward III. laid claim to the kingdom of Fiance, which happened in the year
                    1330, on account of his being son to Isabelle, sister to Charles the Handsome,
                    who died without issue. Arms of <hi rend="italic">concession,</hi> or
                    augmentation of honour, are either entire arms, or else one or more figures,
                    granted by princes as a reward for some extraordinary service. We read in
                    history that Robert Bruce, king of Scotland, allowed the Earl of Wintoun’s
                    ancestor to bear, in his coat-armour, a crown supported by a sword, to show that
                    he and the clan Seaton, of which he was the head, had supported his tottering
                    crown. Queen Anne granted to Sir Cloudesly Shovel, rear-admiral of Great
                    Britain, a cheveron between two fleurs-de-lis in chief, and a crescent in base,
                    to denote three great victories which he had gained, two over the French and one
                    over the Turks. Arms of <hi rend="italic">community</hi> are those of
                    bishoprics, cities, universities, academies, societies, companies, and other
                    bodies corporate. Arms of <hi rend="italic">patronage</hi> are such as governors
                    of provinces, lords of manors, patrons of benefices, and others, add to their
                    family arms, as a token of their superiority, rights, and jurisdiction. These
                    arms have introduced into heraldry, castles, gates, wheels, ploughs, rakes,
                    harrows, and the like. Arms of <hi rend="italic">family,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">paternal arms,</hi> are those which belong to one particular
                    family, and distinguish it from others, and which no person is suffered to
                    assume without committing a crime that sovereigns have a right to restrain and
                    punish. Arms of <hi rend="italic">alliance</hi> are those which families or
                    private persons take up and join to their own, to denote the alliances which
                    they <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642267" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2267-0244"/>have
                    contracted by marriage. This sort of arms is either impaled, or borne in an <hi
                    rend="italic">escutcheon of pretence,</hi> by those who <hi rend="subscript">
                    r</hi> have married heiresses. Arms of <hi rend="italic">succession</hi> are
                    such as are taken up by those who inherit certain estates, manors, and other
                    hereditaments, either by will, entail, or donation, and which they either impale
                    or quarter with their own arms; and this multiplies the titles of some families
                    from necessity, and not through ostentation, as some have imagined.</p>
                <p>These are the eight classes under which the different kinds of arms are generally
                    arranged; but there is a sort which blazoners call <hi rend="italic">assumptive
                    arms,</hi> being such as are assumed by the caprice or fancy of upstarts, though
                    of ever so mean extraction, who, being advanced to a degree of fortune, take
                    them without any legal title. This is considered as a great abuse of heraldry,
                    and common only in Britain, no such practice being permitted on the
                    Continent.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to consider the essential and integral parts of arms, which are,
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Escutcheon,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tinctures,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Charges,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ornaments.</hi></p>
                <p>I. OF THE SHIELD OR ESCUTCHEON.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi><hi rend="italic">shield</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >escutcheon</hi> is the shield or ground on which are represented the figures
                    that make up a coat-of-arms. These marks of distinction were originally put on
                    bucklers or shields before they were placed on banners, standards, flags, and
                    coat-armour; and wherever they may be fixed, they are ⅛till represented on a
                    plain or superficies the form of which resembles a shield.</p>
                <p>Shields, in heraldry called <hi rend="italic">escutcheons</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">scutcheons,</hi> from the Latin word <hi rend="italic"
                    >scutum,</hi> have been, and still are, of different forms, according to the
                    usages of different times and nations. Amongst ancient shields, some were almost
                    like a horseshoe, and others triangular, somewhat rounded at the bottom. The
                    people who inhabited Mesopotamia, now called <hi rend="italic">Diar-behir,</hi>
                    made use of this sort of shield. Sometimes the shield was heptagonal, that is,
                    had seven sides. The first of this shape is said to have been used by the
                    celebrated triumvir Marc Antony. That of knights-banneret was square, like a
                    banner. As to modern escutcheons, those of the Italians, particularly of
                    ecclesiastics, are generally oval. The English, French, Germans, and other
                    nations, have their escutcheons formed different ways, according to the carver’s
                    or painter’s fancy.- But the escutcheon of maids, widows, and such as are born
                    ladies, and are married to private gentlemen, is generally of the form of a
                    lozenge. Sir George Mackenzie mentions one Muriel, countess of Strathern, who
                    carried her arms in a lozenge, in 1284; a circumstance which shows how long we
                    have been conversant with heraldry.</p>
                <p>Armorists distinguish several parts or points in escutcheons, in order to
                    determine exactly the position of the bearings they are charged with. Thus, in
                    the annexed outline of an escutcheon,</p>
                <p>A is the dexter chief, B the precise middle chief, C the sinister chief, D the
                    honour point, E the fess point, F the nombril point, G the dexter base, H the
                    middle precise base, and I the sinister base.</p>
                <p>The knowledge of these points is of great importance, and ought to be well
                    observed, for they are frequently occupied with things of different kinds. It is
                    necessary to observe, that the dexter side of the escutcheon is opposite to the
                    left hand, and the sinister side to the right hand, of the person who looks on
                    it.</p>
                <p>II. OF TINCTURES, FURS, LINES, AND DIFFERENCES.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Of Tinctures.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tinctures</hi> is meant that variable hue of arms which is common
                    both to shields and their bearings. According to the French heralds, there are
                    but seven tinctures in armoury, of which two are metals, and the other five
                    colours. The metals are gold, termed <hi rend="italic">or</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and silver, termed <hi rend="italic">argerd.</hi> The colours are blue,
                    termed <hi rend="italic">azure</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> red, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">gules</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> green, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >vert</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> purple, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >purpure</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and black, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >sable.</hi> When natural objects, such as animals, plants, celestial bodies,
                    and the like, are introduced into coats-of-arms, they retain their natural
                    colours, which is expressed in this science by the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >proper.</hi> Besides the five colours above mentioned, the English writers on
                    heraldry admit two others, namely, orange, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >tenηy</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and blood-colour, termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >sanguine.</hi> But these two are rarely to be found in British bearings.</p>
                <p>These tinctures are represented in engravings and drawings by dots and lines (as
                    in fig. 3, No. 1-9), which are the invention of the ingenious Silvester de Petra
                    Sancta, an Italian author of the seventeenth century. Thus, or is expressed by
                    dots; <hi rend="italic">argent</hi> needs no mark, and is therefore plain; <hi
                    rend="italic">azure,</hi> by horizontal lines; <hi rend="italic">gules,</hi> by
                    perpendicular lines; <hi rend="italic">vert,</hi> by diagonal lines from the
                    dexter chief to the sinister base points; <hi rend="italic">purpure,</hi> by
                    diagonal lines from the sinister chief to the dexter base points; <hi
                    rend="italic">sable,</hi> by perpendicular and horizontal lines crossing each
                    other; <hi rend="italic">tenny,</hi> by diagonal lines from the sinister chief

                    >sanguine,</hi> by lines crossing each other diagonally from dexter to sinister,
                    and from sinister to dexter.</p>
                <p>Sir George Mackenzie observes, that some fantastic heralds have blazoned not only
                    by the ordinary colours and metals, but by flowers, days of the week, parts of a
                    man’s body, and the like, and have been condemned for it by the heralds of all
                    nations. Yet, he adds, the English have so far owned this fancy, that they lay
                    it down as a rule that the coats of sovereigns should be blazoned by the
                    planets, and those of noblemen by precious stones. According to this rule, which
                    some think judicious, though Cartwrighl and others reprobate it as absurd, the
                    relative blazonry would stand thus:</p>

                <p>“But I crave leave to say,” continues Sir G. Mackenzie, “that these are but mere
                    fancies, and are likewise unfit for the art, for these reasons: Is/, The French,
                    from whom the English derive their heraldry, not only in principles, but in
                    words of the French language, do not only not use these different ways of
                    blazoning, but treat them <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">ridicuk.
                    2dly,</hi> The Italian, Spanish, and Latin heralds use no such different forms,

                    should imitate nature; and as it would be an unnatural thing in common discourse
                    not to call red <hi rend="italic">red</hi> because a prince wears it, so it is
                    unnatural to use these terms in heraldry. And it may fall out to be very
                    ridiculous in some arms; for instance, if a prince had for <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">?</hi> A hundred other examples might be given; but it is enough
                    to say, that this is to confound colours with charges, and the things that are
                    borne with colours, <hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi> It makes the art unpleasant,
                    and deters gentlemen from studying it, and strangers from understanding what our
                    heraldry is; nor could the arms of our princes and nobility be translated in
                    this disguise into Latin or any other language. But that which convinces most
                    that this is an error is, because it makes that great rule unnecessary, whereby
                    colour cannot be put upon colour, nor metal upon metal; but this cannot hold but
                    where metals and colours are expressed.” The English heralds give different
                    names to the roundlet (No. 10), according to its colour. Thus, if it be or, it
                    is called a <hi rend="italic">bezant;</hi> if argent, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >plate</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> if azure, <hi rend="italic">ŭhurt;</hi> if

                    rend="italic">guze.</hi> The French, and all other nations, do not admit such a
                    multiplicity of names for this figure, but call them <hi rend="italic"
                    >bezants,</hi> after an ancient coin struck at Constantinople, anciently <hi
                    rend="italic">Byzantium,</hi> if they are or and torteaux; or of any other
                    tincture, expressing the same.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Of Furs.</hi></p>
                <p>Furs represent the hairy skin of certain beasts, prepared for the doublings or
                    linings of robes and garments of state; and as shields were anciently covered
                    with furred skins, they are therefore used in heraldry not only for the linings
                    of the mantles, and other ornaments of the shields, but also in the
                    coats-of-arms themselves.</p>
                <p>There are three different kinds in general use, namely, 1. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ermine,</hi> which is a field argent, powdered with black spots, the tails of
                    which terminate in three hairs (No. 11); 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Counter-ermine,</hi> where the field is sable, and the powdering white (No.
                    12); and, 3. <hi rend="italic">Vαir</hi> (No. 15), which is expressed by blue
                    and white skins, cut into the forms of little bells, ranged in rows opposite to
                    each other, the base of the white ones being always next to that of the blue
                    ones. Vair usually consists of six rows; if there be more or fewer, the number
                    ought to be expressed; and if the colours be different from those above
                    mentioned, they should likewise be expressed.</p>
                <p>The English multiply the furs, as well as the names of the tinctures, though no
                    other nation has adopted such varieties. Thus they give us, 1. <hi rend="italic"
                    >White,</hi> which is the natural colour of the ermine, but is used upon no
                    occasion except in the description of mantles. 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ermines,</hi> which is the same with contra-ermine. 3. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erminois,</hi> where the field is or, and the powdering sable (No. 13). 4. <hi
                    rend="italic">Pean,</hi> where the field is sable, and the powdering or (No.
                    14). The French use no such term; but they call all furs or doublings <hi
                    rend="italic">des pannes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pennes,</hi> a term which has
                    possibly given rise to this mistake, and many others, on the part of those who
                    did not understand the French language. 5. <hi rend="italic">Εrminites,</hi> the
                    same as ermine, with the addition of a red hair on each side of the black. Sir
                    George Mackenzie calls these distinctions “but fancies, for <hi rend="italic"
                    >erminites</hi> signifies properly <hi rend="italic">little ermines?</hi> 6. <hi
                    rend="italic">Counter-vair,</hi> when the bells of the same tincture are placed
                    base against base, and point against point (No. 16). 7. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Potent-counter-potent,</hi> anciently called <hi rend="italic"
                    >vairy-cuppy,</hi> as when the field is filled with crutches or potents
                    counterplaced (No. 17).</p>
                <p>It may not be improper to observe here, that the use of the tinctures took its
                    rise from the several colours used by warriors whilst they were in the army,
                    which Silvester de Petra Sancta proves by many citations. And because it was the
                    custom to embroider gold and silver on silk, or silk on cloth of gold and
                    silver, the heralds therefore appointed, that, in imitation of the clothes so
                    embroidered, colour should never be used upon colour, nor metal upon metal.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Of the Lines used in the parting of Fields.</hi></p>
                <p>Escutcheons are either of one tincture or more than one. Those which are of one
                    only, that is, when some metal, colour, or fur, is spread all over the surface
                    or field, are said to have such a tincture predominant; but in those which have
                    more than one, the field is divided by lines, which, according to their
                    different forms, receive various names.</p>
                <p>Lines may be either straight or crooked. Straight lines are carried evenly
                    through the escutcheon, and are of four different kinds, viz. a perpendicular
                    line ∣; a horizontal, —; a diagonal dexter, ∖; a diagonal sinister, ∕. Crooked
                    lines are those which are carried unevenly through the escutcheon, rising and
                    falling. French armorists reckon eleven different sorts of these; Guillim admits
                    of only seven; but there are fourteen distinct kinds, viz. 1. The engrailed; 2.
                    the invected; 3. the wavy; 4. the embattled, or crenelle; 5. the nebule; 6. the
                    regule; 7. the indented; 8. the dancette; 9. the dove-tail; 10. the grafted; 11.
                    the embattled aronde; 12. the battled embattled; 13. the patee or dove-tail; and
                    14. the champaine.</p>
                <p>The principal reason why lines are thus used in heraldry, is to distinguish
                    bearings which would otherwise be the same; for an escutcheon charged with a
                    chief engrailed, differs from one charged with a chief wavy, as much as if the
                    one bore a cross and the other’ a saltier.</p>
                <p>As the lines above mentioned serve to divide the field, it must be observed, that
                    if the division consist of two equal parts formed by the perpendicular line, it
                    is called <hi rend="italic">parted per pale;</hi> by the horizontal line, <hi
                    rend="italic">parted per fess</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by the diagonal
                    dexter, <hi rend="italic">parted per bend;</hi> and by the diagonal sinister,
                    <hi rend="italic">parted per bend sinister.</hi> If a field be divided into four
                    equal parts by any of these lines, it is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >quartered,</hi> and this may be done in two ways, viz.</p>
                <p>1. Quartered or parted <hi rend="italic">per cross,</hi> which is made by a per-
                    ’ pendicular and horizontal line, crossing each other at the centre of the
                    field, and dividing it into four equal parts called <hi rend="italic"
                    >quarters.</hi> 2. Quartered or parted <hi rend="italic">per saltier,</hi> which
                    is made by two diagonal lines, dexter and sinister, crossing one another in the
                    centre of the field, and likewise dividing it into four equal parts.</p>
                <p>The escutcheon is sometimes divided into a greater number of parts, in order to
                    place in it the arms of the several families to which one is allied; and in this
                    case it is called a <hi rend="italic">genealogical achievement.</hi> These
                    divisions may consist of six, eight, twelve, and sixteen, quarters, and even
                    sometimes of twenty, thirty-two, sixty-four, and upwards; there being examples
                    of such divisions frequently exhibited at pompous funerals. An extraordinary
                    instance of this kind was exhibited at the funeral of the Viscountess Townshend,
                    whose corpse was brought from Dublin Castle to Rainhamhall in Norfolk; on which
                    occasion one of the principal tenants on horseback carried before the hearse a
                    genealogical banner, containing the quarterings of, his lordship’s and her
                    ladyship’s families, to the amount of upwards of 160 coats. But Sir William
                    Dugdale justly objects to so many arms being clustered together in one shield or
                    banner, on account of the difficulty of knowing and distinguishing one
                    coat-of-arms from another.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Of the Differences of Coats-of-Arms.</hi></p>
                <p>Armorists have invented various differences or characteristical marks, by which
                    bearers of the same coat-of-arpis may be distinguished from one another, and
                    their nearness to the principal bearer demonstrated; and these differences are
                    to be considered as either ancient or modern.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642293" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2293-0246"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of Ancient Differences.</hi> Those which are called <hi
                    rend="italic">ancient differences</hi> consist in <hi rend="italic"

                    principal figure, and numbered amongst the rest of the ordinaries.</p></note>
                    which is a bearing that goes all round, and parallel to the boundary of the
                    escutcheon, in the form of a hem, and always contains a fifth part of the field
                    in breadth. Bordures were used in ancient times not only for distinguishing one
                    nation or. tribe from another, but also for noting a diversity between
                    particular persons descended of one family and from the same parents. This
                    distinction, however, was not expressly signified by invariable marks; nor were
                    bordures always appropriated to denote the different degrees of consanguinity;
                    for, as Sir Henry Spelman rightly observes, ancient heralds, being fond of
                    perspicuous differences, often inverted the paternal tincture, or sometimes
                    inserted another charge in the escutcheon, such as bends, croslets, cantons, or
                    the like; an irregularity which, he supposes, has induced modern armorists to
                    invent and make use of others.</p>
                <p>There are bordures of different forms and tinctures, as, [.for example, 1. Sable,
                    a bordure argent, borne by the Earl of Thanet. When a border is plain, it is not
                    necessary to mention it, as it is always so understood in heraldry, though it be
                    not expressed; but if it has any other form, this must be signified. 2. Gules, a
                    bordure engrailed argent, borne by Lord Gray. This is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >engrailed,</hi> from the French word <hi rend="italic">engrele,</hi> which
                    signifies a thing the hail has fallen upon and broken off’ the edges, leaving it
                    with little semicircles struck out of it. 3. Gules, a bordure engrailed or,
                    borne by the Earl of Shrewsbury. In a bordure or ordinary formed of these lines,
                    the points are represented on all sides towards the field, and the semicircles
                    are turned towards the bordure or ordinary. 4. Argent, a bordure invected azure.
                    This is quite contrary to the last, which turns its points from the bordure into
                    the field. 5. Gules, a bordure indented argent. The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >indented</hi> requires little explanation, the signification being obvious,
                    from its figure, which is composed of tracks resembling teeth, called in Latin
                    <hi rend="italic">dentes.</hi> 6. Azure, a bordure ermine. 7. Vert, a bordure
                    vair. 8. Ermine, a bordure compony, or gobony, or and sable. This is so termed
                    from its being composed of small equal pieces. 9. Quarterly, azure and gules, a
                    bordure compony argent and azure, borne by the Duke of Beaufort. 10. Azure, a
                    bordure counter-compony argent and gules. But the counter-compony always
                    consists of two tracks and no more. 11. Or, a bordure cheeky argent and sable.
                    This has a great resemblance to the last bordure, having only one track more.
                    Before blazoning, therefore, care must be taken to number them, so as to avoid
                    taking the one for the other. 12. Gules, a bordure argent, charged with eight
                    trefoils slipped proper, that is, vert. All nations use few terms in blazoning
                    bordures; but English armorists have perplexed it, and rendered it
                    unintelligible to all foreigners, by introducing several mystical proper names,
                    amongst which may be reckoned the following, viz. They call a bordure, if
                    charged with eight plants, fruits, flowers, or leaves, <hi rend="italic"
                    >verdoy</hi> of such vegetables; or <hi rend="italic">enaluron</hi> of such
                    birds; <hi rend="italic">enurny</hi> of beasts; <hi rend="italic">perflew</hi>
                    of furs; and <hi rend="italic">entoyre</hi> of inanimate things, of whatsoever
                    kind. 13. Gules on a bordure azure, eight stars or. 14. Argent, a bordure
                    compony of the last and gules, the first charged with roses of the second,
                    barbed and seeded proper. This bordure is borne by the Duke of Richmond. 15.
                    Ermine, with a bordure engrailed gules, the coat-of-arms of Viscount Kingsland.
                    This family is of French extraction, and allied to the Dukes of Lower Bretagne.
                    16. Argent, a bordure sable charged with eight bezants, borne by Lord Ranelagh.
                    17. Party per pale argent and gules, a: bordure charged with eight escalops
                    counterchanged; I</p>
                <p>the coat of arms of Maule, Lord Panmure. This ancient family is originally
                    French, and derives its surname from' the lordship of Maule in Normandy, where
                    the same arms are still to be seen in the parish church. 18. Azure, a bordure
                    quarterly, the first and fourth ermine, the second and third counter-compony
                    argent and azure. 19. Purpure, a bordure compony or and gules, each of the last
                    charged with a bezant. 20. Quarterly or and gules, within a bordure vert,
                    charged with eight escalops or. We shall conclude this head with observing, that
                    a bordure is never of metal upon metal, and seldom of colour upon colour, but
                    rather of the same tincture with the principal bearing or charge. Thus Dalziel
                    of Glenae, whose predecessor was a younger brother of the family of Carnwath,
                    has, within a bordure argent, the paternal coat of the ancient name of Dalziel,
                    viz. sable, a hanged man with his arms extended, argent, and whom they formerly
                    carried hanging on a gallows. This bearing, though so very singular for a
                    coat-of-arms, was given as a reward to one of the ancestors of the Earl of
                    Carnwath, to perpetuate the memory of a brave and hazardous exploit performed,
                    in taking down from a gallows the body of a favourite and near relative of
                    Kenneth II. who had been hung up by the Picts. The story is thus related by
                    Nisbet: “The king being exceedingly grieved that the body of his minion and
                    kinsman should be so disgracefully treated, he proffered a great reward to any
                    of his subjects who would adventure to rescue his corpse from the disgrace his
                    cruel enemies had unjustly put upon it; but when none would undertake this
                    hazardous enterprise, at last a valorous gentleman came and said to the king,
                    <hi rend="italic">Dalziel,</hi> which signifies, <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>
                    I dare;’ and he did actually perform that noble exploit to the king’s
                    satisfaction and his own immortal honour, and in memory of it got the aforesaid
                    remarkable bearing; and afterwards his posterity took the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dalziel</hi> for their surname; and the interpretation of it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >I dare,</hi> continues even to this day to be the motto of that noble family.”
                    We can have no better proof of the truth of the tradition than this, that the
                    heads of the ancient family in question have for ages carefully retained this
                    bearing without any alteration or addition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of Modern Differences.</hi> The modern differences which the
                    English have adopted, not only for distinguishing sons issued out of one family,
                    but also for denoting the difference and subordinate degrees in each house from
                    the original ancestors, are nine, viz. for the heir or first son, the label;
                    second son, the crescent; third.son, the mullet; <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    fourth son, the martlet; fifth son, the annulet; sixth son,' the fleur-de-lis;
                    seventh son, the rose; eighth son, the cross-moline; ninth son, the double
                    quatre-foil. By these differences the six sons of Thomas Beauchamp, the
                    fifteenth Earl of Warwick, who died in the thirty-fourth year of the reign of
                    Edward III. are distinguished in an old window of the church of St Mary at
                    Warwick; so that although they are called <hi rend="italic">modem
                    differences,</hi> their usage among the English is ancient.</p>
                <p>It must be observed, that of all the above-mentioned marks of distinction, none
                    but the label is affixed on the coats-of-arms belonging to any of the royal
                    family; which the authors of this peculiarity have, however, thought proper to
                    distinguish by additional pendants and distinct charges on them.</p>
                <p>As to the distinction to be made in the arms of the offspring belonging to each
                    of the above-mentioned brothers, it is expressed by figures on the top and
                    margin of the table contained in fig. 3. For instance, the heir or first son of
                    the second house bears a crescent charged with a label during his father’s
                    lifetime only; the second son of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642306"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2306-0247"/>second house, a crescent charged with another
                    crescent; the third son of the second house, a crescent charged with a mullet;
                    the fourth son of the second house, a crescent charged with a martlet; the fifth
                    son of the second house, a crescent charged with an annulet; the sixth son of
                    the second house, a crescent charged with a fleur-de-lis; and so on of the other
                    sons, taking care to have them of a different tincture.</p>
                <p>It is not certain in what part of the escutcheon these differences should be
                    borne; for Guillim, Morgan, and others, give us many different examples of their
                    position. The honour-point would be the most proper place, if the arms would
                    admit of it; but that is not always the case, as the part in question may be
                    charged with some figure in the paternal coat, which cannot with propriety
                    receive the difference. There arc instances where these are borne as perfect
                    coats-of-arms, which are to be blazoned thus: The first is azure, a label
                    argent. When such a label is borne as a difference, the pendants, according to
                    Leigh, signify that he is but the third person; the dexter pendant referring to
                    his father, the sinister to his mother, and the middle one to himself. The
                    second is argent, a label of five points azure, borne by the name of
                    Henting-ton. If a label has more or less than three pendants or points, they are
                    to be expressed as in the foregoing example. The third is azure, a crescent
                    argent, borne by the name of Lucy. The reason Leigh assigns for the second son
                    having a crescent for a difference, is to show that he should increase the
                    family by adding to its riches and reputation. The fourth is argent, a mullet
                    sable, on a chief azure, a fleur-de-lis or; borne by the name of Rogers, in
                    Gloucestershire. A mullet or spur was appointed for the third son’s difference,
                    to indicate that he should follow chivalry. The fifth is azure, a fleur-de-lis
                    argent; borne by Digby Baron Digby of Geaśhill, in King’s County, Ireland.</p>
                <p>These examples, with many more which might be produced, demonstrate the
                    impropriety of adopting these <hi rend="italic">modern differences</hi> as marks
                    of cadency to distinguish the different branches of a family; for it is
                    impossible to distinguish the uncle or granduncle from the nephew or
                    grandnephew, if each of them are second, third, or fourth sons; and in the
                    course of succession these differences would multiply to such a number, that it
                    would be impossible in most cases to delineate them distinctly. But as they are
                    given by most of the English writers on heraldry, though no foreign nation uses
                    them, it was thought proper to insert them here.</p>
                <p>Sisters, except of the blood-royal, have no other mark of difference in their
                    coats-of-arms, than the form of the escutcheon; and therefore they arc permitted
                    to bear the arms of their father, even as the eldest son does after his father’s
                    decease. The reason of this is said to be, that when they are married, they lose
                    their surname, and receive that of their husbands.</p>
                <p>Next to these diminutions Leigh, Guillim, and Dr Harris in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lexico</hi><hi rend="italic">Technicum,</hi> set forth at large different
                    figures, which, they pretend, were formerly added to the coats of such as were
                    to be punished and branded for cowardice, fornication, slander, adultery,
                    treason, or murder, for which they give them the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >abatements of honour</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as they produce but one
                    instance of such whimsical bearings, we have not inserted them here. Besides,
                    arms being marks of honour, they cannot admit of any note of infamy; nor would
                    any body now-a-days bear them if they were so branded. It is true, a man may be
                    degraded for various crimes, particularly high treason; but in such cases the
                    escutcheon is reversed, trodden upon, and torn in pieces, to denote a total
                    extinction and suppression of the honour and dignity of the person to whom it
                    belonged.</p>
                <p>lit. OF THE CHARGES.</p>
                <p>Armorists call a charge whatsoever is contained in the field, whether it occupy
                    the whole or only a part thereof. All charges are distinguished by the names of
                    <hi rend="italic">honourable ordinaries, subordinaries,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">common charges.</hi></p>
                <p>Honourable ordinaries, the principal charges in heraldry, are made of lines only,
                    which, according to their disposition and form, receive different names.
                    Sub-ordinaries arc ancient heraldic figures, frequently used in coats of arms,
                    and which are distinguished by terms appropriated to each of them. Common
                    charges are composed of natural, artificial, and even chimerical objects or
                    figures; such as planets, creatures, vegetables, instruments, and the like.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Of Honourable Ordinaries.</hi></p>
                <p>The most judicious armorists admit of only nine honourable ordinaries, viz. the
                    chief, the pale, the bend, the bend sinister, the fess, the bar, the cheveron,
                    the cross, and the saltier. Of these, six only have diminutives, which are as
                    follow: That of the chief is a <hi rend="italic">fillet</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the pale has a <hi rend="italic">pallet</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >endorse</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the bend, a <hi rend="italic">bendlet,
                    cost,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">riband;</hi> the bend sinister has the <hi
                    rend="italic">scarp</hi> and <hi rend="italic">baton;</hi> the bar, the <hi
                    rend="italic">closet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">barulet</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and thecheveron, a <hi rend="italic">cheveronel</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">couple-close.</hi><hi rend="italic">Of the Chief.</hi> The chief
                    is an ordinary determined by a horizontal line, which, if it be of any other
                    form but straight, must be expressed. It is placed in the upper part of the
                    escutcheon, and contains in depth the third part of the field. Its diminutive is
                    a fillet, the content of which is not to exceed one fourth of the chief, and it
                    stands in the lowest part of the escutcheon. This ordinary is subject to be
                    charged with variety of figures; and may be indented, wavy, nebule, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>1. Or, a chief indented azure; borne by Viscount Mount-: garret. The family of
                    the Butlers is descended from the ancient Counts of Brion in Normandy; but since
                    Henry II. conferred the office of chief butler of Ireland upon one of the
                    family, he and his successors have assumed the name of Butler. 2. Azure, a chief
                    engrailed or. 3. Argent, a chief invected vert. 4. Vert, a chief undy or. 5.
                    Azure, a chief nebule argent. 6. Or, a chief cheeky azure and argent. 7. Ermine,
                    a chief quarterly or and gules; borne by the name of Peckham. 8. Argent, a chief
                    sable; in the lower part thereof a fillet of the field. 9. Azure, fretty argent,
                    a chief or; borne by Viscount Doneraile. This family is of French extraction,
                    and is descended from Sir Robert Saint Leger, knight, who in 1066 accompanied
                    William duke of Normandy in his expedition into England. 10. Argent, on a chief
                    engrailed azure, a tortoise passant or; borne by the name of Bidgood. 11.
                    Argent, on a chief gules, two spur revels or; borne by Lord St John of Bletshoe.
                    This ancient family derive their surname from a place called St John in
                    Normandy. 12. Argent, on a chief vert, two spears’ heads erect of the field, the
                    points imbrued gules; borne by Viscount Middleton. This family is lineally
                    descended from George de Brodrick, who came into England in the reign of William
                    II. 13. Or, on a chief sable, three escalope of the field, for the name of
                    Graham; and bome quartered in the arms of the Duke, Marquis, and Earl of
                    Montrose, with argent three roses gules. According to the Scottish writers, this
                    family is descended from the renowned Greme or Graeme, who in the year 404 was
                    general of Fergus II.’s army, and in 420 forced his way through the wall built
                    by the Romans between the rivers Forth and Clyde, in order to prevent the Scots
                    from molesting them in their possessions; and the said breach has ever since
                    been called <hi rend="italic">Graeme s Dike.</hi> 14. Argent, on a chief <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642319" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2319-0248"/> indented gules,
                    three crosses patee of the field; borne by the Earl of Egmont. This family is
                    supposed to have sprung from a younger branch of the sovereign dukes of Bretagne
                    in France. They were transplanted into Normandy before the Conquest, possessed

                    of the escutcheon, somewhat less than the quarter, but without any fixed
                    proportion, representing the banner that was given to ancient knights-bannerets,
                    and, generally speaking, possesses the dexter-chief point of the shield; but
                    should it possess the sinister corner, which but seldom occurs, it must be
                    blazoned a canton sinister. The <hi rend="italic">pairle</hi> is a figure formed
                    by the conjunction of the upper half of the saltier with the under half of the
                    pale. The reí is a figure representing two little sticks in saltier, with a
                    mascle in the centre interlaced. Gibbon terms it the <hi rend="italic">herald’s
                    true lover’s knot,</hi> but many dissent from his opinion. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fretty</hi> is said when the field or bearings are covered with a fret of six,
                    eight, or more pieces. The∕&gt;z7e, consisting of two lines terminating in a
                    point, is formed like a wedge, and is borne engrailed, wavy, &amp;c. It issues
                    in general from the chief, and extends towards the base; yet there are some
                    piles borne in bend, and issuing from other parts of the field. The <hi
                    rend="italic">orle</hi> is an ordinary composed of two lines going round the
                    shield, the same as the bordure; but its breadth is but one half of the latter,
                    and at some distance from the brim of the shield. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >inescutcheon</hi> is a little escutcheon borne within the shield. Modern
                    heralds give the name of <hi rend="italic">inescutcheon</hi> to such as are
                    borne single in the fess-point or centre, and call that which is fixed upon the
                    fess-point <hi rend="italic">escutcheon of pretence.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >fressure</hi> is an ordinary commonly supposed to be the half of the breadth of
                    an orle, and is generally borne flowery and counter-flowery, as it is also very
                    often double, and sometimes treble. This double tressure forms part of the arms
                    of Scotland, as marshalled in the royal achievement, and granted to the Scotch
                    monarch by Charlemagne. The <hi rend="italic">annulet,</hi> or ring, is a
                    well-known figure, and is frequently found in arms throughout every kingdom of
                    Europe. The <hi rend="italic">flanches</hi> are formed by two curved lines, or
                    semicircles, being always borne double. The <hi rend="italic">flasques</hi>
                    resemble the flanches, except that the circular lines do not go so near the
                    centre of the field. The <hi rend="italic">voiders</hi> are considered as a
                    subordinate ordinary, and are not unlike the flasques, but they occupy less of
                    the field. The <hi rend="italic">billet</hi> is an oblong square figure, twice
                    as long as broad. Some heralds <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642371"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2371-0252"/>imagine that they represent bricks for building;
                    but others more properly consider them as representing folded paper or letters.
                    The <hi rend="italic">lozenge</hi> is an ordinary of four equal and parallel
                    sides, but not rectangular; two of its opposite angles being acute, and the
                    other two obtuse. <hi rend="italic">. Gutts,</hi> or drops, are round at bottom,
                    waved on the sides, and terminate at the top in points. Heralds have given them
                    different names, according to their different tinctures. Thus, if they are
                    yellow, they are called <hi rend="italic">d’or</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> if
                    white, <hi rend="italic">d’eau</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> if red, <hi
                    rend="italic">de sang</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> if blue, <hi rend="italic">de
                    larmes;</hi> if green, <hi rend="italic">de vert;</hi> if black, <hi
                    rend="italic">de poix.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">fusil</hi> is longer than the
                    lozenge, having its upper and lower part more acute than the other two
                    collateral middle parts, which acuteness is occasioned by the short distance of
                    the space between the two collateral angles; and this space, if the fusil be
                    rightly made, is always shorter than any of the four equal geometrical lines of
                    which it is composed. The <hi rend="italic">rustre</hi> is a lozenge pierced
                    round in the middle. The <hi rend="italic">mascle</hi> is pretty much like a
                    lozenge, but voided or perforated throughout its whole extent, showing a narrow
                    border.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Authors are
                    divided about the resemblance of a mascle, some taking it for the mash of a net,

                    writer has given a clearer account in support of this last opinion than
                    Colombier, author of <hi rend="italic">Lα</hi><hi rend="italic">Sciente</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Héraldique,</hi> we shall transcribe it for the satisfaction of
                    the curious. “Rohan,” says he, “bears gules, nine mascles, or, 3, 3, 3. Opinions
                    have varied very much about the origin of the itiascles or mashes, as being
                    somewhat like the meshes of nets; but for my own part, having often observed
                    that those things which are remarkable and singular in some countries, have
                    sometimes occasioned the lords thereof to represent them in their escutcheons,
                    and to take them for their arms, I am of opinion, that the lords of Rohan, who,
                    I believe, are the first that bore those figures in their arms, though descended
                    from the ancient kings and princes of Bretagne, took them, because in the most
                    ancient viscounty of Rohan, afterwards erected into a duchy, there are abundance
                    of small flints, which being cut in two, this figure appears on the inside of
                    them; as also the carps, which are in the fish-ponds of that duchy, have the
                    same mark upon their scales; which, being very extraordinary, and peculiar to
                    that country, the ancient lords of the same had good reason, upon observing that
                    wonder, to take those figures for their arms, and to transmit them to their
                    posterity, giving them the name of <hi rend="italic">macles,</hi> from the Latin
                    word <hi rend="italic">macula,</hi> signifying a spot; whence some of that house
                    have taken for their motto, <hi rend="italic">Sine macula macla,</hi> that is, a
                    mascle without a spot.”</p></note><hi rend="italic">Papilione</hi> is an
                    expression used for a field or charge that is covered with figures like the
                    scales of a fish. <hi rend="italic">Diapering</hi> is said of a field or charge
                    shadowed with flourishings or foliage, with a colour a little darker than that
                    on which it is wrought. The Germans frequently use it; but it does not enter
                    into the blazoning or description of an arms, and only serves to embellish the
                    coat.</p>
                <p>If the forementioned ordinaries have any attributes, that is, if they are
                    engrailed, indented, wavy, &amp;c. they must be distinctly specified, after the
                    same manner as the honourable ordinaries.</p>
                <p>The following are examples of sub-ordinaries, viz. 1. Gules, an orle ermine;
                    borne by the name of Humfran-ville. 2. Argent, three inescutcheons gules; borne
                    by the name of Hay, and the second and third quarters in the coat-of-arms of
                    Hay, earl of Kinnoull. The first of the name of Hay who bore these arms obtained
                    them because he and his two sons, after having defeated a party of the Danes at
                    the battle of Loncarty in the year 942, were brought to the king with their
                    shields all stained with blood. 3. Argent, a fret sable; borne by Talmash, earl
                    of Dysart. 4. Or, fretty of gules, a canton ermine; borne by Noel, earl of
                    Gainsborough, descended from Noel, who came into England with William the
                    Conqueror, and, in consideration of his services, obtained a grant of several
                    manors and lands. 5. Gironny of eight pieces or and sable; the first and fourth
                    quarters of the coat-of-arms of Campbell, now Marquis of Breadalbane, descended
                    in regular succession from Duncan, the first Lord Campbell, ancestor of the
                    family of Argyll. 6. Lozengy argent and gules; borne by Earl Fitz-William,
                    descended from Sir William Fitz-William, marshal of the army of William the
                    Conqueror at the battle of Hastings. 7. Sable, a mascle within a tressure
                    flowery argent; borne by the name of Hoblethorne. 8. Gules, three rnullets or,
                    within a bordure of the latter, charged with a double tressure flowery, and
                    counter-flowery with fleurs-de-lis of the first; borne by the family of
                    Sutherland, &amp;c. This family is amongst the oldest in Britain, if not in
                    Europe; the title of Earl having been conferred on one of their ancestors in
                    1067. 9. Azure, a pile ermine; for the name of Wyche, and quartered as first and
                    fourth in the coat-of-arms of Wyche. 10. Or, on a pile engrailed azure, three
                    cross-croslets fitchy of the first; borne by the name of Rigdon. 11. Or, on a
                    pile gules, three lions of England between six fleurs-de-lis azure; the first
                    and fourth quarters of the Duke of Somerset, granted him by Henry VIII. on his
                    marriage with Lady Jane Seymour. 12. Ermine, two piles issuing from the dexter
                    and sinister sides, and meeting in base sable; borne by the name of Holles. 13.
                    Argent, three piles, one issuing from the chief between the others reversed,
                    sable; for the name of Hulse. 14. Azure, a pile wavy bendways or; borne by the
                    name of Aldham. 15. Or, three piles in bend, each point enseigned with a
                    fleur-de-lis sable; borne by the name of Norton. 16. Argent, three piles meeting
                    near the point of the base azure; borne by the name of Bryan. 17. Party per pale
                    and per bend or and azure counterchanged; borne by the name of Johnson. 18.
                    Party per pale and per cheveron argent and gules counterchanged. 19. Party per
                    pale chappé or and vert counterchanged. This is a bearing seldom to be met with.
                    20. Party per fess gules and argent, a pale counterchanged; borne by the name of
                    Lavider.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Of Common Charges borne in Coats-of-Arrns.</hi></p>
                <p>It has been already observed, that in all ages men have made use of the
                    representation of living creatures, and other symbolical signs, to distinguish
                    themselves in war; and that these marks, which were promiscuously used as
                    hieroglyphics, emblems, and personal devices, gave the first notion of heraldry.
                    But nothing shows the extent of human ingenuity more than the great variety of
                    these marks of distinction, since they are composed of all sorts of figures,
                    some natural, others artificial, and many chimerical or fantastical.</p>
                <p>Hence it is that the sun, moon, stars, comets, meteors, and so on, have been
                    introduced to denote glory, grandeur, power; that lions, leopards, tigers,
                    serpents, stags, have been employed to signify courage, strength, prudence,
                    swiftness. The application to certain exercises, such as war, hunting, music,
                    has furnished lances, swords, pikes, arms, fiddles; architecture, columns,
                    cheverons, &amp;c.; and the other arts several things that relate to them. Human
                    bodies, or distinct parts of them, also clothes and ornaments, have, for some
                    particular intention, found a place in armorial bearings; and trees, plants,
                    fruits, and flowers, have likewise been admitted to denote the rarities,
                    advantages, and singularities of different countries. The relation of some
                    creatures or figures to particular names has farthermore been a very fruitful
                    source of variety marms. Thus the family of Coningsby bears three coneys; that
                    of Arundel, six swallows; that of Urson, a bear; that of Lucie, three pikes, in
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">tres lucios pisces</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that of
                    Starkey, a stork; that of Castlemain, a castle triple-towered<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642384" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2384-0253"/>; and that of Shuttleworth,
                    three weavers’ shuttles.</p>
                <p>Besides these natural and artificial figures, there are chimerical or imaginary
                    ones used in heraldry, the result of fancy and caprice; such as centaurs,
                    hydras, phoenixes, griffons, hippogriffs, dragons, and the like. This great
                    variety of figures shows the impossibility of comprehending all common charges
                    in a work of this nature; therefore such only shall be treated of as are most
                    frequently borne in coats-of-arms, or escutcheons.</p>
                <p>Anτ. 1.— <hi rend="italic">Of Natural Figures borne in Coats-οfArms.</hi></p>
                <p>Amongst the multitude of natural things which are used in coats-of-arms, those
                    most usually borne are, for the sake of brevity as well as perspicuity,
                    distributed into the following classes: viz. <hi rend="italic">Celestial
                    figures,</hi> as the sun, moon, stars, &amp;c. and their parts; <hi
                    rend="italic">effigies</hi> of men, women, &amp;c. and their parts; <hi
                    rend="italic">beasts,</hi> as lions, stags, foxes, boars, &amp;c. and their
                    parts; <hi rend="italic">birds,</hi>. as eagles, swans, storks, pelicans,
                    &amp;c. and their parts; <hi rend="italic">fishes,</hi> as dolphins, whales,
                    sturgeons, trouts, &amp;c. and their parts; <hi rend="italic">reptiles</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">insects,</hi> as tortoises, serpents, grasshoppers, &amp;c.
                    and their parts; <hi rend="italic">vegetables,</hi> as trees, plants, flowers,
                    herbs, &amp;c. and their parts; <hi rend="italic">stones,</hi> as diamonds,
                    rubies, pebbles, rocks, and the like. These charges have, as well as ordinaries,
                    various attributes or epithets, which express their qualities, positions, and
                    dispositions. Thus the sun is said to be <hi rend="italic">in his glory,

                    in the first and fourth quarters of the coat-of-arms of the Marquis of Lothian.
                    2. Azure, one ray of the sun, bendways gules, between six beams of that luminary
                    argent; borne by the name of Aldam. 3. Argent, five rays of the sun issuing out
                    of the sinister corner gules; borne by the name of Mudtshideler, a family of
                    distinction in Franconia. 4. Or, a sun eclipsed. This bearing is seldom to be
                    met with, except in emblematic or hieroglyphic figures, and might be expressed
                    sable, because that hue is accidental and not natural. 5. Gules, the moon in her
                    complement or, illustrated with all her light proper. This is sufficient without
                    naming the colour, which is argent. 6. Azure, a moon decrescent proper; borne by
                    the name of Delaluna. 7. Gules, a moon increscent or; borne by the name of
                    Descus. 8. Argent, a moon in her <hi rend="italic">detriment,</hi> sable. This
                    word is used in heraldry to denote her being eclipsed. 9. Azure, a crescent
                    argent; borne by the name of Lucy. This bearing is also used as a difference,
                    being assigned to the second son, as before mentioned. 10. Gules, three
                    crescents argent; borne by Oliphant, Lord Oliphant. 11. Azure, a crescent
                    between three mullets argent; borne by Arbuthnot, Viscount and Baron Arbuthnot.
                    12. Gules, a star issuing from between the horns of a crescent argent. 13.
                    Azure, a star of sixteen points argent; borne by the name of Huitson. 14.
                    Argent, three mullets pierced sable; borne by the name of Wollaston. 15. Azure,

                    their disposition, or their form. Thus swords are said to be erect, pommeled,
                    hilted; arrows, armed, feathered; towers, covered, embattled; and so of all
                    others, as will more fully appear by the following examples: 1. Sable, three
                    swords, their points meeting in the base argent, pommeled and hilted or, a
                    crescent in chief of the second for difference; borne by Powlet, duke of Bolton,
                    descended from Hercules, lord of Tournon in Picardy, who came over to England
                    with Jeffrey Plantagenet, earl of Anjou, third son of King Henry II., and
                    amongst other lands had the lordship of Paulet in Somersetshire conferred on
                    him. 2. Argent, three battering-rams barways in pale,headed azure and hooped or,
                    an annulet for difference; borne by Bertie, earl of Abington. 3. Azure, three
                    left-hand gauntlets with their backs forward or; borne by Fane, earl of
                    Westmoreland, descended from the Fanes, an ancient family which resided at
                    Badsal in Kent. 4. Azure, three arrows, their points in base or; borne by
                    Archer, Lord Archer, descended from John de Archer, who came over from Normandy
                    with William the Conqueror. 5. Gules, two helmets in chief proper, garnished or,
                    in a base of a garb of the third; borne by Cholmondeley, earl of Cholmondeley,
                    descended from the ancient family of Egerton in Cheshire, which flourished in
                    the time of the Conquest, from whom also the Duke of Bridgewater was descended.
                    6. Argent, a ship with its sails furled up sable; quartered by Hamilton, earl of
                    Abercorn. The descent of this family is from that of the Duke of Hamilton. 7.
                    Or, an anchor in pale gules; quartered by Johnston, marquis of Annandale. The
                    Johnstons are an ancient and warlike family, and derive their surname from the
                    barony of Johnston in Annandale. 8. Sable, three spears’ heads erect argent,
                    imbrued gules, on a chief or, as many pole-axes azure; borne by King, Lord King.
                    9. Gules, three clarions or; quartered by Carteret, earl of Granville. This
                    ancient family derives its pedigreefrom Offercy de Carteret, whoattended William
                    the Conqueror in his descent upon England, and contributed to the victory he
                    obtained over Harold, at Hastings, in 1066. 10. Argent, a maunch sable; borne by
                    Hastings, earl of Huntingdon, descended from Hugh de Hastings, a younger son of
                    the ancient and noble family of the Hastings, earl of Pembroke, of which was
                    William de Hastings, steward of the household to King Henry I. 11. Azure, a
                    circular wreath argent and sable, with four hawks’ bells joined thereto in
                    quadrature or; borne by Jocelyn, Viscount Jocelyn.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This noble family is of great antiquity; for,
                    after the Romans had been masters of Britain for five hundred years, wearied
                    with the wars, they took their final leave of it, and carried away with them a
                    great many of their brave old British soldiers, who had served them in their
                    wars both at home and abroad, to whom they gave Armorica in France, for their
                    former services, which country was from them afterwards denominated Little
                    Britain. It is supposed that there were some of this family amongst them; and

                <p>The last and the oddest kind of bearings in coats-of-arms is comprehended under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">chimerical figures;</hi> that is, such figures as
                    have no real existence, but are mere fabulous and fantastical inventions. These,
                    charges, griffons, martlets, and unicons excepted, are so uncommon in British
                    coats, that in order to make up the same number of examples hitherto contained
                    in each collection, several foreign bearings are introduced; which, however, as
                    they are conformable to the laws of heraldry, may also contribute both to
                    entertain and instruct the reader. Those most in use are the following, namely,
                    angels, cherubims, tritons, centaurs, martlets, griffons, unicons, dragons,
                    mermaids, satyrs, wiverns, harpies, cockatrices, phoenixes.</p>
                <p>These, like the foregoing charges, are subject to various positions and
                    dispositions, which, from the principles already laid down, will be easily
                    nnderstood by the following examples: 1. Gules, an angel standing affrontée,
                    with his hands conjoined and elevated upon his breast, habited in a long robe
                    close girt argent, his wings displayed or; borne by the name of Brangor de
                    Cerevisia, a foreign prelate, who assisted at the council of Constance in 1412.
                    2. Sable, a cheveron between three cherubim or; borne by the <hi

                    cherub having three pair of wings, the uppermost and lowermost counter-crossed
                    saltierways, and the middlemost displayed argent; borne by the name of

                    Macgill. This bird, which is represented without feet, is given for a difference
                    to younger brothers, to put them in mind that, in order to <pb break="no"

                    trust to the wings of virtue and merit, and not to their legs, having but little
                    land to set their feet on. 7. Azure, three mullets argent within a double
                    tressure counter-flowery or, in the centre a martlet of the last; borne by
                    Murray, Lord Elibank. 8. Sable, a cockatrice displayed argent, crested,
                    membered, and jowlopped gules. 9. Argent, a mermaid gules, crined or, holding in
                    her right hand a comb, and in her left a mirror, both proper; borne by the name
                    of Ellis. 10. Argent, a wivern, his wings elevated, and his tail nowed below him

                    of Stephen of Blois, son of Adela, daughter of William the Conqueror, and of
                    Stephen, earl of Blois; who, grounding his pretension to the crown of England on
                    this descent, was proclaimed king in 1135, and reigned till the 25th of October
                    1154. 13. Argent, an unicon sejant sable, un-guled and horned or; borne by the
                    name of Harling. 14. Argent, a dragon’s head erased vert, holding in his mouth a

                <p>To the above-mentioned figures may be added the mon-tegre, an imaginary creature,
                    supposed to have the body of a tiger with the head and horns of a satyr; also
                    those which have a real existence, but are said to be endowed with extravagant
                    and imaginary qualities, as the salamander, beaver, cameleon, and others.</p>
                <p>IV. OF THE EXTERNAL ORNAMENTS OF ESCUTCHEONS.</p>
                <p>The ornaments which accompany or surround escutcheons were introduced to denote
                    the birth, dignity, or office, of the persons to whom the coat-of-arms
                    appertained; and this was practised both amongst the laity and the clergy. Those
                    which are most in use consist of ten sorts, viz. crowns, coronets, mitres,
                    helmets, mantlings, chapeaux, wreaths, crests, scrolls, and supporters.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Of Crowns.</hi></p>
                <p>The first crowns were only diadems, bands, or fillets; but afterwards they were
                    composed of branches of various trees, and then flowers were added to them.
                    Amongst the Greeks, the crowns given to those who carried off the prize at the
                    Isthmian games were of pine; at the Olympic, of laurel; and at the Nemean, of
                    smallage. The Romans also had various crowns to reward martial exploits and
                    extraordinary services done to the republic. Examples of some of these crowns
                    are frequently met with in modern achievements.</p>
                <p>But modem crowns are only used as an ornament, which emperors, kings, and
                    independent princes set on their heads, in great solemnities, both to denote
                    their sovereign authority, and to render themselves more imposing to their
                    subjects. Those most in use in heraldry are as follow:</p>
                <p>Hi. The imperial crown, which is made of a circle of gold, adorned with precious
                    stones and pearls, heightened with fleurs-de-lis, bordered and seeded with
                    pearls, and raised in the form of a cap voided at the top like a crescent. From
                    the middle of this cap rises an arched fillet enriched with pearls, and
                    surmounted with a mound on which is a cross of pearls. No. 1.</p>
                <p>2rf. The crown of the kings of Great Britain, which is a circle of gold, bordered
                    with ermine, enriched with pearls and precious stones, and heightened up with
                    four crosses patee and four large fleurs-de-lis alternately; .from these rise
                    four arched diadems adorned with pearls, which close under a mound, surmounted
                    with a cross like those at the bottom. No. 2.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">3d.</hi> The crown of the kings in France, which is a circle
                    enamelled, adorned with precious stones, and heightened up with eight arched

                    double fleur-de-lis, all of gold. No. 3.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">4íä.</hi> The crowns of Spain, Portugal, and Poland, are all
                    three of the same form, and are described by Colonel Parsons in his <hi

                    with eight arched diadems, which support a mound, ensigned with a plain cross.
                    Those of Denmark and Sweden are both of the same form, and consist of eight
                    arched diadems, rising from a marquis’s coronet, which conjoin at the top under
                    a mound ensigned with a cross-bottony. The crowns of most other kings are
                    circles of gold, adorned with precious stones, heightened up with large
                    trefoils, and closed by four, six, or eight diadems, supporting a mound,
                    surmounted of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> cross.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">5th.</hi> The Grand Signior bears over his arms a turban,
                    enriched with pearls and diamonds, under two coronets, the first of which is
                    made of pyramidical points heightened up with large pearls, whilst the uppermost
                    is surmounted with crescents. No. 4.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">6th.</hi> The pope, or bishop of Rome, appropriates to himself
                    a tiara or long cap of golden cloth, from which hang two pendants embroidered
                    and fringed at the ends, <hi rend="italic">semée</hi> with crosses of gold. This
                    cap is enclosed by three marquises’ coronets; and has on its top a mound of
                    gold, on which is a cross of the same, sometimes represented by engravers and
                    painters pometted, recrossed, flowery, or plain. It is a difficult matter to
                    ascertain the time when the popes assumed the three coronets above mentioned. A
                    succession of the supreme pontiffs, engraved and published by order of Clement
                    XIII. for the edification of his subjects in Great Britain and Ireland,
                    represents Marcellus, who was chosen bishop of Rome in the year 310, and all his
                    successors, adorned with such a cap; but it appears from good authority, that
                    Boniface VIII. who was elected to the see of Rome in the year 1295, first
                    compassed his cap with a coronet; whilst Benedict XII. in 1335, added to it a
                    second, and John XXIII. in 1411, a third, with a view to indicate that the pope
                    is the sovereign priest·, the supreme judge, and the sole legislator, amongst
                    Christians. No. 5.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Of Coronets.</hi></p>
                <p>The coronet of the Prince of Wales, or eldest son of the king of Great Britain,
                    was anciently a circle of gold set round with four crosses patee, and as many
                    fleurs-de-lis alternately; but since the restoration it has been closed with one
                    arch only, adorned with pearls, surmounted by a mound and cross, and bordered
                    with ermine like the king’s. No. 7.</p>
                <p>Besides this coronet, the Prince of Wales has another distinguishing mark of
                    honour, peculiar to himself, called by the vulgar the prince’s arms, namely, a
                    plume of three ostrich-feathers, with an ancient coronet of a prince of Wales.
                    Under this, in a scroll, is the motto, <hi rend="italic">Ich Dien,</hi><pb

                    where having with his own hand killed John, king of Bohemia, he took from his
                    head such a plume as that here described, and put it on its own. No. 6.</p>
                <p>The coronet of all the intermediate sons and brothers of the kings of Great
                    Britain is a circle of gold bordered with ermine, heightened up with four
                    fleurs-de-lis and as many crosses patee alternate. No. 8. The particular and
                    distinguishing form of such coronets as are appropriated to princes of the
                    blood-royal is described and settled in a grant of Charles II. in the thirteenth
                    year of his reign. The coronet of the princesses of Great Britain is a circle of
                    gold bordered with ermine, and heightened up with crosses-patee, fleurs-de-lis,
                    and strawberry leaves alternate (No. 9); whereas a prince’s coronet has only
                    fleurs-de-lis and crosses.</p>
                <p>A duke’s coronet is a circle of gold bordered with ermine, enriched with precious
                    stones and pearls, and set round with eight large strawberry or parsley leaves.
                    No.</p>
                <p>10. A marquis’s coronet is a circle of gold bordered with ermine, set round with
                    four strawberry leaves and as many pearls on pyramidical points of equal height
                    alternate. No.</p>
                <p>11. An earl’s coronet is a circle of gold bordered with ermine, heightened up
                    with eight pyramidical points or rays, on the tops of which are as many large
                    pearls, which are placed alternately with as many strawberry leaves, but the
                    pearls much higher than the leaves. No. 12. A viscount’s coronet differs from
                    the preceding ones as being only a circle of gold bordered with ermine, with
                    large pearls set close together on the rim, without any limited number, which is
                    the prerogative above the baron, who is limited. No. 13. A baron’s coronet,
                    which was granted by King Charles II., is formed with six pearls set at equal
                    distances on a gold circle bordered with ermine, four of which only are seen on
                    engravings, paintings, and the like, to show that he is inferior to the
                    viscount. No. 14. The eldest sons of peers, above the degree of a baron, bear
                    their father’s arms and supporters with a label, and use the coronet
                    appertaining to their father’s second title; and all the younger sons bear their
                    arras with proper differences, but use no coronets.</p>
                <p>As the crown of the king of Great Britain is not quite like that of other
                    potentates, so most of the coronets of foreign noblemen differ a little from
                    those of the British nobility. For example, the coronet of a French earl is a
                    circle of gold with eighteen pearls set on the brim of it; a French viscount’s
                    coronet is a circle of gold only enamelled, charged with four large pearls; a
                    French baron’s coronet is a circle of gold enamelled and bound about with a
                    double bracelet of pearls; but these coronets are only used on French noblemen’s
                    coats-of-arms, and not worn on their heads, as the British noblemen and their
                    ladies do at the king’s coronation.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Of Mitres.</hi></p>
                <p>The archbishops and bishops of England and Ireland place a mitre over their
                    coats-of-arms. It is a round cap pointed and cleft at the top, from which hang
                    two pendants fringed at both ends; with this difference, that the bishop’s mitre
                    is only surrounded with a fillet of gold, set with precious stones (Plate
                    CCLXXXIII. fig. I, No. 6), whereas the archbishop’s issues out of a ducal
                    coronet. (Plate CCLXXXII. fig. 2, No. 15.) This ornament, with other vestments,
                    is still worn by the archbishops and bishops of the church of Rome, whenever
                    they officiate with solemnity; but it is never used in England, otherwise than
                    on coats-of-arms, as before mentioned.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Of Helmets.</hi></p>
                <p>The helmet was formerly worn as a defensive weapon, to cover the bearer’s head,
                    and is now placed over a coat-of-arms as its chief ornament, and the true mark
                    of gentility. Several sorts have been distinguished, Isŕ, by the matter they are
                    made of; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> by their form; and, 3<hi rend="italic"
                    >dly,</hi> by their position.</p>
                <p>Isí, As to the matter they are, or rather were, made of, the helmets of
                    sovereigns were of burnished gold damasked; those of princes and lords, of
                    silver figured with gold; those of knights, of steel adorned with silver; and
                    those of private gentlemen, of polished steel. 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> As
                    to their form, those of the king and the royal family, and noblemen, of Great
                    Britain, are open-faced and grated, and the number of bars serves to distinguish
                    the bearer’s quality; that is, the helmet appropriated to the dukes and
                    marquises is different from the king’s, by having a bar exactly in the middle,
                    and two on each side, making but five bars in all (No. 1), whereas the king’s
                    helmet has six bars, or three on each side (No. 7). The other grated helmet with
                    four bars is common to all degrees of peerage under a marquis. The opened-faced
                    helmet without bars denotes baronets and knights. The close helmet is that for
                    all esquires and gentlemen, 3<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> Their position is also
                    looked upon as a mark of distinction. The grated helmet in front belongs to
                    sovereign princes. The grated helmet in profile is common to all degrees of
                    peerage. The helmet standing direct without bars, and the beaver a little open,
                    denotes baronets and knights. Lastly, the side-standing helmet, with the beaver
                    close, is the manner of wearing it peculiar to esquires and gentlemen. See Nos.
                    1, 2, 3, 4, 7.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Of Mantlings.</hi></p>
                <p>Mantľmgs are pieces of cloth jagged or cut into flowers and leaves, which now
                    serve as an ornament for escutcheons. They were the ancient coverings of
                    helmets, to preserve them, or the bearer, from the injuries of the weather, as
                    also to prevent the evil consequences of their too much dazzling the eye in
                    action. But their shape must have undergone a great alteration since they have
                    been out of use, and therefore they might more properly be termed <hi
                    rend="italic">flourishings</hi> than <hi rend="italic">mantlings.</hi> The
                    French heralds assure us that these mantlings were originally no other than
                    short coverings which commanders wore over their helmets, and that, going into
                    battle with them, they often, on coming away, brought them back in a ragged
                    manner, occasioned by the many cuts which they had received on their heads; and
                    therefore the more hacked they were, the more honourable they were accounted; as
                    our colours in time of war are the more esteemed for having been shot through in
                    many places. Sometimes skins of beasts, as lions, bears, and such like, were
                    thus borne, to make the bearer look more terrible, and that gave occasion to the
                    doubling of mantlings with furs.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Of Chapeaux.</hi></p>
                <p>A chapeau is an ancient hat, or rather cap, of dignity, worn by dukes, generally
                    scarlet-coloured velvet on the outside, lined and turned up with fur, and
                    frequently to be met with above an helmet, instead of a wreath, under
                    gentlemen’s and noblemen’s crests. Heretofore they were seldom to be found, as
                    of right appertaining to private families; but by the grants of Robert Cooke,
                    clarencieux, and other succeeding heralds, these, together with ducal coronets,
                    are now frequently to be met with in families, who yet claim not above the
                    degree of gentlemen. (Plate CCLXXXII. fig. 3, No. 5.) <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193642449" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2449-0258"/><hi rend="italic">7. Of the
                    Wreath.</hi></p>
                <p>The wreath is a kind of roll made of two skeins of silk of different colours
                    twisted together, which ancient knights usually wore as a head-dress when
                    equipped for tournaments. The colours of the silk are always taken from the
                    principal metal and colour contained in the coat-of-arms of the bearer. They are
                    still accounted one of the lesser ornaments of escutcheons, and are placed
                    between the helmet and the crest. In the time of Henry I. and long afterwards,
                    no man who was under the degree of a knight had his crest set upon a wreath; but
                    this, like other prerogatives, has been so far infringed, that every body
                    now-a-days wears a wreath.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Of Crests.</hi></p>
                <p>The crest is the highest part of the ornaments of a coat-of-arms. It is called
                    <hi rend="italic">crest,</hi> from the Latin word <hi rend="italic">crista,</hi>
                    which signifies comb or tuft, such as many birds have upon their heads, as the
                    peacock, pheasant, and others, in allusion to the place on which it is
                    fixed.</p>
                <p>Crests were formerly great marks of honour, because they were only worn by heroes
                    of great valour, or by such as were advanced to some superior military command,
                    in order that they might be the better distinguished in an engagement, and
                    thereby rally their men if dispersed; but they are at present considered as a
                    mere ornament. The crest is frequently a part either of the supporters, or of
                    the charge borne in the escutcheon. Thus the crest of the royal achievement <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Great Britain is a lion guardant crowned, and the crest of
                    France is a double fleur-de-lis. Out of the many crests borrowed from
                    supporters, are the following, namely, the Duke of Montagu’s, a griffon’s head
                    couped or, backed and winged sable; the Marquis of Rockingham’s, a griffon’s
                    head argent, gorged with a ducal coronet; the Earl of Westmoreland’s, a bull’s
                    head argent, pyed sable, armed or; and Lord Archer’s, out of a mural crown or, a
                    wivern’s head argent. There are several instances of crests which relate to
                    alliances, employments, or names; and which on that account have been
                    changed.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Of the Scroll.</hi></p>
                <p>The scroll is the ornament placed above the crest, containing a motto, or short
                    sentence, alluding thereto, or to the bearings, or to the bearer’s name. Thus,
                    the motto of the Earl of Cholmondeley is, <hi rend="italic">Cassis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tutissima virtus,</hi> “Virtue is the safest helmet,” on account
                    of the helmet in the coat-of-arms; and the motto of Lord Fortescue is, <hi
                    rend="italic">Forte scutum</hi><hi rend="italic">salus ducum,</hi> “A strong
                    shield is the safety of the commanders,” alluding to the name of that ancient
                    family. Sometimes, however, the motto has reference to neither, but expresses
                    something divine or heroic; as that of the Earl of Scarborough, <hi
                    rend="italic">Murus</hi><hi rend="italic">aereus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >conscientia</hi><hi rend="italic">Sana,</hi> “A good conscience is a wall of
                    brass.” Others are enigmatical, as that of the royal achievement, which is, <hi
                    rend="italic">Dieu et</hi><hi rend="italic">mon droit,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi> God and my right,” introduced in 1340 by Edward III., when he assumed
                    the arms and title of king of France, and began to prosecute his claim, which
                    occasioned long and bloody wars, fatal by turns to both kingdoms; or that of the
                    Prince of Wales, <hi rend="italic">Ich dien,</hi> “I serve,” the origin of which
                    has already been explained. Mottos, though hereditary in the families which
                    first took them, have been changed on particular occasions, and others
                    appropriated in their stead. Instances of this are sometimes to be met with in
                    the history of families.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Of Supporters.</hi></p>
                <p>Supporters are figures standing on the scroll, and placed at the side of the
                    escutcheon; they are so called because they seem to support or hold up the
                    shield. The rise of supporters is, by Menestrier, traced to ancient tournaments,
                    in which the knights caused their shields to be carried by servants or pages
                    under the disguise of lions, bears, griffons, blackamoors, and the like, who
                    also held and guarded the escutcheons, which the knights were obliged to expose
                    to public view for some time before the lists were opened. But Sir George
                    Mackenzie dissents from this opinion, and contends <hi rend="italic">{Treatise
                    on the Science of Heraldry,</hi> chap, xxxi. p. 93), “That the first origin and
                    use of them was from the custom which ever was, and is, of leading such as are
                    invested with any great honour to the prince who confers it. Thus, when any man
                    is created a duke, marquis, or knight of the garter, or any other order, he is
                    supported by, and led to the prince, betwixt two of the quality, and so receives
                    from him the symbols of that honour; and in remembrance of that solemnity, his
                    arms are thereafter supported by any two creatures he chooses.” Supporters were
                    formerly taken from such animals or birds as were borne in the shields, and
                    sometimes they have been chosen as bearing some allusion to the names of those
                    whose arms they are made to support. The supporters of the arms of Great
                    Britain, since the accession of James I. to the throne, are a lion rampant
                    guardant crowned or, on the dexter side, and an unicon argent, crowned, armed,
                    unguled, maned, and gorged with an antique crown, to which a chain is affixed,
                    all or, on the sinister.</p>
                <p>This last figure represents the coat-of-arms of the king of Great Britain, or the
                    royal achievement, as it has been marshalled since the accession of George I. in
                    1714, and is blazoned as follows, viz.</p>
                <p>ARMS. Quarterly, in the first grand quarter gules, three lions rampant guardant
                    in pale or, the imperial ensigns of England; impaled with or, a lion rampant,
                    within a double tressure flowery and counter-flowery gules, the royal arms of
                    Scotland. The second is azure, three fleurs-de-lis or, the arms of France. The
                    third is azure, a harp or, stringed argent, the ensign of Ireland. The fourth
                    grand quarter is gules, two lions passant guardant in pale or, for Brunswick;
                    impaled with or semée of hearts proper, a lion rampant azure, for Lunenburg;
                    with grafted in base gules a horse current argent, for ancient Saxony; and in a
                    shield surtout gules, the crown of Charlemagne or, as arch-treasurer of the
                    empire; the whole within a garter, inscribed with this motto, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Honi</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">soit qui mal y pense,</hi> as
                    sovereign of that noble order, given by the founder King Edward HI.</p>
                <p>CREST. On a helmet full faced, grated and surmounted by a crown, a lion guardant
                    crowned or; the mantlings of the last, and lining, ermine.</p>
                <p>SUPPORTERS. On the dexter side a lion rampant guards or, crowned as the crest. On
                    the sinister side an unieorn argent, crowned, armed, maned, and unguled or,
                    gorged with an antique crown; a chain affixed thereto, reflecting over the back,
                    and passing over the hind legs of the last, both standing on a scroll inscribed
                    with this motto, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dieu et mon droit,</hi> from which issue
                    the two royal badges of his majesty’s chief dominions, viz. on the dexter side a
                    rose party per pale argent and gules, stalked and leaved proper, for England;
                    and on the sinister side a thistle proper, for Scotland, being so adorned by
                    King James I. upon his succeeding to the crown of England. As king of Scotland,
                    he bore two unieorns as his supporters; but upon the union of that crown with
                    England, in 1603, he introduced one of the above supporters on the sinister side
                    of the royal achievement, which continues to this day.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed, that bearing coats-of-arms supported, is, according to the
                    heraldic rules of England, the prerogative, first, of those called <hi
                    rend="italic">nobiles</hi><hi rend="italic">majores,</hi> viz. dukes, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642462" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2462-0259"/> marquises, earls,
                    viscounts, and barons; secondly, of all knights of the garter, though they
                    should be under the degree of barons; thirdly, of knights of the bath, who, as
                    well as the former, receive on their creation a grant of supporters; and,
                    lastly, of such grants as the king chooses to bestow this honour upon. An
                    instance of this occurred in the case of Sir Andrew Fountain, who was knighted
                    by Philip, earl of Pembroke, when lord lieutenant of Ireland, Fountain being
                    then his secretary; and on his return to England, King William granted him
                    supporters to his arms, viz. two griffons gules and or. In Scotland all the
                    chiefs of clans or names have the privilege of claiming supporters, and also the
                    baronets. But by act of parliament, 10th September 1672, none are allowed to use
                    either arms or supporters, under a penalty and confiscation of all moveables on
                    which arms are put, without the authority of the lord lyon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">V. OF THE RULES OR LAWS OF HERALDRY.</hi></p>
                <p>The several escutcheons, tinctures, charges, and ornaments of coats-of-arms, and
                    their various properties, being now explained, it may not be improper to subjoin
                    such rules for blazoning these as the ancient usage and laws of heraldry have
                    established amongst us.</p>
                <p>I. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> and most general rule is, to express one’s
                    self in proper terms, so as not to omit any thing which ought to be specified,
                    and at the same time to be clear and concise without tautology.</p>
                <p>II. We must begin with the tincture of the field, and then proceed to the
                    principal charges which possess the most honourable place in the shield, such as
                    fess, cheveron, &amp;c. always naming that charge first which lies next and
                    immediately upon the field.</p>
                <p>III. After naming the tincture of the field, the honourable ordinaries, or other
                    principal figures, their attributes, and afterwards their metal or colour, must
                    be specified.</p>
                <p>IV. When an honourable ordinary, or some one figure, is placed upon another,
                    whether it be a fess, cheveron, cross, &amp;c. it is always to be named after
                    the ordinary or figure over which it is placed, with the expression <hi
                    rend="italic">surtout,</hi><hi rend="italic">or over all.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >N</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> In blazoning such ordinaries as are plain, the
                    bare mention of them is sufficient; but if an ordinary should be made of any of
                    the crooked lines mentioned above, its form must be specified; that is, whether
                    it be engrailed, wavy, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>VI. When a principal figure possesses the centre of the field, its position is
                    not to be expressed; or, which amounts to the same thing, when a bearing is
                    named, without specifying the point where it is placed, then it is understood to
                    possess the middle of the shield.</p>
                <p>VII. The number of the points of mullets or stars must be specified when more
                    than five; and also if a mullet or any other charge be pierced, it must be
                    mentioned as such, to distinguish it from what is plain.</p>
                <p>VIII. When a ray of the sun, or other single figure, is borne in any other part
                    of the escutcheon than the centre, the point it issues from must be named.</p>
                <p>IX. The natural colour of trees, plants, fruits, birds, and the like, is no
                    otherwise to be expressed in blazoning but by the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >proper</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but if discoloured, that is, if they differ
                    from their natural colour, it must be particularized.</p>
                <p>X. When three figures are in a field, and their position is not mentioned in the
                    blazoning, they are always understood to be placed, two above, and one
                    below.</p>
                <p>XI. When there are many figures of the same species bome in a coat-of-arms, their
                    number must be observed as they stand, and distinctly expressed.</p>
                <p>But, for the better understanding of this last rule, we have inserted examples of
                    the <hi rend="italic">different</hi><hi rend="italic">dispositions</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of figures,</hi> in which they are properly represented. Tims, <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> maybe <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ranged in pale, in
                    fess, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Three</hi> may be 2 and 1, as also in bend,
                    &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">Four</hi> are placed 2 and 2, or cantoned. <hi
                    rend="italic">Five,</hi> 1, 3, 1, in cross; or 2, 1, 2, in saltier. <hi
                    rend="italic">Six,</hi> 3, 2, 1, <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> in pile; or 2, 2,
                    2, paleways. <hi rend="italic">Eight,</hi> in orle, or on a bordure. <hi
                    rend="italic">Nine,</hi> 3, 3, 3, barways; or 3, 3, 2, 1, in pile. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ten,</hi> 4, 3, 2, 1, in pile; or else 4, 2, 4, bar ways. <hi
                    rend="italic">Twelve</hi> are placed 4, 4, 4, barways.</p>
                <p>There are other positions called <hi rend="italic">irregular</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> as, for example, when three figures are naturally placed, 2
                    and 1 are disposed 1 and 2, &amp;c. It must also be observed, that when the
                    field is strewed with the same figures, this is expressed by the word <hi
                    rend="italic">semee</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but, according to the opinion
                    of a French armorist, if the figures strewed on the field are whole ones, it
                    must be denoted by the words <hi rend="italic">sans nombre;</hi> whereas, if
                    part of them be cut off at the extremities of the escutcheon, the word <hi
                    rend="italic">semee</hi> must then be used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">VI.—OF MARSHALLING COATS-OF-ARMS.</hi></p>
                <p>By marshalling coats-of-arms is to be understood the art of disposing them in one
                    escutcheon, and of distributing their contingent ornaments in proper places.</p>
                <p>Various causes may occasion arms to be thus conjoined, and these Guillim
                    comprehends under two heads, viz. <hi rend="italic">manifest</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">obscure.</hi> By <hi rend="italic">manifest causes</hi> in the
                    marshalling of coats-of-arms, are meant such as betoken marriages, or a
                    sovereign’s gift, granted either through the special favour of the prince, or
                    for some eminent services. Concerning marriages it is to be observed, that when
                    the coats-of-arms of a married couple, descended of distinct families, are to be
                    put together in one escutcheon, the field of their respective arms is conjoined
                    paleways, and blazoned <hi rend="italic">parted per pale, baron and femme, two
                    coats, first, &amp;c.</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in which case the baron’s
                    arms are always to be placed on the dexter side, and the femme’s arms on the
                    sinister side.</p>
                <p>If a widower marry again, his late and present wife’s arms are, according to
                    Leigh, to be both placed on the sinister side, in the escutcheon with his ow n,
                    and parted per pale. The first wife’s coat should stand on the chief, and the
                    second on the base; or he may set them both in pale with his own, the first
                    wife’s coat next to himself, and his second outermost. If he should marry a
                    third wife, then the first two matches should stand on the chief, and the third
                    should have the whole base. And if he take a fourth wife, she must participate
                    one half of the base with the third wife, and so they will seem to be so many
                    coats quartered. But it must be observed, that these forms of impaling are meant
                    of hereditary coats, by which the husband stands in expectation of having the
                    hereditary possessions of his wife united to his patrimony.</p>
                <p>In the arms of femmes joined to the paternal coat of the baron, the proper
                    differences by which they were borne by the fathers of such women must be
                    inserted.</p>
                <p>If a coat-of-arms which has a bordure be impaled with another, as by marriage,
                    then the bordure must be wholly omitted in the side of the arms next the
                    centre.</p>
                <p>The person who marries an heiress, instead of impaling his arms with those of his
                    wife, is to bear them in an escutcheon placed in the centre of his shield, after
                    the same manner as the baronet’s badge is marshalled, and which, on account of
                    its showing forth his pretension to her estate, is called <hi rend="italic">an
                    escutcheon of pretence,</hi> and is blazoned <hi rend="italic">surtout,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">over all,</hi> as in the escutcheon borne in the fourth
                    quarter of the royal achievement. But the children are to bear the hereditary
                    coat-of-arms of their father and mother <hi rend="italic">quarterly,</hi> which
                    denotes a fixed inheritance, and so transmit them to posterity. The first and
                    fourth quarters generally contain the father’s arms, and the second and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193642475" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2475-0260"/>third the
                    mother’s; unless the heirs should derive not only their estate, but also their
                    title and dignity, from their mother.</p>
                <p>If a maiden or a dowager lady of quality marry a commoner, or a nobleman inferior
                    to her in rank, their coats-of-arms may be set beside one another in two
                    separate escutcheons, upon one mantle or drapery, and the lady’s arms may be
                    ornamented according to her title.</p>
                <p>Archbishops and bishops impale their arms differently from the before-mentioned
                    coats, in giving the place of honour, that is, the dexter side, to the arms of
                    their dignity. It may be observed of these prelates, that they thus bear their
                    arms parted per pale, to denote that they are joined to their cathedral church
                    in a sort of spiritual marriage.</p>
                <p>With respect to such armorial ensigns as the sovereign thinks fit to augment a
                    coat-of-arms withal, they may be marshalled in various ways, as may be seen by
                    the arms of the Duke of Rutland, and others.</p>
                <p>To those augmentations may be added, first, the baronet’s mark of distinction, or
                    the arms of the province of Ulster in Ireland, granted and made hereditary in
                    the male line by King James I. who erected this dignity on the 22d of May 1611,
                    in the ninth year of his reign, in order to propagate a plantation in that
                    province. This mark is, Argent, a sinister hand couped at the wrist, and erected
                    gules; which may be borne either in a canton, or in an escutcheon, as will best
                    suit the figures of the arms. Secondly, the ancient and respectable badge of the
                    order of the garter, instituted by King Edward III. in 1349, and which, ever
                    since its institution, has been looked upon as a great honour bestowed on the
                    noblest persons of this nation and other countries. This honourable augmentation
                    is made to surround, as with a garter, the arms of such knights, and is
                    inscribed with the motto, <hi rend="italic">Honi</hi><hi rend="italic">soit qui
                    mal y pense.</hi></p>
                <p>So far the causes for marshalling different arms in one shield, &amp;c. are <hi
                    rend="italic">manifest.</hi> As to those which are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >obscure,</hi> that is, when coats-of-arms are marshalled in such a manner that
                    no probable reason can be given why they are so conjoined, they must be left to
                    heralds to explain, as being the most proper persons to unfold these and other
                    mysteries of the science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">VII.—OF FUNERAL ESCUTCHEONS.</hi></p>
                <p>After having treated of the essential parts of the coats-of-arms, of the various
                    charges and ornaments usually borne therewith, of their attributes and
                    dispositions, and of the rules for blazoning and marshalling them, we shall next
                    describe the several funeral escutcheons, usually called <hi rend="italic"
                    >hatchments,</hi> by which it may be known, after any person’s decease, what
                    rank either he or she held when living; and if it be a gentleman’s hatchment,
                    whether he was a bachelor, married man, or widower, with similar distinctions
                    for gentlewomen.</p>
                <p>The hatchment represents such as are affixed to the fronts of houses when any of
                    the nobility and gentry dies, the arms therein being those of a private
                    gentleman and his wife parted per pale; the dexter side, which is gules, three
                    bars or, for the husband, having the ground without the escutcheon black,
                    denotes the man to be dead; and the ground on the sinister side being white,
                    signifies that the wife is living, which is also demonstrated by a small
                    hatchment, which is there depicted without mantling, helmet, and crest, for the
                    sake of perspicuity alone.</p>
                <p>When a married gentlewoman dies first, the hatchment is distinguished by a
                    contrary colour to the former; that is, the arms on the sinister side have the
                    ground without the escutcheon black, whereas those on the dexter side, for her
                    surviving husband, are upon a white ground. The hatchment of a gentlewoman is,
                    moreover, differenced by a cherub placed over the arms instead of a crest.</p>
                <p>When a bachelor dies, his arms may be depicted single or quartered, with a crest
                    over them, but never impaled as the two first are, and all the ground without
                    the escutcheon is also black.</p>
                <p>When a maid dies, her arms, which are placed in a lozenge, may be single or
                    quartered, as those of a bachelor; but, instead of a crest, they have a cherub
                    placed over them, and all the ground without the escutcheon is also black.</p>
                <p>When a widower dies, his arms are represented impaled with those of his deceased
                    wife, having a helmet, mantling, and crest over them, and all the ground without
                    the escutcheon black.</p>
                <p>When a widow dies, her arms are also represented im paled with those of her
                    deceased husband, but enclosed in a lozenge, and, instead of a crest, a cherub
                    is placed over them; all the ground without the escutcheon being also black.</p>
                <p>If a widower or bachelor should happen to be the last of his family, the
                    hatchment is depicted as in the case of a widower; and that of a maid or widow,
                    whose family is extinct by her death, is depicted as in that of a widow, with
                    this difference only, that a death’s-head is generally annexed to each
                    hatchment, to denote that death has conquered all, leaving nothing but the vain
                    formalities of heraldry.</p>
                <p>By these rules, which are sometimes neglected through the ignorance of illiterate
                    people, may be known, upon the sight of any hatchment, what branch of the family
                    is dead; and by the helmet or coronet, the title and degree of the person
                    deceased.</p>
                <p>The same rules are observed with respect to the escutcheon placed on the hearse
                    and horses used in pompous funerals; excepting that they are not surmounted with
                    any crest, as in the foregoing examples of hatchments, but are always plain. It
                    is necessary, however, to ensign those of peers with coronets, and that of a
                    maiden lady with a knot of ribands.</p>
                <p>In Scotland, a funeral escutcheon not only shows forth the arms and condition of
                    the defunct, but is also a proof of the gentility of his descent; and such
                    persons for whom this species of escutcheon can be made out, are legally
                    entitled to the character of gentlemen of blood, which is the highest species of
                    gentility. The. English hatchment above described exhibits no more than a right
                    to a coat of arms which may be acquired by purchase, and is only the first step
                    towards establishing gentility in a family.</p>
                <p>The funeral escutcheon, as exhibited in Scotland, France, and Germany, is in the
                    form of a lozenge, above six feet square of black cloth; in the centre of which
                    is painted, in proper colours, the complete achievement of the defunct, with all
                    its exterior ornaments and additional marks or badges of honour; and round the
                    sides are placed the sixteen arms of the families from which he derives his
                    descent, as far back as the grandfather’s grandfather, as the proofs of his
                    gentility. They exhibit the armorial bearings of his father and mother, his two
                    grandmothers, his four great-grandmothers, and his eight great-grandmothers’
                    mothers; and if all these families have acquired a legal right to bear arms,
                    then the gentility of the person whose proof it is must be accounted complete,
                    but not otherwise. On the four corners are placed mort-heads, and the initials
                    of his name and titles or designation; and the black interstices are semée or
                    powdered with tears.</p>
                <p>On the morning of the interment, one of these is placed on the front ’of the
                    house where the deceased lies; and another on the church where he is to be
                    buried, and after the burial it is fixed above the grave. The pall, too, is
                    generally adorned with these proofs of gentility, and the horses of the hearse
                    with the defunct’s arms.</p>
