                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HARMATTAN</label>, the name of a remarkable periodical wind
                    which blows from the interior parts of Africa towards the Atlantic Ocean. Of
                    this wind we have an account <hi rend="italic">{Philosophical Transactions,</hi>
                    vol. lxxi.) furnished by Mr Norris, a gentleman who had frequent opportunities
                    of observing its singular properties and effects.</p>
                <p>On that part of the coast of Africa which lies between Cape Verde and Cape Lopez,
                    an easterly wind prevails during the months of December, January, and February,
                    which by the Fantees, a nation on the Gold Coast, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Harmattan.</hi> Cape Verde is in 15° north latitude, and Cape
                    Lopez in 1° south latitude; and the coast between these two capes runs in an
                    oblique direction nearly from west-south-west to east-south-east, forming a
                    range of upwards of 2100 miles. At the Isles de Los, which are a little to the
                    northward of Sierra Leone, and to the southward of Cape Verde, it blows from the
                    eastsouth-east, on the Gold Coast from the north-east, and at Cape Lopez, and
                    the river Gabon, from the north-northeast. This wind is by the French and
                    Portuguese, who frequent the Gold Coast, called simply the north-east wind, the
                    quarter from which it blows. The English, who sometimes borrow words and phrases
                    from the Fantee language, which is less guttural and more harmonious than that
                    of their neighbours, adopt the Fan tee word <hi rend="italic"
                    >harmattan.</hi></p>
                <p>The harmattan comes on to blow at any hour of the day, at any time of the tide,
                    or at any period of the moon, and continues sometimes only a day or two,
                    sometimes five or six days; but it has been known to last fifteen or sixteen
                    days. There are generally three or four returns of it every season. It blows
                    with a moderate force, not quite so strong as the sea-breeze, which every day
                    sets in during the fair season from the west, west-south-west, and south-west,
                    but somewhat stronger than the land wind at night from the north and
                    north-north-west.</p>
                <p>A fog or haze is one of the peculiarities which always accompanies the harmattan.
                    The gloom occasioned by this fog is so great, as sometimes to obscure objects
                    near at hand. The English fort at Whyddah stands about midway between the French
                    and Portuguese forts, and not quite a quarter of a mile from either, yet often
                    neither of the other forts can be discovered from the intermediate one. The sun,
                    concealed during the greater part of the day, appears only a few hours about
                    noon, and is then of a mild red, exciting no painful sensation in the eye.</p>
                <p>Extreme dryness is another property of this wind. No dew falls during the
                    continuance of the harmattan; noris there the least appearance of moisture in
                    the atmosphere. Vegetables of every kind are much injured; all tender plants,
                    and most of the productions of the garden, are destroyed; the grass withers, and
                    becomes dry like hay; the vigorous evergreens likewise feel its pernicious
                    influence; the branches of the lemon, orange, and lime trees droop; the leaves
                    become flaccid, wither, and, if the harmattan continues to blow for ten or
                    twelve days, are so parched as to be easily rubbed to dust between the fingers;
                    and the fruit of these trees, deprived of its nourishment, and stinted in its
                    growth, only <hi rend="italic">appears</hi> to ripen, becoming, in fact, yellow
                    and dry, without acquiring hall the usual size. The natives take the opportunity
                    of the extreme dryness of the grass and young trees to set fire to them,
                    especially near the roads, not only to keep those roads open to travellers, but
                    to destroy the shelter which long grass, and thickets of young trees, would
                    afford to skulking parties of their enemies. A fire thus lighted spreads with
                    such rapidity as to endanger those who travel. In this situation a common method
                    of escape is, on discovering a fire to windward, to set the grass on fire to
                    leeward, and then follow your own fire. There are other extraordinary effects
                    produced by the extreme dryness of the harmattan.</p>
                <p>The parching effects of this wind are likewise evident on the external parts of
                    the body. The eyes, nostrils, lips, and palate, are rendered dry and uneasy, and
                    drink is often required, not so much to quench thirst, as to remove a painful
                    aridity in the fauces. The lips and nose become sore, and even chapped; and
                    though the air be cool, yet there is a troublesome sensation of prickling heat
                    on the skin. If the harmattan continues four or five days, the scarf skin peels
                    off, first from the hands and face, and afterwards from the other parts of the
                    body, if it continue a day or two longer. Mr Norris observed, that when by
                    exercise sweat was excited on those parts which were covered by his clothes from
                    the weather, it was peculiarly acrid, and tasted, on applying his tongue to his
                    arm, something like spirits of hartshorn diluted with water.</p>
                <p>Salubrity forms a third peculiarity of the harmattan. Though this wind is so very
                    prejudicial to vegetable life, and occasions such disagreeable parching effects
                    on the human species, yet it is highly conducive to health. Those labouring
                    under fluxes and intermitting fevers generally recover during an harmattan.
                    Those weakened <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641032" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1032-0149"
                    />by fevers, and sinking under evacuations for the cure of them, particularly
                    bleeding, which is often injudiciously repeated, have their lives saved, and
                    vigour restored, in spite of the doctor. It stops the progress of epidemics; the
                    smallpox and intermittent fevers not only disappear, but those labouring under
                    these diseases, when an harmattan comes on, are almost certain of a speedy
                    recovery.</p>
                <p>This account, however, differs from that given by Dr Lind, who calls the
                    harmattan a malignant and fatal wind. (See his <hi rend="italic">Diseases of Hot
                    Climates.)</hi></p>
