                <p><label type="entry">HERALD</label>, a term supposed to be derived from <hi
                    rend="italic">heer,</hi> an army, and <hi rend="italic">healt,</hi> a
                    champion.</p>
                <p>The principal employment of heralds in early times was to demand redress of
                    injuries from foreign powers, carry messages of amity or defiance, and proclaim
                    war and peace; whence they came also to record and emblazon armorial bearings,
                    and to marshal great public solemnities.</p>
                <p>In the days of chivalry they were introduced into this island from France; and as
                    in that country, and indeed also in Rome so likewise, both in England and
                    Scotland they were in high repute. The chief of them was styled king of arms,
                    and crowned at his installation to office by the sovereign himself; and as the
                    sovereign and other lords had their <hi rend="italic">armiger</hi> or
                    armour-bearer, so every herald had his <hi rend="italic">signifer</hi> or
                    ancient, or, as he was called from the French, pursuivant, that is, follower or
                    attendant.</p>
                <p>In 1450 the heralds of England were by King Richard II. incorporated into a
                    college like the <hi rend="italic">collegium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fecialium</hi> of Rome. The earl marshal of England is superior of the college,
                    and has the right of appointing the members of whom it consists, namely, three
                    kings at arms, six heralds at arms, and four pursuivants at arms. The <hi
                    rend="italic">hings</hi> are garter, clarencieux, and norroy; of whom garter,
                    instituted and created by King Henry V. to attend on the order of the garter, is
                    principal. His distinguishing colour is <hi rend="italic">blue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> that of the “provincial kings,” as clarencieux and norroy
                    are called, is <hi rend="italic">purple.</hi> Clarencieux was ordained by King
                    Edward IV., when, on attaining the dukedom of Clarence by the death of his
                    brother, he made the herald which properly belonged to the Duke of Clarence a
                    king of arms, with power to marshal and dispose of funerals, and other
                    processions, throughout the realm of England on the south side of Trent, as the
                    office of norroy is the like on the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642241"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2241-0242"/>north. The <hi rend="italic">heralds</hi> are
                    styled of York, Lancaster, Chester, Windsor, Richmond, and Somerset. They are
                    esquires by creation, and rank according to seniority of appointment. For some
                    time past the crown has occasionally issued a warrant to the earl marshal to
                    create extraordinary heralds; but these receive no salary, which the king’s
                    ordinary heralds and pursuivants at arms do. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >pursuivants</hi> are now reckoned of a sort in the number of heralds, and
                    commonly succeed in the place of heralds, as these die or are preferred. Their
                    names are Blue-mantle, Rouge-croix, Rouge-dragon, and Portcullis. The meetings
                    of the heralds’ college are termed chapters; and matters are determined therein
                    by a majority of voices. The earl marshal sits in the midst of his court,
                    attended sometimes by one or more of the judges. He has also belonging to his
                    court a pursuivant messenger to serve his precepts, a crier, a doctor of the
                    civil law, and the clerk or registrar, on either side of whom are placed the
                    officers at arms to give their opinions when required.</p>
                <p>In Scotland there is but one principal herald or king of arms. He is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Lyon</hi> from the cognisance of Scotland, as one of the signiferi
                    or pursuivants is called Unicon from the supporters of. the shield; and, as
                    early as the coronation of King Robert II. on the 27th of March 1371, we find
                    lyon king of arms called in with his attending heralds by the lord marischal of
                    Scotland, sworn, and crowned. (MS. Account of the Coronation, <hi rend="italic"
                    >apud</hi> Chalmers, <hi rend="italic">Caledonia,</hi> vol. i. p. 763, note.)
                    Indeed it would seem that heralds are of greater antiquity in Scotland than in
                    England; and it is not unlikely that norroy, the most ancient of the English
                    kings of arms, had his origin in the wars of the borders. That the Scottish king
                    of arms was at one time dependent on the marischal of Scotland, as the English
                    heralds are on the marshal of England, there is clear circumstantial, though
                    certainly, from the state of the records, no direct evidence. That dependence,
                    however, did not continue, and lyon has long held his place by commission under
                    the great seal, and been recognised as the head of the office of arms; nor is
                    there any such rule acknowledged here as that established in the heralds’
                    college at London, that none can be a king of arms before he is a herald.
                    Jurisdiction in arms, also, which was heretofore in all the heralds jointly, is
                    now exercised only by the king of arms, who himself performs the duties of his
                    place by <hi rend="italic">deputies</hi> of his own appointment. This devolution
                    of duty to a deputy may be traced up to about the year 1663, when lyon first
                    obtained the style of lord lyon king of arms. The <hi rend="italic">heralds</hi>
                    are Rothesay, Ross, Snowdon, Marchmont,. Islay, and Albany. The <hi
                    rend="italic">pursuivants</hi> are Unicon, Ormond, Carrick, Bute, Dingwall, and
                    Kintyre. The number of each thus appears to be six, as it has been for at least
                    three hundred years past; but in the end of the fifteenth century there were but
                    five each, including the lyon herald. They receive their commission from the
                    lord lyon, usually for life; and the only duty they now perform is to attend at
                    royal proclamations, coronations, and other great public solemnities. Attached
                    to this department of the office of arms are now also six <hi rend="italic"
                    >trumpeters,</hi> officers apparently of modern origin. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >rnacers</hi> used likewise to be reckoned amongst the officers at arms, and in
                    early times were placed after the pursuivants; but, from the institution of the
                    Court of Session, they took precedence of them, and are now altogether detached
                    from the heralds’ office, and wait only on the judges of the above court. They
                    receive their commission from the crown, excepting one, which is hereditary, and
                    executed by deputy. After the pursuivants are accordingly to be ranked the <hi
                    rend="italic">messengers</hi> at arms, of whom there is now, by statute 1587, c.
                    46, a certain number in every shire of the kingdom. They are admitted and
                    removed by the lord lyon, and their duty is to execute the process and letters
                    of the superior courts. The jurisdiction and authority of the Scottish king of
                    arms is thus twofold; one over the officers at arms, in which respect he may not
                    inaptly be regarded as in many respects at the head of the executive department
                    of the law here; and the other in relation to bearings and ensigns armorial. The
                    lord lyon also appoints a <hi rend="italic">procurator fiscal</hi> to sue before
                    him, a messenger to act as his <hi rend="italic">macer,</hi> and a <hi
                    rend="italic">clerk and registrar.</hi></p>
                <p>Immemorial usage and the king’s concession of arms are the main pillars of the
                    law of arms. They give the fundamental right to use ensigns armorial, and to
                    have those ensigns matriculated in the heralds’ books. Where neither usage nor
                    royal concession appears, the discretion of the college arises; and as the
                    principles on which coat armour is awarded were never very clearly defined, it
                    is not surprising that the power to purchase arms became the criterion of
                    fitness to bear them; and that, as Bailey says, “In our days all are accounted
                    gentlemen that have money, and if a man hath no coat of arms, the king of arms
                    can sell him one.” The principles which regulate the heralds’ court at Edinburgh
                    are stated in the Report of the Commission on Courts of Justice in Scotland,
                    anno 1821. Under that commission Mr George Tait, advocate, late lyon-depute, was
                    examined on oath, and being interrogated, according to what rules or ordinances
                    cases respecting the grant of arms, or competition of claims between different
                    parties, are determined, he deponed, that he was not aware of any record of
                    precedents in cases of this nature, and he had not since his appointment had
                    occasion to decide any formal or regular question of competition; but that the
                    rules according to which he would form his opinion, and which he had observed in
                    as far as he had been called to decide on claims presented, were those to be
                    found in the acts of the Scottish parliament, 1592, c. 127, and 1672, c. 21, and
                    the rules laid, down by Sir George Mackenzie, by Nisbet, and other writers on
                    heraldry. And being interrogated, if there was any restriction observed with
                    respect to the class or description of persons to whom a grant of arms would be
                    allowed, he deponed that such grants were not refused in any case .where the
                    person applying was respectable, which he understood to be conformable to the
                    practice now observed in all other colleges of arms; but with regard to the
                    right of bearing <hi rend="italic">supporters,</hi> he conceived it to be
                    competent to be granted only in a very few cases, which cases Mr Tait enumerated
                    at length, but which, it is enough here to say, may be reduced to those in which
                    the claim rests on the immemorial use of supporters by the claimant’s family, or
                    on the claimant or his ancestor being either a peer of the realm, or else one of
                    the ancient <hi rend="italic">barones</hi><hi rend="italic">minores,</hi> or,
                    lastly, on the king’s concession of supporters.</p>
                <p>From the earl marshal of England an appeal lies to the king in council. The case
                    was probably the same in Scotland, and both the language and context of the
                    statutes above named imply that the lord lyon is, under his majesty, king and
                    sovereign within the office of arms; but for some time past the Court of Session
                    have treated his jurisdiction as subject to their review and control.</p>
                <p>By the statutes imposing and regulating the assessed taxes, an annual duty of
                    12s. was made payable by every person using or wearing any armorial bearing or
                    ensign, which duty is doubled if the party be liable in house-duty, and
                    quadrupled if he be liable in the duty on a carriage.</p>
