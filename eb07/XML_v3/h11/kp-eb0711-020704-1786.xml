                    pensionary of Holland by successive quinquennial re-elections, from the year
                    1689 until his death on the 3d of August 1720, at the age of seventy-nine, was
                    one of the statesmen who, during this memorable period, exercised the greatest
                    influence on the affairs of Europe. Marlborough, Prince Eugene, and Heinsius,
                    formed the famous triumvirate so resolutely determined to humiliate France, and
                    which steeped in bitterness the declining years of Louis XIV He saw his country
                    avenged for the misfortunes which that monarch had inflicted on it in 1672; and
                    he also saw himself avenged; for, after the peace of Nimeguen, having been sent
                    to the court of France on affairs connected with the principality of Orange, he
                    had experienced the ill nature of the haughty and insolent Louvois, who did all
                    but threaten to have him shut up in the Bastille. Heinsius commenced his public
                    career as councillor-pensionary of the town of Delft; and, faithful to his
                    commission, he sometimes, in this capacity, pursued a line of conduct not
                    calculated to make him be considered as a person devoted to the interests of the
                    stadt- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641799" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1799-0208"/>. holder. But at a subsequent period the Prince of
                    Orange honoured him with the most unlimited confidence; and Heinsius, in return,
                    rendered him the most important services. He continued to enjoy the same favour
                    when that prince became king of England, and even after he had been succeeded by
                    Queen Anne. After the death of King William, however, his political conduct in
                    regard to France appears to have experienced some modification, though not to
                    such an extent as to enable the French court to flatter themselves with any
                    decided change in his views. Voltaire, in his <hi rend="italic">Siècle</hi><hi rend="italic">de Louis XIV.,</hi> represents Heinsius as a Spartan, proud of
                    having humbled the king of Persia, when, in 1709, Louis sent his minister De
                    Torcy to the Hague to sue for peace. De Torcy himself, in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> (tom. ii. p*3), describes the grand pensionary “as a man of
                    consummate ability in the management of affairs, cold in his manners, polished
                    in his conversation, having nothing repulsive in his demeanour, and rarely
                    warmed, far less excited, by debate. His exterior,” adds the same authority,
                    “was simple, and his house plain; an establishment composed of a secretary, a
                    coachman, a laquais, and a female servant, by no means indicated the credit of a
                    prime minister.” De Torcy further informs us that “he was never accused, either
                    of seeking to prolong the war on account of the consideration which its
                    continuance necessarily gave him, or from any views of private interest or
                    personal ambition.” This is the testimony of an enemy, and cannot, therefore, be
                    suspected of partiality. Μ. de Haren, in a note to his poem of the <hi rend="italic">Gueux,</hi> renders the same justice to the calmness and sobriety
                    of Heinsius; but supposes that his seclusion from society prevented him
                    acquiring that knowledge of the human heart which a statesman ought to possess,
                    and thus led him to disregard intelligence, of which one better acquainted with
                    mankind would at once have discerned the importance. “Hence, when the refugee
                    pastor Basnage, in 1707, apprised him of a certain secret convention entered
                    into between the courts of Vienna and Versailles to defeat the projected
                    enterprise against Toulon, Heinsius neglected this information, not imagining it
                    possible that a minister of the gospel could be better initiated in the secrets
                    of cabinets than a grand pensionary.” But Fagel did not share this security, nor
                    was it justified by the event. Μ. de Haren also mentions a singular anecdote of
                    Heinsius. Soon after the peace of Utrecht be was attacked by the pestilence in
                    the midst of the Hague, and cured without the appalling fact being suffered to
                    transpire. On this occasion he displayed admirable prudence and self-possession.
                    The secret was confined to himself, his physician, and Count de
                    Wassenaer-Starrenburg, and was kept with inviolable fidelity until after his
                    death. Heinsius was the last of the magistrates and ministers of the states of
                    Holland who wore the costume of the gown and band. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Heinsius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Daniel,</hi> a
                    Dutch philologist, was descended of a distinguished family, and born at Ghent in
                    1580. In the troubles of the Low Countries, his father, a man without ambition,
                    but of an elevated character, took a part, which proved fatal to his own repose
                    and that of his family. Daniel was sent to Veere, in Zealand, whence, with his
                    parents, he passed over into England; and soon afterwards he accompanied them on
                    their return to Holland. They established themselves first at Delft, then at the
                    village of Ryswick, and lastly at the Hague. The father of Heinsius consoled
                    himself under his misfortunes by devoting his attention to the education of his
                    son; but circumstances obliged the latter to return to Zealand, where he was
                    placed under good masters, though at first he showed no great disposition to
                    profit by their instructions, and preferred play to study. Having, however,
                    evinced a predilection for verse, he composed, at the age of ten, a Latin elegy,
                    which gave a favourable presage of future eminence. As his father intended him
                    for the bar, he was, at the age of fourteen, sent to Franeker to study law; but
                    this intention was defeated by the passion which he had conceived for Greek.
                    Having remained about six months at Franeker, he passed thence to Leyden, whose
                    rising university already shone with great lustre. Here he attracted the notice
                    of Scaliger, whilst Marnix de Sainte-Aldegonde, and the elder Douza, honoured
                    him with particular attention. Between Heinsius and Scaliger there was
                    established an intimacy, founded on affection on the one hand and veneration on
                    the other. A noble emulation now fired the soul of Heinsius, who, though
                    ambitious to rival, despaired of ever approaching so great a model, and spent
                    many sleepless nights in the most anxious and unremitting labour. Douza,
                    however, judiciously attempted to moderate the ardour of his young friend
                    without repressing his ambition, and procured him agreeable relaxation by
                    occasionally carrying him to his country residence at Nordwick, two leagues
                    distant from Leyden. Heinsius was only eighteen when he was attached to the
                    university of Leyden, first to explain the Latin classics, and not long
                    afterwards the Greek; and at the age of twenty-five he was appointed to the
                    chair of history and politics. Scaliger, who died in 1609, had wished to leave
                    him the whole of his library; but Heinsius only accepted part of it. On the
                    death of Paul Merula, the office of librarian to the academy of Leyden devolved
                    on him, and he also discharged the duties of secretary. His increasing
                    reputation now attracted to Leyden a great number of pupils; and as other
                    countries envied Holland the possession of a man of such distinguished merit,
                    propositions were made to him on the part of France, Germany, and Italy. In 1616
                    Heinsius writes that the Italians had paid him flattering compliments, and that
                    he was strongly solicited to repair to Rome. “Valde Itali nos amant, et jam
                    clanculum <hi rend="italic">s∕ς rnv</hi><hi rend="italic">ίπταλοφον,</hi>
                    ingenti praemio, videndae urbis causa, invitamur.” If we may credit Balzac,
                    Heinsius, in his relations with Rome, acted with more adroitness than sincerity
                    (“ménageait un peu la chèvre et le chou”). In the apology for his <hi rend="italic">Herodes Infanticida</hi> against the strictures of Balzac, a work
                    which he sent to Rome, a passage of the text in which the pope is mentioned as
                    <hi rend="italic">ipsum</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiae caput,</hi> is
                    rectified in the <hi rend="italic">errata</hi> into <hi rend="italic">ipsum</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclxsioe Romance caput.</hi> “The text,’ says Balzac, “was
                    for Rome, the errata for Leyden; on the one hand Heinsius wished to please the
                    pope, who w ould probably not read his errata, and on the other to have the
                    means of justifying himself to the ministers, ií he should be accused of being a
                    bad Huguenot, and of keeping up an understanding with the enemy.” But, in the
                    first place, this duplicity is irreconcilable with the known character of
                    Heinsius; secondly, it was not Heinsius himself who edited his <hi rend="italic">Epistola</hi><hi rend="italic">qua</hi><hi rend="italic">Dissertationi</hi><hi rend="italic">D∙ Balzacii ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Herodem Infanticidam
                    respondetur,</hi> but Boxhorn; thirdly, the erratum in question is not placed,
                    as usual, at the end of the volume, but is interposed between the dedication and
                    the Epistle; and, lastly, it appears from the statement of Thysius, in his
                    funeral oration on Heinsius, that, in the propositions made to him by Pope Urban
                    VIII. and Cardinal Barberini, in order to draw him to Rome, nothing had been
                    stipulated in reference to religion. Various honours were, however, conferred
                    upon Heinsius. The republic of Venice created him knight of the order of St
                    Mark; the king of Sweden, Gustavus Adolphus, named him his historiographer, to
                    which he added the title of privy councillor; and the states of Holland rewarded
                    him for his attachment to his country, and the refusal of various foreign
                    propositions, by choosing him their historiographer, and attaching to the title
                    a liberal salary. Heinsius alienated many friends by accepting, in 1618, the
                    office of secretary to the famous synod<pb break="no" facs="nls:193641812" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1812-0209"/> of Dordrecht.
                    At the age of thirty-five he married Ermengarde, sister of Janus Rutgersius, by
                    whom he had a son, Nicoas, and a daughter, Elizabeth, and whom he survived many
                    years. Being endowed with a strong constitution, Heinsius, notwithstanding his
                    unremitting labours, was rarely indisposed; but a particular symptom accompanied
                    the decline of his days, namely, an almost total extinction of memory. He died
                    at Leyden on the 23d of February 1665, when he had nearly completed the
                    eighty-fourth year of his age. Heinsius was not less remarkable for the
                    excellence of his character than for his vast erudition. Modesty, sensibility,
                    benevolence, and candour, formed its distinctive features; and, though he was
                    naturally grave, he loved to joke with his friends, and to indulge in innocent
                    pleasantries. He had some disputes, more or less serious, with Salmasius,
                    Balzac, and a minister of the gospel called John de Croy, who had sought his
                    acquaintance by means of adulation and sycophancy; but being naturally of a mild
                    and peaceable disposition, he avoided controversy as much as possible, and bad
                    probably fewer enemies than almost any eminent man of his time. Notwithstanding
                    his great knowledge, or rather because he knew so much, he adopted as his motto,
                    <hi rend="italic">Quantum</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">guod</hi><hi rend="italic">nescimus.</hi> The works of Heinsius are, 1.

                    of July 1620, and there received, under the auspices of his father, the most
                    careful education. The same studies in which his parent had distinguished
                    himself became in some measure the passion of his life. He visited England in
                    1642; but not finding the English very communicative of their literary
                    treasures, he made only a short stay in their country, where, however, he
                    collated some manuscripts of Ovid, a poet whose works he had already undertaken
                    to illustrate. In 1644 he repaired to Spa for the benefit of the waters, from
                    which he derived great advantage, and on his return traversed Belgium, where he
                    formed useful connections, and acquired new riches for his Ovid. The following
                    year he revisited Spa, and towards aŉtumn proceeded to Paris, where his merit
                    and his name procured him the friendship of the most eminent men, and opened all
                    the libraries to his researches, and where also he published a collection of
                    Latin poems, which met with the most flattering success. Next year he visited
                    Rome, where, through the good offices of Holstenius, he obtained access to the
                    inedited Greek work of John Lydus on the Roman magistracies, and was otherwise
                    well received. From Rome he proceeded to Naples, but the troubles which broke
                    out in that city in the summer of 1647 obliged him to return to Leghorn, whence
                    he proceeded first to Venice and next to Padua, where, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Italica,</hi> he published two books of elegies in 1648. After an
                    absence of three years he returned to Leyden; but his stay there was short, for,
                    having yielded to the solicitations of Queen Christina of Sweden, who had
                    invited him to join her literary court, he set out for Stockholm, where he
                    established himself in 1650. The queen undertook to purchase books and
                    manuscripts for his library; but Heinsius, unwilling to take immediate advantage
                    of the generosity of Christina, made advances of which he afterwards found great
                    difficulty in obtaining the reimbursement. At Stockholm he met the ardent enemy
                    of his father, Salmasius, who, in concert with Michon Bourdelot, endeavoured to
                    overwhelm him with every species of annoyance, and to drive him from the court
                    in disgust» But the musè of Heinsius avenged him on his implacable adversary;
                    and nothing but the obstinate malevolence of Salmasius can excuse a piece so
                    virulent as the <hi rend="italic">Scazon</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Alastorem,</hi> which we find in his poems. During the following
                    years Heinsius traversed Italy in all directions, to make interesting
                    acquisitions for Christina, whether in books and manuscripts, or in medals and
                    antiquities. Salmasius had not ceased to intrigue against him during his
                    absence; but the credit of Bochart counterbalanced this hateful influence, and
                    Salmasius died in 1653, whilst proceeding to take the benefit of the waters of
                    Spa. Next year Heinsius returned to Stockholm, but it was only to demand of
                    Christina, whose tastes began to take another direction, permission to retire,
                    and the reimbursement of the sums which he had expended. Her letter, which is in
                    the form of a <hi rend="italic">placet,</hi> and exceedingly remarkable, may be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">Sylloge</hi><hi rend="italic">Epistolarum</hi>
                    of Peter Burmann (tom. V. p. 766, et seqq.). The Queen of Sweden attempted to
                    dissuade Heinsius from carrying his resolution into effect; and, on the 7th of
                    October 1654, the states of Holland appointed him their resident at Stockholm,
                    which induced him to remain some time longer in the Swedish capital. But in the
                    month of February 1655, having lost his father, he resolved to return to his
                    native country. Like Grotius, he was at the point of death on the road; but,
                    more fortunate than that illustrious man, he escaped from a malady which
                    detained him thirty-six days at Dantzig. On his arrival at the Hague, the
                    states, in order to testify their satisfaction with his conduct in Sweden,
                    offered him his choice of the Prussian or Danish legations; but the state of his
                    health prevented his accepting either of those appointments; and, in 1656, he
                    established himself at Amsterdam, where he was appointed secretary. The repose
                    of his latter days was disturbed by a process brought against him by a
                    courtesan, called Margaret Wullen, whom he had known at Stockholm, and who
                    pretended to have rights over him which he refused to recognise. In 1658 he
                    resigned his secretaryship, and then went to establish himself at the Hague,
                    where Virgil, Valerius Flaccus, the Latin muse, and literary correspondence,
                    occupied all the leisure which the process in question left at his disposal. It
                    appears that he also meditated continuing the Annals of Grotius after 1609, but
                    the design was not carried into' execution. Being again appointed resident at
                    the court of Sweden, he set out for that country, and on the road met his debtor
                    Christina, who was on her way to Denmark; she received him kindly, and lavished
                    on him the most flattering distinctions, but forgot to pay her debt, which would
                    have been much more acceptable to Heinsius. About this time, also, Louis XIV.
                    included him in the number of the foreign men of letters to whom he granted
                    pensions; but the post which he occupied at the court of Sweden prevented his
                    enjoying this favour. He never neglected his favourite studies; and it was
                    therefore with regret that, in the year 1667, he found himself charged with a
                    mission to the czar of Muscovy. In 1671 he once more returned to the Hague, but
                    with his health much impaired; and next year the public calamities forced him to
                    withdraw to East Friseland, then to Bremen, Minden, Paderborn, Mayence, Worms,
                    Spire, and Heidelberg. Upon his return to the Hague he occupied himself
                    principally with Valerius Flaccus and Petronius; but being entangled in new
                    processes, he withdrew to Maarssen, in the province of Utrecht, where he
                    established himself about the month of December 1674. This retreat, however, did
                    not shelter him from the annoyances to which he was exposed, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641825" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1825-0210"/>at length he
                    sought repose in the small town of Viane, where his friend Graevius took
                    pleasure in visiting him. Family affairs having recalled him to the Hague, he
                    died there, on the 7th of October 1681, at the age of sixty-one, having expired
                    in the arms of Graevius, whom he charged with his last instructions. Nicoas
