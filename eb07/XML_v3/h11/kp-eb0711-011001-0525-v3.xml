                <p><label type="entry">HALES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Stephen</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated divine and philosopher, was born in the year 1677. He was the sixth
                    son of Thomas Hales, the eldest son of Sir Robert Hales, created a baronet by
                    King Charles II., and Mary, the heiress of Richard Langley of Abbotswood in
                    Hertfordshire. In 1696 he was entered as a pensioner at Bennet College,
                    Cambridge, was admitted a fellow in 1703, and became bachelor of divinity in
                    1711. He soon discovered a genius for natural philosophy; but botany was his
                    first study; and he used frequently to make excursions among Gogmagog Hills, in
                    company with Dr Stukely, with a view of prosecuting that study. In these
                    expeditions he likewise collected fossils and insects, having contrived a
                    curious instrument for catching such of the latter as had wings. In conjunction
                    with this friend he also applied himself to the study of anatomy, and invented a
                    curious method of obtaining a representation of the lungs in lead. They next
                    applied themselves to the study of chemistry; but in this science they did not
                    make any remarkable discoveries. In the study of astronomy Mr Hales was equally
                    assiduous. Having made himself acquainted with the Newtonian system, he
                    contrived a machine for showing the phenomena, on much the same principles with
                    that afterwards constructed by Rowley, and, from the name of his patron, called
                    an <hi rend="italic">Orrery.</hi></p>
                <p>About the year 1710 he was presented to the perpetual cure of Teddington, near
                    Twickenham, in Middlesex; and he afterwards accepted the living of Porlock in
                    Somersetshire, which vacated his fellowship in the college, and which he
                    exchanged for the living of Faringdon in Hampshire. Soon afterwards he married
                    Mary, the daughter and heiress of Dr Newce, who was rector of Halisham ir
                    Sussex, but resided at Much-Haddam in Hertfordshire On the 13th of March 1718,
                    he was elected a member of the Royal Society; and on the 5th of March in the
                    yeaι <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640538" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0538-0111"
                    />following, he exhibited an account of some experiments which he had recently
                    made on the effect of solar heat in raising the sap in trees. This procured him
                    the thanks of the society, who also requested him to prosecute the subject. With
                    this request he complied; and on the 14th of June 1725 exhibited a treatise, in
                    which he gave an account of his progress. This production being highly applauded
                    by the society, he further enlarged and improved it; and in April 1727 he
                    published it, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Vegetable Statics.</hi> He
                    dedicated the work to his majesty</p>
                <p>• King George II. who was then Prince of Wales; and he was the same year
                    appointed one of the council of the Royal Society, Sir Hans Sloane being at the
                    same arfnual election chosen their president. His book being well received,
                    there was published in 1731 a second edition, in which Mr Hales promised a
                    sequel to the work, which he accordingly published in 1733, under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Statical Essays.</hi> In 1732 he was appointed one of the
                    trustees for establishing a new colony in Georgia. On the 5th of July 1733 the
                    university of Oxford honoured him with a diploma, conferring the degree of
                    doctor in divinity; a mark of distinction the more honourable, as it was not
                    usual for one university to confer academical honours upon those who had been
                    educated at another. In 1734, when the health and morals of the lower and
                    middling class of people were subverted by the excessive drinking of gin, he
                    published, though without his name, <hi rend="italic">A Friendly Admonition to
                    the Drinkers of Brandy and other Spirituous Liquors,</hi> which was twice
                    reprinted. Towards the close of the same year, he published a sermon which he
                    preached at St Bride’s before the rest of the trustees for establishing a new
                    colony in Georgia^ In 1739 he printed a volume in octavo, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Experiments on Sea-water, Corn, Flesh, and other
                    Substances.</hi> This work, which contained many useful instructions for
                    voyagers, was dedicated to the lords of the admiralty. The same year he
                    exhibited to the Royal Society an account of some further experiments towards
                    the discovery of medicines for dissolving the stone in the kidneys and bladder,
                    and preserving meat in long voyages; and for this he received the gold medal of
                    Sir Godfrey Copley’s donation. The year following he published some account of
                    experiments and observations on Stephen’s <hi rend="italic">Medicines for
                    dissolving the Stone,</hi> in which their dissolvent power is inquired into and
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>In 1741 he read before the Royal Society an account of an instrument which he had
                    invented, and called <hi rend="italic">a ventilator,</hi> for conveying fresh
                    air into mines, hospitals, prisons, and the confined parts of ships. He had
                    communicated it to his particular friends some months before; and it is very
                    remarkable, that a machine of the same kind, for the same purpose, was in the
                    spring of the same year invented by one Martin Triewald, an officer in the
                    service of the king of Sweden, for which the king and senate granted him a
                    privilege in October following, and ordered every ship of war in the service of
                    that country to be furnished with one of them. A model of this machine was also
                    sent into France, and all the ships in the French navy were in consequence
                    ordered to have a ventilator of the same sort. It happened likewise, that about
                    the same time one Sutton, who kept a coffee-house in Aldersgate Street, invented
                    a ventilator of another construction, to draw off the foul air from ships by
                    means of the cook-room fire; but poor Sutton had not interest enough to make
                    mankind accept the benefit he offered them, though its superiority to Dr Hales’s
                    contrivance was evident, and though Dr Mead and Mr Benjamin .Robins gave their
                    testimony in its favour. The public, however, is not less indebted to the
                    ingenuity and benevolence of Dr Hales, whose ventilators came more easily into
                    use for many purposes of the greatest importance, particularly for keeping corn
                    sweet, by blowing through it currents of fresh air; a practice very soon adopted
                    by France, where a large granary was constructed, under the direction of
                    Duhamel, for the preservation of corn in this manner, with a view to render the
                    practice general.</p>
                <p>In 1743, Dr Hales read before the Royal Society a description of a method of
                    conveying liquors into the abdomen during the operation of tapping; and it was
                    afterwards printed in their Transactions. In 1745, he published some experiments
                    and observations on tar-water, which he had been induced to make in consequence
                    of the publication of a work called <hi rend="italic">Siris,</hi> in which Dr
                    Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, had recommended tar water as an universal medicine.
                    On this occasion several letters passed between them on the subject,
                    particularly with respect to the use of tar-water in the disease of the horned
                    cattle. In the same year he communicated to the public, in a letter addressed to
                    the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman’s Magazine,</hi> a description of
                    a <hi rend="italic">bach-heaver,</hi> Calculated to winnow and clean corn much
                    sooner and better than can be done by the common method. He also, at the same
                    time, and by the same channel, communicated to the public a cheap and easy way
                    to preserve corn sweet in sacks; an invention of great benefit to farmers,
                    especially to poor lessees, who want to keep small quantities of corn for some
                    time, but have no proper granary or repository for the purpose. He likewise the
                    same year took the same method to publish directions how to keep corn sweet in
                    heaps without turning it, and to sweeten it when musty. He published a long
                    paper, containing an account of several methods to preserve corn by ventilators;
                    with a particular description of several sorts of ventilators, illustrated by a
                    cut, so that the whole mechanism of them might be easily known, and the machine
                    constructed by a common carpenter. He published also in the same volume, but
                    without his name, a detection of the fallacious boasts concerning the efficacy
                    of the liquid shell in dissolving the stone in the bladder. In 1746 he
                    communicated to the Royal Society a proposal for bringing small passable stones
                    soon, and with ease, out of the bladder; and this was also printed in the
                    Transactions of that body. In the <hi rend="italic">Gentlemans Magazine</hi> for
                    July 1747 he published an account of an improvement of his back-heaver, by which
                    it was rendered capable of clearing corn of the small grain, seeds, blacks,
                    smut-balls, and other impurities, to such perfection, as to make it fit for
                    seed-corn. In 1748 he communicated to the Royal Society a proposal for checking,
                    in some degree, the progress of fires, occasioned by the great fire which
                    happened that year in Cornhill; and the substance of this proposal was printed
                    in the Transactions of the society. In the same year he also communicated to the
                    society two memoirs, which are printed in their Transactions; one on the great
                    benefit of ventilators, and the other on some experiments in electricity. In
                    1749 his ventilators were fixed in the Savoy prison, by order of Henry Fox, then
                    secretary at war, and afterwards Lord Holland; and the benefit proved so great,
                    that though previously fifty or a hundred in a year often died of the jail
                    distemper, yet from the year 1749 till the year 1752 inclusive, not more than
                    four persons died, though in the year 1750 the number of prisoners was two
                    hundred and forty; and of those four, one died of the smallpox, and another of
                    intemperance. In the year 1750 he published some considerations on the causes of
                    earthquakes, occasioned by the slight shocks felt that year in London. The
                    substance of this work was also printed in .the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions.</hi> The same year he exhibited an examination of the strength of
                    several purgin'-»· waters, especially of the water of Jessop’s Well, which iţ
                    printed in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi></p>
                <p>Dr Hales had been several years honoured with the esteem and friendship of
                    Frederick prince of Wales, who <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640551"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-0551-0112"/>frequently visited him at Tcddington, from his
                    neighbour* ing palace at Kew, and took pleasure in surprising him in the midst
                    of those curious researches which almost incessantly employed him. Upon the
                    prince’s death, which happened this year, and the settlement of the household of
                    the princess-dowager, he was, without his solicitation, or even knowledge,
                    appointed clerk of the closet, or almoner, to her royal highness. In 1751 he was
                    appointed by the College of Physicians to preach the annua! sermon called
                    Crowne’s Lecture; Dr William Crowne having left a legacy for a sermon to be
                    annually preached on “the wisdom and goodness of God displayed in the formation
                    of man.” Dr Hales’s text was, <hi rend="italic">With the ancient is wisdom, and
                    in length of days understanding</hi> (Job, xii. 12). ∙ This sermon, as usual,
                    was published at the request of the college. In the latter end of the year 1752,
                    his ventilators, worked by a windmill, were fixed in Newgate, with branching
                    trunks to twenty-four wards; and it appeared that the disproportion of those who
                    died in the jail before and after this establishment was as sixteen to seven. He
                    published also a further account of their success, and some observations on the
                    great danger arising from foul air, exemplified by a narrative of several
                    persons seized with the jail-fever by working in Newgate.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Sir Hans Sloane, which happened in the year 1753, Dr Hales was,
                    elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris*⅛ι his room. The same year
                    he published some further considerations about the means of expelling foul air
                    from the sick-rooms of occasional army hospitals, and private houses in town. He
                    also published many other curious particulars relative to the use and success of
                    ventilators. The same year a description of a sea-gage, which he had invented to
                    measure unfathomable depths, was communicated to the public. This paper was
                    drawn up about the year 1732 or 1733, for Mr Colin Campbell; and the latter
                    employed Mr Hawksbee to make the machine it describes, which was tried in
                    various depths, and answered with great exactness. It was however lost near
                    Bermuda. In 1754 he communicated to the Royal Society some experiments for
                    keeping water and fish sweet with lime-water, an account of which was published
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> He also continued from
                    this time till his death to enrich their memoirs with many useful articles,
                    particularly a method of forwarding the distillation of fresh from salt water,
                    by blowing showers of fresh air up through the latter during the operation. In
                    1757 he communicated to the editor of the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman’s
                    Magazine</hi> an easy method of purifying the air, and regulating its heat, in
                    melon-frames and green-houses; also further improvements in his method of
                    distilling sea-water.</p>
                <p>His reputation and the interest of his family and friends might easily have
                    procured him further preferment; but of this he was not desirous; for being
                    nominated by his majesty to a canonry of Windsor, he engaged the princess to
                    request his majesty to recall his nomination. That a man so devoted to
                    philosophical studies and employments, and so conscientious in the discharge of
                    his duty, should not desire any preferment which might reduce him to the dilemma
                    of either neglecting his duty, or foregoing his amusement, is not strange; but
                    that he would refuse an honourable and profitable appointment, for which no duty
                    was to be done that could interrupt his habits of life, can scarcely be imputed
                    to his temperance and humility, without impeaching his benevolence. If he had no
                    desire of any thing more for himself, a liberal mind would surely have been
                    highly gratified by the distribution of so considerable a sum as a canonry of
                    Windsor would have put in his power, in the reward of industry, the alleviation
                    of distress, and the support of helpless indigence. He was, however, remarkable
                    for the social virtues'and sweetness of temper; his life was not only blameless,
                    but exemplary in</p>
                <p>&gt; a high degree; he was happy in himself, and beneficial to ι others, as
                    appears by this account of his attainments and pursuits; whilst the constant
                    serenity and cheerfulness of ι his mind, and the temperance and regularity of
                    his life, l’ concurred, with a good constitution, to preserve him in health and
                    vigour to. the uncommon age of fourscore and , four years. He died at Teddington
                    in 1761, and was bu-</p>
                <p>ried under the tower of the parish church, which he had I built at his own
                    expense not long before his death. Her royal highness the Princess of Wales
                    erected a monument i to his memory in Westminster Abbey.</p>
