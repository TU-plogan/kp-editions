                <p><label type="entry">HIPPOCRATES</label>, the greatest physician of antiquity, was
                    born in the island of Cos, in the eightieth Olympiad, and flourished during the
                    Peloponnesian war. He was the first who laid down precepts concerning physic;
                    and, if we may believe the author of the life, which goes under the name of
                    Soranus, he derived his materials from Hercules and Aesculapius. He was first a
                    pupil of his father Heraclides, then of Herodicus, then of Gorgias of Leontium,
                    the orator, and, according to some, of Democritus of Abdera. After being
                    instructed in physic and in the liberal arts, he lost his parents, upon which he
                    left his own country <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, and practised physic all
                    over Greece, where he was much admired on account of his skill. He was publicly
                    sent for, along with Euryphon, a man superior to him in years, to Perdiccas,
                    king of Macedonia, who was then thought to be consumptive; but Hippocrates, as
                    soon as he arrived, pronounced the disease to be entirely mental, as in truth it
                    proved. Upon the death of his father Alexander, Perdiccas fell in love with
                    Philas, his father’s mistress; and this Hippocrates discerned by the great
                    change which her presence always wrought upon him. The cause of his malady being
                    thus ascertained, a cure was soon effected.</p>
                <p>Being entreated by the people of Abdera to come and cure Democritus of a supposed
                    madness, he proceeded thither; but, upon his arrival, instead of finding
                    Democritus mad, he discovered that all his fellow-citizens were so, and that
                    Democritus was the only wise man amongst them. From this philosopher he heard
                    much, and learned a great deal of philosophy; a circumstance which has led
                    Cornelius Celsus and some others to imagine that Hippocrates was the disciple of
                    Democritus, though it is probable they never saw each other till this interview,
                    occasioned by the Abderites. Hippocrates also received public invitations to
                    other countries. Thus, when a plague attacked the Illyrians and Paeonians, the
                    kings of those countries begged him to come to their assistance. He did not
                    comply with their request; but learning from the messengers the prevailing
                    direction of the winds, he concluded that the distemper would at length reach
                    Athens; and having foretold what would happen, he applied himself to devise
                    means for mitigating the evil when it should occur. So ardent indeed was his
                    love of Greece, that when his fame had reached Persia, and Artaxerxes entreated
                    him through the Persian governor of the Hellespont to come to him," at the same
                    time promising him great rewards, he refused to go. He also delivered his
                    country from a war which was just ready to break out, by prevailing upon the
                    Thessalians to come to the assistance of his countrymen, a service for which he
                    received the sincere acknowledgments of the Coans. The Athenians also conferred
                    great honours upon him. They admitted him next to Hercules in the Eleusinian
                    ceremonies, conferred on him the freedom of the city, and voted a public
                    maintenance for himself and his family in the Prytaneum or&lt;ouncil-house at
                    Athens, where none were maintained at the public charge excepting such as had
                    done public service to the state. He died amongst the Laris-saeans, at a very
                    advanced age, having, according to some, outlived the usual term of human life,
                    and attained upwards of a hundred years of age.</p>
                <p>A complete bibliographical account of the editions, general and partial, of the
                    works of Hippocrates, would occupy many pages; for, independently of the
                    numerous Greek and Latin editions, almost all the modern languages have been
                    enriched with translations of the different treatises of the Greek physician.
                    The number of special editions of his principal works is prodigious. Thus, there
                    have been more than thirty of the Protestation, as many of the book on the
                    Nature of Man, and of that on Airs, Waters, and Places; about fifty on the Books
                    of Epidemics; more than seventy of the Prognostics, and upwards of three hundred
                    editions, with almost as many commentaries in all languages, of his Aphorisms,
                    “ce chef-d’oeuvre de ľésprit humain.” The following classification is made on
                    the principle recommended by Erotian, the eldest glossator of Hippocrates, and
                    adopted and improved by Foes: 1. Greek Editions, Venice, 1526, in folio, Aldus
                    and Asulanus; Basil, 1538, in folio, Frohen, a more complete and exact edition
                    than the preceding: 2. Greek and Latin Editions, Venice, 1588, in folio,
                    Mercuriali; Frankfort, 1595, 1621, 1624, and 1645, in folio; Geneva, 1657, in
                    two vols. folio; Leyden, 1665, in two vols. 8vo; the Variorum edition, Vienna,
                    1743-1749. in two vols. folio, Stephen Mack: 3. Latin Editions, Rome, 1525, in
                    folio, Calvo; Rome, 1549, 1610, 1619, in folio; Basil, 1526, in folio; Venice,

                    vols. 8vo, Pierer, with a learned dissertation on the state of medicine before
                    the time of Hippocrates: 4. Greek and French Edition, Paris, 1811, 1815, in four
                    vols. 12mo.∙ 5. Numerous editions in French and other modern languages.</p>
