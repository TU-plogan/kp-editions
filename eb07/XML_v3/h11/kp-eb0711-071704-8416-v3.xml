                    of Avranches, was born at Caen on the 8th of February 1630, and early
                    distinguished for his love of letters and philosophy. His parents having died
                    whilst he was yet an infant, Huet fell into the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193648429" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8429-0718"/>hands of guardians who
                    neglected him; but his invincible love of learning enabled him to surmount every
                    disadvantage, and he finished his studies in the belles-lettres before he had
                    completed his thirteenth year. He studied philosophy under Father Mambrun, a
                    Jesuit, who, in imitation of Plato, directed him to commence by learning
                    geometry; and Huet contracted such a relish for the mathematics, that he applied
                    himself to almost every branch of the exact sciences, and maintained public
                    theses thereon at Caen. But he was withdrawn from this pursuit by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles</hi> of Descartes on the one hand, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sacred Geography</hi> of Bochart on the other. Of Descartes, then
                    in all his vogue, Huet was a warm admirer, and, for many years, adhered to his
                    philosophy, which, however, he at length saw reason to abandon as visionary. But
                    the work of Bochart, who, like himself, was a native of Caen, made a more
                    lasting impression upon his mind, and inspired him with that taste for erudition
                    by which he was afterwards so much distinguished. In 1652 Huet accompanied
                    Bochart in a visit to Sweden, where he met with a most gracious reception from
                    the queen, Christina. In undertaking this journey he had two objects in view;
                    one was, to see Christina, who was then occupied in regulating and improving her
                    states; and the other to become acquainted with the learned men by whom that
                    princess was surrounded, and to examine the ancient manuscripts in her
                    possession, particularly one of the works of Origen. He returned with literary
                    treasures of more than one kind, which in due time he communicated to the
                    public. Scarcely had he revisited his native city, when, in conjunction with
                    some friends, he formed there an academy for the encouragement of learning,
                    which, we believe, is still in existence. The reputation and merit of Huet,
                    however, had not procured him any solid recompense, when, in 1670, he was united
                    as sub-preceptor with Bossuet, who had just been appointed to superintend the
                    education of the Dauphin. It was at this period that he took occasion to embark
                    in a work which suited him perfectly, and in which he was engaged nearly twenty
                    years. In conformity with a suggestion of the Duke of Montausier, he formed the
                    plan of those editions of the Latin classics, <hi rend="italic">ad usurn
                    Delphini,</hi> destined for the instruction of his illustrious pupil; and it was
                    he who directed the execution of the undertaking. In 1674 he was received into
                    the French Academy; and it may be remarked that, in his inaugural discourse, he
                    complained that ancient learning was then held in little estimation, being
                    almost banished from the commerce of the polite world, and buried in the dust
                    and obscurity of a few cabinets. Fléchier, who was then director of the academy,
                    spoke in reply, and dwelt upon the protracted and useful studies which had been
                    the delight of the Abbé Huet in his early youth, and which formed the sole
                    occupation, as well as passion, of his more mature years. His duties as
                    sub-preceptor did not prevent him from satisfying his ardent taste for the most
                    difficult languages, and the most ancient books. Leaving court in the evening,
                    he occasionally passed entire nights in the libraries of Paris, whence he
                    derived the information which he could not obtain from his own. In 1678 Louis
                    XIV. granted him, as a recompense for his zeal and services, the abbey of
                    Avenay, near Caen, where he composed the greater part of his works. In 1685 he
                    was appointed to the bishopric of Soissons, of which, however, he did not take
                    possession; he had not, in fact, received the bulls in 1689, when Μ. Brûlart de
                    Śillery, nominated for the bishopric of Avranches, proposed to him an exchange.
                    This latter see was much more acceptable to Huet, because it fixed him at no
                    great distance from his native city and his abbey; but he was not consecrated
                    until 1692, by reason of some differences which had arisen between the court of
                    France and that of Rome. Huet did not neglect his episcopal duties; but when
                    these were discharged, he indulged his love of learning with so much ardour, and
                    passed so much time in his library, that men of the world, and even
                    ecclesiastics, who had business to transact with him, could scarcely obtain
                    access to the studious prelate. An individual who had often been told, when he
                    called, that the bishop could not be seen, because he was occupied among his
                    books, withdrew one day, much dissatisfied; “why,” said he, “has the king sent
                    us a bishop who has not yet completed his studies.” Huet, however, did not long
                    retain his preferment. Sensible of growing infirmities, and finding that he
                    could not reconcile his tastes with his duties, he resigned his bishopric, and
                    received in exchange the abbey of Fontenay, situated at the gates of Caen. Some
                    time afterwards he repaired „to Paris; established himself in the Jesuits’
                    College there, to which he presented his fine library; and, during twenty years,
                    divided his time between prayer and study, for which he preserved his taste to
                    the last. Zealous for the glory of that religion which, in more than one work,
                    he had ably defended, he closed his long and honourable career on the 26th
                    January 1721, at the advanced age of about ninety-one. The works of Huet, the
                    greater part of which continue to be held in high estimation, are, 1. De
