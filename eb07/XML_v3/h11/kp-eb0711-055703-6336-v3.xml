                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HOOLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, translator of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Gierusalemme</hi><hi rend="italic">Liberata</hi> of Tasso,
                    was the son of Samuel Hoole, watchmaker, London, and born at Moorfields in 1727.
                    Having receiv-. ed some elementary instruction from his uncle, a tailor in Grub
                    Street, he was sent to a private school in Hertfordshire, kept by Bennet, the
                    publisher of Roger Ascham’s works, where he acquired a knowledge of the Latin
                    and French languages, and some smattering of Greek. It was the wish of the
                    father to bring up his son to his own trade of watchmaker, in which he had met
                    with considerable success; but the shortsightedness of young Hoole proving an
                    insuperable objection, he was, at the age of seventeen, placed as a clerk in the
                    accountant’s department in the East India House. About this time, having
                    accompanied to the theatre his father, who had access behind the scenes, he
                    contracted a fondness for the stage, which, if indulged, might have proved fatal
                    to him, seeing he was entirely devoid of histrionic talents; but his attention
                    having been diverted from this pursuit, he employed his leisure in improving
                    himself in Latin, and in learning Italian, which he studied with the view of
                    being able to read in the original the <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Furioso</hi> of Ariosto, of which, while a boy, he had become
                    enamoured in the translation of Sir John Harrington. From admiring he soon
                    proceeded to translate his favourite production; but after having made some
                    progress in his task, he laid it aside for a time, in order to execute a
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Gierusalemnιe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Liberata,</hi> which, accordingly, he commenced in 1758. ∙ In 1761 he printed
                    ?ı specimen, which appears to have met the approbation of his friends; for the
                    whole was published in 1763, with a dedication to the queen, written by Dr
                    Johnson. This translation is distinguished for cold correctness and elaborate
                    elegance; but, in the transfusion, the essential spirit of poetry has in a great
                    measure evaporated, leaving a residuum, the general character of which is
                    insipidity. In 1773 Hoole published the first volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso,</hi> which was favourably received by
                    the public; but the further prosecution of the translation was interrupted by
                    his receiving an appointment as auditor of accounts to the East India Company,
                    an office which occupied much of his time and attention; nor did the whole make
                    its appearance<pb break="no" facs="nls:193646349" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6349-0558"/>
                    until 1783, when it was published in five vols. 8vo. In 1785 he wrote the life
                    of his friend Mr Scott, the poet of Amwell, with whom he had become acquainted
                    in 1757; in 1791 he published the Orlando reduced to twenty-four books, in two
                    vols.8vo; and, in 1792, he gave to the English public Tasso’s juvenile
                    production, <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo.</hi> He also published, in three vols.
                    8vo, the dramas and other poems of Metastasio, his versions of which display
                    more spirit and variety than his translations of Tasso and Ariosto, of which the
                    chief characteristic is an uniform and monotonous smoothness of versification.
                    He was also the author of several dramas, namely, <hi rend="italic">Cyrus,</hi>
                    which appeared in 1768, <hi rend="italic">Timanthes</hi> in 1770, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cleonice</hi> in 1775; but none of these had any success on the
                    stage. Mr Hoole lived in habits of intimacy with Dr Johnson, whom he attended in
                    his last illness; and died at Dorking on the 2d of August 1803, in the
                    seventy-sixth year of his age. In his private character he was amiable and
                    estimable; but though a man of taste and a good scholar, he had not the
                    slightest pretension to poetical genius, though, from long practice, he had
                    acquired considerable skill in the mechanical construction of verse. He had no
                    kindred sympathies with the <hi rend="italic">mens</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >divinior</hi> of true poetry, and in his hands, accordingly, its finer spirit
                    generally escaped, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
