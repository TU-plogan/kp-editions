                    Africa, which, along with Bornou, bears the general name of Soudan, or Land of
                    the Blacks. It consists of various petty kingdoms or states, which occupy
                    territory stretching east and west from the upper course of the Yeou nearly to
                    the Niger, but the boundaries of which on the south and north are imperfectly
                    defined. This region appears in several respects to be superior to the countries
                    on either side of it. It is less sultry, an advantage which it probably owes to
                    its higher elevation. The face of the country bears marks of greater
                    cultivation, the fields being covered with large crops of wheat, two of which
                    are annually produced; and, to prevent the grain from being destroyed by
                    insects, it is secured in granaries raised on poles. The soil is well watered by
                    the river Q,uarrama or Zirmie, which, with several tributaries, flows westward
                    to join the Niger. On its eastern quarter it is traversed by the Yeou, and on
                    its southern by the Shary or Tschadda, which also falls into the Niger. Besides
                    these natural supplies of water, artificial irrigation is diligently practised.
                    The predominant people here are the Fellatahs, of whom we shall afterwards
                    speak.</p><p>From information afforded by Major Denham, who travelled in this region of
                    Africa, it appears that Houssa is divided into seven provinces or states, to
                    each of which a prince or petty governor was appointed under the Fellatahs, the
                    inhabitants all speaking one language. Over the whole a sultan holds supreme
                    rule. The most fertile province is Kano, the most extensive is Zegzeg, the most
                    warlike Ghoober and Zamfra, which two countries seem to constitute one province
                    under the rule of the Fellatahs; the central province is Kashna or Kassina.
                    Three others, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648312" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8312-0709"/>of which our information is very indistinct, are
                    designated Dor or Dowry, Ranoo, and Yarcem. Captain Clapperton mentions a
                    province called Guari, which may correspond to Yareem; and the same traveller
                    speaks of Doura, in immediate connection with the southern part of Zegzeg, as if
                    bordering on it. Another province is called Kotongra or Kotongkora, which may
                    correspond to Ranoo.</p><p>Kano, the capital of a province of the same name, and the principal commercial
                    city of Houssa, is situated in latitude 12° 0' 19" north, and longitude 9° 20'
                    east. It may contain between 30,000 and 40,000 inhabitants, of whom a great
                    proportion are slaves. This number is exclusive of strangers, who crowd thither
                    during the dry months from all parts of Africa. The city is of an irregular oval
                    shape, about fifteen miles in circumference, and surrounded by a clay wall
                    thirty feet in height, having a dry ditch on both sides of it. There arc
                    fourteen gates made of wood, and covered with sheet iron, and these arc
                    regularly opened and shut at sunrise and sunset. A platform inside, with two
                    guard-houses below it, serves to defend each entrance. The houses within the
                    walls do not occupy more than one fourth of the ground enclosed, the remaining
                    space being laia out in fields and gardens. The city is almost divided into two
                    parts by a large morass, which stretches from east to west. This swamp is
                    crossed by a small neck of land, which is overflowed during the rainy season,
                    but in the dry season the market is held upon it. On account of this morass, and
                    also of the many pools of stagnant water made by digging clay for building
                    houses, the city is rendered very unhealthy. Captain Clapperton thus describes
                    the houses of K¢no.</p><p>“They are built of clay, and are mostly of a square form, in the Moorish fashion,
                    with a central room, the roof of which is supported by the trunks of palm-trees,
                    where visitors and strangers are received. The apartments of the ground-floor
                    open into this hall of audience, and are generally used as store-rooms. A
                    staircase leads to an open gallery overlooking the hall, and serving as a
                    passage to the chambers of the second story, which are lighted with small
                    windows. In a back court-yard there is a well and other conveniences. Within the
                    enclosure in which the house stands, there are also a few round huts of clay,
                    roofed with the stalks of Indian corn, and thatched with long grass. These are
                    usually very neat and clean, and of a much larger size than those of Bornou. The
                    governor’s residence covers a large space, and resembles a walled village. It
                    even contains a mosque, and several towers three or four stories high, with
                    windows in the European style, but without glass or frame-work. It is necessary
                    to pass through two of these towers in order to gain the suite of inner
                    apartments occupied by the governor.”</p><p>The great market, as already observed, is held upon a neck of land which
                    intersects the morass. Here streets consisting of sheds or stalls of bamboo are
                    regularly arranged, different places being allotted to those who traffic in
                    different commodities. The latter consist of cattle, vegetables, fruits, the
                    fine cotton fabrics of the country, goora or kolla nuts, which are called
                    African coffee, and crude antimony, with which every eyebrow in Houssa is dyed.
                    The Arabs also dispose of sundry commodities, such as cast-off dresses. The
                    slaves, who constitute the staple article of trade, have a special market
                    appropriated to them, consisting of two long ranges of sheds, one for males and
                    the other for females. Here these poor creatures, drawn up in regular array, and
                    dressed in attractive attire, are inspected and scrutinized by purchasers, in
                    much the same manner as horses are in the cattle-markets of this country. The
                    market of Kano is under the superintendence of a sheik, who regulates the
                    police, and is said also to possess the exorbitant power of fixing the prices.
                    The medium of exchange consists of the small shells called cowries, four hundred
                    and eighty of which make a shilling, so that paying a large sum is here rather a
                    tedious process. Kano is celebrated all over Central Africa for the dyeing of
                    cloth, for which process there are numerous establishments. Some ingenuity, is
                    displayed in the manufacture of leathern jars, which are fashioned upon a clay
                    mould out of the raw hide. The inhabitants are also acquainted with the art of
                    tanning. The negroes here are very polite and ceremo nious, especially to those
                    advanced in years. A part of the city is appropriated to the use of those who
                    are afflicted with blindness, which is a prevalent disease.</p><p>Adjoining the province of Kano on the west there is a portion of territory called
                    Katagum, which is said by Captain Clapperton to be a distinct province.
                    According to that traveller, it is able to send into the field 4000 horse and
                    20,000 foot, armed with bows, swords, and spears. The city is built in the form
                    of a square, the sides facing the cardinal points of the compass, with four
                    corresponding gates, which are regularly opened and shut like those of Kano. It
                    is defended by two walls, which have ditches on each side, and one between them.
                    The governor and principal inhabitants have houses made entirely of clay. They
                    are flat roofed, and sometimes consist of two stories, with square or
                    semicircular openings for windows. The city may contain from 7000 to 8000
                    inhabitants. There are other towns comprised within the boundaries of this
                    province, but none requiring particular description. Many parts of Katagum are
                    highly cultivated, and laid out in plantations of cotton, tobacco, and indigo,
                    which are separated from one another by rows of date-trees, and shaded by large
                    umbrageous trees.</p><p>The next considerable town is Soccatoo, situated nearly at the western extremity
                    of Houssa. The country which lies between Kano and Soccatoo is remarkably fine,
                    and under high cultivation. It is diversified with forests of noble trees, and
                    various rivers and streams, and traversed by picturesque ridges of granite,
                    amongst which villages are romantically situated.</p><p>Soccatoo stands in latitude 13° 4' 52" north, and longitude 6° 12' E. “It
                    occupies,” says Captain Clapperton, “a long ridge which slopes gently towards
                    the north, and appeared to me the most populous town I had visited in the
                    interior of Africa; for, unlike most other towns in Houssa, where the houses are
                    thinly scattered, it is laid out in regular well-built streets. The houses
                    approach close to the walls, which were built by the present sultan in 1818,
                    after the death of his father; the old walls being too confined for the
                    increasing population. This wall is between twenty and thirty feet high, and has
                    twelve gates, which are regularly closed at sunset. There are two large mosques,
                    including the new one at present building by the Gadado, besides several other
                    places for prayer. There is a spacious market-place in the centre of the city,
                    and another large square in front of the sultan’s residence. The dwellings of
                    the principal people arc surrounded with high walls, which enclose numerous
                    coozees and flat-roofed houses, built in the Moorish style, whose large
                    waterspouts of baked clay, projecting from the eaves, resemble at first sight a
                    tier of guns. The inhabitants are principally Fellatahs, possessing numerous
                    slaves. Such of the latter as are not employed in domestic duties reside in
                    houses by themselves, where they follow various trades; the master, of course,
                    reaping the profit. Their usual employments are weaving, house-building,
                    shoe-making, and iron work: many bring fire-wood to the market foi sale. Those
                    employed in raising grain and tending cattle, of which the Fcllatahs have
                    immense herds, reside in villages without the city. It is customary for private
                    individuals to free a number of slaves every year, according to their means,
                    during the great feast after the Ra <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648325" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8325-0710"/>madan. The
                    enfranchised seldom return to their native country, but continue to reside near
                    their old masters, still acknowledging them as their superiors, and presenting
                    them yearly with a portion of their earnings. The trade of Soccatoo is at
                    present inconsiderable, owing to the disturbed state of the surrounding country.
                    The necessaries of life are very cheap; butcher-meat is in great plenty, and
                    very good. The exports are principally civet, and blue check tobes called <hi rend="italic">sharie,</hi> which are manufactured by the slaves from Nyffee, of
                    whom the men are considered as the most expert weavers in Soudan, and the women
                    as the best spinners. The common imports are brought from the borders of
                    Ashantee; and coarse calico and woollen cloth, in small quantities, with brass
                    and pewter dishes, and some few spices, from Nyffee. The Arabs, from Tripoli and
                    Ghadamis, bring unwrought silk, ottar of roses, spices, and beads. Slaves are
                    both exported and imported. A great quantity of Guinea corn is taken every year
                    by the Tuaricks, in exchange for salt. The market is extremely well supplied,
                    and is held daily from sunrise· to sunset. On the north side of Soccatoo there
                    is a low marsh, with some stagnant pools of water, between the city and the
                    river: this, perhaps, may be the cause of the great prevalence of ague, as the
                    city stands in a fine airy situation.”</p><p>Subsequently to the writing of the above description, nearly two thirds of the
                    city were destroyed by a conflagration; but when Clapperton visited it a second
                    time, it had been rebuilt, in a manner so closely resembling what it had
                    formerly been, that little alteration could be perceived. The palace, or house
                    of the sultan, forms a sort of enclosed town, with an open quadrangle in front.
                    A painted and ornamented cottage constitutes the hall of audience. Soccatoo is
                    likely to decline, on account of the residence of the court having of late been
                    transferred to Magaria.</p><p>The countries of Ghoober and Zamfra or Zanfara are inhabited by a rude and
                    warlike race, who have sometimes assumed authority over Houssa, and are at
                    present, or were lately, in open rebellion against Soccatoo. The people are a
                    species of outlaws or robbers, and the high road between Kano and Soccatoo
                    passing through their territory, merchants can only travel between the two
                    cities in numerous armed bodies. Coonia, the capital of Ghoober, is strongly
                    fortified, and in 1829 repulsed the whole military force of Houssa, consisting
                    of 50,000 or 60,000 men. Zirmie, the capital of Zamfra, occupies a peninsula
                    formed by the river Quarrama, which has here very high and steep banks covered
                    with mimosas and prickly bushes, through which a narrow path winds to the gates.
                    It is surrounded with a clay wall and a dry ditch. The governor of this
                    stronghold bears the character of a freebooter, and the inhabitants, whom
                    Clapperton represents as having a reckless independent look, are esteemed the
                    greatest rogues in all Houssa. Runaway slaves from all quarters make Zirmie an
                    asylum, where they are always well received.</p><p>To the north of Kano lies the considerable province of Kashna or Kassina, which
                    at one period held supreme sway over all Houssa, and which has recently shaken
                    off the yoke of Soccatoo. Kashna, the capital, is situated in lat. 12. 59. N. on
                    a ridge of sienite, one of a number of ridges of this rock which run from
                    north-north-east to south-south-west. The walls are of clay, and very extensive;
                    but, as in the case of Kano, the houses do not occupy above one tenth of the
                    ground enclosed, the rest being laid out in fields, and covered with wood. The
                    houses are mostly in ruins, the principal commerce of the country having been
                    transferred to Kano since the Fellatah power became predominant. Notwithstanding
                    its abject state, it has nevertheless a considerable trade, which is carried on
                    with the Tuaricks, or with caravaps coming across the desert by the route of
                    Ghadamis and Tuat. The manufactures of Kashna are chiefly of leather, such as
                    water-skins, red or yellow cushions, bridles of goat-εkin, and hides. There is
                    likewise some trade in fruits, such as figs, melons, pomegranates, and
                    limes.</p><p>To the south of Soccatoo and Kano lies the country of Zegzeg, one of the finest
                    in all Africa, and the most extensive province in Houssa. It is bounded on the
                    east by Kano, on the south-east by Yacoba, on the south by a mountainous tract
                    inhabited by Pagans, on the south-west by Nyffee, and on the north and west by
                    Guari and Kashna. Travellers represent Zegzegas resembling in appearance the
                    finest parts of England, being beautifully variegated with hill and dale, over
                    which are spread rich pastures and extensive fields, yielding plentiful crops,
                    particularly of rice. Zaria, the capital, is situated in lat. 10. 59. N. and
                    long. 8. 42. E. It occupies a great extent of ground, the houses being detached,
                    or rather clustered together in small villages, which are separated from each
                    other by corn fields, and even woods. The whole is surrounded with high clay
                    walls, and the population has been estimated at about 50,000. To the south of
                    Zegzeg, the country, though diversified by rising grounds, is fertile and well
                    cultivated, and contains a number of considerable towns. Lander describes Cuttup
                    as consisting of “nearly five hundred villages almost joining each other,
                    occupying a vast and beautiful plain, adorned with the finest trees. Among
                    these, the plantain, the palm, and the cocoa-nut tree were seen flourishing in
                    great abundance, and the aspect of the country strikingly resembled some parts
                    of Yariba. A considerable traffic is carried on here in slaves and bullocks,
                    which are alike exposed, in the daily market. The bullocks are bred by the
                    Fellatahs, who reside here for no other purpose. Among the other articles
                    brought here for sale, are red cloth, gum, salt, goora-nuts, trona, beads,
                    tobacco, native cloth, rings, needles, cutlery, honey, rice, and milk; people
                    from the most distant parts resorting hither in vast numbers.” To the south of
                    this place stretch a range of hills, which, Lander was told, were inhabited by a
                    ferocious race of <hi rend="italic">yamyams</hi> or cannibals, who a short time
                    previously had killed and eaten a whole caravan-full of people. In a country
                    fertile, but rocky, is situated Dunrora, a town containing about 4000
                    inhabitants. Not far from this place is a large town called Jacoba, which was
                    described to Lander as standing on the river Shary; whilst farther to the east,
                    on the same stream, there was said to be situated another large city called
                    Adamowa; and here our knowledge of this portion of Africa becomes scanty and
                    imperfect.</p><p>In the western tracts of Houssa there are few towns of any importance: these were
                    visited, and have been described, by Captain Clapperton. After leaving Boogawa,
                    a small town in the province of Katagum, and passing first through a
                    thickly-wooded tract, and then over an open, well-cultivated country, this
                    traveller reached Katungwa, a walled town. A range of low rocky hills was seen
                    stretching nearly south-west, called <hi rend="italic">Dooshee</hi> (the rocks),
                    from which a large town takes its name. These were the first rocks that had
                    occurred after leaving the southern borders of the Great Desert, the whole
                    country thus far being soft alluvial clay. Near the extremity of the Dooshee
                    hills is situated Zangeia, within the walls of which town there is a ridge of
                    loose blocks of stone connected with the range. These masses of rock are about
                    200 feet in height, and give a romantic appearance to the neat huts clustering
                    round the base, and to the fine plantations of cotton, tobacco, and indigo, and
                    the rows of date and other trees. From the extensive walls which remain, Zangeia
                    must have once been a very large town. Now, however, it consists merely of a
                    collection of thinly-scattered hamlets. The country between this place and Kano
                    is highly cultivated, and beautifully diversified by hill and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648338" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8338-0711"/>dale. Captain
                    Clapperton passed several walled towns, the principal of which was Girkwa. As in
                    the other towns already described, the houses here are in groups, with large
                    intervening vacancies. The disproportion in the size of the Avails of towns and
                    the number of houses, to the amount of inhabitants, Avhich is exhibited in many
                    parts of Houssa, is to be accounted for by the usurpation of the country by the
                    Fellatahs, who generally massacred the former occupants, or carried them aAvay
                    captives. To complete our description of Houssa, it will be necessary to give an
                    account of this singular people, who are gradually extending their authority
                    over Central Africa.</p><p>By the most correct accounts, it would appear that the Fellatahs are an off-shoot
                    from the Foolahs of Western Africa, and may be identified Avith them. They are a
                    mixture of Moors, Arabs, Berbers, and probably other races of men. They are much
                    superior to the native negroes, Avith whom they very rarely mix their blood.
                    Captain Lyon, speaking of the Fellatahs, observes, “their complexion being of a
                    much lighter hue than that of the other tribes, they call themselves white ,∙
                    their colour resembles that of our gypsies in England. Many female slaves are
                    brought to Mourzouk from their nation, and are very handsome women.” Other
                    observers describe their complexion as being very dark, and of a shade
                    intermediate betAveen that of the deepest African and the Moors. The fact seems
                    to be, that their colour varies in a very remarkable manner, from being nearly
                    white to nearly black. Both men and women pay considerable attention to their
                    dress, which amongst the wealthy inhabitants is rather showy. In their domestic
                    habits they are regular, orderly, and cleanly, and the slaves are generally well
                    treated. The Mahommedan is the predominant religion, and considerable attention
                    is paid to keeping up an appearance of it. Prayers are regularly said five times
                    a day in the Arabic language, which both the male and female children of the
                    better sort of Fellatahs are taught to read and Avrite. Their marriages are
                    celebrated without any pomp or noise, and such contracts are of a less arbitrary
                    nature than Ave find them to be amongst the inferior races of mankind. Captain
                    Clappenton makes the following remarks regarding Houssa :—“The government of the
                    Fellatahs in Soudan is in its infancy. The governors of the different provinces
                    are appointed during pleasure; and all their property, on their death or
                    removal, falls to the sultan. The appointment to a vacancy is sold to the
                    highest bidder, who is generally a near relation, provided that his property is
                    sufficient to enable him to bid up to the mark. All the inferior offices in the
                    tθAvns are sold in like manner by the governors, who also succeed to the
                    property of those petty officers at their death or removal. In the province of
                    Kano they have no regular system of taxation. A great deal of marketable
                    property is claimed by the governor, such as two thirds of the produce of all
                    the date-trees and other fruit-trees, the proprietor being allowed only the
                    remaining third. A small duty is also levied on every article sold in the
                    market; or, in lieu thereof, a certain rent is paid for the stall or shed. A
                    duty is also fixed on every <hi rend="italic">to be</hi> that is dyed blue, and
                    sold. On grain there is no duty. Kano produces the greatest revenue that the
                    sultan receives; it is paid monthly, in horses, cloth, and coAvries. AdamoAva
                    pays yearly in slaves; Yacoba in slaves and lead ore; Zegzeg in slaves and <hi rend="smallcaps">coav-</hi> ries; Zamfra the same; Hadiga, and Katagum, and
                    Za-onima in horses, bullocks, and slaves; Kashna in slaves, cowries, and cloth;
                    Ader, or Tadela, in bullocks, sheep, camels, and a coarse kind of cotton cloth,
                    like Avhat is called by us a counterpane.” Of the number of negroes and
                    Fellatahs who inhabit the country of Houssa no correct idea can be formed. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r.</hi> R. R.)</p></div></body></text></TEI>
