                    celebrated philologist, was born at Basil in 1635. His father, who was professor
                    of law in the academy of that city, inspired him betimes with a taste for
                    application, and directed his early studies. Young Hoffmann went through his
                    courses of philosophy and theology with distinction, and was ordained to the
                    holy ministry. But as the delicacy of his health did not admit of his pursuing
                    that career, he applied himself to teaching; and after having, for several
                    years, given private instructions, he was, in 1667, appointed to the chair of
                    Greek in the academy, whence he was, in 1683, translated to that of history, the
                    duties of which he discharged with indefatigable zeal until his death, which
                    occurred in 1706, without his having ever quitted his native country. The best
                    known of all his works is the <hi rend="italic">Lexico Universale,</hi><hi rend="italic">HistoricoGeographico</hi><hi rend="italic">Chronologico</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetico</hi><hi rend="italic">Philologicum,</hi> Basil, 1677, in
                    two volumes folio, with a Supplement, also in two volumes, 1683. The work at
                    first met with indifferent success. This dictionary is constructed upon a very
                    extensive plan; but all the parts leave much to be desired. The articles on
                    ancient geography are considered as the best; those on history are superficial
                    and inaccurate. The title of the book announces various synonymes of
                    geographical names derived from twenty different languages; but the execution
                    does not come up to the announcement. The author omits no opportunity to declaim
                    against the Catholic religion and against France. The other works of Hoffmann
                    are, 1. Numerous Theses on subjects of little or no interest; 2. A Collection of
                    Poems, <hi rend="italic">Poemata,</hi> Basil, 1684, in 12mo; 3. Epitome metrica

                    physician of the university of Halle in Saxony, was born in that city in 1660.
                    He received his early education in his native town, and made great progress in
                    the mathematics, which his parents had caused him to study, and to which he
                    ascribed advances in the study of medicine. At the age of fifteen he lost both
                    his father and his mother during the prevalence<pb break="no" facs="nls:193645634" xml:id="kp-eb0711-5634-0503"/> of an
                    epidemical distemper. In 1680, he established himself at Erfurt, there to study
                    chemistry under Gaspar Cramer, and the following year he received the degree of
                    doctor of physic at Iena. In 1682, he published an Essay <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Cinnabari</hi><hi rend="italic">Antimonii,</hi>
                    which was reprinted at Leyden in 1685, 12mo, and laid the foundation of his
                    reputation as an able chemist, which he afterwards increased by professing
                    chemistry in the schools of Iena. It is to him we are indebted for the
                    preparation known by the name of the Anodyne Liquor of Hoffmann, which is
                    considered as one of the best sedatives. Frederick III. elector of Brandenburg,
                    having founded the university of Halle in 1693, Hoffmann was appointed primarius
                    professor, and alone prepared the statutes of the faculty of medicine. His fame
                    soon spread throughout all Germany, and thence into foreign parts; and several
                    learned bodies, including the academies of Berlin and Petersburg, and the Royal
                    Society of London, enrolled him among their members. During his residence at
                    Halle he divided his time between instruction, practice, and study; but more
                    than once he interrupted his pursuits by visits to the different courts of
                    Germany, where his professional successes procured him honours, titles, and
                    rewards. He was solicited by the king of Prussia to fix his residence at Berlin;
                    but he preferred remaining in his native country, where he died on the 12th of
                    November 1742. At the age of sixty Hoffmann undertook his great work entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Medicina Rationalis</hi><hi rend="italic">Systematica,</hi>
                    Halle, 1730, in nine vols. 4to, of which Bruhier d’Ablain-court has given a
                    translation under the title of <hi rend="italic">Médecine Raisonnée</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Hoff mann,</hi> 1739, in nine vols.
                    12mo. The same physician has also translated from the Latin of Hoffmann, a
                    Treatise on Fevers, Paris, 1746, in three vols. 12mo; the Politics of Medicine,
                    ibid. 1751, in 12mo; and Observations on the Cure of Gout and Rheumatism. A
                    complete edition of his works has been published, with a life of the author,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Hoffrnanni Opera omnia Medicophysica
                    cum</hi><hi rend="italic">Supplementis,</hi> Geneva, 1740, 1755, eleven parts,
                    in folio. The writings of Hoffmann contain a great mass of practical matter of
                    considerable value, partly compiled from preceding writers, and partly the
                    result of his own observation; but they are also deformed by trifling remarks,
                    hypothetical conjectures, and frequent prolixity and repetition in the details.
                    As a theorist, his suggestions proved of great importance, and contributed to
                    introduce that revolution in the science of medicine which subsequent
                    observation has extended and confirmed. Mis doctrine of atony and spasm in the
                    living solid, according to which all internal disorders were referred to some
                    preternatural affection of the nervous system, rather than to the morbid
                    derangements of the fluids, first turned the attention of physicians from the
                    mere mechanical and chemical operations of the body, to those of the primary
                    moving powers of the living system. Hoffmann pursued with considerable ardour
                    the study of practical chemistry, and improved the department of pharmacy by the
                    addition of some mineral preparations. But, upon the whole, his practice was
                    cautious, especially in his latter years; and he trusted much to vegetable
                    simples. “I affirm solemnly,” said he, “that though in my youth I ran much after
                    chemical remedies, yet, in my age, I became convinced that very few remedies,
                    well selected, and derived from substances in appearance the most worthless,
                    afford more prompt and efficacious relief to the sick than the rarest and most
