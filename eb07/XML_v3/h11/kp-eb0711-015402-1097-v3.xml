                    gentleman distinguished by his writings on the subject of grammar, was born on
                    the 20th of July 1709. He received his early educational Salisbury, whence he
                    was removed to Oxford at the age of sixteen; and having passed the usual number
                    of years as a gentleman commoner of W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> adham
                    College, he was entered at Lincoln’s Inn as a student of law, though not
                    intended for the bar. When he had attained his twenty-fourth year, his father
                    died; and this event having at once freed him from all control, and placed him
                    in the possession of an independent fortune, enabled him to exchange the study
                    of law for other pursuits more congenial to his taste. The decided bent of his
                    mind had always been towards the Greek and Latin classics, which he preferred to
                    every other kind of reading; and to the study of these authors he now applied
                    himself with unremitting assiduity during a period of fourteen or fifteen years.
                    The first fruit of this lengthened course of application was a volume which he
                    published in 1744, containing three treatises; one on art, another on music,
                    painting, and poetry, and a third on happiness. These treatises are illustrated
                    with a variety of learned notes and observations; and one of them, that upon
                    art, has been commended by Lord Monboddo as containing“the best specimen of the
                    dividing or diaeretic manner, as the ancients called it, that is to be found in
                    any modern book.” But the work by which he is best known is his <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> a philosophical inquiry concerning universal grammar,
                    which appeared in 1751,8vo. “Those who would enter deeply into the subject” (of
                    universal grammar), says Dr Lowth, “will find it fully and accurately handled,
                    with the greatest acuteness of investigation, perspicuity of application, and
                    elegance of method, in a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> by
                    James Harris, Esq.; the most beautiful example of analysis that has been
                    exhibited since the days of Aristotle.” To this culogium, however, the
                    philosophical grammarians of the present time are not by any means disposed to
                    subscribe. Without questioning the learning displayed in the <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> we may venture to affirm, that the arrangement of the parts of
                    speech into substantives, attributives, definitives, and connectives, is
                    entirely arbitrary; that nothing whatever is gained by this departure from the
                    ordinary classification, excepting perhaps to impart to the work an appearance
                    of originality, which, upon examination, will be found to vanish; that, though
                    professing to treat the subject of grammar in a philosophical manner, Mr Harris
                    is in reality the slave of authority; and that there is no quality for which his
                    work is less distinguished than that rigid analysis which Bishop Lowth has
                    somewhat hastily given him credit for. This, we think, has been fully
                    established in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Grammar</hi> of the present
                    work, to which accordingly the reader is referred for more ample information. Mr
                    Harris’s attention seems to have been first directed to this subject by the <hi rend="italic">Minerva</hi> of Sanctius, to which he has confessed himself
                    indebted for much valuable information; but it is somewhat remarkable, that with
                    the treatise of Apollonius <hi rend="italic">{De</hi><hi rend="italic">Constructione Orationis)</hi> also before him, he should not have avoided the
                    narrow and confined views which he has adopted on particular points, or should
                    have missed principles which would have served to guide him through the
                    intricacies in which he is frequently entangled. Mr Harris’s other productions
                    are, Philosophical Arrangements, published in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641110" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1110-0155"/>1775, being
                    part of a larger work which he had meditated, but did not complete, on the
                    peripatetic logic; and Phi- • lological Inquiries, printed in 1780, but not
                    published till 1781, containing not so much a regular system, as a summary of
                    the conclusions to which the philosophy of the ancients had conducted them in
                    their critical inquiries. After having been quite exhausted by illness, Mr
                    Harris expired on the 22d of December 1780, in the seventy-second year of his
                    age. In 1801, his son Lord Malmesbury published an edition of his works in two
                    volumes quarto; prefixed to which is a biographical sketch of the author from
                    the pen of the editor. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Harris,</hi> a district of the Hebrides, forming, with the larger district of
                    Lewis, one considerable island. In one part it is divided into nearly two parts
                    by the approximation of West Loch Tarbet and East Loch Tarbet, which leave only
                    a neck of land of about half a mile in breadth. At the head of the former is
                    situated the solitary village of Tarbet Harris is about twenty miles in length,
                    by eleven in breadth in the northern part, and from six to seven in the
                    southern. It is bleak, rocky, and unproductive. On the shores, however, there
                    are small patches of cultivated land; the rearing of cows and black cattle
                    further tends to support the inhabitants; but until the duty on barilla was
                    lowered, their chief source of profit was the manufacture of kelp. This,
                    however, is now considerably reduced. Harris is an independent parish in the
                    presbytery of Wick, and its kirk-town and capital is Rowadill or Rowdill, a
                    small village at the south-east corner of the island. The population amounted in
                    1821 to 3909, and in 1831 to 3900.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
