                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    >Ascra,</hi> a celebrated poet, the son of Dius and Pycimede, of whose life and
                    character history has left us very few particulars on which dependence can be
                    placed. His father was a native of Cumae, in Aeolis, where he seems to have
                    lived in the greatest indigence. Anxious to improve his circumstances, he
                    emigrated with his son Perses to Ascra, a small village of Boeotia, at the foot
                    of Mount Helicon, and there it would appear that Hesiod was born. The early
                    years of the poet were spent in the mountains of Boeotia, in the humble capacity
                    of a shepherd; and how he acquired the learning which he displays in his poetry,
                    we have no means of discovering. On the death of his father, he engaged in a
                    law-suit with his brother respecting the property left by his father; and he
                    speaks with great contempt and bitterness of the dishonest conduct pursued by
                    the judges of Ascra. They gave judgment against him, and in consequence of this
                    he left his native city. He probably retired to the country of the Locri Ozolae,
                    where, at last, he met with a tragical end. It so happened that Demodes of
                    Miletus, a friend of Hesiod, ill treated Climene, the daughter of the Locrian
                    with whom Hesiod was residing; and as her brothers Ainphiphanes and Ganyctor
                    believed the poet to be accessory to, if not an active partner in, the
                    disgraceful transaction, they put him to death on the spot where they overtook
                    him. Hesiod had been ordered by an oracle to avoid Nemea, as likely to prove
                    fatal to him, which the poet naturally imagined to allude to the city of that
                    name in the Peloponnesus; but the true meaning of the oracle was discovered by
                    his being slain in the porticoof the temple of the Nemean Jupiter, near Oeneon,
                    within the territory of Naupactus. His body had been thrown into the sea, but
                    being recovered in an extraordinary manner, was buried within the precincts of
                    the temple. It was afterwards transferred to Orchomenos by order of an oracle,
                    to avert a plague which afflicted the inhabitants of that city.</p>
                <p>The period during which he flourished was a point disputed by the ancients, and
                    we have no facts of a later date which can enable us to come to a correct
                    conclusion. He is described by Herodotus as contemporary with Homer; and this
                    must have been the tradition followed by the author of the contest between
                    Hesiod and Homer, in which the former is supposed to gain the victory. Vellei us
                    Paterculus represents him as having lived more than a century after Homer,
                    whilst others have endeavoured to prove that he preceded that poet.</p>
                <p>Of the numerous works attributed to Hesiod only three have been preserved, and
                    these not in the most perfect state. The Works and Days is considered as the
                    most valuable, not so much from its own intrinsic merit, as from having
                    suggested to Virgil the idea of the Georgies; and to it also we are indebted for
                    the description of the five ages, and the fable of Pandora. It contains at the
                    beginning a collection of moral maxims and wise saws, and then proceeds to give
                    some superficial hints on agriculture, on the proper season for each work, and
                    on the construction of vessels; it closes with many puerile observations, and
                    with an account of some superstitious practices. This was the only worker Hesiod
                    which the Boeotians allowed to be authentic, and it was regarded with such
                    veneration that they had it engraved on a leaden tablet, which they showed to
                    Pausanias. The <hi rend="italic">Theogonia</hi> is a didactic poem on the
                    generation of the gods, and is curious as being the most ancient account <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the Greek mythology. To it we probably owe the
                    Metamorphoses of Ovid. The <hi rend="italic">Aspes</hi> of Hercules contains an
                    account of a battle between that hero and Cyenus, and derives its title from the
                    shield having been made by Vulcan. It is ascribed to Hesiod by Athenaeus, though
                    probably without any sufficient reason. There are many other works quoted by the
                    ancients, but not even a fragment of them has been preserved. Many editions of
                    the works of Hesiod have been published, but the best are those of Gaisford,
                    Oxford, 1814-1820; Dindorf, Leipsic, 1825; and Gottlingius, Gotha, 1831.</p>
