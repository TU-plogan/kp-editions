                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HIGHMORE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph</hi></label>, a painter
                    and writer of some eminence in his day, was born in the parish of St James’s,
                    Garlickhithe, London, on the 13th of June 1692, being the third son of Mr Edward
                    Highmore, a coal-merchant in Thames Street. Having such an early and strong
                    inclination to painting that he could think with pleasure of nothing else, his
                    father endeavoured to gratify him by making a proposal to his uncle, who was
                    serjeant-painter to King William, and with whom Mr, afterwards Sir James
                    Thornhill, had served his apprenticeship. This however was subsequently for good
                    reasons declined, and he was articled as clerk to an attorney in 1707, but so
                    much against his own declared inclination, that in about three years he began to
                    form resolutions of indulging his natural disposition for his favourite art,
                    having continually employed his leisure hours in designing, and in the study of
                    geometry, perspective, architecture, and anatomy, but without any instructors in
                    these branches except books. He had afterwards an opportunity of improving
                    himself in anatomy, by attending the lectures of Mr Cheselden; besides entering
                    himself at the painters’ academy in Great Queen Street, where he remained ten
                    years, and had the honour to be particularly noticed by Sir Godfrey Kneller, who
                    distinguished him by the name of the Young Lawyer. In 1714 his clerkship
                    expired; and in 1715 he began painting as a profession, and settled in the city.
                    In the same year Dr Brook Taylor published his Linear Perspective. On this
                    complete and universal theory our artist grounded his subsequent practice; and
                    it has been generally allowed, that few if any of the profession at that time
                    were so thorough masters of Taylor’s excellent but intricate system. In 1716 he
                    married Susanna, daughter and heiress of Mr Anthony Hiller of Effingham, in
                    Surrey; a young lady in every respect worthy of his choice. As his reputation
                    and business increased, he took a more conspicuous station, by removing to a
                    house in Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields; and an opportunity soon offered of introducing
                    him advantageously to the nobility, by his being desired, by Mr Pine the
                    engraver, to make drawings for his prints of the knights of the bath, upon the
                    revival of that order in 1725. The publication of Pamela in 1744 gave rise to a
                    set of paintings by Highmore, which were engraved by two French engravers, and
                    published by subscription in 1745. In the same year he painted the only original
                    of General Wolfe, who was then about eighteen years of age. FIis Pamela
                    introduced him to the acquaintance and friendship of the excellent author of
                    that work, whose picture he drew, and for whom he painted the only original of
                    Dr Young. In 1750 he had the misfortune to lose his wife. On the first
                    institution of the Academy of Painting and Sculpture, in 1753, he was elected
                    one of the professors; an honour which, on account of many avocations, he was
                    induced to decline. In 1754 he published a critical examination of two paintings
                    by Rubens on the ceiling of the banqueting-house at Whitehall, in which
                    architecture <pb break="no" facs="nls:193643853" xml:id="kp-eb0711-3853-0366"
                    />is introduced,as far as relates to perspective; together with the discussion
                    of a question which has been the subject of debate amongst painters; printed in
                    4to∙ Of the numerous portraits which Mr Highmore painted, in an extensive
                    practice of forty-six years, it is impossible and useless to discuss the merits.
                    Some of the best in the historical branch may, however, be mentioned, viz. Hagar
                    and Ishmael; the Good Samaritan; the Finding of Moses; the Harlowe Family, as
                    described in Clarissa; Clarissa, the portrait mentioned in that work; the Graces
                    Unveiling Nature; the Clementina of Grandison; and the Queen Mother of Edward
                    IV. with her younger son, in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>His principal literary work was his Practice of Perspective, on the principles of
                    Dr Brook Taylor, written many years before, but not published till 1763. In 1765
                    he published Observations on a Pamphlet entitled Christianity not founded on
                    Argument; and in the same year two small volumes of Essays, moral, religious,
                    and miscellaneous, with a translation in prose of Mr Brown’s Latin poem on the
                    immortality of the soul. A strong constitution, and constant attention to his
                    health, prolonged his life and preserved his faculties until his eighty-eighth
                    year, when he gradually ceased to breathe, and, as it were, fell asleep, on the
                    3d of March 1780.</p>
