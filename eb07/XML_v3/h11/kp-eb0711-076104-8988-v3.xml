                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                    History,</hi> a party of reformers, the followers of John Huss. The person from
                    whom the Hussites take their name was born in a little village in Bohemia,
                    called Huss, and lived at Prague in the highest reputation, both on account of
                    the sanctity of his manners and the purity of his doctrine. He was distinguished
                    by his uncommon erudition and eloquence, and discharged at the same time the
                    functions of professor of divinity in the university, and of ordinary pastor in
                    the church of that city. He adopted the sentiments of Wickliffe, and the
                    Waldenses; and in the year 1407 began openly to oppose and preach against
                    various errors in doctrine, as well as corruptions in point of discipline, which
                    then prevailed in the church. Huss likewise endeavoured to the utmost of his
                    power to withdraw the university of Prague from the jurisdiction of Gregory
                    XII., whom the kingdom of Bohemia had hitherto acknowledged as the true and
                    lawful head of the church. This occasioned a violent quarrel between the
                    incensed Archbishop of Prague and the zealous reformer, which the latter
                    inflamed and augmented from day to day by his pathetic exclamations against the
                    court of Rome, and the corruptions that prevailed amongst the sacerdotal
                    order.</p>
                <p>But there were other circumstances which contributed to inflame the resentment of
                    the clergy against him. He adopted the philosophical opinions of the realists,
                    and vehemently opposed and even persecuted the nominalists, whose number and
                    influence were considerable in the university of Prague. In the year 1408 he
                    also increased the bitterness of his enemies, by procuring a sentence in favour
                    of the Bohemians, who had disputed with the Germans concerning the number of
                    suffrages which their respective nations were entitled to in all matters that
                    were carried by election in this university. In consequence of a decree obtained
                    in favour of the former, which restored them to their constitutional right of
                    three suffrages, usurped by the latter, the Germans withdrew from Prague, and,
                    in the year 1409, founded a new"academy at Leipsic. This event had no sooner
                    happened than Huss began to inveigh with greater freedom than he had before done
                    against the vices and corruptions of the clergy, and to recommend, in a public
                    manner, the writings and opinions of Wickliffe, as far as these related to the
                    papal hierarchy, the despotism of the court of Rome, and the corruption of the
                    clergy. Hence, in the year 1410, an accusation was brought against him before
                    the tribunal of John XXIII. ’ by whom he was solemnly expelled from the
                    communion of the church. Notwithstanding this sentence of excommunication, he
                    proceeded to expose the errors and vices of the Roman Ca <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193649001" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9001-0762"/>tholic church, with a
                    fortitude and zeal that were almost universally applauded.</p>
                <p>This eminent man, whose piety was equally sincere and fervent, though his zeal
                    was perhaps too violent, and his prudence not always circumspect, was summoned
                    to appear before the council of Constance. Secured, as he apprehended, from the
                    rage of his enemies by the safe-conduct granted him by the Emperor Sigismund for
                    his journey to Constance, his residence in that place, and his return to his own
                    country, John Huss obeyed the order of the council, and appeared before it to
                    demonstrate his innocence, and to prove that the charge of his having deserted
                    the church of Rome was entirely groundless. However, his enemies so far
                    prevailed, that by a scandalous breach of public faith he was cast into prison,
                    declared a heretic because he refused to plead guilty, in obedience to the
                    orders of the council, and burned alive in 1415; a punishment which he endured
                    with unparalleled magnanimity and resignation.</p>
                <p>The same unhappy fate was reserved for another reformer, Jerome of Prague, his
                    intimate companion, who attended the council in order to support his persecuted
                    friend. Jerome, indeed, was terrified into temporary submission; but he
                    afterwards recovered his fortitude, and maintained the opinions, which he had
                    for a while deserted through fear, amidst the flames, in which he expired in
                    1416.</p>
                <p>The disciples of Huss adhered to their master’s doctrine after his death with a
                    zeal which broke out into an open war, that was carried on with the most
                    unparalleled barbarity. John Ziska, a Bohemian knight, in 1420 put himself at
                    the head of the Hussites, who had now become a considerable party, and threw off
                    the yoke of Sigismund, who had treated their brethren in the most cruel and
                    barbarous manner. In the year 1424, Ziska was succeeded by Procopius. The acts
                    of barbarity committed on both sides were shocking and horrible; for
                    notwithstanding the irreconcilable opposition between the religious sentiments
                    of the contending parties, they both agreed in this one detestable principle,
                    that it was innocent and lawful to extirpate by fire and sword the enemies of
                    the true religion; and as such they reciprocally considered each other. But, by
                    the interference of the council of Basil, in the year 1433, these commotions in
                    a great measure subsided, and peace was at length restored. The Hussites, who
                    were divided into two parties, viz. the Calixtines and Taborites, spread over
                    all Bohemia and Hungary, and even Silesia and Poland; and some remains of them
                    still subsist in those parts.</p>
