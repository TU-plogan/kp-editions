                <p><label type="entry">HANSE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Hans</hi></label>, an ancient
                    name for a society or company of merchants, particularly that of certain cities
                    in Germany, hence called <hi rend="italic">Hanse-towns.</hi> The word <hi
                    rend="italic">hanse</hi> is obsolete High Dutch or Teutonic, and signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">alliance,</hi><hi rend="italic">confederacy, association.</hi> But
                    some derive it from the two German words <hi rend="italic">am-see,</hi> that is,
                    <hi rend="italic">on the sea,</hi> because the first hanse towns were all
                    situated on the sea-coast; and hence the society is said to have been originally
                    called <hi rend="italic">am zee stenen,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cities on the
                    sea,</hi> and afterwards, by abbreviation, <hi rend="italic">hansee,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">hanse.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Hanse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Towns.</hi> The Hanseatic society was a league between several
                    maritime cities of Germany, for the protection of their commerce. Bremen and
                    Amsterdam were the first two that formed it; and the trade of these towns
                    experienced such advantage by their fitting out two men of war in each to convoy
                    their ships, that more cities entered into the league. Even kings and princes
                    made treaties with the league, and were often glad of their assistance and
                    protection; by which means they became so powerful both by sea and land, that
                    they raised armies as well as navies, possessed countries in sovereignty, and
                    made peace or war, though always in defence of their trade, as if they had been
                    an united state or commonwealth.</p>
                <p>At this time many cities, though they had no great interest in trade, or
                    intercourse with the ocean, entered into this alliance for the preservation of
                    their liberties; so that in 1200 we find no less than seventy-two cities in the
                    list of the towns of the Hanse, particularly Bremen, Amsterdam, Antwerp,
                    Rotterdam, Dort, Bruges, Ostend, Dunkirk, Middleburg, Calais, Rouen, Rochelle,
                    Bordeaux, St Malo, Bayonne, Bilboa, Lisbon, Seville, Cadiz, Carthagena,
                    Barcelona, Marseilles, Leghorn, Naples, Messina, London, Lubeck, Rostock,
                    Stralsund, Stettin, Wismar, Königsberg, Dantzig, Elbing, and Marienburg.</p>
                <p>The alliance was now so powerful that their ships of war were often hired by
                    other princes to assist them against their enemies. They not only awed, but
                    often defeated, all that opposed their commerce; and in 1358 they took such
                    revenge on the Danish fleet in the Sound, for having interrupted their commerce,
                    that Waldemar III. king of Denmark, for the sake of peace, gave them up Schonen
                    for sixteen years, by which they commanded the passage of the Sound in their own
                    right. In 1428 they made war on Erick, king of Denmark,"with two hundred and
                    fifty sail, carrying on board 12,000 men. These so ravaged the coast of Jutland,
                    that the king was glad to make peace with them.</p>
                <p>Many privileges were bestowed upon the Hanse Towns by Louis XI., Charles VIII.,
                    Louis XII., and Francis I., kings of France, as well as by the emperor Charles
                    V., who had different loans of money from them, and by King Henry HL, who also
                    incorporated them into a trading body, in acknowledgment of money which they had
                    advanced to him, as well as for the good services they did him by their naval
                    forces in 1206.</p>
                <p>These towns exercised a jurisdiction amongst themselves; and for this purpose
                    they were divided into four colleges or provinces, distinguished by the names of
                    their four principal cities, viz. Lubeck, Cologne, Brunswick, and Dantzig, in
                    which were held their courts of judicature. They had a common stock or treasury
                    at Lubeck, and power to call an assembly as often as was necessary. They kept
                    magazines or warehouses for the sale of their merchandises in London, Bruges,
                    Antwerp, Berg in Norway, Revel in Livonia, and Novogorod in Muscovy, which were
                    exported to most parts of Europe, in English, Dutch, and Flemish bottoms. One of
                    their principal magazines was at London, where a society of German merchants was
                    formed, called the Steelyard Company. To this company great privileges were
                    granted by Edward I.; but these were revoked by act of parliament in 1552, in
                    the reign of Edward VI., upon a complaint of the English merchants that this
                    company had so completely engrossed the cloth trade, that in the preceding year
                    they had exported 50,000 pieces, whilst the English had only shipped 1100
                    pieces. Queen Mary, who ascended the throne the following year, having resolved
                    to marry Philip, son of the emperor Charles V., suspended the execution of the
                    act for three years; but after that term, whether by reason of some new statute,
                    or in pursuance of that of King Edward, the privileges of the company were no
                    longer regarded, and all efforts of the Hanse Towns to recover this loss were
                    unavailing.</p>
                <p>Another accident which contributed to their mortification occurred whilst Queen
                    Elizabeth was at war with the Spaniards. Sir Francis Drake happening to meet
                    sixty ships in the Tagus, loaded with corn belonging to the Hanse Towns, took
                    out all the corn as contraband goods, which they were forbidden to carry by
                    their original patent. The Hanse Towns having complained of this to the diet of
                    the empire, the queen sent an ambassador thither to declare her reasons. The
                    king of Poland likewise interested himself in the affair, because the city of
                    Dantzig was under his protection. At last, though the queen strove hard to
                    preserve the commerce of the English in Germany, the emperor excluded the
                    English company of merchant-adventurers, who bad considerable factories at
                    Stade, Emden, Bremen, Hamburg, and Elbing, from all trade in the empire. In
                    short, the Hanse Towns, particularly in Germany, were not only in so
                    flourishing, but in so formidable a state, from the fourteenth to the sixteenth
                    century, that they gave umbrage to all the neighbouring princes, who threatened
                    a strong confederacy against them, and, as the first step towards this,
                    commanded all the cities within their dominion or jurisdiction to withdraw from
                    the union or Hanse, and have no further concern therein. This immediately
                    separated from them all the cities of England, France, and Italy. The Hanse, on
                    the other hand, prudently put themselves under the protection of the empire; and
                    as the cities just mentioned had withdrawn from them, they withdrew from several
                    more, and made a decree amongst themselves, that none should be admitted into
                    their society but such as stood <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640928"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-0928-0141"/>within the limits of the German empire, or were
                    dependent thereon, except Dantzig, which continued a member, though in nowise
                    dependent on the empire. By this means they maintained their confederacy for the
                    protection of trade, without being any more envied by their neighbours; but they
                    were reduced to Lubeck, Bremen, Hamburg, and Dantzig, in the first of which they
                    kept their register, and held assemblies once in three years at least. In the
                    middle of the seventeenth century, Lubeck, Bremen, and Hamburg were all that
                    continued to acknowledge the authority of the league; and even to this day the
                    shadow of its power still exists, these places having been acknowledged in the
                    act for the establishment of the Germanic confederation signed at Vienna on the
                    8th of June 1815, as free Hanseatic cities.</p>
