                    Earl of Clarendon), was born at Dinton, in the county of Wilts, on the 18th of
                    Ie-bruary 1609. He was the third son of Henry Hyde, the descendant of a family
                    of that name, which had resided from a remote period at Norbury, in Cheshire.
                    Edward, after receiving his first education under his father’s roof, was sent,
                    at the age of thirteen, to Magdalen Hall, at Oxford. He was originally intended
                    for the church; but, in consequence of the death of his last surviving elder
                    brother, his destination was changed, whilst he was at the university, from the
                    profession of the church to that of law, and in 1625 he was entered at the
                    Middle Temple. A severe ague with which he was attacked that year caused a
                    suspension of his studies, and temporary removal from the Middle Temple, to
                    which he returned in 1626. In 1628, when riding the Norfolk summer circuit with
                    his une <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ì,</hi> Sir Nicholas Hyde, chief-justice of
                    the King’s Bench, who died in 1631, he caught the small-pox; and his legal
                    studies were again for a long time interrupted. He married, in 1629, a daughter
                    of Sir George Ayliffe, who died of the small-pox six months afterwards. He
                    married a second time in 1632, in which year he lost his father. His se <pb

                    daughter of Sir Thomas Aylesbury, Bart, master of requests; and by her he had
                    many children. Hyde now applied himself to the study of the law with a diligence
                    which he had not shown before, and his success soon surpassed the expectations
                    of his contemporaries. Meanwhile he lived little with lawyers; but he had many
                    associates of political and literary celebrity, Lord Falkland, Selden,
                    Chillingworth, Waller the poet, Ben Jonson, May the historian, Hales, Sheldon,
                    Earles, and Morley. To these maybe added a few men of high rank, as the Marquis
                    of Hamilton, the Earls of Pembroke, Holland, and Manchester, and Lord Coventry.
                    In 1635, through an accidental circumstance, he also obtained the notice of
                    Archbishop Laud. In the course of an inquiry into the state of the customs
                    instituted by the primate in his capacity of commissioner of the treasury, Hyde
                    was mentioned to him as one who had been much consulted by some aggrieved
                    merchants, and could afford the information desired. From this time Laud saw him
                    frequently, employed him upon many occasions, and caused him to be noticed and
                    employed by others. From 1635 till 1640 may be regarded as the most fortunate
                    period of Hyde’s life. He was successful in his profession, possessed a
                    competent private fortune, and was happily married. In 1640 he was elected
                    member of parliament for Wootton-Basset and for Shaftesbury, and took his seat
                    for the former. The parliament met on the 13th of April, and was dissolved on
                    the 5th of May. Hyde’s first brief parliamentary career was characterized by
                    activity and an honest zeal in the correction of abuses, from which not all the
                    friendship of Laud and the favour of the court was able to divert him. In his
                    first speech he denounced the earl marshal’s court, which, in its protection of
                    the privileges of the titled classes, had been intolerably vexatious and
                    oppressive; and he showed himself a true and practical friend of rational
                    freedom. During this very short session, he served in seven committees. He
                    foresaw the evil consequences of the hasty dissolution, and endeavoured in vain
                    to prevail on Laud to employ his influence with the king to prevent it. In the
                    next parliament, which met in November 1640, Hyde sat for Saltash. He
                    recommenced his proceedings against the earl marshal’s court, of which he
                    procured the suppression. He was also chairman of a committee of inquiry into
                    the abuses of the council of York, and the court of the council of the marches;
                    and he conducted the impeachment of three of the barons of the exchequer for
                    illegal exactions at the bidding of the crown. But Hyde, though zealous for the
                    redress of grievances, was opposed to the encroachments of parliamentary
                    authority, which began to assume a formidable aspect. Strongly attached to
                    episcopacy, he also disliked the attempts of the parliament to remodel the
                    government of the church; and boasts that as chairman of the committee on that
                    question, he interposed so many delays that the project was suspended. He
                    vehemently protested against the Commons’ remonstrance, his opposition to which
                    was the occasion of his first introduction to Charles I. He had written an
                    answer to it, which he showed in confidence to Lord Digby. Digby made it known
                    to the king, who sent for Hyde, requested the paper, approved, and published it
                    as the reply of the king with the advice of his council. Soon afterwards the
                    king offered to Hyde the office of solicitor-general, which the latter declined,
                    alleging that he could better serve his sovereign in an unofficial capacity. To
                    this the king assented; and meanwhile committed to him, to Lord Falkland, and to
                    Sir John Colepepper, the entire management of his affairs in the House of
                    Commons, assuring them that he would take no step therein without their
                    concurrence. Notwithstanding this assurance, Charles, without apprizing these
                    chosen councillors, not long afterwards had recourse to the ill-timed measure of
                    attempting to seize the five members in the House of Commons. Though the
                    consequences of this rash act were irretrievable, and the royal cause was almost
                    hopeless, Hyde continued courageously to support it. During many months he was
                    secretly employed in writing answers for the king to the declarations of the
                    parliament, and had frequent interviews with him by stealth; but he was at
                    length suspected, and narrowly escaped committal to the Tower by flying to the
                    king at York. Though Hyde had thus become openly an adherent of the king, he
                    long refused office. He declined the proffered post of secretary of state; and
                    it was not till March 1643 that, on the promotion of Sir John Colepepper to the
                    mastership of the rolls, he accepted the chancellorship of the exchequer. He was
                    one of the commissioners at the negotiations at Uxbridge, where, as on other
                    occasions, he fruitlessly laboured to effect peace between king and parliament,
                    as far as was compatible with a preservation of the royal prerogative and the
                    rights of the established church.</p>
                <p>In 1644, after the battle of Naseby, Hyde was appointed, together with Sir John
                    Colepepper and Lords Capel and Hopton, to form a council to attend, watch over,
                    and direct the Prince of Wales. After hopelessly witnessing for many months a
                    course of disastrous and ill-conducted warfare in the west, they fled with him,
                    first to Scilly, and thence to Jersey; from which, at the entreaty of the queen,
                    but against the opinion of Hyde and others of the council, the prince, in 1646,
                    repaired to his mother at Paris, attended only by Sir John Colepepper, and
                    leaving Hyde at Jersey. In this retreat Hyde remained till the spring of 1648,
                    engaged in the composition of his history of the rebellion. He also wrote,
                    during this period, an answer to a declaration of the parliament, in which they
                    charged the king with all the evils which had happened, and justified the
                    discontinuance of all further addresses to him. In May 1648, he was summoned to
                    attend the prince, who, at the head of a fleet which had espoused the royal
                    cause, was blockading the Thames. Hyde, after encountering sundry difficulties,
                    and amongst others seizure by privateers off Ostend, did not meet the prince
                    till his return to the Hague, about the end of August, from his fruitless
                    expedition. Hyde found dissensions in the prince’s little court at the Hague,
                    especially'between Prince Rupert and Lord Colepepper. The news of the death of
                    Charles I. for a while afflicted and appalled them; but their animosities soon
                    broke out afresh, and disturbed the councils of the new sovereign. In 1649, at
                    the suggestion of Lord Cottington, Hyde and that nobleman were sent as
                    ambassadors to the court of Spain for the purpose of soliciting its assistance.
                    They were coolly received, and had the mortification of perceiving that the
                    Spanish court was more inclined to cultivate the friendship of the commonwealth
                    of England; and to the memorial which they presented to the king of Spain in a
                    private audience, they obtained only a cold and ambiguous reply. The treatment
                    they experienced from the Spanish government was meanly time-serving, and varied
                    with the fortune of Charles’s affairs. On his determining to proceed to
                    Scotland, upon the invitation of the Scotch council and parliament, the
                    ambassadors were treated with more regard.’ Upon the news of Cromwell’s victory
                    over Argyll’s army, they were desired to depart. Accordingly, Hyde quitted
                    Spain, unaccompanied by his colleague Lord Cottington, who chose to remain as a
                    private person, though not permitted to reside at Madrid. On Hyde’s return from
                    Spain in 1651, he met “at Paris the king, returned from the ill-fated expedition
                    which terminated in his defeat at Worcester; which rash interference, and the
                    king’s negotiation with the Scotch, and acceptance of the covenant, Hyde
                    severely censured. He found himself expos <pb break="no" facs="nls:193649079"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-9079-0768"/>ed to the enmity of many, especially of the queen.
                    Sundry calumnies were circulated against him, and two petitions were prepared,
                    one from presbyterians, the other from papists, praying his removal from
                    Charles’s councils. But Charles’s confidence in Hyde was not shaken by these
                    intrigues; and he appears to have seen their groundlessness, and properly
                    appreciated the valuable services of so honest, able, and zealous a minister.
                    Extreme poverty was amongst the evils which, in a greater or less degree, since
                    Hyde’s departure from Jersey, he and his family had been compelled to bear. His
                    family resided principally at Antwerp, and he and they were almost reduced to
                    want the most common necessaries of life; yet his courage and integrity never
                    faltered, and he would not even (as many had done) compound for his estates in
                    England, lest thereby he should seem to acknowledge the existing government.
                    Year after year, too, the hope of relief to the royalist party from foreign aid
                    was waning away; and neither foreign war nor domestic conspiracy seemed to avail
                    against the power of Cromwell. In 1658 Cromwell died, but the protectorate
                    passed, like an inheritance, into the hands of his son; and though the hopes of
                    the royalists were naturally excited, the prospects of restoration were still
                    found to be dark, vague, and distant. Hyde, who was now lord chancellor,
                    corresponded much with those whom the weakness of Richard Cromwell and the
                    distracted state of England had rendered favourable to the royal cause, and
                    proved instrumental in forwarding that Restoration which was at length more
                    ostensibly effected by the powerful agency of Monk.</p>
                <p>The period immediately following the Restoration was that of Hyde’s greatest
                    power. He was the first minister, presiding over a cabinet in which the
                    principal offices were filled by his friends (for such were Sir Edward Nicholas,
                    the Earl of Southampton, and the Marquis of Ormonde), and the principal measures
                    of the government were peculiarly his. The first great measure of his
                    administration was the act of indemnity. This was in accordance with the king’s
                    declaration from Breda, in which he promised pardon to all his subjects, save
                    such as should be excepted by parliament, by which was intended the exclusion of
                    those who had been instrumental to his father’s death. The lord chancellor was
                    on the side of mercy, and urged the speedy adoption of this healing measure on a
                    reluctant and vindictive parliament. In the settlement of property under the act
                    of indemnity some apparent injustice was unavoidably committed, by the necessity
                    of dealing differently, not according to the merits of persons, but the nature
                    of the property to be dealt with, and the title by which it was held.
                    Transactions between individuals could not be reached; but grants to or
                    purchases by individuals from the usurping state became subject to revision from
                    defect of title; and crown and church lands were recovered from their holders,
                    whilst the impoverished royalist who had sold his property to support the cause
                    of the king was doomed to see the sale confirmed, and himself debarred from
                    compensation. The royalists consequently murmured loudly. They called the
                    statute an act of “indemnity tor the king’s enemies, and of oblivion for his
                    friends;” and they hated the chancellor for the part he took in framing this
                    act, and his steady adherence to the principles of it. The next important
                    measure was the settlement of the revenue. It is asserted by several
                    authorities, that the chancellor might have obtained for the king from the
                    parliament, in the first fervour of their revived loyalty, an annual revenue of
                    L.2,000,000. But it was not his wish to render the sovereign independent of the
                    aid of his parliament, and he therefore sought for him only L. 1,200,000, a sum
                    scarcely sufficient for the exigencies of the state, unless administered with
                    due economy. This sum the parliament readily granted. Military tenures, and the
                    oppressive privileges of wardship, purveyance, and pre-emption, were abolished,
                    and the excise on liquors was granted in their stead. The restoration of the
                    bishops to the House of Lords, the statute against tumultuous petitioning, the
                    vesting of the supreme command of the militia solely in the crown, and the
                    repeal of the triennial acts, were measures promoted by the chancellor for the
                    purpose of strengthening the prerogative of the crown. In the regulation of the
                    judicature he deserved high praise. He showed a rare impartiality and
                    discernment in his appointments, and eminent integrity and diligence in the
                    administration of his own office. His conduct in ecclesiastical matters was less
                    liberal and judicious. He believed episcopacy to be the only form of church
                    government suitable to monarchy, and was too little tolerant towards other
                    sects. Under his administration several oppressive acts were passed; the act of
                    uniformity, compelling clergymen, on pain of abandoning their livings, to
                    subscribe to the forms of the church of England, and to the doctrine of passive
                    obedience, by which two thousand were ejected; the act against conventicles,
                    imposing fines on all present at any meeting for religious worship at which five
                    assisted besides the family; and the five-mile act, by which dissenting teachers
                    who had not taken the oath of passive obedience were forbidden to approach
                    within five miles of a place where they had preached since the act of indemnity.
                    But the sin of such oppressions lies chiefly with the parliament. In that which
                    succeeded the convention parliament there were a great majority of high
                    churchmen. Venncrs’ insurrection had strengthened the prejudices against
                    sectarians; and it is by no means certain that Clarendon could have stemmed the
                    torrent of intolerance, even if he had wished or attempted to do so.</p>
                <p>In 1660, on the 3d of September, his daughter Anne was secretly married to the
                    Duke of York; an union which, after much opposition from the mother and sister
                    of the duke, and the calumnies of profligate courtiers, was acknowledged about
                    the end of the year. The discovery was received by the chancellor with violent
                    demonstrations of indignation and grief. He seems to have been solicitous to
                    repel the imputation of having secretly promoted an alliance so flattering to
                    his ambition, and to have dreaded the effects of the jealousy it might excite.
                    He had in the following year a share in negotiating a marriage for the king with
                    Catherine of Portugal; a marriage which, when it proved unfruitful, was
                    groundlessly supposed to have been promoted by Clarendon under that expectation,
                    and with a view that his son-in-law or his descendants might inherit the throne.
                    Such suppositions would have been far fetched, even if an incapacity in the
                    princess to bear children had really existed; and it must fall to the ground
                    when the contrary is known. Difference of religion was the only obvious
                    objection to this alliance; but there was no Protestant princess to whom Charles
                    would ally himself; and amongst Catholics the princess of Portugal was perhaps
                    least objectionable, and conferred the advantages of a dowry of L.500,000,
                    Tangiers, Bombay, and free trade with Portugal and its colonies. The profligacy
                    of Charles, and the malign influence of Lady Castlemaine, afterwards Duchess of
                    Cleveland, which Clarendon vainly endeavoured to resist, were the main causes of
                    the unhappiness of this marriage.</p>
                <p>Hyde showed no avidity for emoluments or distinctions. After the Restoration,
                    when Monk was created a duke, and Montague an earl, Hyde declined a proffered
                    peerage, resting his refusal on unwillingness to excite disaffection amongst the
                    new supporters of monarchy by an apparent eagerness on the part of the king to
                    load with honours his old adherents. When the marriage of his daughter with the
                    Duke of York became known, this objection ceased; a public mark of the king’s
                    unaltered regard be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193649092"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-9092-0769"/>came desirable, and Hyde accepted the barony of
                    Hindon. A further elevation took place in 1661, at the coronation, on the
                    request of the Duke of York; and the chancellor was created Earl of Clarendon,
                    and took his seat as such on the 11th of May. At the time when he was made a
                    baron he accepted a present of L.20,000 from the king; but he had declined at an
                    earlier period the more valuable grant of ten thousand acres of crown land,
                    which Charles was willing to bestow.</p>
                <p>One of the measures of his administration which has exposed him to most reproach,
                    was the sale of Dunkirk in 1662. Yet it cannot be shown that the motive was
                    corrupt, or the measure indefensible. Money was wanted; large arrears had been
                    due to the army; and large sums had been necessarily expended in military and
                    naval stores. The revenue settled by the parliament was insufficient in amount,
                    and with difficulty collected; and subsidies were granted by the parliament in
                    1661 as an additional aid. The wants of the state were still urgent. Dunkirk was
                    a source of expense to the yearly amount of L.120,000. France was willing to
                    purchase; and after much negotiation between Clarendon and D’Estrades, Dunkirk
                    was sold to France for 5,000,000 livres. A more truly censurable actof
                    Clarendon’s administration was sanctioning the acceptance of money for Charles
                    from Louis XIV. though he had the honesty to refuse it for himself, and laying
                    the foundation of that secret correspondence which at length rendered the king
                    of England almost the pensioned servant of France. The sale of Dunkirk tended to
                    weaken the popularity of Clarendon with the nation. He soon began to lose the
                    favour of the king, by his opposition, in July 1663, to a measure Charles had
                    much at heart, namely, a bill to invest the king with a discretionary power of
                    dispensing, for a fine, penal laws against all sects, by which Charles hoped to
                    favour the Catholics, though this purpose was necessarily cloaked under a
                    promise of toleration, including all Protestant dissenters. Clarendon, who knew
                    and disapproved of the motive, vehemently opposed this bill, and caused it to be
                    laid aside; and Charles from that time began to entertain a dislike of his
                    minister, which the enemies of Clarendon sedulously fostered. The Duke of
                    Buckingham and other chosen associates of the king tried to undermine the
                    influence of Clarendon by mimicry and taunts, representing him as a churlish
                    pedagogue, and inciting the king to emancipate himself from restraint. His
                    influence as a minister was also lessened by the substitution of Bennet for his
                    firm friend Sir Edward Nicholas, and by the reviving power of Coventry and
                    Ashley. He also paid the penalty of power, in bearing the load of whatever
                    calamities befel the nation. Even the plague, and the fire of London, and the
                    disastrous issue of the Dutch war (a war to which the public was favourable, and
                    he was adverse), concurred to weaken his popularity. The defenceless state of
                    the Thames, which enabled the Dutch to invade it successfully, and the
                    conclusion of a peace which the people disliked, were imputed to the chancellor.
                    Anxious to pursue a middle course, and careless of the public favour, he had
                    gained the friendship of no party alike able and willing to support him. The
                    Protestant dissenters disliked him as the promoter of the measures against
                    non-conformists; the Catholics as having frustrated the king’s endeavour to
                    grant them indulgence; the Royalists as the supporter of the act of indemnity
                    and oblivion; the populace because he had built a large house, which, it was
                    already rumoured, was the ostentatious result of secret bribes from France or
                    Holland. The profligate and ambitious court disliked him as a reprover of their
                    license, and an obstacle to their advancement; and Charles, who, aided by the
                    high-church party, might have supported him against these assailants, had
                    recently entertained a fresh ground of dislike. He knew that Clarendon opposed
                    his infamous plan of obtaining a divorce; and he believed him to have promoted
                    the marriage of Miss Stewart, whom, after obtaining such divorce, Charles had
                    intended to espouse. The discontented nation clamoured for a victim; and the
                    ungrateful king was glad to sacrifice to popular vengeance the minister whose
                    stubborn honesty was opposed to the gratification of his will. He sent a message
                    to Clarendon, then in affliction from the recent death of his wife, advising him
                    to resign, with a view of saving himself from impeachment. Clarendon refused to
                    take so humiliating a step; and Charles deprived him of the great seal on the
                    13th of August 1667. Clarendon, whom the impeachment preferred by Lord Bristol
                    four years before had left unshaken, was now again exposed to this attack under
                    circumstances which rendered it more powerful against him. Urged by the Dukes of
                    Buckingham and Albemarle, the Commons drew up, on the 6th of November, an
                    impeachment, consisting of seventeen articles, which, after several days’
                    debate, was on the 12th carried up to the Lords. He was accused of designing to
                    govern by a standing army, and advising the king to discontinue parliaments; of
                    saying that the king was in his heart a Papist; of receiving money for illegal
                    patents; of imprisoning in remote garrisons; of unjust sale of offices; of
                    corruptly procuring the customs to be farmed at low rates, pretended debts to be
                    paid by the king, and the company of vintners to obtain undue advantages; of
                    procuring grants to be made to himself and his relations; of introducing
                    arbitrary government in the colonies; of frustrating a proposal for the
                    preservation of Nevis and St Christopher’s; of advising and effecting the sale
                    of Dunkirk; of unduly causing the king’s letters-patent to Dr Croucher to be
                    altered; of arbitrary conduct in the council; of having caused <hi rend="italic"
                    >quo</hi><hi rend="italic">warrantas</hi> to be issued against corporations,
                    with the intent of extorting money; of having corruptly procured the bill of
                    settlement for Ireland; of having deceived the king in his administration of
                    foreign affairs, and betrayed his councils to the enemy; and of having
                    counselled the division of the fleet in June 1666. To these flimsy charges Lord
                    Clarendon replied by the mouth of his son, that if any one was proved, he would
                    submit to the rest. His accusers were ashamed to make any one of them the
                    specific ground of an impeachment; and accordingly he was impeached of high
                    treason in general terms, and his imprisonment demanded, until the Commons, “in
                    convenient time,” shall exhibit “articles against him.” The Lords refused to
                    imprison him on this general accusation. Much controversy ensued between the two
                    houses, during which, in compliance with the entreaties of his friends, and the
                    intimated wishes of the king, Clarendon closed the dispute by withdrawing
                    himself from the kingdom on the 29th of November 1667, and retiring to France.
                    He left on his departure a vindication of his conduct, addressed to the House of
                    Lords, which address was communicated to the Commons, by whom it was voted that
                    it was scandalous and seditious, and should be burned by the hangman. The
                    Commons then attempted to obtain his attainder, but were opposed by the Lords;
                    and the two houses finally concurred in an act of banishment and incapacity,
                    unless he appeared and took his trial before the 1st of February, which act was
                    passed on the 18th of December 1667. Fresh persecutions awaited Clarendon. The
                    court of France, in order to gain the favour of England, wished to expel him
                    from their dominions; and it was not till their hopes of alliance were dispelled
                    by the triple league, that they showed kindness to the distinguished exile, and
                    Clarendon received a special permission to reside in any part of France. He
                    abode principally at Montpellier, where, resuming his literary labours,
                    hecompleted his celebrated History, and the Memoir of his own Life. From thence
                    he re <pb break="no" facs="nls:193649105" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9105-0770"/>paired
                    to Rouen, where, in the year 1674, he addressed to Charles II. a fruitless
                    prayer for permission to spend the short remainder of his life in England. A few
                    months afterwards he died at Rouen, on the 9th of December 1674, in the
                    sixty-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>The character of Lord Clarendon has been much exposed to undeserved extremes of
                    praise and of censure. He has been made the idol of the high-church party, and
                    bitterly assailed by their opponents. As a minister he appears to have been
                    incorrupt, indefatigable, zealous for the public service, and anxious to hold an
                    even balance between the liberties of the subject and the privileges of the
                    crown, and to secure to the restored king only the constitutional powers of
                    limited monarchy. His chief faults were harshness towards the non-conformists,
                    and acquiescence in the king’s clandestine acceptance of pecuniary aid from
                    France. His merits cannot be fairly estimated, without considering the
                    difficulties of his position, the profligacy and corruption of the times in
                    which he lived, to which he boldly and honourably opposed himself, and comparing
                    his administration with the disgraceful epoch by Which it was succeeded. He was
                    upright and uncompromising, and neglectful of the arts of popularity, both
                    towards men of high and of humble station. His abilities were very great, but
                    consisted perhaps rather in quickness than in depth and comprehensiveness of
                    mind. He was ready and powerful as an orator, and prompt and able in the
                    despatch of business, of which, in spite of frequent illness, he bore by far the
                    greatest share during the period of his administration. In private life he was
                    unimpeachable. As a writer he will ever occupy a high place. His history, as
                    characterized by a distinguished modern historian, is “a monument of powerful
                    ability and impressive eloquence.” Its remarkable beauties are its masterly
                    delineation of celebrated characters, the occasional eloquence of its
                    descriptive passages, and the frequent interspersion of luminous reflections.
                    Its chief faults are diffuseness of style, and the want of accuracy and
                    arrangement. Its fidelity as a history cannot be upheld; a defect attributable
                    partly to the circumstance of his having trusted much to recollection in the
                    absence of requisite materials, partly to that desire to render it serviceable
                    to the cause of the royalists, with which he professed to have commenced it.</p>
                <p>His principal works are, his History of the Rebellion; A short View of the State
                    of Ireland; and The Life of Edward Earl of Clarendon, in which is included a
                    Continuation of his History of the Grand Rebellion. Of these three works, a
                    complete edition, containing the passages suppressed by former editors, was
                    published for the first time at Oxford in 1826. Brief View and Survey of the

                    of the most learned writers of the seventeenth century, was born at Billingsley,
                    near Bridgenorth, Shropshire, in 1636. He studied first at Cambridge, and
                    afterwards at Oxford. Before he was eighteen years of age, he was sent from
                    Cambridge to London to assist Mr Brian Walton in the great work of the Polyglott
                    Bible; and about the same period he undertook to transcribe the Pentateuch out
                    of the Hebrew characters, in which it was first printed at Constantinople, into
                    the proper Persian characters. After he had happily succeeded in this, he
                    assisted in correcting several parts of Mr Walton’s work, for which he was
                    perfectly qualified, “Nec praetereundus est D. Thomas Hyde,” says the editor,
                    “summae spei juvenis, qui in linguis orientalibus supra actatem magnos
                    progressus fecit, quorum specimina dedit tum in Arabibus, Syriacis, Persicis
                    corrigendo, tum in Pentateucho Persicocharacteribus Persicis describendo, quia
                    antea solis Hebraicis extitit, ejusque versionem Latinam concinnando.” He was
                    made archdeacon ofGloucester, canon of Christ-church, head keeper of the
                    Bodleian Library, and professor of Hebrew and Arabic in the university of
                    Oxford. He was interpreter and secretary of the oriental languages during the
                    reigns of Charles II. James II. and William III.; and he was perfectly qualified
                    to fill this post, as he could converse in all the languages which he
                    understood. There never was an Englishman in his situation of life who made so
                    great progress; but his mind was so engrossed by his beloved studies, that he is
                    said to have been but ill qualified to appear to any advantage in common
                    conversation. This distinguished orientalist died on the 18th of February 1702.
                    Of all his writings, the very catalogue of which is a curiosity, the most
                    celebrated is his <hi rend="italic">Religio Veterum Persarum,</hi> a work of
                    profound and various erudition, and abounding with many new lights and ingenious
                    conjectures concerning the theology, history, and learning of the eastern
                    nations. Amongst his other works may be mentioned, 1. A Latin translation of
                    Ulug Beig’s observations on the longitude and latitude of the fixed stars; and,
                    2. A Catalogue of the printed books in the Bodleian Library. Dr Gregory Sharpe,
                    master of the Temple, collected and republished some of Dr Hyde’s pieces
                    formerly printed, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Syntagma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertationum et Opuscula,</hi> in 2 vols. 4to, 1767; to which is
                    prefixed, a life of the author, containing a very judicious estimate of his
                    labours and acquisitions. At the time of his death, Dr Hyde had planned, and
                    partly prepared for the press, no less than thirty-one different works, some of
