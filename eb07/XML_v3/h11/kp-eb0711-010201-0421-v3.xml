                    rend="smallcaps">East Lothian,</hi> a county in Scotland, situated between 55°
                    47' and 56° 5' north latitude, and between 2° 25' and 3° 2' west longitude from
                    Greenwich. Its boundaries are the Frith of Forth and German Ocean on the north
                    and east, Berwickshire on the south, and Edinburghshire or Mid Lothian on the
                    west. From west to east its extreme length is about twenty-five miles, and its
                    greatest breadth from north to south seventeen; but from the irregularity of its
                    boundaries, the area is computed to be only 272 square miles, or 174,080 English
                    acres, of which about four fifths may be in tillage, or fit for cultivation, and
                    the remaining fifth, consisting of hills or moorish ground, in its natural
                    state, covered with heath and the coarser grasses. Of this last description is
                    the greater part of the Lammermuir Hills, which bound the county in a direction
                    from south-west to north-east, where they terminate in the bold promontory of St
                    Abb’s Head.</p>
                <p>From this range of hills on the south, Haddingtonshire appears, when viewed from
                    some commanding eminence at a distance, to slope gradually to the Frith of Forth
                    and the German Ocean; but, upon a nearer survey, the acclivity from the sea is
                    found to consist of nearly parallel ridges, running from west to east, most of
                    which commence near the western extremity of the county, and run throughout the
                    greater part of its length. At the termination of these ridges on the east,
                    there is a most fertile and extensive plain, which has the Lammermuir Hills on
                    the south, and North Berwick Law on the north. Some of the hills in the low
                    country, though of no great elevation, are very conspicuous objects, owing to
                    their rising suddenly from a flat surface, and being exposed to view on all
                    sides, surrounded by low grounds. North Berwick Law on the coast, 940 feet high,
                    Traprane Law, 700, and the Garleton Hills, almost in the centre, not only
                    themselves hold a prominent place in the landscape, but afford -from their
                    heights a view of some of the richest and most beautiful scenery in Britain. The
                    Lammermuir range on the south, which, when viewed from the Garleton Hills,
                    appear to rise in the form of a vast amphitheatre, as if to protect and shelter
                    the lower part of the county, present in their dark and rugged surface a
                    striking contrast with the highly cultivated plains below. Over these plains,
                    from the same station, the eye takes in the ports of Dunbar, North Berwick,
                    Prestonpans, and Cockenzie, with the Bass Rock, the Isle of May, and others on
                    the coast, and the shipping in the Frith of Forth; whilst nearer and all around
                    lies an extensive tract of the most fertile land in the island, covered, if seen
                    in a fine evening early in autumn, with rich crops of every hue, and studded
                    with habitations of great variety, from the princely mansion, indistinctly
                    traced through the variegated foliage of its woods, to the cottage of the
                    peasant, sending up its slender column of smoke in the rays of the setting
                    sun.</p>
                <p>Almost every variety of soil known in Britain is to be found here; but it appears
                    from the Agricultural Survey that clay and loam, nearly in equal proportions,
                    though <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640434" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0434-0103"/>each of
                    various qualities, extend over about two thirds of the county; yet a great deal
                    of both descriptions is not naturally very fertile, much of the clay, in
                    particular, being shallow, and incumbent on a wet bottom. Tracts of moorish soil
                    are also found interspersed among the lower grounds. The climate, though as
                    various as the soil, is, in an agricultural point of view, perhaps the best in
                    Scotland, especially for the growth of corn. In the eastern parts, very little
                    rain falls during the summer months, a circumstance to which is ascribed the
                    superior quality of the grain. Here also harvest commences ten days earlier than
                    upon the coast lands on the north, though on these last it is still earlier by
                    three weeks or <hi rend="italic">a</hi> month than upon the hills. In the
                    Lammermuir district, snow in some seasons covers the ground entirely for three
                    months, and lies on the north sides of the hills till after midsummer, though
                    they are only thirteen or fourteen miles from the gea, whilst upon the coast it
                    commonly dissolves as it falls. From December to May, the winds are chiefly from
                    the east and north; in summer, when the weather is dry, from the east; and in
                    autumn, from west to south and south-east, the last often accompanied with rain
                    and fogs. The north-west brings storms in winter; and from the game quarter, and
                    also from the south-west, come the high gales which are sometimes so injurious
                    in autumn.</p>
                <p>Haddingtonshire, though it has a number of streams, sufficient, perhaps, for the
                    common purposes of its population, possesses no lakes of any magnitude. There
                    is, however, a beautiful sheet of water at Pressmenon, in the midst of the most
                    beautiful scenery; and also Danskine Loch, which is of much less magnitude and
                    importance, unless for the great number of wild ducks which frequent its waters.
                    The Tyne is the largest river, but it is inconsiderable, and enjoys no internal
                    navigation nor fresh-water fishery. The Tyne, which springs from the Moor of
                    Middleton in Edinburghshire, enters this county on the west, near Ormiston, and
                    flowing nearly due east, passes Haddington, the county town, and falls into the
                    sea beyond Tyningham, the seat of the Earl of Haddington, after receiving
                    Coalstone and a few other rills from the south. Yet it has sometimes swelled to
                    a great height, and occasioned much damage. In 1775 the whole suburb of
                    Haddington called Nungate, and more than half the town, were laid under water. A
                    small stream called the Peffer crosses part of the county from east to west, in
                    a very level swampy district. In one part of its course so flat is the county,
                    that one part of the stream takes a westerly course, and empties itself into
                    Aberlady Bay, whilst another part takes an easterly direction, and discharges
                    itself into the sea about two miles north from the Tyne. A number of brooks and
                    rivulets take their rise amongst the Lammermuir Hills, and run in a south-east
                    direction. The most conspicuous of these are the Dye, the Fasney, the Whitadder,
                    Bothwell Water, and Moneynut Water.</p>
                <p>This county is not less fortunate in its mineral productions than in its soil and
                    climate. Coal, which has been wrought here since the beginning of the thirteenth
                    century, is found in great abundance in the western parts of it, from the
                    borders of Lammermuir to the sea; particularly in the parishes of Tranent,
                    Ormiston, Gladsmuir, and Pencaitland. Hardly any part of the district is distant
                    six miles from limestone; several extensive parishes rest;on a bed of this rock.
                    Marl is also found in different parts, though, since the use of lime became so
                    general, it is not raised to a great extent. ^Sandstone or freestone, which
                    prevails very generally throughout the county, is wrought, of an excellent
                    quality, near Barra, and in Pencaitland and Tranent. On the west side of the
                    harbour of Dunbar there is a remarkable promontory, resembling the Giant’s
                    Causeway in Ireland, composed of a red stone, apparently a very hard sandstone.
                    It runs out to the north about a hundred yards, and is twenty yards wide, having
                    the sea on each side on the flow of the tide. The diameter of its columns is
                    from one to two feet, and their length at low water thirty, inclining a little
                    to the south. Ironstone has been found in the parishes of Humbie, Keith,
                    Oldhamstocks, and Tranent; and mineral springs at several places, some of which
                    were once much resorted to, but are in little repute at present.</p>
                <p>Near the place where the Fasney joins the Whitad-der are to be found masses
                    ofgranite and other primitive rocks, which have afforded much scope for
                    geological speculation. At the termination of the granitic formation a seam of
                    copper has been discovered. Both in the high and low districts of the county,
                    the remains of numerous old encampments may be traced, and also ancient castles
                    and other places of defence or retreat. Amongst the Lammermuir Hills circles are
                    frequently to be seen formed of stones placed on end. It is a curious fact that
                    the number of these stones is either six or nine. Within their enclosure vessels
                    have occasionally heen found, which are supposed to be urns containing the ashes
                    of the dead.</p>
                <p>The county of Haddington was in 1811 divided into 183 estates, of which
                    twenty-three were above L.2000 Scots of valuation, fifty-two above L.500, and
                    133 below L.500. The valuation of the whole is L.168,873. IOs. 8d. Scots, of
                    which L.1305. 4s. 3d. belonged to corporations, and L.56,257.3s. to estates held
                    under entail. And in the same year the real rent of the lands, as returned under
                    the property-tax act, was L. 180,654. 5s. 9d. sterling, and of the houses,
                    L.6780. 15s. 2d. sterling. Thus the land-rent of the whole county, the
                    Lammermuir Hills included, was almost a guinea an acre. Since 1811 the rent of
                    land has in many instances been much reduced, and in general it has been
                    converted from money into grain, the quantity of which varies according to the
                    soil, situation, and other circumstances. At present the highest rent in the
                    county is about fifteen bushels three pecks of wheat per acre, calculated at the
                    second fiars, and the lowest is about four bushels, estimated at the same rate.
                    The nobility who have seats in the county are the Duke of Roxburgh, the Marquis
                    of Tweeddale, the Earls of Haddington, Wemyss, Hopetoun, Lauderdale, and
                    Dalhousie; the Lords Sinclair, Blantyre, and Elibank. Several other proprietors
                    have elegant mansions, which tend greatly to ornament the districts in which
                    they are situate.</p>
                <p>The farms are not generally what in some other parts of Britain would be called
                    large. Their average size may be from 300 to 500 English acres over the whole of
                    the arable land, but smaller on the best soils, and larger, perhaps, on the
                    inferior. On land of a medium quality, 300 acres are not considered as a small
                    farm. All the farms are held on leases, commonly for nineteen or twenty-one
                    years, which do not often contain any covenants that are not equitable and
                    liberal; except that here, as throughout the rest of Scotland, the tenant is
                    seldom allowed to sublet his farm or assign his lease, or even bequeath it by
                    testament, the heir-at-law succeeding to the farm as a matter of course, though
                    not to the stock or crop upon it. This arrangement has often been complained of
                    by both parties, though in few cases has it been set aside by mutual agreement.
                    The landlord, on the one hand, would wish to oblige the tenant to leave to his
                    heir-at-law a stock sufficient for the cultivation of the farm; and the tenant,
                    on the other, desires that he should be left at liberty to dispose of his lease,
                    and the capital he may have invested in the improvement of his farm, without any
                    other condition than that the possessor shall become bound to the landlord for
                    the performance of all the obligations he had himself come under.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is the chief employment of the people of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640447" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0447-0104"/>this district, which has long
                    been celebrated for yielding a greater produce and higher rents than perhaps any
                    other tract of corn land of the same extent in any part of Britain; whilst, at
                    the same time, the farmer and the labourer, each in his own condition, have long
                    maintained a high character for knowledge and industry; the one enjoying the
                    fair profits of bis skill and capital, and the other the reward of his useful
                    services, in a degree of independence and comfort which is perhaps far from
                    having been so general in other parts of the island. The principal object on the
                    low grounds, in many situations almost the exclusive object, is the growing of
                    com; the dryness of the climate being thought to be less favourable to grazing
                    and cattle crops. Latterly, however, grazing has been more generally practised,
                    from the land being exhausted by frequent cropping. The farmers have found this
                    a more profitable speculation, whilst at the same time it enriches the soil. The
                    general rule by which the course of cropping is regulated, is not to take two
                    crops of corn successively, but to interpose peas or beans, with cultivated
                    herbage, commonly rye-grass and clover, on the clays; and turnips, with the same
                    sort of herbage, on dry loams and sandy soils. On strong clays, a clean fallow
                    once in four, six, or eight years, is considered as indispensable. In a six
                    years’ course on clays, a third of the land is under wheat, which is almost
                    universally taken after the fallow, and also after the beans; the order being
                    fallow, wheat, herbage, oats, beans, and wheat. On inferior clays a fallow is
                    made every fourth year, and only a fourth of the land is usually under wheat. On
                    the best dry loams wheat, in a few instances, may be taken every second year, in
                    the order of turnips, wheat sown in winter and spring, herbage, and wheat. But
                    this severe course, if it be in any case profitable for a number of years, can
                    only be adopted in situations where more manure can be applied than is made from
                    the produce of the farm itself. As there are no towns of any size in the county,
                    and few or no considerable manufactories, an extra supply of manure could only
                    be procured from the lime-works, if it were not that much of the coast land is
                    plentifully supplied with sea-weed. This article, as well as lime, is therefore
                    used to a great and most beneficial extent, and affords a degree of facility in
                    the cultivating of corn, without deteriorating the soil, which does not exist in
                    many other districts. Bone dust is used to a great extent in raising turnips,
                    and is considered as the cheapest manure, particularly in inland districts, on
                    account of the cheapness of the carriage. Tile draining has now been substituted
                    for that effected by stones, and it has been found to answer remarkably well.
                    Spade husbandry, or trenching, has lately been partially introduced. On
                    well-managed soils, though not of the first quality, the produce may be about
                    thirty bushels of wheat, forty-eight of oats, forty of barley, twenty-seven of
                    beans, and from one and a half to two tons of hay at one cutting the English
                    acre.</p>
                <p>The farm-servants are, with very few exceptions, married; they live in cottages
                    on the farms, and for a long time were paid altogether, or nearly so, in
                    produce, each having a cow kept for him throughout the year. An attempt,
                    however, has been made to pay the servants with money alone; but this is not
                    likely to succeed, the plan being much opposed by the servants themselves. The
                    occasional labourers reside in the villages which are scattered over the county;
                    a much better situation for men who depend upon several employers, than if they
                    were set down on particular farms. By this arrangement, which is common to
                    several other parts of Scotland, the labouring classes in agriculture possess
                    all the advantages ascribed to cottage farms, without being exposed to those
                    evils which both theory and experience assure us that a general system of
                    cottage farms is calculated to produce.</p>
                <p>The breeding of live stock is almost confined to the Lammermuir district, which
                    is stocked chiefly with sheep of the Linton or black-faced breed. On the low
                    grounds, it is thought to be more profitable to buy the animals at a proper age
                    than to rear them; horses from the west of Scotland, cattle from the north, and
                    sheep from the hills of Tweeddale and Roxburghshire. Generally speaking, cattle
                    are kept only in such numbers as to convert the straw into manure, getting a few
                    turnips along with it, and are commonly sold in spring for the pastures of the
                    south; and, in summer, the clovers, excepting that part of them which is wanted
                    for hay, are fed off, as well as their turnips in winter, with sheep. The dairy
                    is nowhere an object of consideration beyond the supply of their own domestic
                    wants.</p>
                <p>Haddingtonshire has taken the lead in several important rural improvements. Lords
                    Belhaven and Haddington, early in the last century, wrote useful treatises on
                    husbandry and forests. In 1750 the first turnpike act for Scotland was obtained
                    for repairing the post-road through it. Wight, one of its farmers, who, like
                    Arthur Young, made tours for collecting agricultural information, contributed
                    much, by his publications, to improve the practices of this and other parts of
                    Scotland; and Meigle, an ingenious mechanic, first brought the thrashing-mill
                    into an effective state. Where water-power cannot be obtained, the steam-engine
                    has been introduced, and almost totally superseded the use of horses or
                    windmills. Some defects may be pointed out in the management of agricultural
                    ŕnatters; but as improvements are always being introduced, it is likely that the
                    former will soon disappear. The drill system, which is had recourse to in sowing
                    wheat, barley, and oats, is considered as a great improvement, since by this
                    means the soil is more effectually cleared of its annual growth of weeds. In the
                    neighbourhood of Dunbar there is a common consisting of about 4000 acres, which
                    seems condemned to perpetual sterility. It was formerly claimed by the burgesses
                    of Dunbar, but the right being disputed by the neighbouring proprietors, a
                    division took place, by which arrangement a very small part of it fell to the
                    share of the royal burgh.</p>
                <p>The principal towns in Haddingtonshire are, the county town of Haddington,
                    Dunbar, and North Berwick. In these places the principal manufactures are
                    carried on. See the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Haddington</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dunbar.</hi></p>
                <p>The villages are, Tranent, where there is a market for the sale of corn in bulk;
                    Prestonpans, noted for its salt-works and potteries, and formerly for an oyster
                    fishery; Ormiston <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Gladsmuir, Gifford, Saltoun,
                    Aberlady, Cockenzie, Linton Bridge, Dirleton, and a few others.</p>
                <p>The Bass, Craigleith, Fidra, Lamb, and Idris, are islets on the coast. The most
                    noted of these is the Bass, a rocĥ about a mile from the shore, a mile in
                    circuit, and inaccessible on all sides, except the south-west. It has a spring
                    of fresh water near the summit, affords pasture for a few sheep, and is
                    frequented by great numbers of solan-geese and other sea birds. The situation of
                    this small island occasioned its being at different times a military station, s
                    state prison, and a place of resort for pirates, down to so late a period as the
                    Revolution.</p>
                <p>Haddingtonshire has produced men of eminence in various departments, amongst whom
                    the names of Cockburn. Fletcher, Dalrymple, and several members of the Maitland
                    or Lauderdale family, are conspicuous. Dunbar, the poet, was born at Saltoun in
                    the year 1465; Burnet, the historian, was five years rector of the same parish.

                    Athelstaneford. George Heriot, the founder of the nobk hospital in Edinburgh
                    which bears his name, was born in the parish of Gladsmuir; and here Robertson

                    most extraordinary men whom any age or nation has produced, was born in the
                    suburbs of Haddington, in 1505. The house, the place of his birth, which, with a
                    few acres of land adjoining, belonged, till lately, to a family of his name, is
                    still pointed out to strangers. A very conspicuous monument to the memory of the
                    late Earl of Hopetoun has been erected on Garleton Hills, solely at the expense
                    of the tenants on the Hopetoun estate.</p>
                <p>There are twenty-four parishes in this county, of which twenty-three belong to
                    the presbyteries of Haddington and Dunbar, and one to the presbytery of
                    Dalkeith. These presbyteries constitute part of the synod of Lothian and
                    Tweeddale. The poor are for the most part relieved by voluntary contributions;
                    and where assessments have been found necessary, they have seldom exceeded two
                    and a half per cent, on the real rent, and this is paid in equal moieties by the
                    landlord and tenant. There is a charitable establishment for the education of
                    boys at Preston, which was founded by James Schaw, the proprietor of that
                    estate, who died in the year 1784; and another at Saltoun, for the same and
                    other objects, the work of Bishop Burnet, who in 1711 bequeathed 20,000 merks
                    for its support.</p>
                <p>The county of Haddington sends one member to parliament, and the three burghs of
                    Haddington, Dunbar, and North Berwick, join with Jedburgh and Lauder in electing
                    another. In 1755, the population, according to the returns made to Dr Webster,
                    was 29,709; and, in 1811, it was 31,164, being an increase of about four and a
                    half per cent, in a period of fifty-six years. The numbers given by the writers
                    of Sir John Sinclair’s <hi rend="italic">Statistical Account of Scotland</hi>
                    denote a decrease, between 1755 and the years 1790- 1797, of 743, the population
                    at the latter periods being only 28,966. We annex an abstract of the census
                    taken in 1811, 1821, and 1831. (See Somerville’s <hi rend="italic">Survey of
