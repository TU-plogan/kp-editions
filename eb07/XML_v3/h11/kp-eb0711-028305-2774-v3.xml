                <p><label type="entry">HERTFORD</label>, a town, the capital of the county of the
                    same name, twenty-one miles from London, on the river Lea. It is supposed to
                    have been a town as early as the time of the Britons. The Saxon kings held their
                    court at this place; and Alfred, to check the irruptions of the Danes,
                    constructed a castle, the remains of which are still to be seen. It is a
                    corporate town, governed by a mayor or high steward, a recorder, and nine
                    aidermen, and two members are returned to parliament. Christ Hospital in London
                    has here a branch of its establishment, in which 400 boys and sixty girls are
                    educated. There are two parish churches, and several places of worship for the
                    different dissenters from the establishment. The assizes and sessions being held
                    here, brings some trade to the town; and there is a good market on Saturday, at
                    which much corn, especially barley, is sold. The chief trade consists in
                    converting barley into malt for the great breweries in the metropolis. The
                    inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 3360, in 1811 to 3900, in 1821 to 4265, and in
                    1831 to 5247.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hertford College.</hi> The design of this institution is to
                    train up and qualify a race of youths, for filling in succession the various and
                    important offices of government in our Indian empire. “To dispense justice to
                    millions of people of various languages, manners, usages, and religions; to
                    administer avast and complicated system of revenue, through districts equal in
                    extent to some of the most considerable kingdoms in Europe; to maintain civil
                    order in one of the most populous and litigious regions in the world; these,”
                    says Marquis Wellesley, “are now the duties of the larger portion of the civil
                    servants of the Company. The <hi rend="italic">senior merchants,</hi> composing
                    the courts of circuit and appeal under the presidency of Bengal, exercise in
                    each of these courts a jurisdiction of greater local extent, applicable to a
                    larger population, and occupied in the determination of causes infinitely more
                    intricate and numerous, than that of any regularly constituted courts of justice
                    in Europe. The senior or junior merchants employed in the several magistracies
                    and courts, the writers or factors filling the stations of registrars, and
                    assistants to the several courts and magistrates, exercise, in different
                    degrees, functions of a nature purely judicial, or intimately connected with the
                    administration of the police, and with the maintenance of the peace and good
                    order of their respective districts.” The marquis points out, in the same strong
                    manner, the arduous duties of the several departments which the Europeans are
                    required to perform in India; and sums up by saying, “that the civil servants of
                    the East India Company can no longer be considered as the agents of a <hi
                    rend="italic">commercial concern</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> they are in fact
                    the ministers and officers of a <hi rend="italic">powerful</hi> sovereign; they
                    must be viewed in that capacity with a reference, not to their nominal, but to
                    their real occupations. They are required to discharge the functions of
                    magistrates, judges, ambassadors, and governors of provinces, in all the
                    complicated and extensive relations of those sacred trusts and exalted stations,
                    and under peculiar circumstances, which greatly enhance the solemnity of every
                    public obligation, and the difficulty of every public charge. Their duties are
                    those of statesmen in every other part of the world; with no other
                    characteristic differences than the obstacles opposed by an unfavourable
                    climate, a foreign language, the peculiar usages and laws of India, and the
                    manners of its inhabitants.”</p>
                <p>The system of education adopted holds a due medium between the strictness of our
                    public schoolsand the laxity of the English universities. Upon being appointed,
                    each youth must undergo an examination in Greek and Latin, and arithmetic,
                    before the principal professors. This previous examination at once prevents
                    persons from offering themselves who have not received the usual school
                    education of the higher classes of society; and those who offer themselves, and
                    are found deficient, are remanded till another period of admission. The lectures
                    of the different professors in the college are given in a manner to make
                    previous preparation necessary, and to encourage most effectually habits of
                    industry and application. In their substance they embrace the important subjects
                    of Classical Literature, the Oriental Languages, the elements of Mathematics and
                    Natural Philosophy, the Laws of England, General History, and Political
                    Economy.</p>
                <p>On all the important subjects above enumerated, examinations take place twice in
                    the year. These examinations are conducted upon the plan of the great public and
                    collegiate examinations in the universities, particularly of Cambridge, with
                    such improvements as experience has suggested. The questions given are framed
                    with a view to ascertain the degree of progress and actual proficiency in each
                    particular department on the subjects studied during the preceding term; and the
                    answers, in all cases which admit of it, are given in writing, in the presence
                    of the professors, and without the possibility of a reference to books. After
                    the examination in any particular department is concluded, the professor in that
                    department reviews, at his leisure, all the papers that he has received, and
                    places, as nearly as he can, each individual in the numerical order of his
                    relative merit, and in certain divisions implying his degree of positive merit.
                    These arrangements are all subject to the control of the whole collegiate body.
                    They require considerable time and attention, and they are executed with
                    scrupulous care and strict impartiality.</p>
                <p>The course of study continues two years, and commences at such an age that the
                    students may be qualified to proceed to India by the time they are eighteen or
                    nineteen years old; and having begun the study of the oriental languages, they
                    are prepared to prosecute them in Calcutta, so as to proceed to their official
                    appointments by the time they have attained the age of twenty or twenty-one.</p>
