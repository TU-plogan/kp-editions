                <p><label type="entry">HERBERT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mary</hi></label>, Countess of
                    Pembroke, was sister of Sir Philip Sidney, and wife of Henry, earl of Pembroke.
                    She was not only a lover of the muses, but a great encourager of polite
                    literature; a character which is not very common amongst titled ladies. Her
                    brother dedicated to her his <hi rend="italic">Arcadia.</hi> She translated a
                    dramatic piece from the French, entitled <hi rend="italic">Antonius,</hi> a
                    tragedy, though it is said that in this she was assisted by her chaplain, Dr
                    Babington, afterwards Bishop of Exeter. She also translated the Psalms of David
                    into English metre; but it is doubtful whether these works were ever printed.
                    This lady died in 1621; and an exalted character of her may be found in
                    Osborne’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of James I.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Herbert,</hi><hi rend="italic">Edward,</hi> Lord Herbert of Cherburyin
                    Shropshire, an eminent English writer, was born in 1581, and educated at Oxford,
                    after which he travelled, and at his return was made a knight of the bath. James
                    I. sent him as ambassador to Louis XIII. in behalf of the Protestants who were
                    besieged in several cities of France; and he continued in thi&amp;situation
                    until he was recalled, on account of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193642501"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-2501-0262"/>a dispute between him and the constable de Luines.
                    In 1625 he was advanced to the dignity of baron of the kingdom of Ireland, by
                    the title of Lord Herbert of Castle Island; and in 1631 to that of Lord Herbert
                    of Cherbury in Shropshire. After the breaking out of the civil wars, he adhered
                    to the parliament; and in 1644 obtained a pension, on account of his having been
                    plundered by the king’s forces. He wrote a History of the Life and Reign of
                    Henry V1H., a treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Veritate,</hi>
                    of considerable celebrity, and several other works. Lord Herbert died at London
                    in 1648. This nobleman, according to Granger, “stands in the first rank of the
                    public ministers, historians, and philosophers of his age. It is hard to say
                    whether his person, his understanding, or his courage, was the most
                    extraordinary; as the fair, the learned, and the brave held him in equal
                    admiration. But the same man was wise and capricious; redressed wrongs, and
                    quarrelled for punctilios; hated bigotry in religion, and was himself a bigot to
                    philosophy. He exposed himself to such dangers as other men of courage would
                    have carefully declined; and called in question the fundamentals of a religion
                    which none had the hardiness to dispute besides himself.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Herbert,</hi><hi rend="italic">William,</hi> Earl of
                    Pembroke, was born at Wilton, in Wiltshire, 1580, and admitted to New College,
                    Oxford, in 1592, where he continued about two years. In 1601 he succeeded to his
                    father’s honoursand estate, and was made a knight of the garter in 1604, and
                    governor of Portsmouth six years afterwards. In 1626 he was elected chancellor
                    of the university of Oxford, and about the same time made lord steward of the
                    king’s household. He died suddenly at his house in London on the 10th of April
                    1630, if we may credit Wood, according to the calculation of his nativity made
                    several years before by Mr Thomas Allen of Gloucester Hall. Concerning this
                    calculation, Clarendon relates, that some considerable persons connected with
                    Lord Pembroke having met at Maidenhead, one of them at supper drank a health to
                    the lord steward; upon which another said, that he believed his lordship was at
                    that time very merry, for he had now outlived the day which it had been
                    prognosticated from his nativity that he would not survive. The next morning,
                    however, they received the news of his death. Whether the noble historian really
                    believed this and other accounts relating to astrology, apparitions,
                    providential interpositions, and other marvels not dreamt of in philosophy,
                    which he has inserted in his history, we do not presume to say; he narrates
                    them, however, as if he did not actually disbelieve them. Lord Pembroke was not
                    only a great favourer of learned men, but was himself learned, and endowed with
                    a considerable share of poetical genius. All that are extant of his productions
                    in this way were published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Poems written by
                    William Earl of Pembroke.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Herbert,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sir Thomas,</hi> a gentleman of the Pembroke family, was born at
                    York, where his father was an aiderman. William, earl of Pembroke, sent him
                    abroad in 1626; and he spent four years in travelling through Asia and Africa.
                    In 1634 he published, in folio, a Relation of some Years’ Travel into Africa and
                    the Great Asia, especially the Territories of the Persian Monarchy, and some
                    parts of the Oriental Indies and Isles adjacent. On the breaking out of the
                    civil war, he adhered to the parliament; and at Oldenby, on the removal of the
                    king’s servants, by the desire of the parliamentary commissioners, he and James
                    Harrington were retained as grooms of the bedchamber, and attended the king even
                    to the block. At the Restoration he was created a baronet by Charles II. for his
                    faithful services to his father during the last two years of his life. In 1678
                    he wrote <hi rend="italic">Threnodia Carolina,</hi> containing an account of the
                    last two years of the life of Charles I.; and he assisted Sir William Dugdale in
                    compiling the third volume of his <hi rend="italic">Monastico Anglicanum.</hi>
                    He died at York in 1782, leaving several manuscripts to the public library at
                    Oxford, and others to that of the cathedral at York.</p>
