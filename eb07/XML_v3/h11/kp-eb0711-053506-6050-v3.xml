                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">HOMBERG, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated chemist, born at Batavia on the 8th of January 1652, was the son of a
                    Saxon gentleman employed in the service of the Dutch East India Company. His
                    father intended him for the army, but having afterwards settled at Amsterdam,
                    William prosecuted his studies at that place, whence he removed to Iena, and
                    afterwards to Leipsig, where he studied the law. In 1674 he was received as
                    advocate at Magdeburg, which had been indebted for a new species of celebrity to
                    the physical experiments of Otto Guericke, and there applied himself to the
                    study of experimental philosophy. Some time afterwards he travelled into Italy,
                    and at Padua applied himself to the study of medicine, anatomy, and botany. He
                    afterwards studied at Bologna; and at Rome he learned optics, painting,
                    sculpture, and music. He then travelled into France, England, and Holland; <pb

                    of doctor of physic at Wirtemberg; visited Germany and the North; explored the
                    mines of Saxony, Bohemia, Hungary, and Sweden; and returned to France, where he
                    acquired the esteem of the learned. He was on the point of returning into
                    Germany, when Colbert being informed of his merit, made him advantageous offers,
                    which induced him to fix his residence at Paris. But soon afterwards he lost his
                    protector, and also incurred the odium of returning into the bosom of the Roman
                    Catholic church; and this double misfortune was the more sensibly felt that he
                    had never dreamed of securing for himself any independent means of subsistence.
                    Homberg, already well known for his phosphorus, for a pneumatic machine of his
                    own invention more perfect than that of Guericke, for his microscopes, for his
                    discoveries in chemistry, and for the number and variety of his curious
                    observations, was received into the Academy of Sciences in 1691, and had
                    committed to him the laboratory of that body, of which he was one of the
                    principal ornaments. The Duke of Orleans, afterwards regent of the kingdom, at
                    length made him his chemist, settled upon him a pension, gave him a superb
                    laboratory, and in 1704 made him his first physician. Homberg, having lived for
                    thirty-three years in the Catholic faith, died in 1715. His principal works are,
                    1. Manière de faire le Phosphore brûlant de Kunckel, 1692; 2. Diverses
                    Expériences du Phosphore; 3. Réflexions sur l’expérience des Larmes de Verre qui
                    sebrisent dans le Vide; 4. Expériences sur la Germination des Plantes, 1693; 5.
                    Essais de Chimie, 1702, 1705, 1709; 6. Observations faites par le Miroir ardent,
                    1702; 7. Analyse du Soufre commun, 1703; 8. Découverte d’une liqueur qui dissout
                    le Verre, 1703; 9. Observations sur les Araignées, 1707; 10. Mémoires touchant
                    les Végétations artificielles, 1710; 11. Manière de copier sur le Verre coloré
                    les Pierres gravées, 1712; 12. Observations sur one séparation del’Or d’avec
                    l’Argent, par la fonte, 1713; 13. Tracts on different metallic vegetations, on
                    the generation of iron, and on the vitrification of gold. Homberg had occupied
                    himself much with metals, and was not far from believing in the philosopher’s
                    stone.</p>
