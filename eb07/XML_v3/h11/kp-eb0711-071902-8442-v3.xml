                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">HULL</label>, a sea-port town of the east riding of the
                    county of York, 234 miles from London byway of York, and 170 by way of Lincoln,
                    and crossing the Humber from Barton. It is situated on a river of the same name,
                    whose waters are received at the town into the Humber. The old part of the town,
                    with the exception of the fine market-place, is ill built, with narrow streets;
                    but that portion near the docks consists of handsome and commodious houses and
                    streets. It is admirably situated for trade, from being at the mouth of the
                    great rivers Humber, Ouse, and Trent, whose tributary streams, and the various
                    canals that branch from them, afford facilities for the conveyance of the
                    productions of a large space of country to Hull, and for receiving from it the
                    requisite articles of foreign growth. These advantages’ have been improved by
                    the activity of the inhabitants, who have constructed docks and warehouses,
                    which, for accessibility and security, are only inferior to those of London and
                    Liverpool. The building and equipment of ships is an important branch of
                    industry; and those built at Hull are considered as superior to those
                    constructed at the more northern ports. As there is a vast trade with Russia,
                    Prussia, Sweden, and Denmark, centring at Hull, the builders are enabled to
                    procure timber, iron, flax, hemp, and other articles for ship-building, on the
                    most favourable conditions. This is the port from which the greater number of
                    ships are despatched to the whale fishery on the coasts of Greenland. The owners
                    of ships in Hull do not confine themselves to the trade of their own port, but
                    charter them to all parts of the world, by the merchants of London, Liverpool,
                    and other mercantile places. A considerable direct trade is carried on with the
                    West India islands, with South America, the United States, the Mediterranean,
                    and the ports of Holland and Belgium. Though the ancient gates remain, there are
                    no land fortifications; but on the sea side the approach to the town is defended
                    by competent batteries. As Hull is situated in the fertile district of
                    Holderness, it is well supplied with necessaries from that part, as well as from
                    the Lincolnshire country, on the other side of the Humber. It is a county of
                    itself, with its own courts, sheriffs, and assizes; and a branch of the Trinity
                    House has the superintendence of the pilots and the lights.</p>
                <p>It is governed by a mayor and aidermen, and returns two members to parliament,
                    chosen by the resident freemen and householders, who amount to about 3800. The
                    town was formerly subject to inundations; but, by appropriate embankments and
                    drainage, that inconvenience is no longer felt. The population amounted in 1801
                    to 29,516, in 1811 to 26,792, in 1821 to 31,425, and in 1831 to 32,958. If to
                    this be added the inhabitants of Drypool, Sutton, and Sul-coates, which form
                    apart of the town, the whole population will be from 45,000 to 50,000.</p>
                <p>The gradual increase of the foreign trade of Hull may be seen by the following
                    account of the number of vessels which have entered from foreign parts in each
                    year from 1820 to 1833 both inclusive.</p>

                    1832, and 1833, will convey a tolerably accurate view of the nature of the whole
                    trade.</p>
