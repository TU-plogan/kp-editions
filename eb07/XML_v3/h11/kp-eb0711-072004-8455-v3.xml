                <p><label type="entry">HUME, <hi rend="smallcaps">David</hi></label>, an illustrious
                    philosopher and historian, was born in the south of Scotland, on the 26th of
                    April, old style, in the year 1711. His father was a descendant of the family of
                    the Earl of Home or Hume; and his mother, whose name was Falconer, was descended
                    from that of Lord Halkerton, whose title came by succession to her brother. This
                    double alliance with nobility was a source of great self-complacency to Hume,
                    who was not philosopher enough to despise such distinctions. But being the
                    younger son of a country gentleman of no great fortune, his patrimony was
                    consequently insufficient to support him. For this reason he was destined for
                    the bar, and passed through the usual course of academical study in the
                    University of Edinburgh; hut having conceived an early passion for letters, he
                    contracted an insurmountable aversion for any other pursuit; and whilst his
                    friends imagined that he was poring over Voet and Vinnius, he was secretly
                    occupied with Cicero and Virgil. His fortune, however, being small, and his
                    health somewhat affected by close application, he was induced to make a feeble
                    attempt at engaging in business; and in the year 1734, he went to Bristol, with
                    recommendations to some eminent merchants of that city. But the bustle and
                    activity of a mercantile city were by no means suited to his meditative
                    disposition; and, in a few months, he left it in disgust. Immediately after
                    this, he went over to France with the view of prosecuting his studies in
                    private, and established himself first at Rheims, and then at La Fleche in
                    Anjou, where, in order to maintain his independence, he practised the most rigid
                    frugality. The writings of Locke and Berkeley having directed the attention of
                    many learned men towards metaphysics, Mr Hume had early applied himself to
                    studies of this kind, and, during his retreat, composed his Treatise of Human
                    Nature, which he published at London in 1738. This work he had meditated even
                    while at college; a circumstance which proves at once the self-sufficiency of
                    Hume, and the early bias of his mind towards scepticism. He had the
                    mortification, however, to find his book generally neglected, and to perceive
                    that the taste for systematic writing was now upon the decline. “It fell,” he
                    says, “dead-born from the press, without reaching such distinction as even to
                    excite a murmur among the zealots.” He adds, however, that “being naturally of a
                    cheerful and sanguine temper, he soon recovered the blow.” But this pretended
                    equanimity was, we suspect, mere affectation. For the work, so far from passing
                    altogether without notice, was criticised with much ability in the only review
                    of that period, <hi rend="italic">The Works of the Learned;</hi> and the
                    critique has with some reason been ascribed to Warburton. One remark of the
                    reviewer is singular, and may be almost thought prophetic. “This work abounds
                    with ego <pb break="no" facs="nls:193648468" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8468-0721"
                    />tisms. The author would scarcely use that form of speech more frequently, if
                    he had written his own memoirs.”</p>
                <p>In 174'2, Mr Hume published, with more success, the first part of his Essays
                    moral, political, and literary. But these, though better received than his
                    former publication, contributed little to his reputation as an author, and still
                    less to his profit; and his small patrimony being now almost spent, he accepted
                    an invitation from the Marquis of Annandale to go and live with him in England.
                    With this nobleman he remained a twelvemonth, during which time his small
                    fortune was considerably increased. He then received an invitation from General
                    St Clair to attend him in the capacity of secretary to the expedition which was
                    at first meant against Canada, but afterwards ended in an incursion on the coast
                    of France. In 1747, he received an invitation from the general to attend him in
                    the same situation in his military embassy to the courts of Vienna and Turin. He
                    then wore the uniform of an officer, and was introduced at these courts as
                    aide-de-camp to the general, along with Sir Harry Erskine, and Captain,
                    afterwards General Grant. These two years were almost the only interruptions
                    which his studies experienced during the whole course of his life; but his
                    appointments made him some compensation on this account, for he was now “master
                    of near L.1000,” and, in his own opinion, “independent.” In 1749 he returned to
                    Scotland, and lived about two years with his brother at his country-house, where
                    he composed the second part of his essays, called Political Discourses. And now
                    the general approbation of his productions was indicated by a more extensive
                    sale than formerly, and likewise by the numerous answers published by different
                    persons in order to counteract their supposed pernicious tendency. In 1752 were
                    published at Edinburgh his Political Discourses, the only work of his which was
                    well received on its first appearance; and the same year at London, his Inquiry
                    concerning the Principles of Morals, which in his own opinion was incomparably
                    the best of all his works. This year also he was appointed librarian to the
                    Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh; but the principal advantage resulting from
                    this employment was, that he had thereby the command of a large library. He then
                    formed the design of writing the History of England; but deeming the whole to be
                    too extensive, he confined himself to the history of Britain under the house of
                    Stuart; and in 1754 published the first volume, entitled A Portion of English
                    History, from the Accession of James I. to the Revolution, in 4to. The book,
                    however, was almost universally decried on its first appearance, and soon
                    afterwards seemed to sink into oblivion. Dr Herring, primate of England, and Dr
                    Stone, primate of Ireland, were the only persons of the author’s acquaintance
                    who approved of the work, and sent him messages not to be discouraged.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding the approbation of these eminent men, Mr Hume’s spirits were
                    so much sunk by his want of success, that he had some thoughts of retiring to
                    France, changing his name, and bidding adieu to his own country for ever. This
                    design, however, was rendered impracticable by the breaking out of the war of
                    1755 between France and Britain. He then published his Natural History of
                    Religion, to which, soon after its appearance, an answer was published in the
                    name of Dr Hurd, bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, though, in reality, it
                    proceeded from Bishop Warburton, as Dr Hurd afterwards expressly declared. In
                    1756 was published the second volume of the History of the Stuarts. This was
                    better received, and helped to retrieve the character of the former volume.
                    Three years afterwards his History of the House of Tudor made its appearance,
                    and was almost as ill received as the History of the Stuarts had been, the reign
                    of Elizabeth being particularly obnoxious. The author, however, had now learned
                    to aespise popular clamour; and proceeded to finish at his leisure the more
                    early part of the English history, which was published in 1761, and received
                    with tolerable success.</p>
                <p>Mr Hume being now turned of fifty, and having obtained by the sale of his books a
                    competent fortune, retired into his native country of Scotland, determined never
                    more to set his foot out of it. From this resolution, however, he was diverted
                    by the Earl of Hertford, whom he attended as secretary in his embassy to Paris
                    in 1763. In 1765, the earl being appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, Mr Hume
                    was intrusted with the sole management of the business of the state till the
                    arrival of the Duke of Richmond towards the latter end of the year. In 1767, he
                    returned to Edinburgh, with a much larger income, procured for him by the Earl
                    of Hertford, than he formerly possessed; and now formed the same design he had
                    previously entertained, namely, of burying himself in his philosophical retreat.
                    In this, however, he was again disappointed, by receiving an invitation from
                    General Conway to become under secretary of state; and this invitation he was
                    prevented from declining, both by the character of the person, and his
                    connections with Lord Hertford. In 1769 he returned to Edinburgh, possessed of
                    L.1000 a year, healthy, and, though somewhat stricken in years, yet having a
                    prospect of long enjoying his ease, and of seeing the increase of his
                    reputation. Of his last illness and character he has himself given the following
                    account:—“In spring 1775 I was struck with a disorder in my bowels, which at
                    first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend it, become mortal and
                    incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy dissolution. I have suffered very little
                    pain from my disorder; and, what is more strange, have, notwithstanding the
                    great decline of my person, never suffered a moment’s abatement of my spirits;
                    insomuch that were I to name the period of my life which I should most choose to
                    pass over again, I might be tempted to point to this latter period. I possess
                    the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety in company. I consider,
                    besides, that a man of sixty-five, by dying, cuts off only a few years of
                    infirmities; and though I see many symptoms of my literary reputation breaking
                    out at last with additional lustre, I know that I could have but few years to
                    enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from life than I am at present. To
                    conclude, historically, with my own character, I am, or rather was (for that is
                    the style I must now use in speaking of myself, which emboldens me the more to
                    speak my sentiments)—I was, I say, a man of mild dispositions, of command of
                    temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour, capable of attachment, but
                    little susceptible of enmity, and of great moderation in all my passions. Even
                    my love of literary fame, my ruling passion, never soured my temper,
                    notwithstanding my frequent disappointments. My company was not unacceptable to
                    the young and careless, as well as to the studious and literary; and as I took
                    particular pleasure in the company of modest women, I had no reason to be
                    displeased with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though most men
                    anywise eminent have found reason to complain of calumny, I never was touched,
                    or even attacked, by her baleful tooth; and though I wantonly exposed myself to
                    the rage of both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed in my
                    behalf of their wonted fury. My friends never had occasion to vindicate any one
                    circumstance of my character and conduct; not but that the zealots, we may well
                    suppose, would have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my
                    disadvantage; but they could never find any which they thought would wear the
                    face of probability. I cannot say there is no vanity in making this funeral
                    oration of myself, but I hope it is not a misplaced one; and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193648481" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8481-0722"/>this is a matter of fact
                    which is easily cleared and ascertained.” His fears concerning the incurableness
                    of his disorder proved too true. He died on the 25th of August 1776, and was
                    interred in the Calton-hill burying-ground, Edinburgh, where a monument is
                    erected to his memory.</p>
                <p>Hume’s account of his own life is dated only four months previous to his decease;
                    and as he was then aavare that a recovery from the malady under which he
                    suffered was hopeless, if not impossible, it may be considered as the testimony
                    of a dying man respecting his own character, conduct, and opinions. But it
                    disappointed those who expected to find in it some acknowledgment of error in
                    speculation, and perhaps also some expressions of regret for the injury done to
                    many by the promulgation of doctrines calculated to unsettle their faith and
                    annihilate their hopes in religion. Hume, however, was not a man from whom any
                    thing of this sort could have reasonably been expected. Devoid of all sense of
                    religion in his own mind, and constitutionally disposed to call in question the
                    received opinions concerning it, he had, from a mere fondness for speculation,
                    mixed with a love of philosophical applause, laboured to extirpate from the
                    human mind all respect for the authority of revelation, or the obligations
                    imposed by it, and had even treated the disciples and advocates of Christianity
                    with a contempt bordering on detestation, “as if he had been revenging a
                    personal injury.” Having early imbibed the principles of a philosophy the direct
                    tendency of which was to unsettle all the foundations of belief, philosophical
                    and moral, as well as religious, and thus to undermine the best interests and
                    dissolve the firmest bonds of society, he went on doubting until he even doubted
                    whether he doubted, and at last became so entangled in the inextricable mazes of
                    scepticism, that all kinds of opinion or belief appeared to him involved in
                    nearly equal uncertainty. With a mind thus overclouded by its own speculation,
                    and a natural temper, in which quiet self-love was interwoven with perfect
                    equanimity, it is scarcely to be wondered that Hume, instead of being visited by
                    repentance or regret, should have terminated an otherwise irreproachable life
                    “in such a happy composure of mind that nothing could exceed it.” In short, he
                    died in the same state of mind in which he had lived, “believing nothing, and
                    fearing nothing and though, to men of different sentiments, there is something
                    sickening in the levity of his imaginary conversations with Charon, when in the
                    near prospect of eternity, yet this seems in no degree inconsistent with our
                    general conception of his character, and still less with the desire of rendering
                    his death a sort of triumph to philosophy, over what he and some at least of his
                    friends deemed superstition. In fact, he was at last surrounded by men who, from
                    congeniality of sentiments, contemplated his end with satisfaction; and it is by
                    no means improbable, that the same love of approbation for which he was
                    distinguished throughout life, should have contributed to give a peculiar
                    colouring to its close. But however this may have been, his social qualities,
                    his wit, his acuteness, his generosity, and, we may add, his fame, preserved to
                    him the regard of his learned countrymen, who forgot the sceptic in the
                    philosopher, and the infidel in the historian.</p>
                <p>It is indeed as an historian and a political writer that Hume will perhaps be
                    best known to posterity. Yet even in his capacity of historian he has many
                    faults. As slavish in politics as lie was daring in religion, he does not
                    scruple to disguise facts from party motives; and he seldom omits an occasion to
                    sneer at Christianity under the name of fanaticism or superstition. The
                    inexpressible charm of his style has been universally felt and acknowledged; but
                    this is at best only a poor compensation for that negligence which prevents an
                    historian from discovering the truth, or that prejudice which leads him to
                    misrepresent it. Hume, we fear, sinned in both ways; and his reputation has
                    suffered in consequence. His errors have been detected, his misrepresentations
                    exposed, and his unjust aspersions refuted, often by the very authorities which
                    he professed to have consulted. But his political and historical disquisitions
                    display throughout an acuteness, penetration, and comprehensiveness which no
                    writer of modern times has approached, and which, notwithstanding all the
                    defects we have alluded to, will secure to him a rank permanently high in the
                    literature of his country. In his political essays, he anticipated many truths,
                    which it has required more than half a century adequately to unfold and
                    illustrate.</p>
                <p>Of the character of Hume as a speculative philosopher the reader will find the
                    most able and exact appreciation in the First and Second Dissertations prefixed
                    to the present work. That he w$s profound, far-sighted, and even original, in as
                    far at least as originality consists in discovering consequences which had
                    escaped the penetration of others, has been admitted even by his opponents; nor
                    can it be doubted that intellectual philosophy has benefited by the rare
                    sagacity with which he traced some of the prevailing systems to their necessary
                    consequences, and thus showed how dangerous it is to form theories on a subject
                    where the sphere of observation is extremely confined, and direct experiment is
                    in a great measure impracticable.</p>
                <p>Few books have been so often reprinted as Hume’s History, and none has ever
                    experienced greater injustice, than by being united, in the same form, with
                    Smollett’s Continuation. The best and most complete edition of his philosophical
                    works, is that which was published at Edinburgh, 1826, in four vols. 8vo,
                    including all the essays, and exhibiting the more important alterations and
                    corrections in the successive editions published by the author. In this edition,
                    which was superintended by Mr David Constable, the essays are reprinted from
                    that of 1777, corrected by the author for the press a short time before his
                    death, and which he desired to be regarded as containing his philosophical
                    principles; whilst the essays contained in the early editions, but which were
                    omitted in that of 1777, are annexed to the fourth volume, together with two
                    essays, the one on Suicide, and the other on the Immortality of the Soul. In
                    addition to the author’s Life, written by himself, the account of his
                    controversy with Rousseau, originally printed in French, and shortly afterwards
                    (in 1766) in English, is also prefixed. The English translation was
                    superintended by Mr Hume himself; and as it relates to an extraordinary
                    occurrence in the lives of these eminent persons, it has justly been thought a
                    suitable appendage to the short memoir which Mr Hume left of his own life.</p>
