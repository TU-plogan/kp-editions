                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">GETAE</label>, the same people who were known to the Romans
                    under the name of Dacians. They were originally a Thracian tribe, occupying the
                    country between Mount Hasmus, the lofty ridge of the Balkan, and the lower part
                    of the river Danube, and distinguished from the rest of their countrymen neither
                    in language nor in manners. Here Herodotus seems to have known them probably
                    from personal observation (iv.93), and Thucydides speaks of them as occupying
                    the same position (ii. 96). It was not till Philip of Macedon and his successors
                    proceeded to extend their conquests over the Thracian tribes, that we hear of
                    the Getae changing their abode. When Alexander (about 333 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b. c.)</hi> made an expedition into their country, he found them on the north
                    side of the Danube, but we have no means of ascertaining whether they still
                    retained their possessions to the south. His successor Lysimachus was
                    not∙equally successful in his war with the Getae. Having been taken prisoner by
                    their king, he was asked to observe the poverty of the nation, and at the same
                    time advised not to make war upon a people whose wants were so few and so easily
                    supplied. He was afterwards allowed to depart in safety. (Diod. Sic. <hi
                    rend="italic">Fragm.</hi> xxi.; Memnon, ap. Phot. cod. 214, c. 6.) In the reign
                    of Perseus, last king of Macedon (170 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.),</hi> we find
                    the eastern bank of the Danube in possession of the Bastarnae, a Teutonic
                    people, who must have expelled the Getae, and gave occasion to the appellation
                    of <hi rend="italic">Deserta Getarum,</hi> by which it was first known to the
                    Romans. The Getae seem to have travelled westwards, and settled in Transylvania,
                    spreading themselves over Hungary. Here their power increased so much under one
                    of their kings, Bocribistas, that it became formidable even to the Romans; they
                    pillaged Thrace, and reduced the country of the Boii to a desert. At this time
                    they were in possession of part of the country to the south of the Danube, a
                    part of Servia and Bulgaria, where we find them attacked by the Romans (Justin.
                    xxv. 1.; Flor. iii. 4). At last Augustus determined to subdue them, and he found
                    the attempt less difficult than he had expected, for Bocribistas was dead, and
                    his kingdom divided into several parts. The Roman generals compelled the Getae
                    partly to submit, and partly to withdraw to the north of the Danube. Moesia was
                    erected into a province, the banks of the river were studded with fortresses,
                    and the kingdom of the Getae to the south was put an end to for ever. (Strab.
                    vii. 304, 305.) During the whole of the first century of the Christian era, the
                    Getae continued to make incursions from their mountains into the Roman
                    territory, but it was not till the reign of Domitian that they became truly
                    formidable. They were then under the command of Decebalus, who directed their
                    proceedings with so much prudence and vigour, that the emperor found himself
                    obliged to conclude with them a disgraceful treaty. The succession of Trajan to
                    the empire, and his well-known experience and wisdom, induced Decebalus to lower
                    his tone; but it was too late, for Trajan was determined to relieve the Romans
                    from all danger in this quarter. Trajan crossed the Danube with a formidable
                    army; and Decebalus, after several unsuccessful battles, found himself obliged
                    either to submit or to put an end to his life. The latter alternative he chose
                    as the more honourable, and his subjects submitted to the conqueror. His kingdom
                    was erected into the province of Dacia, the only one which ever existed to the
                    north of the Danube; and as the land was nearly without inhabitants, Trajan
                    transferred to it many from other parts of the empire, and the province became
                    Roman not only in manners, but even in language (Dion. Cass. Ixviii. 14; Eutrop.
                    viii. 2, 6). The Romans were not allowed to remain quietly in possession of this
                    country, but they continued to maintain their footing until the reign of
                    Aurelian <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 271), who, convinced of the
                    impossibility of resisting the encroachments of the Goths without some better
                    protected frontier than Dacia presented, determined to withdraw the Roman
                    inhabitants to the south side of the Danube. The greater number followed his
                    advice, and were placed in the country between Upper and Lower Moesia, in the
                    present district of Servia and Bulgaria, which was then called Dacia Ripensis
                    (Eutrop. ix. 15; Vopisc. in Aurel, c. 39). The name of Dacian or Getan was no
                    longer heard of; but a considerable number of the people still remained,
                    preserving their ancient customs and the Latin language. There seems indeed to
                    be little doubt that the present inhabitants of Wallachia are descendants from
                    this people, as it is difficult otherwise to account for their language so
                    closely resembling the ancient Latin. (See a discussion on this subject in
                    Thunmann’s Untersuchungen über die Geschichte der östlich Europ. Volker, Leips.
                    1774.)</p>
