                    mathematician and antiquary, was the eldest son of John Greaves, rector of
                    Cole-more, near Alresford in Hampshire, and born in 1602. He was educated at
                    Baliol College, Oxford, from which he removed to Merton. He was afterwards, on
                    the ground of merit, chosen professor of geometry in Gresham College. His ardent
                    thirst of knowledge soon led him to visit several parts of Europe, where he
                    eagerly availed himself of every opportunity to improve it. His travels were
                    next into the countries of the East, where nothing remarkable seems to have
                    escaped his observation. With indefatigable industry, and even at the peril of
                    his life, he collected for Archbishop Laud a considerable number of Arabic,
                    Persic, and Greek manuscripts, of which he well knew the value, as he was a
                    master of the languages in which they were written. He also collected for that
                    prelate many oriental gems and coins. He made a more accurate survey of the
                    pyramids of Egypt than any traveller who had preceded him, and afterwards
                    digested his observations in a work on that subject. On his return from the
                    East, he visited a second time several parts of Italy; and during his stay at
                    Rome instituted inquiries into the ancient weights and measures. Soon after his
                    return he was appointed to the Savilian professorship of astronomy at Oxford; an
                    office for which he was eminently qualified, as the works of the ancient and
                    modern astronomers were alike familiar to him. But, after enjoying this
                    preferment for some time, Greaves was deprived of it by the parliamentary
                    visitors, on account of his strong royalist predilections, and died on the 8th
                    of October 1652, of a fatal disorder, which appears to have been brought on by
                    excessive application. Besides his papers in the Philosophical Transactions, the
                    works of Greaves printed separately are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Pyramidologia,</hi> or a description of the Pyramids in Egypt, London, 1646, in
                    8vo; 2. A Discourse of the Roman Foot and Denarius, ibid. 1649, in 4to; 3.
                    Elementa Linguae Per-sicae, ibid. 1649, in 4to; 4. Epoch« celebriores
                    Astronomie, Historicis, Chronologie Chataiorum, Syro-Graecorum, Arabum,

                    Persae, una cum hypothesibus Planetarum, ibid. 1652, in 4to. In 1737, Dr Birch
                    published the Miscellaneous Works of Greaves, in two vols. 8vo, containing some
                    of those above mentioned, with additions, and a biographical notice of the
                    author.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193523327" xml:id="kp-eb0710-3327-0720"/></div></body></text></TEI>
