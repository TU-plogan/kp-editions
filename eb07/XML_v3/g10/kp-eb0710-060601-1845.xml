                    ornaments, in gold and silver.</p><p>The goldsmith’s work is either performed in the mould, or beat out with the
                    hammer or other instrument. All works which have raised figures are cast in a
                    mould, and afterwards polished and finished; plates or dishes of silver or gold
                    are beaten out from thin flat plates; and tankards, and other vessels of the
                    kind, are formed of plates soldered together, their mouldings being beaten put,
                    not cast The business of the goldsmiths formerly required much more labour than
                    it does at present; for they were then obliged to hammer the metal from the
                    ingot to the thinness they wanted; but the flattening mills which have been
                    latterly invented reduce metals to the thinness required, at a very moderate
                    expense. The goldsmith makes his own moulds, and, for that reason, should be a
                    good designer, and have a taste in sculpture; he ought also to know enough of
                    metallurgy to be able to assay mixed metals, and to mix the alloy.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Goldsmith,</hi><hi rend="italic">Oliver,</hi> an eminent
                    English poet and general writer, was born on the 29th of November 1728, at a
                    place called Pallas, in the parish of Forney and county of Longford, in Ireland.
                    His father, the Reverend Charles Goldsmith, was a clergyman of the established
                    church, who had been educated at Dublin, and afterwards held the living of
                    Kilkenny West, in the county of Westmeath. By his wife, Anne, daughter of the
                    Reverend Mr Jones, master of the diocesan school of Elphin, he had five sons and
                    two daughters. His eldest son Henry entered the church, and to him the Traveller
                    is dedicated; the second was Oli- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521858" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1858-0607"/>ver, who is
                    supposed to have faithfully represented his father in the character of the
                    village preacher in the poem of the Deserted Village. Oliver was originally
                    intended for some mercantile employment, and with this view he was instructed in
                    reading, writing, and arithmetic, at a common school; but, as he had shown an
                    early predilection for poetry, and betrayed some inequalities of temper and
                    conduct which seemed to indicate a disposition more favourable to the pursuits
                    of genius than the regularity of business, he was put to a school of reputation
                    to qualify him for entering the university with the advantage of suitable
                    preparation. In June 1744, being then in his fifteenth year, he was entered as a
                    sizer at Trinity College, Dublin; and in this seminary he continued a few years,
                    when he took a bachelor’s degree; but his brother not being able to obtain any
                    preferment after he left the college, Oliver, by the advice of a relation,
                    turned his thoughts to the study of physic; and, after attending some courses of
                    anatomy in Dublin, proceeded, in the year 1752, to Edinburgh, where he studied
                    the several branches of medicine under the different professors in that
                    university. But his thoughtless disposition soon involved him in difficulties;
                    and he was obliged to leave Scotland precipitately, in consequence of engaging
                    to pay a considerable sum of money for a fellow student. A few days afterwards,
                    about the beginning of the year 1754⅛ he arrived at Sunderland, near Newcastle,
                    where he was arrested at the suit of a tailor in Edinburgh, to whom he had given
                    security for his friend. But by the good offices of Mr Laughlan Maclane and Dr
                    Sleigh, he was soon delivered out of the hands of the bailiff, and took his
                    passage on board a Dutch ship to Rotterdam, where, after a short stay, he
                    proceeded to Brussels. He then visited the greater part of Flanders; and, after
                    passing some time at Strasburg and Louvain, where he obtained the degree of
                    bachelor of physic, he accompanied an English gentleman to Berne and Geneva, in
                    Switzerland.</p><p>It is undoubted that this ingenious but unfortunate person travelled on foot
                    during the greater part of his tour. He had left England with very little money;
                    and being of a philosophical turn, and at that time possessing a body capable of
                    sustaining every fatigue, and a heart not easily appalled at danger, he became
                    an enthusiast in the design he had formed of seeing the manners of different
                    countries. He had some knowledge of the French language and of music, and he
                    played tolerably well on the German flute; which, from an amusement, became at
                    some times his only means of subsistence. His learning produced him a hospitable
                    reception at most of the religious houses; and his music made him welcome to the
                    peasants of Flanders and other parts of Germany. “Whenever <hi rend="italic">I</hi> approached a peasant’s house towards night-fell,” said he, “I played one
                    of my most merry tunes, and that procured me not only a lodging, but subsistence
                    for the next day; but in truth I must own, whenever I attempted to entertain
                    persons of a higher rank, they always thought my performance odious, and never
                    made me any return for my endeavours to please them.”</p><p>On Goldsmith s arrivai at Geneva, he was recommended as a proper person for a
                    travelling tutor to a young man who had been unexpectedly left a considerable
                    sum of money by his uncle, formerlyan eminent <hi rend="subscript"> pa</hi>
                    wnbroker near Holborn. Inis youth, who had been articled to an attorney,
                    determined, on receipt of his fortune, to see the world; and, on his engaging
                    with his preceptor, made a provision that he should be permitted to govern
                    himself; but Goldsmith soon found his pupil understood extremely well the art of
                    managing his money concerns, avarice being, in fact, his ruling passion. His
                    questions were usually how money might be saved, which was the least expensive
                    course of travelling, and whether any thing could be bought that would turn to
                    account when disposed of again in London. Such curiosities on the way as could
                    be seen for nothing he was ready enough to look at; but if the sight of them
                    required to be paid for, he usually asserted that he had been told they were not
                    worth seeing. A companion of this turn could not be much to Goldsmith’s taste,
                    and in truth must have been intolerable to any one. During his continuance in
                    Switzerland he assiduously cultivated his poetical talent, of which he had given
                    some proofs even whilst at Edinburgh. It was from this country that he sent the
                    first sketch of his poem called the Traveller to his brother the clergyman in
                    Ireland, who, giving up fame and fortune, had retired with an amiable wife, to
                    happiness and obscurity, on an income of only L.40 a year. From Geneva Mr
                    Goldsmith and his pupil visited the south of France, where the young man, upon
                    some disagreement with his preceptor, paid him the small part of his salary
                    which was due, and embarked at Marseilles for England. Our wanderer was thus
                    left once more at large in the wide world, and passed through a variety of
                    difficulties in traversing the greater part of France. At length his curiosity
                    being satiated, he bent his course towards England, and arrived at Dover in the
                    year 1756.</p><p>When he reached London, his stock of cash did not amount to a couple of
                    shillings; and being an entire stranger in the metropolis, his mind was filled
                    with the most gloomy reflections on his embarrassed situation. With some
                    difficulty he discovered the part of the town in which his old acquaintance Dr
                    Sleigh resided. This gentleman received him with the warmest affection, and
                    liberally invited him to share his purse until some establishment could be
                    procured for him. Unwilling, however, to be a burden to his friend, Goldsmith, a
                    short time afterwards, embraced an offer which was made him to assist Dr Milner
                    in instructing young gentlemen at an academy at Peckham; and for a short time he
                    acquitted himself greatly to the doctor’s satisfaction. But having obtained some
                    reputation by some criticisms he had written in the Monthly Review, Mr Griffith,
                    the proprietor, engaged him in the compilation of that work; and, resolving to
                    pursue the profession of writing, he returned to London, as the mart where
                    abilities of every kind were sure to meet distinction and reward. As his
                    finances were by no means in a good state, he determined to adopt a plan of the
                    strictest economy, and took lodgings in an obscure court in the Old Bailey,
                    where he wrote several ingenious little pieces. Mr Newberry, who was at that
                    time a great encourager of men of literary abilities, became a patron of our
                    author, and introduced him as a writer in the Public Ledger, in which his
                    Citizen of the World originally appeared, under the title of Chinese
                    Letters.</p><p>Fortune now seemed to bestow some notice on a man whom she had long neglected.
                    The simplicity of his character, the integrity of bis heart, and the merit of
                    his productions, made his company acceptable to a number of respectable
                    families; and he emerged from his shabby apartments in the Old Bailey to the
                    politer air of the Temple, where he took handsome chambers, and lived in a
                    genteel style. The publication of his Traveller, and his Vicar of Wakefield, was
                    followed by the performance of his comedy of the Good-Natured Man at Covent
                    Garden Theatre; a production which placed him in the first rank of the poets of
                    the age.</p><p>Amongst many persons of distinction who were desirous to know him was the Duke of
                    Northumberland; and the circumstance which attended his introduction to that
                    nobleman is worthy of being related, as showing a striking trait of his
                    character. “I was invited,” said the doctor, as he was then universally called,
                    “by my friend Mr Percy, to wait upon the duke, in consequence of the
                    satisfaction he had received from the perusal of one of my <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521871" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1871-0608"/>. productions.
                    I dressed myself in the best manner I could, and, after studying some
                    compliments I thought necessary on such an occasion, proceeded to Northumberland
                    House, and acquainted the servants that I had particular business with his
                    grace. They showed me into an antichamber; where, after waiting some time, a
                    gentleman very genteelly dressed made his appearance. Taking him for the duke, I
                    delivered all the fine things I had composed in order to compliment him on the
                    honour he had done me; when, to my great astonishment, he told me I had mistaken
                    him for his master, who would see me immediately. At that instant the duke came
                    into the apartment, and I was so confused on the occasion, that I wanted words
                    barely sufficient to express the sense I entertained of the duke’s politeness,
                    and went away extremely chagrined at the blunder I had committed.” Absence,
                    simplicity, credulity, and entire ignorance of the world, appear to have formed
                    the principal elements in the character of this amiable but somewhat eccentric
                    man of genius. He was indeed “in wit a man, simplicity a child.”</p><p>Previously to the publication of his Deserted Village, the bookseller had given
                    him a note for a hundred guineas for the copyright, which the doctor mentioned a
                    few hours afterwards to one of his friends, who observed, it was a very great
                    sum for so short a performance. “In truth,” replied Goldsmith, “I think so too;
                    I have not been easy since I received it, therefore I will go back and return
                    him his note.” This he absolutely did, and left it entirely to the bookseller to
                    pay him according to the profits produced by the sale of the piece, which,
                    however, proved to be very considerable.</p><p>During the last rehearsal of his comedy entitled She Stoops to Conquer, which
                    Coleman had no opinion would succeed, on the doctor’s objecting to the
                    repetition of one of Tony Lumpkin’s speeches, being apprehensive it might injure
                    the play, the manager with great keenness replied, “Psha, my dear doctor, do not
                    be fearful of squibs, when we have been sitting almost these two hours upon a
                    barrel of gunpowder.” The piece, however, contrary to Coleman’s expectation, was
                    received with uncommon applause by the audience; and Goldsmith’s pride was so
                    much hurt by the severity of this observation, that it entirely put an end to
                    his friendship for Coleman.</p><p>Notwithstanding the great success of his pieces, by some of which, it has been
                    asserted on good authority, he cleared L.1800 in one year, his circumstances
                    were by no means in a prosperous condition. This was partly owing to the
                    liberality of his disposition, and partly to an unfortunate habit he had
                    contracted of gaming, the arts of which he knew very little of, and consequently
                    became the prey of those who were unprincipled enough to take advantage of his
                    simplicity.</p><p>Just before his death he had formed a design of executing an Universal Dictionary
                    of Arts and Sciences, the prospectus of which he actually published. In this
                    work several of his literary friends, particularly Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr
                    Johnson, Mr Beauclerc, and Mr Garrick, had undertaken to furnish him with
                    articles upon different subjects; and he entertained the most sanguine
                    expectations of its success. The undertaking, however, did not meet with that
                    encouragement from the booksellers which he had imagined it would undoubtedly
                    receiye; and he used to lament this circumstance almost to the last hour of his
                    existence.</p><p>He had been for some years afflicted, at different times, with a violent
                    strangury, which contributed not a little to embitter the latter part of his
                    life; and which, united with the vexations he suffered on other accounts,
                    brought on a kind of habitual despondency. In this unhappy condition he was
                    attacked by a nervous fever, which, being improperly treated, terminated his
                    existence on the 4th of April 1774, at the age of forty-five.</p><p>The learned leisure which he loved to enjoy was too often interrupted by
                    distresses which arose from the liberality of his temper, and which sometimes
                    threw him into loud fits of passion. But this impetuosity was corrected upon a
                    moment’s reflection; and his servants have been known upon these occasions
                    purposely to throw themselves in his way, that they might profit by it
                    immediately afterwards; for he who had the good fortune to be reproved was
                    certain of being rewarded for it. The universal esteem in which his poems were
                    held, and the never-failing pleasure which they afford in the perusal, are
                    striking proofs of their merit. He was a studious and correct observer of
                    nature; happy in the selection of his images, the choice of his subjects, and
                    the harmony of his versification; and though his embarrassed situation prevented
                    him from putting the last hand to many of his productions, his Hermit, his
                    Traveller, and his Deserted Village, bid fair to retain their place amongst the
                    most finished pieces in the English language.</p><p>Besides the works already mentioned, he wrote, 1. History of the Earth and
                    Animated Nature, in 6 vols. 8vo; 2. History of England, in 4 vols. 8vo; 3.
                    History of Rome, in 2 vols.; and, 4. Abridgments of the two last, for the use of
                    schools. Goldsmith’s Miscellaneous Works were collected and published by Bishop
                    Percy, who prefixed to his edition a valuable and interesting life of the
                    author.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
