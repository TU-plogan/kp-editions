                <p>On some medals of the emperors John and Manuel Comneni may be seen the figure of
                    St George armed, holding a sword or javelin in one hand, and in the other a
                    buckler, with this inscription, an O, containing therein A, and</p>

                <p>George. He is generally represented on horseback, being supposed to have
                    frequently engaged in combat in that manner. He is highly venerated throughout
                    Armenia, Muscovy, and all the countries which adhere to the Greek ritual; from
                    the Greek his worship has long ago been received into that of the Latin church;
                    and England and Portugal have both chosen him as their patron saint.</p>
                <p>Great difficulties have been raised about this saint or hero, whose very
                    existence has been called in question. Dr Heylin, who wrote most largely
                    concerning him, concluded<pb break="no" facs="nls:193520051"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-0051-0468"/> by giving him up entirely, and supposing him only
                    a symbolical device; whilst Dr Pettingal turned him into a mere Basilidian
                    symbol of victory. But Mr Pegg, in a paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archoeologia,</hi> attempted to restore the hero; and, finally, Mr Gibbon sunk
                    him into an Arian bishop in the reigns of Constantius and Julian.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi><hi rend="italic">the Cappadocian</hi> was so
                    surnamed, according to some, from his parents or education, and was born at
                    Epiphania, in Cilicia, in a fuller’s shop. From this obscure and servile origin
                    he raised himself by the talents of a parasite; and the patrons whom he had
                    assiduously flattered procured for their worthless dependent a lucrative
                    commission or contract to supply the army with bacon. His employment was mean,
                    and he rendered it infamous. He accumulated wealth by the basest arts of fraud
                    and corruption; but his malversations were so notorious that he was at length
                    compelled to escape from the pursuit of justice. After this disgrace, in which
                    he appears to have saved his fortune at the expense of his character, he
                    embraced, with real or affected zeal, the profession of Arianism. From the love
                    or the ostentation of learning, he collected a valuable library of history,
                    rhetoric, philosophy, and theology; and the choice of the prevailing faction
                    promoted George of Cappadocia to the throne of Athanasius. His conduct in this
                    station is represented by historians as polluted by cruelty and avarice, and his
                    death is considered as a just punishment for the enormities of his life, amongst
                    which Mr Gibbon seems to rank his enmity to the gods.</p>
                <p>The immediate occasion of his death, however, as narrated by ecclesiastical
                    writers, does not appear calculated to add any stain to his memory. There was in
                    the city of Alexandria a place in which the heathen priests had been accustomed
                    to offer human sacrifices. This place, as being of no use, Constantius gave to
                    the church of Alexandria, and George the bishop issued orders that it should be
                    cleared in order to build a Christian church on the spot. In doing this they
                    discovered an immense subterranean cavern, in which the heathen mysteries had
                    been performed, and where there were many human skulls. These, and other things
                    which they found in the place, the Christians brought out and exposed to public
                    ridicule. Provoked at this exhibition, the heathens suddenly took arms, and
                    rushing upon the Christians, killed many of them with swords, clubs, and stones;
                    some also they strangled, and several they crucified. The Christians, therefore,
                    proceeded no farther in clearing the temple; but the heathens, pursuing their
                    advantage, seized the bishop whilst he was in the church, and threw him into
                    prison. The next day they dispatched him; and then fastening,the body to a
                    camel, they dragged it about the streets all day, and in the evening burned the
                    corpse and the camel together. This fate, according to Sozomen, the bishop owed
                    in part to his haughtiness whilst in favour with Constantius; and some think
                    that the friends of Athanasius were concerned in this murder; but the former
                    ascribes it chiefly to the inveteracy of the heathens, whose superstitions he
                    had been active in abolishing.</p>
                <p>This George, the Arian bishop of Alexandria, was a man of letters, and had a
                    valuable library, which Julian ordained to be seized for his own use. In his
                    orders concerning the collection, he says that many of the books were on
                    philosophical and rhetorical subjects, though many of them related to the
                    doctrine of the impious Galileans, as he affected to call the Christians. “These
                    books,” says he, “I could wish to have utterly destroyed; but lest books of
                    value should be destroyed along with them, let those also be carefully sought
                    for.”</p>
                <p>But Mr Gibbon gives a different version of the affair of Georges murder, winch he
                    relates with different circumstances. “The Pagans," says he, “excited his devout
                    avarice; and the rich temples of Alexandria were either pillaged or insulted by
                    the haughty prelate, who exclaimed, in a loud and threatening tone, ‘ How long
                    will these sepulchres be permitted to stand ?' Under the reign of Constantius,
                    he was expelled by the fury, or rather by the justice, of the people; and it was
                    not without a violent struggle that the civil and military powers of the state
                    could restore his authority, and gratify his revenge. The messenger who
                    proclaimed at Alexandria the accession of Julian, announced the downfall of the
                    archbishop. George, with two of his obsequious ministers, Count Diodorus, and
                    Darcontius, master of the mint, was ignominiously dragged in chains to the
                    public prison. At the end of twenty-four days, the prison was forced open by the
                    rage of a superstitious multitude, impatient of the tedious forms of judicial
                    proceedings. The enemies of gods and men expired under their cruel insults; the
                    lifeless bodies of the archbishop and his associates were carried in triumph
                    through the streets on the back of a camel; and the inactivity of the Athanasian
                    party was esteemed a shining example of evangelical patience. The remains of
                    these guilty wretches were thrown into the sea; and the popular leaders of the
                    tumult declared their resolution to disappoint the devotion of the Christians,
                    and to intercept the future honours of these martyrs, who had been punished,
                    like their predecessors, by the enemies of their religion. The fears of the
                    Pagans were just, and their precautions ineffectual. The meritorious death of
                    the archbishop obliterated the memory of his life. The rival of Athanasius was
                    dear and sacred to the Arians, and the seeming conversion of these sectaries
                    introduced his worship into the bosom of the Catholic church. The odious
                    stranger, disguising every circumstance of time and place, assumed the mask of a
                    martyr, a saint, and a Christian hero; and the infamous George of Cappadocia has
                    been transformed into the renowned St George of England, the patron of arms, of
                    chivalry, and of the Garter.”</p>

                    Of these there were different orders and congregations, particularly canons
                    regular of St George in Alga, at Venice, established by authority of Pope
                    Boniface IX. in the year 1404. The foundation of this order was laid by
                    Bartolomeo Colonna, who preached in 1396 at Padua, and some other villages in
                    the state of Venice. Pope Pius V. in 1570, gave these canons precedence over all
                    other religious orders.</p>
