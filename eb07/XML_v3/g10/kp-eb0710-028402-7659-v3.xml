                    the Greek physicians after Hippocrates, was born at Pergamus, in Asia Minor,
                    about the year 131. His father was possessed of a considerable fortune, and not
                    only well versed in polite literature, philosophy, astronomy, and geometry, but
                    skilled in architecture. He instructed his son in the rudiments of learning, and
                    afterwards procured him the greatest masters of the age in philosophy and
                    eloquence. Galen having finished his studies under their care, chose physic as
                    his profession, and chiefly studied the works of Hippocrates. Having at length
                    exhausted all the sources of literature which were to be found at home, he
                    resolved to travel, in order to converse with the most able physicians in other
                    countries, intending at the same time to take every opportunity of inspecting on
                    the spot the plants and drugs of the countries through which he passed. With
                    this view he proceeded to Alexandria, where he staid some years; from thence he
                    travelled into Cilicia, passed through Palestine, visited the isles of Crete and
                    Cyprus, and made two voyages to Lemnos, in order to examine the Lemnian earth,
                    which was then esteemed an admirable medicine. With the same view he went into
                    Lower Syria, in order to obtain a thorough insight into the nature of the
                    opobalsamum, or balm of Gilead; and having completed his design, he returned
                    home by the way of Alexandria.</p><p>Galen had been four years at Pergamus, where his practice was attended with
                    extraordinary success, when some seditious commotions induced him to repair to
                    Rome, where he resolved to settle; but the proofs he gave of his superior skill,
                    added to the respect shown him by several persons of elevated rank, created him
                    so many enemies amongst his brethren of the faculty, that he was obliged to quit
                    the city, after having resided there four or five years. He had not long
                    returned to Pergamus, however, when he was recalled by the Emperors Aurelius and
                    Verus. After their death, he retired to his native country, where he died about
                    the year 200. He wrote in the Greek language, and is said to have composed two
                    hundred volumes, which were unhappily burnt in the Temple of Peace. Galen was of
                    a delicate constitution, as he himself asserts; but nevertheless, by his
                    temperance and skill in physic, he arrived at a great age; for it was his maxim
                    always to rise from table with some degree of appetite. He is justly considered
                    as the greatest physician of antiquity next to Hippocrates; and he performed
                    such surprising cures that he was accused of magic.</p><p>But without entering into any detail of the particular treatises written by
                    Galen, it may be sufficient here to notice the different editions of his
                    collected works. The Greek editions are those of Aldus and Asulanus, printed at
                    Venice, 1527, in five vols. folio; and that of Hieronymus Gemusaeus, printed at
                    Basil, 1538, in the same form. The Latin editions are that of Paris, 1536, in
                    folio, printed by Colinaeus, and reprinted at Lyons in 1554, with additions and
                    corrections by Frellonius; that of Basil, 1542, in folio, printed by Frobenius,
                    and edited by Gemusaeus; the editions published at the same place in 1549, 1550,
                    and 1562, the last of which contains an able preface by Conrad Gesner; the
                    edition of Venice, 1562, with the corrections of Rasario; ten editions published
                    at Venice by the Juntas between 1541 and 1625, the ninth of which, printed in
                    1609, and the tenth, a reprint of the ninth, are the most correct; and, lastly,
                    an edition printed at Venice in 1541-1545, by Farraeus, in seven vols. 8vo, with
                    the notes of Ricci. But the most elegant as well as most complete edition of
                    Galen’s works, both in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517672" xml:id="kp-eb0710-7672-0285"/>Greek and in Latin, is that which was published at
                    Paris by Réné Chartier, 1639-1679, in thirteen vols. folio, which are ordinarily
                    bound in nine or ten. This edition included the works of Hippocrates.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
