                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="smallcaps">John George,-</hi> one of the most learned and laborious
                    writers of his time, was born at Naumburg, in Saxony, on the 29th of January
                    1632. He began his studies in the gymnasium of Pforta, and completed them at the
                    university of Leipsic, under Rivinus and Strauch. Graevius was led to the study
                    of letters by his natural inclination, and every day he became more and more
                    devoted to this pursuit. But his father wished that he should study the law;
                    Strauch seconded this view; and Graevius obeyed, though with repugnance. About
                    the same time it happened that his father had occasion to send him into East
                    Friesland to accelerate the payment of a considerable debt. This journey fixed
                    the destination of Graevius. Having successfully accomplished the object of his
                    mission, he had the curiosity to visit Holland, where Salmasius, Heinsius, and
                    Frederick Gronovius, were then in the zenith of their reputation. The
                    conversation of Gronovius revealed to him the painful truth that his studies had
                    been almost entirely unavailing, that he had been taught according to the
                    principles of a bad school, and that he had no time to lose if he desired to
                    correct the vices of its method of instruction. At this period the taste in
                    Latinity had been corrupted in almost all the German universities. Justus
                    Lipsius had first set the example. Despairing of ever attaining the classical
                    elegance of Manucius,Muretus,and a small number of other learned men of their
                    age, he bad abandoned their model, Cicero, and betaken himself to the imitation
                    of some writers of an inferior order, who belonged not to the golden age of the
                    Latin language. In a man of such merit as Justus Lipsius this was a temerity
                    excused perhaps by other qualities of a superior order; in his imitators it
                    implied the total absence of reason and taste. In the rudeness of Ennius,
                    amongst the rugged archaisms of Pacuvius, and the ignoble trivialities of
                    Plautus, they went to seek for words and phrases, which they accommodated to all
                    subjects, even the gravest. They affected ridiculous points, and certain
                    finesses of thought, by which all the vigour of the style was enervated; and
                    they cut down into small periods, of studied brevity, a language already
                    rendered meagre and dry. Graevius, ill directed, had entered upon the same evil
                    path. But he entreated Gronovius to become thenceforth his guide, nor could he
                    have chosen one more able; so, having abandoned jurisprudence, he passed two
                    years at Deventer, attending assiduously the lessons of his new master. He then
                    proceeded to Amsterdam to hear Alexander Morus and David Blondel, whose counsels
                    decided him to quit Lutheranism for the sect of Calvin. Peter Burmann, his
                    panegyrist, anxious that this change of religion should not be misrepresented,
                    declares that it did not proceed from interested motives, and that the new
                    convert listened only to the voice of his conscience. Graevius, whose reputation
                    had now begun to be extended, was, in 1656, called to the university of
                    Duisburg; and he had been there two years, surpassing all the hopes which had
                    been conceived of his talents, when Gronovius, who had entered the university of
                    Leyden, solicited the magistrates of Deventer to appoint Graevius his successor.
                    They agreed to this application, and Graevius, notwithstanding the efforts of
                    the elector of Brandenburg, who, in order to retain him, offered an augmentation
                    of fees, quitted an university for a simple gymnasium, influenced probably by
                    the desire of living under a free government. After a stay of three years at
                    Deventer, he yielded to the solicitations of the university of Utrecht, which
                    offered him the chair of history, then vacant by the death of Aemilius. This
                    satisfied all his ambition, and, content with his situation, he declined the
                    invitations of the magistrates of Amsterdam and Leyden, who twice attempted, by
                    brilliant offers, to attach him to the schools in those cities. The elector
                    palatine, who wished to draw him to Heidelberg, was also refused; the king of
                    Prussia was not more fortunate; and the republic of Venice, which offered him a
                    chair in the university of Padua, had as little success, although, in the hope
                    of inducing him to accept, it had promised him, besides considerable
                    appointments, full liberty on the score of religion, and all necessary
                    protection against the importunity of the inquisitors. But none of these offers
                    could overcome his resolution. The eager desire of foreigners to obtain his
                    services was justified by the great reputation which he had attained as
                    professor. Pupils crowded to his lectures, not only from all Holland, but from
                    all Europe. In Germany, particularly, almost all the great lords sent their sons
                    to be educated by him; and he reckoned amongst his auditors sons of princes, and
                    even of kings; for William HL, who made him his historiographer, had confided to
                    his care the young Prince of Nassau. To the reputation of a great professor
                    Graevius joined that of a learned writer and able critic. Paquot, and before him
                    G. Burmann in the <hi rend="italic">Trajectum Eruditum,</hi> have given a
                    complete list of his works. The principal are, L An edition of the Letters of
                    Casaubon, Brunswick, 1655; 2. The Solecist of Lucian, Amsterdam, 1668, in 8vo,
                    with notes rich in grammatical erudition; 3. Hesiod, with a collection of
                    excellent observations under the title of <hi rend="italic">Lectiones</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hesiodeoe</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 4∙. Justin, 1669, <hi

                    >Variorum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 5. Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius,
                    Utrecht, 1680, <hi rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">Notis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Variorum</hi>; 6. Suetonius, 1672; 7. Florus, 1680; 8. The
                    Commentaries of Caesar; 9. The miscellaneous Letters of Cicero, his Letters to
                    Atticus, his Treatise of Offices, and his Discourses, <hi rend="italic"
                    >cum</hi><hi rend="italic">Notis</hi><hi rend="italic">Variorum.</hi> But his
                    masterpiece is his <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Antiquitatum Romanarum,</hi> in
                    12 vols. folio, a work of incredible labour and research, to which he afterwards
                    added <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Antiq.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Itali&lt;e,</hi> printed the year after his death, 1704, in
                    3 vols. folio, and continued by his successor Peter Burmann. Besides all these
                    works, which are more than sufficient to have exhausted the industry of ten
                    ordinary men, Graevius edited the Philological Lexico of Martinus, the treatise
                    of Junius <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Pictura Veterum,</hi> the
                    Greek and Latin Poetry of Huet, and several works of Meursius; and, in concert
                    with Peter Burmann and Holthen, he had commenced a reimpression of the
                    Inscriptions of Gruter. But in the midst of his labours death surprised this
                    indefatigable scholar, who was suddenly carried off by an attack of apoplexy, on
                    the 11th of January 1703, in the seventy-first year of his age. Fabricius has
                    published a collection of his Prefaces and Letters, and Burmann a collection of
                    his Discourses, <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
