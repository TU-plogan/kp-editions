                    son of the reverend Gilbert Gerard, minister of Chapel-Garioch, in the county of
                    Aberdeen, was born at that place on the 22d of February 1728. He received the
                    rudiments of his education at the parish school of Foveran, where he made rapid
                    progress; but his father having died when he was only ten years of age, his
                    mother soon afterwards removed with her family to Aberdeen, and young Gerard was
                    sent to the grammar-school of that city, where he attended for two years. At the
                    end of this period, being deemed fit for the university, he was entered as a
                    student in Marischal College, where he also distinguished himself by assiduity
                    and proficiency in his studies; and, after passing through the usual academical
                    course of four years, comprehending the study of Latin, Greek, mathematics, and
                    philosophy, he was admitted to the degree of master of arts. He then commenced
                    the study of theology, which he prosecuted in the universities of Aberdeen and
                    Edinburgh; and in 1748, when he had little more than completed his twentieth
                    year, he became a licensed preacher in the church of Scotland, In 1750 he was
                    chosen assistant to Mr David Fordyce, professor of philosophy in Marischal
                    College; and two years afterwards, upon the death of Mr Fordyce, who had been
                    drowned on the coast of Holland, Gerard was appointed to succeed him. At this
                    period it was the practice in Marischal College, as it continued to be in King’s
                    College, for the same professor to carry forward a class of students, during
                    three successive years, through all the branches of Ŭilosophy which were then
                    taught in the college, namely, jic, ontology, pneumatics, morals, politics, and
                    natural philosophy; and, in point of fact, Mr Gerard conducted one class through
                    this extensive course, the mathematics and the Greek being taught by separate
                    professors. But about the year 1754 this system, which differed but little from
                    that of tutors in the English universities, was abandoned, and, in Marischal
                    College, each professor was restricted to one department of science. In
                    vindication of the new plan of academical study, Gerard wrote an able pamphlet,
                    which was printed by appointment of the college, and appears to have satisfied
                    every one as to the propriety of the change which had been introduced. The
                    department assigned to Gerard, in consequence of this distribution, was that of
                    moral philosophy and logic, the duties of which he discharged with unwearied
                    assiduity and distinguished success. He also became a member of a literary
                    society at Aberdeen, consisting of Doctors Blackwell, Gregory, Reid, Campbell,
                    Beattie, and other persons less known to the world as authors, which met
                    regularly every fortnight during the winter, when the members communicated their
                    sentiments with the utmost freedom, and received mutual improvement from the
                    interchange of ideas in their literary discussions. Frwn the stimulus thus given
                    may be said to have ongmated Reid ♯ <hi rend="italic">Inquiry</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> into the Human Min</hi><hi rend="italic">^</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> Gre</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> gory’s <hi rend="italic">Comparatively</hi> Gerard’s <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> on</hi><hi rend="italic">Genius,</hi> Beattie <hi rend="italic">s Essay on Truth,</hi> and Campbell’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophy
                    of Rhetoric.</hi> In September 17o9, Gerard was ordained a minister of the
                    church of Scotland; the following year he was appointed professor of divinity in
                    Manschal College, and mhiister of the Greyfnars church in Aberdeen; and, about
                    the same time, he was created doctor in divinity. He continued to perform the
                    duties attached to these offices till the year 1771, when he resigned his
                    professorship in Marischal College, as weU as his church living, and was removed
                    to the theological chair in King’s College, which he held till the period of his
                    death, in the beginning of 1795. This event happened on his birthday, the 22d of
                    February, when, having suffered much from a schirrous tumor, he expired without
                    a groan, in the sixty-seventh year of his age. Dr Gerard’s attainments were
                    solid rather than brilliant; the effect of close and almost incessant study
                    aided by a sound judgment, rather than the inspirations of strong and original
                    genius. In all the relations of life he was alike estimable and exemplary. As a
                    clergyman, his conduct was marked by prudence, propriety, and diligence in the
                    discharge of his ministerial duties; as a professor, his principal aim was to
                    avoid imposing on his pupils any favourite system of opinions, and, instead of
                    encouraging dogmatism, the parent of intolerance, to impress them with a sense
                    of the importance of the ministerial office, to teach them the proper manner of
                    discharging its various duties, and to enable them, by a knowledge of the
                    Scriptures, and an acquaintance with the principles of sound biblical criticism,
                    to form a just and impartial judgment respecting controverted subjects.
                    Possessing large stores of theological learning, he was not more judicious in
                    selecting his topics than successful in his manner of treating them; and he had
                    the merit of introducing a new, and, in many respects, better plan of
                    theological education than that which had been previously followed. As a writer,
                    he does not rank very high. He is clear, sensible, judicious, and well informed;
                    almost never striking, forcible, eloquent, or original. His <hi rend="italic">Essay on Genius</hi> is more valuable for its facts than its opinions, and
                    seldom evinces that nice, delicate, and refined discrimination without which it
                    is impossible for any writer, whatever his talents or judgment may otherwise be,
                    to distinguish and render perceptible to others the various shades and
                    gradations of genius. In domestic life Dr Gerard was amiable and exemplary;
                    steady and disinterested in his friendships; hospitable, benevolent, and
                    unassuming in the intercourse of society; uniting with the sobriety of the
                    Christian pastor the good breeding of the gentleman, and the cheerfulness,
                    affability, and ease of the agreeable companion. Dr Gerard’s works are, 1. An
                    Essay on Taste, to which the gold medal was, in 1756, adjudged by the
                    Philosophical Society of Edinburgh; 2. Dissertations on the Genius and Evidences
                    of Christianity, 1766; 3. An Essay on Genius, 1774; 4. Two volumes of Sermons,
                    1780, 1782; 5. A part of his theological course, entitled The Pastoral Care,
                    published in 1799, by his son Dr Gilbert Gerard, who succeeded him as professor
