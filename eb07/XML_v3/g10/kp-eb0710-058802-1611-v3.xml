                    son of Richard Glover, a Hamburg merchant in London, and was born in St Martin’s
                    Lane in the year 1712. He very early evinced a strong propensity for poetry, and
                    whilst at school wrote, amongst other pieces, a poem to the memory of Sir Isaac
                    Newton, which is prefixed to the view of that incomparable author’s philosophy,
                    published by his intimate friend Dr Pemberton, 1728, in 4to. But though
                    possessed of talents which were calculated to obtain distinction in the literary
                    world, he was content to devote his attention to commerce, and at a proper
                    period commenced Hamburg merchant. He still, however, cultivated literature, and
                    associated with those who were eminent in science. One of his earliest friends
                    was Matthew Green, the author of some poems, which after his death were
                    collected and published by Mr Glover in 1737. In that year Mr Glover married
                    Miss Nunn, with whom he received a handsome fortune; and in the same month
                    published <hi rend="italic">Leonidas,</hi> a poem in quarto, which in two years
                    passed through three editions. This poem was inscribed to Lord Cobham, and upon
                    its first appearance was received by the world with great approbation, though it
                    has since been unaccountably neglected. Lord Lyttleton, in a popular publication
                    called <hi rend="italic">Common Sense,</hi> and in a poem addressed to the
                    author, praised it in the warmest terms; and in 1738 Dr Pemberton published
                    observations on poetry, especially epic, occasioned by the poem of Leonidas,
                    merely with a view to point out its beauties. In 1739 Mr Glover published <hi rend="italic">London, or the Progress of Commerce,</hi> quarto; and a ballad
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Hosiers Ghost.</hi> Both these pieces seem to have
                    been written with a view to incite the public to resent the misconduct of the
                    Spaniards; and the latter had a very considerable effect. At this period
                    political dissensions raged with great violence, more especially in the
                    metropolis; and at different meetings of the livery on these occasions, Mr
                    Glover was always called to (he chair, and acquitted himself in a very able
                    manner, his conduct being patriotic and his speeches masterly. In the year 1744
                    the Duchess of Marlborough died, and by her will left to Mr Glover and Mr Mallet
                    L.500 each, to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521624" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1624-0589"/>write the history of the Duke of Marlborough’s
                    life. This bequest, however, never took effect. It is supposed that Glover early
                    renounced his share of it; and Mallet, though he continued to talk of performing
                    the task almost as long as he lived, is now known never to have made the least
                    progress in the work. About this period Mr Glover withdrew a good deal from
                    public notice, and lived in retirement. He had been unsuccessful in business,
                    and with a laudable delicacy had preferred an obscure retreat to popular
                    observation, until his affaire should be placed on a better footing. He had been
                    honoured with the attention of Frederick prince of Wales, who once presented him
                    with a complete set of the classics, elegantly bound, and, on his absenting
                    himself for some time on account of the embarrassment in his circumstances, sent
                    him, it is said, L.500. The prince died in March 1751; and in the May following
                    Mr Glover was once more drawn from his retreat by the importunity of his
                    friends, and stood as candidate for the office of chamberlain of London. But it
                    unfortunately happened that he did not declare himself until most of the livery
                    had engaged their votes, and hence he lost his election. In 1753 Mr Glover
                    produced at Drury Lane his tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Boadicea,</hi> which was
                    acted nine nights, in the month of December. It had the advantage of the
                    performance of Garrick, Mossop, Mrs Cibber, and Mrs Pritchard. From the prologue
                    it seems to have been patronised by the author’s friends in the city; and Dr
                    Pemberton wrote a pamphlet to recommend it. In 1761 Mr Glover published <hi rend="italic">Medea,</hi> a tragedy written on the Greek model; but it was not
                    ιacted until 1767, when it appeared for the first time on the stage at Drury
                    Lane for Mrs Yates’ benefit. On the accession of George III. he appears to have
                    surmounted the difficulties of his situation. In the parliament which was then
                    called, he was chosen member for Weymouth, and continued to sit as such until
                    its dissolution. In 1770 a new edition of the poem of <hi rend="italic">Leonidas</hi> being required, it was republished in two volumes duodecimo,
                    corrected throughout, and extended from nine books to twelve. It had also
                    several new characters added, and the old ones were placed in new situations.
                    The improvements made in it were very considerable; but public curiosity was not
                    at this period sufficiently alive to recompense the pains bestowed on this once
                    popular performance. The calamities arising from the wound given to public
                    credit in June 1772, by the failure of the bank of Douglas, Heron, and Company,
                    in Scotland, occasioned Mr Glover’s taking an active part in settling these
                    complicated concerns, and also in endeavouring to relieve the distress then so
                    universally fell. In February 1744 he called the annuitants of that banking
                    house together, at the King’s Arms Tavern, and laid proposals before them for
                    the security of their demands, with which they were fully satisfied. He also
                    undertook to manage the interests of the merchants and traders of London
                    concerned in the trade to Germany and Holland, and of the dealers in foreign
                    linens, in their application to parliament in May 1774. The speeches which he
                    made on both these occasions were published in a pamphlet. In the succeeding
                    year he was engaged in behalf of the West India merchants in their application
                    to parliament, and examined the witnesses and summed up the evidence in the same
                    masterly manner as he had done on former occasions. For the assistance he
                    afforded the merchants in this business, he was complimented by them with a
                    service of plate, of the value of L.300; and the speech which he delivered in
                    the house was also printed. This, we believe, was the last opportunity he had of
                    displaying in public his oratorical talents. Having now arrived at a period of
                    life which demanded a retreat from business, Mr Glover withdrew to ease and
                    independence, and spent the remainder of his days with dignity and honour. It is
                    probable that he still continued his attention to poetry, as it appears that,
                    besides an epic poem of considerable length, he left some tragedies and comedies
                    behind him in manuscript. After experiencing the infirmities of age, he died on
                    the 25th of November 1785, leaving behind him a most estimable character as a
                    man, a citizen, and a writer.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
