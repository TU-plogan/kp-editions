                    thing with gold, either in leaf or in liquid. The art of gilding was not unknown
                    amongst the ancients, though it never arrived among them at the perfection to
                    which the moderns have carried it. Pliny assures us that the first gilding seen
                    at Rome was after the destruction of Carthage, under the censorship of Lucius
                    Mummius, when they began to gild the ceilings of their temples and palaces; the
                    Capitol being the first place on which this enrichment was bestowed. But he
                    adds, that luxury advanced on them so rapidly, that in a little time you might
                    see all, even private and poor persons, gild the walls, vaults, and other paru
                    of their dwellings.</p><p>We need not doubt that they had the same method as ourselves, of beating gold,
                    and reducing it into leaves; though it should seem that they did not carry it to
                    the same extent, if it be true which Pliny relates, that they only made 750
                    leaves of four fingers square out of an ounce. Indeed he adds that they could
                    make more; that the thickest were called <hi rend="italic">bractea</hi><hi rend="italic">Pranestina,</hi> by reason of a statue of fthe goddess Fortune at
                    Praeneste gilt with such leaves; and that the thinner sort was called <hi rend="italic">bractea</hi><hi rend="italic">questoria.</hi></p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193520727" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0727-0520"/><p>The modem gilders also make use of gold leaves of different thickness; but there
                    are some so fine that a thousand do not weigh above four or five drachms. The
                    thickest are used for gilding on iron and other metals, and the thinnest on
                    wood. But we have another advantage over the ancients in the manner of using or
                    applying the gold. The secret of painting in oil, discovered of late ages,
                    furnishes us with means of gilding works capable of enduring all the injuries of
                    time and weather, which to the ancients was impracticable. They had no way to
                    lay the gold on bodies which would not endure the fire, but with the albumen of
                    eggs or sise, neither of which will endure the water; so that they could only
                    gild such places as were sheltered from moisture.</p><p>The Greeks called the composition on which they applied their gilding on wood <hi rend="italic">laicopiueum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">leucophorum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which is described as a sort of glutinous compound earth,
                    serving in all probability to make the gold stick and bear polishing. But
                    antiquaries and naturalists are not agreed as to the particulars of this earth,
                    its colour, and ingredients.</p><p>The lustre and beauty of gold have occasioned several inquiries and discoveries
                    concerning the different methods of applying it to different substances. Hence
                    the art of gilding is very extensive, and contains many particular operations
                    and various management.</p><p>A colour of gold is given by painting and by varnishes, without employing gold;
                    but this is a false kind of gilding. Thus a very fine golden colour is given to
                    brass and to silver, by applying to these metals a gold-coloured varnish, which,
                    being transparent, shows all the brilliancy of the metals underneath. Many
                    ornaments of brass were varnished in this manner, which is called gold <hi rend="italic">laquering,</hi> to distinguish them from those which are really
                    gilt. Silver leaves thus varnished are put upon leather, which is then called
                    <hi rend="italic">gilt leather.</hi> (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Laquer.)</hi></p><p>There are two methods of gilding on wood, which are severally termed size and oil
                    gilding. The leaves of several metals are used for this purpose, viz. gold,
                    silver, mosaic gold, Egyptian gold, Peruvian gold, and Dutch metal. Gold and
                    silver alone are used when the work is to be burnished; the others only for the
                    coarser sorts of oil-gilding, and that rarely, owing to their liability to
                    blacken with the atmosphere, from being merely a composition of the baser
                    metals.</p><p>The practical operations are nearly the same with respect to all the different
                    metals; but as various <hi rend="italic">size»</hi> are required to prepare the
                    work, we shall describe the manner of procuring them before we describe how they
                    are employed: Isŕ, Strong size; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, clear size; 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, burnish gold size, and oil gold size.</p><p>1st, Strong size is prepared from the parings of animal hides: the best, and that
                    in most common use, is known at the tan-works by the name of bate shavings. To
                    one pound of these shavings add a gallon of water, and boil them together for
                    two or three hours, so that when cold they may become a very stiff jelly. After
                    it has been strained it is fit for use. 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, To prepare
                    clear size, take of vellum two ounces, add one pint of water, and boil them for
                    one hour, or until, when cold, they become a stiffish jelly, about half the
                    strength of the above. 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, To make gold size for
                    burnishing, reduce one pound of fine pipe-clay to powder, take one quarter of an
                    ounce of black lead, and half an ounce of French bole, and grind the two
                    together on a painter’s stone with water; mix in the clay, and add more water,
                    until it attains the consistency of a thick paste; put in a quarter of an ounce
                    of olive oil; grind the whole, and it is then ready for use.</p><p>The tools to be used are the tip, the cushion, and knife. The tip is a broad thin
                    brush, made of the long hairs of the squirrel’s tail glued between two cards.
                    The cushion is a board covered with calf leather, the rough side up, and a fold
                    of cotton between.</p><p>Warm the strong size, and mix with it the finest washed whitening until it is of
                    the consistency of very thick cream; lay it on the work to be gilded with a sash
                    tool; allow it to dry, and repeat the coats five or six times, allowing it to
                    dry each time. If plain or moulded, take pumice-stone and smooth the work; allow
                    it to dry, and smooth again with fine sand-paper; then take a portion of the
                    gold size (No. 3), and mix it with a part of the clear size (No. 2), in a warm
                    state, until it has been reduced to the consistency of cream; give the work four
                    coats of this, allowing it to dry each time; rub it down with flour-emery paper,
                    and coat again the parts to be burnished: the mat or flat part must be coated
                    with the clear size (No. 2) reduced with equal part of water. Take the gold leaf
                    and spread it on the cushion, cut it with the knife to the size required, take
                    the tip, grease it slightly, to make the gold lift; and having drawn a wetted
                    hair pencil over the part meant to be covered, lift the leaf with the tip and
                    lay it on, repeating this until the whole is covered: allow this to stand for
                    five or six hours, and rub carefully over the parts to be burnished with the
                    burnisher. The burnisher is a piece of smooth pebble fixed into a handle. Any
                    faults in the mat part should be mended with leaf, and coated over with clear
                    size, and then the work is finished.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Oil-gilding.</hi> —Oil gold size is made by grinding Oxford
                    ochre with drying oil, adding, when used, a little fat oil (fat oil is procured
                    by spreading a thin film of linseed oil on water, or shaking it in a bottle with
                    oxygen gas).</p><p>Work which is not to be exposed to damp or moisture should be prepared in the
                    same manner as for burnishing, and in the place of burnish gold size it should
                    get two coats of strong size (No. 1) a little reduced with water; and when
                    dry-coated with the oil gold size, and allowed to stand till the breath lies on
                    it, then lay the leaf as formerly described, pressing it down with cotton wool;
                    dust it off with a brush, coat it with clear size, and the work is finished.</p><p>Out-door work is prepared entirely with oil-paint in place of size, and when dry
                    it is coated with the oil gold size, and gilded in the same manner as described
                    above; but no size is applied on the surface of the gold.</p><p>It will readily be perceived that burnish and mat gilding is a more laborious
                    process than gilding in oil, consequently more expensive at the first. It has,
                    however, the advantage over the oil, for inside work, of keeping longer clean,
                    owing to the smoothness of its surface; for the best executed work in oil has a
                    roughness which allows the smoke and dust more readily to adhere. On the other
                    hand, when the work is to be exposed to the weather, oil gilding has a power of
                    resisting its action scarcely to be conceived.</p><p>The method of applying gold upon metals is entirely different, and it is done in
                    various ways. One of these is by previously forming the gold into a paste or
                    amalgam with mercury. In order to obtain a small amalgam of gold and mercury,
                    the gold must first be reduced into thin plates or grains, which are heated red
                    hot, and thrown into mercury previously heated, till it begins to smoke. Upon
                    stirring the mercury with an iron rod, the gold totally disappears. The
                    proportion of mercury to gold is generally as six or eight to one. With this
                    amalgam the surface of the metal to be gilded is to be covered; then a
                    sufficient heat is to be applied to evaporate the mercury; and, lastly, the gold
                    is to be burnished with a bloodstone.</p><p>This method of gilding by amalgamation is chiefly used for gilding copper, or an
                    alloy of copper, with a small portion of zinc, which more readily receives the
                    amalgam; and it is also preferable for its colour, which more resembles that of
                    gold than the colour of copper. When the metal to be gilt is wrought or chased,
                    it ought to be pre·</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193520740" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0740-0521"/><p>viously covered with quicksilver before the amalgam is applied, that this may be
                    easier spread; but when the surface of the metal is plain, the amalgam may be
                    applied directly to it. It is to be observed that the use of the blood-stone is
                    now generally abandoned, and a steel burnisher substituted for it. The steel
                    burnisher is case-hardened and then polished; the clearer the polish is, the
                    brighter will the metal be burnished. The quicksilver or amalgam is made to
                    adhere to the metal by means of a little aquafortis, which is rubbed on the
                    metallic surface at the same time, and by which this surface is cleansed from
                    any rust or tarnish that might prevent the union or adhesion of the metals. But
                    the use of the nitrous acid in this operation is not, as is generally supposed,
                    confined merely to the cleansing the surface of the metal to be gilt, from any
                    rust or tarnish which it may have acquired, but also greatly facilitates the
                    application of the amalgam to the surface of that metal. In the first place it
                    dissolves part of the mercury of the amalgam; and when this solution is applied
                    to the copper, the latter metal, having a stronger affinity for nitrous acid
                    than the mercury has, precipitates the mercury upon its surface, in the same
                    manner as a polished piece of iron precipitates copper upon its surface from a
                    solution of blue vitriol. When the metal to be gilt is thus covered over with a
                    thin precipitated coating of mercury, it readily receives the amalgam. In this
                    solution and precipitation of mercury, the principal use of the nitrous acid in
                    the process of gilding appears to consist. The amalgam being equally spread over
                    the surface of the metal to be gilt, by means of a brush, the mercury is then to
                    be evaporated by a heat just sufficient for that purpose; for if it be too
                    great, part of the gold may also be expelled, and part of it will run together,
                    and leave some of die surface of the metal bare. Whilst the mercury is
                    evaporating, the piece should be from time to time taken from the fire, that it
                    may be examined, that the amalgam may be spread more equally by means of a
                    brush, that any defective parts of it may be again covered, and that the heat
                    may not be too suddenly applied to it; and when the mercury has evaporated,
                    which is known by the surface having entirely become of a dull yellow colour,
                    the metal must then undergo other operations, by which the fine gold colour is
                    given to it. First, the gilded piece of metal is rubbed with a scratch brush,
                    composed of brass wire, until its surface be made smooth; then it is covered
                    over with a composition called <hi rend="italic">gilding wax,</hi> and again
                    exposed to the fire until the wax be burnt off. This wax is composed of
                    bees-wax, mixed with some of the following substances, viz. red ochre,
                    verdigris, copper scales, alum, vitriol, borax; but, according to Dr Lewis, the
                    saline substances alone are sufficient, without any wax. By this operation the
                    colour of the gilding is heightened; and the effect seems to be produced by a
                    perfect dissipation of some mercury remaining after the former operation. This
                    dissipation is well effected by this equable application of heat. The gilt
                    surface is then covered over with a saline composition, consisting of nitre,
                    alum, or other vitriolic salt, ground together, and mixed up into a paste with
                    water or urine. The piece of metal thus covered is exposed to a certain degree
                    of heat, and then quenched in water. By this method its colour is further
                    improved, and brought nearer to that of gold. This effect seems to be produced
                    by the acid of nitre (which is disengaged by the vitriolic acid of the alum, or
                    other vitriolic salt, during the exposure to heat) acting upon any particles of
                    copper which may happen to lie on the gilded surface. Lastly, some artists think
                    that they give an additional lustre to their gilt work by dipping it in a liquor
                    prepared by boiling some yellow materials, as sulphur, orpiment, or turmeric.
                    The only advantage of this operation is, that a part of the yellow matter, as
                    the sulphur or turmeric, remains in some of the hollows of the carved work, in
                    which the gilding is apt to be more imperfect, and to which it gives a rich and
                    solid appearance.</p><p>Iron cannot be gilt by amalgamation, unless, as it is said, it be previously
                    coated over with copper by dipping it in a solution of blue vitriol. At
                    Sheffield and Birmingham the metal is generally first covered with copper, and
                    then gilded. This species of gilding, however, does not present any thing like a
                    good colour, and, besides, it is by no means durable. Iron may also receive a
                    gold coating from a saturated solution of gold in nitro-muriatic acid, or in
                    aqua-regia, mixed with alcohol or spirit of wine, the iron having a greater
                    affinity for the acid, from which it necessarily precipitates the gold. Whether
                    any of these two methods be applicable to use, is uncertain; but the method
                    commonly employed of fixing gold upon iron is that above mentioned, of
                    burnishing gold leaf upon this metal when heated so as to become blue; and the
                    operation will be more perfect if the surface has been previously scratched or
                    graved.</p><p>Another method is mentioned by authors, of gilding upon metals, and also upon
                    earthen ware, and upon glass; namely, to fuse gold with regulus of antimony, to
                    pulverize the mass, which is sufficiently brittle to admit that operation, to
                    spread this powder upon the piece to be gilt, and to expose it to such a fire
                    that the regulus may be evaporated, whilst the gold remains fixed. The
                    inconveniences of this method, according to Dr Lewis, are, that the powder does
                    not adhere to the piece, and cannot be equally spread; that part of the gold is
                    dissipated along with the regulus; that glass is fusible with the heat necessary
                    for the evaporation of regulus of antimony; and that copper is liable to be
                    corroded by the regulus, and to have its surface rendered uneven.</p><p>On the subject of gilding by amalgamation Dr Lewis makes the following
                    observations. “There are two principal inconveniences in this business; one,
                    that the workmen are exposed to the fumes of the mercury, and generally, sooner
                    or later, have their health greatly impaired by them; the other, the loss of the
                    mercury; for though part of it is said to be detained in cavities made in the
                    chimney for that purpose, yet the greatest part of it is lost. From some trials
                    1 have made, it appeared that both these inconveniences, particularly the first
                    and most considerable one, might in good measure be avoided, by means of a
                    furnace of a due construction. If the communication of a furnace with its
                    chimney, instead of being over the fire, is made under the grate, the ash-pit
                    door, or other apertures beneath the grate, closed, and the mouth of the furnace
                    left open, the current of air, which otherwise would have entered beneath,
                    enters now at the top, and passing down through the grate to the chimney,
                    carries with it completely both the vapour of the fuel and the fumes of such
                    matters as are placed upon it: the back part of the furnace should be raised a
                    little higher above the fire than the fore part, and an iron plate laid over it,
                    that the air may enter only at the front, where the workman stands, who will be
                    thus effectually secured from the fumes, and from being incommoded with the
                    heat, and at the same time have full liberty of introducing, inspecting, and
                    removing the work. If such a furnace is made of strong forged (not milled) iron
                    plate, it will be sufficiently durable: the upper end of the chimney may reach
                    above a foot and a half higher than the level of the fire: over this is to be
                    placed a larger tube, leaving an interval of an inch or more all round between
                    it and the chimney, and reaching to the height of ten or twelve feet, the higher
                    the better. The external air, passing up between the chimney and the outer pipe,
                    prevents the latter from being much heated, so that the mercurial fumes will
                    condense against its sides into running quicksilver, which, falling down to the
                    bottom, is there catched in a hollow rim, formed by turning inwards a portion of
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193520753" xml:id="kp-eb0710-0753-0522"/>the lower part, and conveyed, by a pipe at one side, into a proper
                    receiver.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Lewis’s
                    improvements, however, have been found too complicated, and simpler contrivances
                    have been had recourse to. The following is the method lately introduced, and
                    now in use. A sponge saturated with vinegar is fastened underneath the mouth and
                    nostrils, and a vessel filled with cold water is placed at the vent of the
                    furnace. This vessel attracts the principal portion of the fumes of mercury, and
                    the remainder is attracted by the sponge. But still this is not able to attract
                    all the smoke, and the gilders in large manufactories generally die at an early
                    age.</p></note></p><p>“Mr Hellot communicates, in the Memoirs of the French Academy for the year 1745,
                    a method of making raised figures of gold on works of gold or silver, found
                    among the papers of Μ. Dufay, and of which Μ. Dufay himself had seen several
                    trials. Fine gold in powder, such as results from the parting of gold and silver
                    by aquafortis, is directed to be laid in a heap on a levigating stone, a cavity
                    made in the middle of the heap, and half its weight of pure mercury put into the
                    cavity; some of the fetid spirit obtained from garlic root by distillation in a
                    retort, is then to be added, and the whole immediately mingled and ground with a
                    muller till the mixture is reduced into an uniform gray powder. The powder is to
                    be ground with lemon juice to the consistence of paint, and applied on the piece
                    previously well cleaned and rubbed over with the same acid juice; the figures
                    drawn with it may be raised to any degree by repeating the application. The
                    piece is exposed to a gentle fire till the mercury is evaporated so as to leave
                    the gold yellow, which is then to be pressed down, and rubbed with the finger
                    and a little sand, which makes it appear solid and brilliant; after this it may
                    be cut and embellished. , The author observes that, being of a spongy texture,
                    it is more advisable to cut it with a chisel than to raise it with a graver;
                    that it has an imperfection of being always pale; and that it would be a
                    desirable thing to find means of giving it colour, as by this method ornaments
                    might be made of exquisite beauty, and with great facility. As the paleness
                    appears to proceed from a part of the mercury retained by the gold, I apprehend
                    it might be remedied by the prudent application of a little warm aquafortis,
                    which, dissolving the mercury from the exterior part, would give at least a
                    superficial high colour: if the piece is silver, it must be defended from the
                    aquafortis by covering it with wax. Instruments and ornaments of gold, stained
                    by mercury where the gold is connected with substances incapable of bearing
                    fire, may be restored to their colour by the same means.</p><p>“The foregoing process is given entirely on the authority of the French writer. 1
                    have had no experience of it myself, but have seen very elegant figures of gold
                    raised upon silver, on the same principle, by a different procedure. Some
                    cinnabar was ground, not with the distilled spirit, but with the expressed juice
                    of garlic, a fluid remarkably tenacious. This mixture was spread all over the
                    polished silver; and when the first layer had become dry, a second, and after
                    this a third, was applied. Over these were spread as many layers of another
                    mixture, composed chiefly of asphaltum and linseed oil boiled down to a due
                    consistence. The whole being dried with a gentle heat on a kind of wire grate,
                    the figures were traced and cut down to the silver, so as to make its surface
                    rough; the incisions were filled with an amalgam of gold, raised to different
                    heights in different parts according to the nature of the design; after which a
                    gentle fire, at the same time that it evaporated the mercury, destroyed the
                    tenacity of the gummy juice, so that the coating, which served to confine the
                    amalgam, and as a guide in the application of it, was now easily got off. The
                    gold was then pressed down and embellished as in the former method; and had this
                    advantage, that the surface of the silver under it having been made rough, it
                    adhered more firmly, so as not to be in danger of coming off, as Μ. Dufay says
                    the gold applied in this way sometimes did. The artist, however, found the
                    process so troublesome, that though he purchased the receipt for a considerable
                    sum, he has laid the practice aside.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The process of Μ. Dufay is a very ancient one, and totally
                    abandoned, or else only had recourse to for the purpose of amusement, or to
                    observe chemical action.</p></note></p><p>Finally, some metals, particularly silver, may be gilt in a different manner. Let
                    gold be dissolved in aqua-regia. In this solution pieces of linen are to be
                    dipt, and burnt to black ashes. These ashes being rubbed on the surface of the
                    silver by means of a wet linen rag, apply the particles of gold which they
                    contain, and which by this method adhere very well. The remaining part of the
                    ashes is to be washed off; and the surface of the silver, which in this state
                    does not seem to be gilt, is to be burnished with a blood-stone, till it acquire
                    a fine colour of gold. This method of gilding is very easy, and consumes a very
                    small quantity of gold. Most gilt ornaments upon fans, snuff-boxes, and other
                    toys of much show and little value, are nothing but silver gilt in this
                    manner.</p><p>Gold may also be applied to glass, porcelain, and other vitrified matters. As the
                    surface of these matters is very smooth, and consequently is capable of a very
                    perfect contact with gold leaf, it adheres to them with some force, although
                    they are not of a metallic nature. This gilding is so much the more perfect,
                    that the gold is more exactly applied to the surface of the glass. The pieces
                    are then to be exposed to a certain degree of heat, and burnished slightly to
                    give them lustre.</p><p>A more substantial gilding is fixed upon glass, enamel, and porcelain, by
                    applying to these substances powder of gold mixed with a solution of gum-arabic,
                    or with some essential oil and a small quantity of borax; after which a
                    sufficient heat is to be applied to soften the glass and the gold, which is then
                    to be burnished. With this mixture any figures whatever may be drawn. The
                    powders for this purpose may be made, first, by grinding gold leaf and honey,
                    which is afterwards to be washed away with water; secondly, by distilling to
                    dryness a solution of gold in aqua-regia; thirdly, by evaporating the mercury
                    from an amalgam of gold, taking care to stir well the mass near the end of the
                    process; fourthly, by precipitating gold from its solution in aqua-regia, by
                    applying to it a solution of green vitriol in water, or some copper, and perhaps
                    some other metallic substances.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
