                <p><label type="entry">GRAMMAR</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Grammar</hi> is the art of speaking or writing any language
                    with correctness and propriety; and the purpose of language is to communicate
                    our thoughts.</p>
                <p>Grammar, considered as an art, necessarily supposes the previous existence of
                    language; and as its design is to teach any language to those who are ignorant
                    of it, it must be adapted to the genius of that particular language of which it
                    treats. A just method of grammar, therefore, without attempting any alterations
                    in a language already introduced, furnishes certain observations called rules,
                    to which the methods of speaking used in that language may be reduced; and this
                    collection of rules is called the <hi rend="italic">grammar of</hi> that
                    particular language. For the greater distinctness with regard to these rules,
                    grammarians have usually divided this subject into four distinct heads: <hi
                    rend="italic">Orthography,</hi> or the art of combining letters into syllables,
                    and syllables into words; <hi rend="italic">Etymology,</hi> or the art of
                    deducing one word from another, and the various modifications by which the sense
                    of any one word can be diversified consistently with its original meaning or its
                    relation to the theme whence it is derived; <hi rend="italic">Syntax,</hi> or
                    what relates to the construction or due disposition of the words of a language
                    into sentences or phrases; and <hi rend="italic">Prosody,</hi> or that which
                    treats of the quantities and accents of syllables, and the art of making
                    verses.</p>
                <p>But grammar, considered as a science, views language only as significant of
                    thought. Neglecting particular and arbitrary modifications introduced tor the
                    sake of beauty or elegance, it examines the analogy and relation between words
                    and ideas; distinguishes between those particulars which are essential to
                    language and those which are only accidental; and thus furnishes a certain
                    standard, by which different languages may be compared, and their several ex
                    cellencies or defects pointed out. This is what is called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Philosophical</hi> or</p>
                <p>UNIVERSAL GRAMMAR.</p>
                <p>The origin of language is a subject which has employed much learned
                    investigation, and about which there is still a diversity of opinion. The design
                    of speech is to communicate to others the thoughts and perceptions of the mind
                    of the speaker; but it is obvious, that between an internal idea and any
                    external sound there is no natural relation; that the word <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> ∕fre, for instance, might have denominated the substance which we call
                    <hi rend="italic">ice,</hi> and that the word <hi rend="italic">ice</hi> might
                    have signified <hi rend="italic">fire.</hi> Some of the most acute feelings of
                    man, as well as of every other animal, are indeed expressed by simple
                    inarticulate sounds, which, as they tend to the preservation of the individual,
                    or the continuance of the species, and invariably indicate either pain or
                    pleasure, are universally understood; but these inarticulate and significant
                    sounds are very few in number; and if they can with any propriety be said to
                    constitute a natural and universal language, it is a language of which man as a
                    mere sensitive being partakes in common with the other animals.</p>
                <p>Man is endowed not only with sensation, but also with the faculty of reasoning;
                    and simple inarticulate sounds are insufficient for expressing all the various
                    modifications <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522274" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2274-0639"
                    />of thought, for communicating to others a chain of argumentation, or even for
                    distinguishing between the different sensations either of pain or of pleasure; a
                    man scorched with fire or unexpectedly plunged amongst ice, might utter the cry
                    naturally indicative of sudden and violent pain; the cry would be the same, or
                    nearly the same, but the sensations of cold and heat are widely different.
                    Articulation, by which those simple sounds are modified, and a particular
                    meaning fixed to each modification, is therefore absolutely necessary to such a*
                    being as man, and forms the language which distinguishes him from all other
                    animals, and enables him to communicate with facility all that diversity of
                    ideas with which his mind is stored, to make known his particular wants, and to
                    distinguish with accuracy all his various sensations. Those sounds thus modified
                    are called <hi rend="italic">words</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and as words
                    have confessedly no natural relation to the ideas and perceptions of which they
                    are significant, the use of them must either have been the result of human
                    sagacity, or have been suggested to the first man by the author of nature.</p>
                <p>Whether language be of divine or human origin, is a question upon which, though
                    it might perhaps be soon resolved, it is not necessary to enter here. Upon
                    either supposition; the first language, compared with those which succeeded it,
                    or even with itself as afterwards enlarged, must have been extremely narrow and
                    rude. If it was of human contrivance, this will be readily granted; for what art
                    was ever invented and brought to a state of perfection by illiterate savages ř
                    If it was taught by God, which is at least the more probable supposition, we
                    cannot imagine that it would be more comprehensive than the ideas of those for
                    whose immediate use it was intended; that the first men should have been taught
                    to express pains or pleasures which they never felt, or to utter sounds that
                    should afterwards be significant of ideas which at the time of utterance had not
                    occurred to the mind of the speaker. Man once taught the elements of language
                    would be able of himself to improve and enlarge it as his future occasions
                    required.</p>
                <p>As all language is composed of significant words variously combined, a knowledge
                    of them is necessary previous to our acquiring an adequate idea of language as
                    constructed into sentences and phrases. But as it is by words that we express
                    the various ideas which occur to the mind, it is necessary to examine how ideas
                    themselves are suggested, before we can ascertain the various classes into which
                    words may be distributed. It is the province of <hi rend="italic">logic</hi> to
                    trace our ideas from their origin, as well as to unfold the process of
                    reasoning; but it is necessary at present to observe, that our earliest ideas
                    are all ideas of sensation, excited by the impressions that are made upon our
                    organs of sense by the various objects with which we are surrounded. Let us
                    therefore suppose a reasonable being, devoid of every possible prepossession,
                    placed upon this globe; and it is obvious that his attention would in the first
                    place be directed to the various objects which he saw existing around him. These
                    he would naturally endeavour to distinguish from one another; and if he were
                    either learning or inventing a language, his first effort would be to give them
                    <hi rend="italic">names,</hi> by means of which the ideas of them might be
                    recalled when the objects themselves should be absent. This is one copious
                    source of words, and forms a natural class which must be common to every
                    language, and which is distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >nouns</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and as <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> these
                    nouns are the names of the several substances which exist, they have likewise
                    been called <hi rend="italic">substantives.</hi></p>
                <p>It would likewise be early discovered that every one of these substances was
                    endowed with certain qualities or attributes, to express which another class of
                    words would be requisite, since it is only by their qualities that substances
                    themselves can attract our attention. Thus, to be weighty, is a quality of
                    matter; to think, is an attribute of man. Therefore in every language words have
                    been invented to express the known qualities or attributes of the several
                    objects which exist. These may all be comprehended under the general
                    denomination of <hi rend="italic">attributives.</hi></p>
                <p>Nouns and attributives must comprehend all that is essential to language;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is the doctrine of many
                    writers on the theory of language; yet it is not easy to conceive mankind so far
                    advanced in the art of abstraction as to view <hi rend="italic">attributes</hi>
                    by themselves independently of particular <hi rend="italic">suhitam∙eι,</hi> and
                    to give one general name to each attribute wheresoever it may be found, without
                    having at the same time words expressive of affirmation, we never talk of any
                    attribute, a colour for instance, without affirming something concerning it; as,
                    either that it is bright or faint, or that it is the colour of some substance.
                    It will be seen afterwards, that to denote affirmation is the proper office of
                    what is called the substantive verb; as, “Milk is white.” That verb therefore
                    appears to be as necessary to the communication of thought as any species of
                    words whatsoever; and if we must range words under a few general classes, we
                    should be inclined to say that nouns,'attributes, and affirmatives, comprehend
                    all that is really essential to language.</p></note> for every thing which
                    exists, or of which we can form an idea, must be either a substance or the
                    attribute of some substance; and therefore the two classes which we denominate
                    substances and attributes must comprehend all the words that are necessary to
                    communicate to the hearer the ideas which are present to the mind of the
                    speaker. If any other words occur, they can only have been invented for the sake
                    of dispatch, or introduced for the purposes of ease and ornament, to avoid
                    tedious circumlocutions or disagreeable tautologies. There are indeed
                    grammarians of great name, who have considered as essential to language an order
                    of words, of which the use is to connect the nouns and attributes, and which are
                    said to have no signification of themselves, but to become significant by
                    relation. Hence all words which can possibly be invented are by these men
                    divided into two general classes; those which are <hi rend="italic">significant
                    of themselves,</hi> and those which are <hi rend="italic">not.</hi> Words
                    significant of themselves are either expressive of the names of substances, and
                    therefore called <hi rend="italic">substantives</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or
                    of attributes, and therefore called <hi rend="italic">attributives.</hi> Words
                    which are not significant of themselves must acquire a meaning either as
                    defining or connecting others, and are therefore arranged under the two classes
                    of <hi rend="italic">definitives</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >connectives.</hi></p>
                <p>That in any language there can be words which of themselves have no
                    signification, is a supposition which a man free from prejudice will not readily
                    admit. For to what purpose, we ask, should they have been invented? As they are
                    significant of no ideas, they cannot facilitate the communication of thought,
                    and must therefore be only an incumbrance to the language in which they are
                    found. But in answer to this it has been said, that these words, though devoid
                    of signification themselves, acquire a sort of meaning when joined with others,
                    and that they are as necessary to the structure of a sentence as mortar is to
                    the structure of an edifice; for as stones cannot be arranged into a regular
                    building without a cement to bind and connect them, so the original words
                    significant of substances and attributes cannot be made to express all the
                    variety of our ideas without being defined and connected by those words which of
                    themselves signify nothing. It is wonderful that he who first suggested this
                    simile did not perceive that it tends to overthrow the doctrine which it is
                    meant to illustrate. For surely the cement is as much the matter of the building
                    as the stones themselves are; it is equally solid and equally extended. By being
                    united with the stones, it neither acquires nor loses any one of the qualities
                    essential to matter; it neither communicates its own softness nor acquires their
                    hardness. By this mode of reasoning, therefore, it <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522287" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2287-0640"/>would appear that the words
                    called definitives and connectives, so far from having of themselves no
                    signification, are equally essential to language, and equally significant with
                    those which are denominated substantives and attributives; and upon
                    investigation it will be found that this is the truth. For whatever is meant by
                    the definition or connection of the words which all men confess to be
                    significant, that meaning must be the sense of the words of which the purpose is
                    to define and connect; and as there can be no meaning where there are no ideas,
                    every one of these definitives and connectives must be significant of some idea,
                    although it may not always be easy or even possible to express that idea by
                    another word.</p>
                <p>These different modes of dividing the parts of speech we have just mentioned
                    because they have been largely treated of by grammarians of high fame. But it
                    does not appear to us that any man can feel himself much the wiser for having
                    learned that all words are either substantives or attributives, definitives or
                    connectives. The division of words into those which are <hi rend="italic"
                    >significant of themselves,</hi> and those which are <hi rend="italic"
                    >significant by relation,</hi> is absolute nonsense, and has been productive of
                    much error and much mystery in some of the most celebrated treatises on grammar.
                    It is indeed probable that any attempt to establish a different classification
                    of the parts of speech from that which is commonly received, will be found of
                    little utility either in practice or in speculation. As far as the former is
                    concerned, the vulgar division seems sufficiently commodious; for every man who
                    knows any thing, knows when he uses a noun and when a verb. With respect to the
                    latter, not to mention that all the grammarians from Aristotle to Horne Tooke
                    have differed on the subject, it should seem to be of more importance, after
                    having ascertained with precision the nature of each species of words, to
                    determine in what circumstances they differ than in what they agree.</p>
                <p>In most languages, probably in all cultivated languages, grammarians distinguish
                    the following parts of speech, viz. noun, pronoun, verb, participle, adverb,
                    preposition, conjunction. The Latin and English grammarians admit the
                    interjection among the parts of speech, although it is confessedly not necessary
                    to the construction of the sentence, being only thrown in to express the
                    affection of the speaker; and in the Greek and English tongues there is the
                    article prefixed to nouns when they signify the common names of things, to point
                    them out, and to show how far their signification extends. In the method of
                    arrangement commonly followed in grammars, adjectives are classed with
                    substantives, and both are denominated nouns. But it is certain that, when
                    examined philosophically, an essential difference is discovered between the
                    substantive and the adjective; and therefore some philologists of eminence, when
                    treating of this subject, have given the following classification of words,
                    which we shall adopt: The <hi rend="smallcaps">article, noun, pronoun, verb,
                    participle,</hi> ADJECTIVE, ADVERB, PREPOSITION, CONJUNCTION, <hi

                    English language, and therefore we shall examine each class, endeavour to
                    ascertain its precise import, and show in what respects it differs from every
                    other class. It is impossible to investigate the principles of grammar without
                    confining the investigation in a great measure to some particular language from
                    which the illustrations must be produced; and that we should prefer the English
                    language for this purpose can excite no wonder, as it is a preference which is
                    due to every tongue from those by whom it is spoken. The principles, however,
                    which we shall here expound and elucidate, being in substance the same with
                    those so clearly and ingeniously established by Dr John Hunter of St Andrews, in
                    his oral prelections on philology, will be found to apply universally; and our
                    inquiry, though principally illustrated from the English language, will be an
                    inquiry into Philosophical and Universal Grammar.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Of the Noun or Substantive.</hi></p>
                <p>Nouns are all those words by which objects or substances are denominated, and
                    which distinguish them from one another, without marking either quantity,
                    quality, action, or relation. The substantive or noun is the name of the thing
                    spoken of, and in Greek and Latin is called <hi rend="italic">name</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for it is <hi rend="italic">tn&gt;μa</hi> in the one, and
                    <hi rend="italic">nomen</hi> in the other; and if in English we had called it
                    the <hi rend="italic">name</hi> rather than the <hi rend="italic">noun,</hi> the
                    appellation would perhaps have been more proper, as this last word, being used
                    only in grammar, is more liable to be misunderstood than the other, which is in
                    constant and familiar use. That nouns or the names of things must make a part of
                    every language, and that they must have been the words first suggested to the
                    human mind, will not be disputed. Men could not speak of themselves, or of any
                    thing else, without having names for themselves and the various objects with
                    which they are surrounded. Now, as all the objects which exist must be either in
                    the same state in which they were produced by nature, or changed from their
                    original state by art, or abstracted from substances by the powers of
                    imagination, and conceived by the mind as having at least the capacity of being
                    characterised by qualities; this naturally suggests a division of nouns into <hi
                    rend="italic">natural,</hi> as man, vegetable, tree; <hi rend="italic"
                    >artificial,</hi> as house, ship, watch; and <hi rend="italic">abstract,</hi> as
                    whiteness, motion, temperance.</p>
                <p>But the diversity of objects is so great, that had each individual a distinct and
                    proper name, it would be impossible for the most tenacious memory, during the
                    course of the longest life, to retain even the nouns of the narrowest language.
                    It has therefore been found expedient, when a number of things resemble each
                    other in some important particulars, to arrange them all under one <hi
                    rend="italic">species</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> to which is given a name that
                    belongs equally to the whole species, and to each individual comprehended under
                    it. Thus the word <hi rend="italic">man</hi> denotes a <hi rend="italic"
                    >species</hi> of animals, and is equally applicable to every human being; the
                    word <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> denotes another species of animals, and is
                    equally applicable to every individual of that species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >quadrupeds</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it cannot be applied to the species
                    of men, or to any individual comprehended under that species. We find, however,
                    that there are some qualities in which several species resemble each other; and
                    therefore we refer them to a higher order called a <hi rend="italic">genus,</hi>
                    to which we give a name that is equally applicable to every species and every
                    individual comprehended under it. Thus, men and horses and all living things on
                    earth resemble each other in this respect, that they have <hi rend="italic"
                    >life.</hi> We refer them therefore to the genus called <hi rend="italic"
                    >animal</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this word belongs to every species of
                    animals, and to each individual animal. The same classification is made both of
                    artificial and abstract substances; of each of which there are genera, species,
                    and individuals. Thus, in natural substances, animal, vegetable, and fossil,
                    denote <hi rend="italic">genera</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> man, horse, tree,
                    metal, <hi rend="italic">species;</hi> and Alexander, Bucephalus, oak, gold, <hi
                    rend="italic">individuals.</hi> In artificial substances, again, edifice is a
                    <hi rend="italic">genus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> house, church, tower, are
                    <hi rend="italic">species</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the Vatican, St
                    Paul’s, and the Tower of London, are <hi rend="italic">individuals.</hi> Lastly,
                    in abstract substances, motion and virtue arc <hi rend="italic">genera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> flight and temperance are <hi rend="italic">species</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the flight of Mahommed, and temperance in wine, are <hi
                    rend="italic">individuals.</hi> By arranging substances in this manner, and
                    giving a name to each genus and species, the nouns necessary to any language are
                    comparatively few and easily acquired; and when we meet with an object unknown
                    to us, we have only to examine it with attention, and, comparing it with other
                    objects, to refer it to the genus or species which it most nearly resembles. By
                    this contrivance we supply the want of a proper name for the individual; and, as
                    far as the resemblance is complete between it and the species to which it is
                    referred, and of which we have given it the name, we may converse and reason
                    about it without danger of error; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522300"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2300-0641"/>whereas had each individual in nature a distinct
                    and proper name, words would be innumerable and incomprehensible; and to employ
                    our labours in language would be as idle as that study of numberless written
                    symbols which has been attributed to the Chinese·</p>
                <p>Although nouns are thus adapted to express, not the individuals, but the genera
                    or species into which substances are classed; yet, in speaking of these
                    substances, whether natural, artificial, or abstract, all men must have occasion
                    to mention sometimes one of a kind, and sometimes more than one. In every
                    language, therefore, nouns must admit of some variation in their form, to denote
                    <hi rend="italic">unity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">plurality</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and this variation is called <hi rend="italic">number.</hi>
                    Thus in the English language, when we speak of a single place of habitation, we
                    call it a house; but if of more, we call them houses. In the first of these
                    cases the noun is said to be in the <hi rend="italic">singular,</hi> in the last
                    case it is in the <hi rend="italic">plural</hi> number. Greek nouns have also a
                    <hi rend="italic">dual</hi> number to express two individuals, as have likewise
                    some Hebrew nouns; but this variation is evidently not essential to language;
                    and it is perhaps doubtful whether it ought to be considered as an elegance or
                    as a deformity.</p>
                <p>But although number be a natural accident of nouns, it can only be considered as
                    essential to those which denote genera or species. Thus we may have occasion to
                    speak of one animal or of many animals, of one man or of many men; and therefore
                    the nouns <hi rend="italic">animal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">man</hi> must be
                    capable of expressing <hi rend="italic">plurality</hi> as well as <hi
                    rend="italic">unity.</hi> But this is not the case with respect to the proper
                    names of individuals; for we can only say <hi rend="italic">Xenophon, Aristotle,
                    Plato,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">singular</hi>; as, were any one of these
                    names to assume a plural form, it would cease to be the proper name of an
                    individual, and become the common name of a species. Of this, indeed, we have
                    some examples in every language. When a proper name is considered as a general
                    appellative under which many others are arranged, it is then no longer the name
                    of an individual, but of a species, and as such admits of a plural; as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Caesars,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Howards,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pelhams,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Montagues</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but <hi rend="italic">Socrates</hi> can never become
                    plural, as long as we know of no more than one man of that name. The reason of
                    all this will be obvious, if we consider that every genus may be found whole and
                    entire in each of its species; for <hi rend="italic">man, horse,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">dog,</hi> are each of them an entire and complete animal; and
                    every species may be found whole and entire in each of its individuals,
                    Socrates, Plato, and Xenophon, being each of them completely and entirely a <hi
                    rend="italic">man.</hi> Hence it is, that every genus, though <hi rend="italic"
                    >one,</hi> is multiplied into <hi rend="italic">many</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and every species, though <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> is also multiplied
                    into <hi rend="italic">many,</hi> by reference to those beings which are their
                    subordinates; but as no individual has any such subordinates, it can never in
                    strictness be considered as <hi rend="italic">many</hi>; and so, as well in
                    nature as in name, is truly an <hi rend="italic">individual</hi> which cannot
                    admit of number.</p>
                <p>Besides number, another characteristic, visible in substances, is that of <hi
                    rend="italic">sex.</hi> Every substance is either male or female, or both male
                    and female, or neither the one nor the other. So that with respect to sexes and
                    their nega- <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> i <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> ' <hi rend="superscript"> a11</hi> substances
                    conceivable are comprehended under this fourfold consideration, which language
                    would be very imperfect if it could not express. Now the existence of
                    hermaphrodites being rare, if not doubtful, and language being framed to answer
                    the ordinary occasions of life, no provision is made, in any of the tongues with
                    which we are acquainted, for expressing, otherwise than by a name made on
                    purpose, or by a periphrasis, duplicity of sex.</p>
                <p>. it " regard to this great natural characteristic, grammarians have made only a
                    threefold distinction of nouns: those which denote <hi rend="italic">males</hi>
                    are said to be of the <hi rend="italic">masculine gender</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> those which denote <hi rend="italic">females,</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">feminine</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and those which denote
                    substances that admit not of <hi rend="italic">sex,</hi> are said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">neuter,</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">neither gender.</hi> All
                    animals have sex, and therefore the names of all animals should have gender. But
                    the sex of all is not equally obvious, nor equally worthy of attention. In those
                    species which are most common, or of which the male and female are, by their
                    size, form, colour, or other outward circumstances, eminently distinguished, the
                    male is sometimes called by one name, which is masculine, and the female by a
                    different name, which is feminine. Thus in English we say, <hi rend="italic"
                    >husband, wife</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">king, queen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">father, mother</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">son, daughter,</hi> and so on. In others of similar
                    distinction, the name of the male is applied to the female only by prefixing a
                    syllable or by altering the termination; as <hi rend="italic">man, woman</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">lion, lioness</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">emperor, empress,</hi> anciently <hi rend="italic"
                    >emperess</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">master, mistress,</hi>
                    anciently <hi rend="italic">masteress</hi>; and so in other similar instances.
                    When the sex of any animal is not obvious, or not material to be known, the same
                    name, in some languages, is applied, without variation, to <hi rend="italic"
                    >all</hi> the species, and that name is said to be of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >common gender.</hi> Thus in Latin <hi rend="italic">bos</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >albus</hi> is a white ox, and <hi rend="italic">bos alba</hi> a white cow.
                    Diminutive insects, though they are doubtless male and female, seem to be
                    considered in the English language as if they were really creeping tilings. No
                    man, speaking of a worm, would say <hi rend="italic">he</hi> creeps, but <hi
                    rend="italic">it</hi> creeps upon the ground. But although the origin of genders
                    is thus clear and obvious, yet the English is the only language with which we
                    are acquainted that deviates not, except in a very few instances, from the order
                    of nature. Greek and Latin, and many of the modern tongues, have nouns, some
                    masculine, some feminine, which denote substances where sex never had existence.
                    Nay, some languages are so particularly defective in this respect, as to class
                    every object, inanimate as well as animate, under either the masculine or the
                    feminine gender, as they have no neuter gender for those which are of neither
                    sex. This is the case with the Hebrew, French, Italian, and Spanish. But the
                    English, strictly following the order of nature, puts every noun which denotes a
                    male animal, and no other, in the masculine gender; every name of a female
                    animal, in the feminine; and every animal whose sex is not obvious, or known, as
                    well as every inanimate object whatsoever, in the neuter gender. And this gives
                    our language an advantage above most others in the poetical and rhetorical
                    style; for when nouns naturally neuter are converted into masculine and
                    feminine, the personification is more distinctly and more forcibly marked. Some
                    very learned and ingenious men have endeavoured, by w hat they call a more
                    subtile kind of reasoning, to discern even in things without a sex a distant
                    analogy to that <hi rend="italic">natural distinction,</hi> and to account for
                    the names ofinanimate substances being, in Greek and Latin, masculine and
                    feminine. But such speculations arc wholly fanciful, and the principles upon
                    which they proceed are overturned by an appeal to facts. Many of the substances
                    that, in one language, have masculine names, have in others names that are
                    feminine; which could not be the case were this matter regulated by reason or
                    nature. Indeed, for this, as well as many other anomalies in language, no other
                    reason can be assigned than that custom,</p>
                <p>Quern penes arbitrium est, et jus, et norma, loquendi.</p>
                <p>It has been already observed that most nouns are the names, not of individuals,
                    but of whole classes of objects termed genera and species.<note anchored="true"

                    which appear to be important, and in which the several individuals are found to

                    be less essential, and which in one individual may be such as have nothing
                    exactly similar in any other individual upon earth. Thus, in classing the

                    no regard to their colour or their size; because experience teaches us that no
                    particular colour or size is essential to that individual living creature, and
                    that there are not perhaps upon earth two horses whose colour and size are
                    exactly alike. But the qualities which in this process we take into view, are
                    the general shape, the symmetry, and proportion of the parts; and in short,
                    every thing which appears evidently essential to the life of the individual and
                    the propagation of the race. All these qualities are strikingly similar in all
                    the individuals which we call <hi rend="italic">horses,</hi> and as strikingly
                    dissimilar from the corresponding qualities of every other individual animal.
                    The colour of a horse is often the same with that of an ox; but the shape of the
                    one animal, the symmetry and proportion of his parts, are totally different from
                    those of the other; nor could any man be led to class the two individuals under
                    the same species. It is by a similar process that we ascend from one species to
                    another, and through all the species to the highest genus. In each species or
                    genus in the ascending series fewer particular qualities are attended to than
                    were considered as essential to the genus or species immediately below it; and
                    our conceptions become more and more general as the particular qualities which
                    are the objects of them become fewer in number. The use of a general term,
                    therefore, can recal to the mind only the common qualities of the class, the
                    genus, or species, which it represents. But we have frequent occasion to speak
                    of individual objects. In doing this, we annex to the general term certain words
                    significant of particular qualities, which discriminate the object of which we
                    speak from every other individual of the class to which it belongs, and of which
                    the general term is the common name. For instance, in advertising a <hi
                    rend="italic">thief,</hi> we are obliged to mention his height, complexion,
                    gait, and whatever may serve to distinguish him from all other men.</p>
                <p>The process of the mind in rendering its conceptions particular, is indeed
                    exactly the reverse of that by which it generalizes them. For, as in the process
                    of generalization, it abstracts from the ideas of any number of species certain
                    qualities in which they differ from each other, and of the remaining qualities
                    in which they agree constitutes the first genus in the ascending series; so,
                    when it wishes to make its conceptions more particular, it annexes to the idea
                    of any genus those qualities or circumstances which were before abstracted from
                    it; and the genus, with this annexation, constitutes the first species in the
                    descending series. In like manner, when it wishes to descend from any species to
                    an individual, it has only to annex to the idea of the species those particular
                    qualities which discriminate the individual intended from the other individuals
                    of the same kind.</p>
                <p>This particularizing operation of the mind points out the manner of applying the
                    general terms of language for the purpose of expressing particular ideas. For,
                    as the min'd, to limit a general idea, connects that idea with the idea of some
                    particular circumstance, so language, as we have already observed, in order to
                    limit a general term, connects that term with the word denoting the particular
                    circumstance. Thus, in order to particularize the idea of horse, the mind
                    connects that general idea with the circumstance, suppose, of whiteness; and in
                    order to particularize the word horse, language connects that word with the term
                    white; and so in other instances. Annexation, therefore, or the connecting of
                    general words or terms in language, fits it for expressing particular
                    conceptions; and this must hold good alike in aD languages. But the methods of
                    denoting this annexation are various in various tongues. In English and most
                    modern languages we commonly use for this purpose little words, which we have
                    chosen to style <hi rend="italic">particles</hi>; and in the Greek and Latin
                    languages, the <hi rend="italic">cases of nouns</hi> answer the same end.</p>
                <p>Cases, therefore, though they are accidents of nouns not absolutely necessary,
                    have been often considered as such; and they are certainly worthy of our
                    examination, since there is perhaps no language in which some cases are not to
                    be found, as indeed without them or their various powers no language could
                    readily answer the purposes for which it was formed.</p>
                <p>All the oblique cases of nouns, if we except the vocative, are merely marks of
                    annexation; but as the connections or relations subsisting among objects are
                    very various, some cases denote one kind of relation, and some another. We shall
                    endeavour to investigate the connection which each case denotes, beginning with
                    the <hi rend="italic">genitive.</hi></p>
                <p>This is the most general of all the cases, and gives notice that <hi
                    rend="italic">some</hi> connection indeed subsists between two objects, but does
                    not point out the particular kind of connection. That we must infer, not from
                    our nature or termination of the genitive itself, but from our previous
                    knowledge of the objects connected. That the genitive denotes merely relation in
                    genera), might be proved by adducing innumerable examples, in which the
                    relations expressed by this case are different; but we shall content ourselves
                    with one observation, from which the truth of our opinion will appear beyond
                    dispute. If an expression be used in which are connected by the genitive case,
                    two words significant of objects between which a twofold relation may subsist,
                    it will be found impossible, from the expression, to determine which of these
                    two relations is the true one, which must be gathered wholly from the context.
                    Thus, for example, from the phrase <hi rend="italic">injuria</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regis,</hi> no man can know whether the injury mentioned be an
                    injury <hi rend="italic">suffered</hi> or an injury <hi rend="italic"
                    >inflicted</hi> by the king; but if the genitive case notified any particular
                    relation, no such ambiguity could exist. This case therefore gives notice, that
                    two objects are somehow connected,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Greek grammarians seem to have been aware of the nature
                    of this case when they called it &lt;rw&lt; <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> 71
                    &gt;&lt;«&gt;,, or the general case; a name of which the Latin grammarians
                    evidently mistook the meaning when they translated it <hi rend="italic"
                    >caiuι</hi><hi rend="italic">genitivus,</hi> or the generative case, which is a
                    name totally foreign to its nature.</p></note> but it marks not the particular
                    sort of connection. Hence it may be translated by our particle <hi rend="italic"
                    >of,</hi> which will be seen afterwards to be of a signification equally
                    general.</p>
                <p>The dative and accusative cases appear to have nearly the same meaning; each of
                    them denoting apposition, or the junction of one object with another. Thus, when
                    any one says, <hi rend="italic">Comparo</hi><hi rend="italic">Virgilium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Homero,</hi> Homer and Virgil are conceived to be placed beside
                    one another, in order to their being compared; and this sort of connection is
                    denoted by the dative case. In like manner, when it is said <hi rend="italic"
                    >latus humeros,</hi> breadth is conceived as joined to or connected in
                    apposition with shoulders; and the expression may be translated “broad <hi
                    rend="italic">at</hi> the shoulders.”</p>
                <p>This apposition of two objects may happen either without previous motion, or in
                    consequence of it. In the foregoing instances no motion is presupposed; but if
                    one say, <hi rend="italic">Misit aliquos subsidio eorum,</hi> the apposition is
                    there in consequence of motion. In like manner, when it is said <hi
                    rend="italic">Profectus est</hi><hi rend="italic">∏omam,</hi> his apposition
                    with Rome is conceived as the effect of his motion thither. From this idea of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522326" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2326-0643"
                    />accusative, the reason is obvious why the object after the active verb is
                    often put in that case; it is because the action is supposed to proceed <hi
                    rend="italic">from</hi> the agent <hi rend="italic">to</hi> the patient. But the
                    same thing happens with respect to the dative case, and for the same reason.
                    Thus, <hi rend="italic">Antonius</hi><hi rend="italic">l&lt;es it</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ciceronem,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Antonius nocuit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ciceroni,</hi> are expressions of the same import; in each the
                    action of hurting is conceived as proceeding <hi rend="italic">from</hi> Antony
                    <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Cicero; and this is finely illustrated by the passive
                    form of such expressions, where the procedure above mentioned is expressly
                    marked by the preposition <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cicero</hi><hi rend="italic">nocetur,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cicero
                    loeditur</hi><hi rend="italic                     smallcaps"> λb</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Antonio.</hi> It is therefore not true that the accusative is that
                    case, at least the only case, which to an efficient nominative and a verb of
                    action subjoins either the effect or the passive subject; nor is the dative the
                    only case which is formed to express relations tending to itself. The only thing
                    <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> to these two cases is to denote the apposition
                    or junction of one object with another; and this they do nearly, if not
                    altogether, in the same manner, although from the custom of language they may
                    not be indifferently subjoined to the same verb.</p>
                <p>The Greek language has no <hi rend="italic">ablative</hi> case; but in the Latin,
                    where it is used, it denotes concomitancy, or that one tiling accompanies
                    another. From this concomitancy we sometimes draw an inference, and sometimes
                    not. For example, when it is said, <hi rend="italic">Templum clamore
                    petebant,</hi> clamour is represented as concomitant of their going to the
                    temple; but here no inference is drawn. From the phrase <hi rend="italic">palleo
                    metu,</hi> although nothing more is expressed than that paleness is a
                    concomitant of the fear, yet we instantly infer that it is also the effect of
                    the fear. In most instances where the ablative is used, an inference is drawn,
                    of which the foundation is some natural connection observed to subsist between
                    the objects thus connected in language. When this inference is not meant to be
                    drawn, the <hi rend="italic">preposition</hi> is commonly added; as, <hi
                    rend="italic">interfectus est</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> cum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gladio,</hi> he was slain with a sword <hi rend="italic"
                    >about</hi> him; <hi rend="italic">interfectus est gladio,</hi> he was slain
                    with a sword as the <hi rend="italic">instrument</hi> of his death.</p>
                <p>The remaining cases, which have not been noticed, are the nominative and the
                    vocative. These are in most instances alike in termination, which makes it
                    probable that they were originally one and the same case. The foundation of this
                    conjecture will appear from considering the use to which each of these cases is
                    applied. The nominative is employed to call up the idea of any object in the
                    mind of the hearer. But when a man hears his own name mentioned, his attention
                    is instantly roused, and he is naturally led to listen to what is to be said.
                    Hence, when one man meant particularly to solicit the attention of another, he
                    would naturally pronounce that other person’s name; and thus the nominative case
                    would pass into a vocative, of which the use is always to solicit
                    attention.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The chief
                    objection to this conjecture, that the nominative and vocative were originally
                    the same case, is taken from the Latin tongue, in which the nouns of the second
                    declension ending in <hi rend="italic">tu</hi> terminate their vocative in <hi
                    rend="italic">c.</hi> But this is easily accounted for. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> in such words was often dropped, as appears from the scanning of old
                    Latin poetry; when this was done, the u being short, would naturally in
                    pronunciation pass into c, a like short vowel; and thus, in the vocative case,
                    “would in time be written instead cfu</p></note></p>
                <p>The Greek and Latin among the ancient, and the German among the modern languages,
                    express different connections or relations of one thing with another by cases.
                    In English this is done for the most part by prepositions; but the English being
                    derived from the same origin as the German, that is, from the Teutonic, has at
                    least one variation of the substantive to answer the same purpose. For instance,
                    the relation of possession, or belonging, is often expressed by a different
                    ending of the substantive, which may be well called a case. This case answers
                    nearly to the genitive case in Latin; but as that is not a denomination
                    significant of the nature of the case in any language, it may perhaps in English
                    be more properly called the possessive case. Thus, <hi rend="italic">God’s
                    grace,</hi> anciently <hi rend="italic">Godis grace,</hi> is the grace belonging
                    to or in the possession of God; and may be likewise expressed by means of the
                    preposition, as, <hi rend="italic">the grace of God.</hi></p>
                <p>Although the word <hi rend="italic">Godis</hi> is as evidently an inflexion of
                    the noun <hi rend="italic">God</hi> as the word <hi rend="italic">Dei</hi> is an
                    inflexion of <hi rend="italic">Deus,</hi> there are grammarians who have denied
                    that in English there is any true inflexion of the original noun, and who have
                    said that the noun with the addition of that syllable which we consider as the
                    sign of a case, ceases to be a noun, and becomes a definitive; a word which with
                    them is devoid of signification. Thus, in the expression <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexander’s house,</hi> the word <hi rend="italic">Alexander’s</hi> stands not
                    as a <hi rend="italic">noun,</hi> but as an article or definitive, serving to
                    ascertain or point out the individuality of the house. But this is a palpable
                    mistake. The word <hi rend="italic">Alexanders</hi> serves not to point out the
                    individuality of the house, but to show to whom the house belongs; and is
                    therefore beyond dispute not an article, but a noun in the possessive case.
                    Again, when we say <hi rend="italic">St Peters</hi> at Rome and <hi
                    rend="italic">St Paul’s</hi> at London, the words <hi rend="italic">St
                    Peter's</hi> and <hi rend="italic">St Paul’s</hi> are neither articles, nor, as
                    has been absurdly imagined, the proper names of edifices, like the Rotunda or
                    the Circus, but they are, in the possessive case, the names of the two apostles
                    to whom the churches were dedicated, and to whom they are supposed to
                    belong.</p>
                <p>But that this, which we have called the possessive case, is really not so, must
                    be evident, it is said, because there are certain circumstances in which it
                    cannot be substituted for the noun with the preposition prefixed. Thus, though a
                    man may say, I speak of Alexander, I write of Caesar, I think of Pompey, he
                    cannot say, I speak Alexander’s, I write Caesar’s, or I think Pompey’s. This is
                    indeed true, but it is nothing to the purpose. For though I may say <hi
                    rend="italic">Loquor</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexandro, Scribo</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Casare, Cogito</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pompeio,</hi> I cannot say, <hi rend="italic">Loquor Alexandri, Scribo
                    Casaris,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cogito Pompeii</hi>; and therefore all that
                    can be jnferred from this argument is, that as the Latin genitive is not always
                    of the same import with the preposition <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> so the
                    English possessive is not always of the same import with the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">of.</hi> Upon the whole, then, we may conclude that English nouns
                    admit of one inflexion; and that though cases are not so essential to nouns as
                    gender and number, no language can be wholly without them or their various
                    powers.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Of Articles or Definitives.</hi></p>
                <p>The intention of language is to communicate thought, or to express those ideas
                    which are suggested to us by our senses external and internal. The ideas first
                    suggested to us are those of pain and pleasure, and of the objects with which we
                    are surrounded; and therefore the words first learned must be nouns, or the
                    names of objects natural, artificial, and abstract. Every object about which the
                    human mind can be conversant is strictly and properly speaking particular; for
                    all things in naturĕ differ from one another in numberless respects, which, not
                    to mention the idea of separate existence, so circumstance and individualize
                    them, that no one thing can be said to be another. Now the use of language being
                    to express our ideas or conceptions of these objects, it might naturally be
                    expected that every object should be distinguished by a proper name. This would
                    indeed be agreeable to the truth of things, but we have already seen that it is
                    altogether impracticable. Objects<pb break="no" facs="nls:193522339"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2339-0644"/> have therefore been classed into genera and
                    species; and names given, not to each individual, but to each genus and species.
                    By this contrivance of language, we are enabled to ascertain in some measure any
                    individual that may occur, and of which we know not the proper name, only by
                    referring it to the genus or species to which it belongs, and calling it by the
                    general or specific name; but as there is frequent occasion to distinguish
                    individuals of the same species from one another, it became necessary to fall
                    upon some expedient to mark this distinction. In many languages general and
                    specific terms are modified and restricted by three orders of words; the <hi
                    rend="italic">article,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">adjective,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">oblique cases of nouns.</hi> The cases of nouns we have already
                    considered; the adjective will employ our attention afterwards; at present our
                    observations are confined to the <hi rend="italic">article,</hi> a word so very
                    necessary, that without it, or at least some equivalent invention, men could not
                    employ nouns to any of the purposes of life, or indeed communicate their
                    thoughts at all. As the business of articles is to enable us, upon occasion, to
                    employ general terms to denote particular objects, they must be considered in
                    combination with the general terms as merely substitutes for proper names. They
                    have, however, been commonly called definitives; because they serve to define
                    and ascertain any particular object so as to distinguish it from the other
                    objects of the general class to which it belongs, and, of course, to denote its
                    individuality. Of words framed for this purpose, whether they have by
                    grammarians been termed articles or not, we know of no language that is wholly
                    destitute. The nature of them may be explained as follows.</p>
                <p>An object occurs with which, as an individual, we are totally unacquainted; it
                    has a head and limbs, and appears to possess the powers of self-motion and
                    sensation; we therefore refer it to its proper species, and call it a dog, a
                    horse, a lion, or the like. If it belongs to none of the species with which we
                    are acquainted, it cannot be called by any of their names; we then refer it to
                    the genus, and call it an animal.</p>
                <p>But this is not enough. The object at which we are looking, and which we want to
                    distinguish, is not a speoies or a genus, but an individual. Of what kind? Known
                    or unknown? Seen now for the first time, or seen before and now remembered? This
                    is one of the instances in which we shall discover the use of the two articles
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">the;</hi> for, in the case
                    supposed, the article <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> respects our primary
                    perception, and denotes an individual as unknown; whereas <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >the</hi> respects our secondary perception, and denotes individuals as known.
                    To explain this by an example: I see an object pass by which I never saw till
                    now: What do I say? There goes <hi rend="italic">a</hi> beggar with <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> long beard. The man departs and returns a week after: What
                    do I then say? There goes <hi rend="italic">the</hi> beggar with <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> long beard. Here the article only is changed; the rest
                    remains unaltered. Yet mark the force of this apparently minute change. The
                    individual once vague is now recognised as something known; and that merely by
                    the efficacy of this latter article, which tacitly insinuates a kind of previous
                    acquaintance, by referring a present perception to a like perception already
                    past.</p>
                <p>This is the explanation of the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">the</hi> as given by the learned Mr Harris, and thus far what
                    he says on the subject is certainly just; but it is not true that the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> always insinuates a previous acquaintance, or
                    refers a present perception to a like perception already past. I am in a room
                    crowded with company, of which the greater part is to me totally unknown; I feel
                    it difficult to breathe from the grossness of the enclosed atmosphere; and,
                    looking towards the window, I see in it a person whom I never saw before. I
                    instantly send my compliments to <hi rend="italic">the</hi> gentleman in the
                    window, and request that, if it be not inconvenient, he will have the goodness
                    to let a little fresh air into the r∞m. Of this gentleman I have no previous
                    acquaintance; my present perception of him is my primary perception, and yet it
                    would have been extremely improper to send my compliments to <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> gentleman in the window. Again, there would be no impropriety in saying,
                    <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">A</hi> man whom I saw yesterday
                    exhibiting a show to the rabble was this morning committed to jail charged with
                    the crime of housebreaking.” Notwithstanding the authority, therefore, of Mr
                    Harris, and his master Apollonius, we may venture to affirm, that it is not
                    essential to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> to respect a primary
                    perception, or to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> to indicate a
                    pre-established acquaintance. Such may indeed be the manner in which these words
                    are most frequently used; but we see that there are instances in which they may
                    be used differently. What, then, it may be asked, is the import of each article,
                    and in what respects do they differ?</p>
                <p>We answer, that the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >the</hi> are both of them definitives, as, by being prefixed to the names of
                    genera and species, they so circumscribe the latitude of those names as to make
                    them for the most part denote individuals. A noun or substantive, without any
                    article to limit it, is taken in its widest sense. Thus the word man means all
                    mankind;</p>
                <p>The proper study of mankind is man; where <hi rend="italic">manhind</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">man</hi> may change places without making any alteration in the
                    sense. But let either of the articles of which we are treating be prefixed to
                    the word <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> and that word is immediately reduced from
                    the name of a whole genus to denote only a single individual; and instead of the
                    noble truth which this line asserts, the poet will be made to say, that the
                    proper study of mankind is not the common nature which is diffused through the
                    whole human race, but the manners and caprices of one individual. Thus far
                    therefore the two articles agree; but they differ in this, that though they both
                    limit the specific name to some individual, the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a</hi> leaves the individual itself unascertained; whereas the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">the</hi> ascertains the individual also, and can be prefixed to
                    the specific name only when an individual is intended of which something may be
                    predicated that distinguishes it from the other individuals of the species.
                    Thus, if I say, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> man is fit for treasons, my assertion
                    may appear strange and vague; the sentence, however, is complete, and wants
                    nothing to make it intelligible; but if I say, <hi rend="italic">the</hi> man is
                    fit for treasons, I speak nonsense; for as the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >the</hi> shows that I mean some particular man, it will be impossible to
                    discover my meaning till I complete the sentence, and predicate something of the
                    individual intended to distinguish him from other individuals.</p>
                <p>The man that hath not music in himself.... Is fit for treasons.</p>
                <p>A man, therefore, means some one or other of the human race indefinitely; <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> man means, definitely, that particular man who is spoken
                    of. The former is called the indefinite, the latter the definite, article.</p>
                <p>The two articles differ likewise in this respect, that as the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a</hi> serves only to separate one individual object from the
                    general class to which it belongs, it cannot be applied to plurals. It has
                    indeed the same signification nearly with the numerical word <hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in French and Italian the same word that
                    denotes unity is also the article of which we now treat. But the essence of the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> being to define objects, by pointing them
                    out as those of which something is affirmed or denied which is not affirmed or
                    denied of the other objects of the same class, it is equally applicable to both
                    numbers; for things may be predicated of one set of men, as well as of a single
                    man, which cannot be predicated of other men. The use <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522352" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2352-0645"/>and import of each article
                    will appear from the following example: “<hi rend="italic">Man</hi> was made for
                    society, and ought to extend his good will to <hi rend="italic">all men</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but <hi rend="italic">a man</hi> will naturally entertain a
                    more particular regard for <hi rend="italic">the men</hi> with whom he has the
                    most frequent intercourse, and enter into a still closer union with <hi
                    rend="italic">the man</hi> whose temper and disposition suit best with his
                    own.”</p>
                <p>We have said that the article <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> cannot be applied to
                    plurals, because it denotes unity. But to this rule there is apparently a
                    remarkable exception in the use of the adjectives <hi rend="italic">few</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">many</hi> (the latter chiefly with the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >great</hi> before it), which, though joined with plural substantives, yet admit
                    of the singular article <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>: as, <hi rend="italic">a few
                    men, a great many men.</hi> The reason of this is manifest from the effect which
                    the article has in these phrases. It means a small or a great number
                    collectively taken, to which it gives the idea of a whole, that is, of unity.
                    Thus likewise <hi rend="italic">a hundred, a thousand,</hi> is one whole number,
                    an aggregate of many collectively taken, and therefore still retains the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a,</hi> though joined as an adjective to a plural
                    substantive; as, <hi rend="italic">a hundred years.</hi> The exception therefore
                    is only apparent; and we may affirm that the article <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>
                    universally denotes unity.</p>
                <p>The indefinite article is much less useful than the other; and therefore the
                    Greek and Hebrew languages have it not, though they have both a definite
                    article. In languages of which the nouns, adjectives, and verbs, have inflexion,
                    no mistake can arise from the want of the indefinite article; because it can
                    always be known by the terminations of the noun and the verb, and by the
                    circumstances predicated of the noun, whether a whole species or one individual
                    be intended. But this is not the case in English. In that language, the
                    adjectives having no variation with respect to gender or number, and the tenses
                    of the verbs being for the most part the same in both numbers, it might be often
                    doubtful, had we not the indefinite article, whether the specific name was
                    intended to express the whole species or only one individual. Thus, if we say in
                    English, <hi rend="italic">man was born sent from God,</hi> we must be
                    understood to mean that the birth of <hi rend="italic">every</hi> man is from
                    God, because to the specific term the indefinite article is not prefixed. Yet
                    the words, Eyire7o <hi rend="italic">àmera×µswí m¢a</hi> Θ∣of∕, convey no such
                    meaning to any person acquainted with the Greek language; as the word άτακτος,
                    without any article, is restricted to an individual by its concord with the verb
                    and the participle; and the sense of the passage is, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a</hi><hi rend="italic">man was born, or existed, sent from God.</hi> But
                    though the <hi rend="italic">Greeks</hi> have no article corresponding to the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">a,</hi> yet nothing can be more nearly related than
                    their Ό to our <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi>; '0 ßcur/Xru¢, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >the</hi><hi rend="italic">king,</hi> T0 δωjor, <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gift.</hi> In one respect, indeed, the Greek and English articles
                    differ. The former is varied according to the gender and number of the noun with
                    which it is associated, being <hi rend="italic">i, masculine, ⅛,
                    feminine,</hi><hi rend="italic">τ»,</hi><hi rend="italic">neuter,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ai, ai,</hi><hi rend="italic">ra,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >plural number</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whereas the English article suffers
                    no change, being invariably <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> before nouns of every
                    gender and in both numbers. There are, however, some modern languages which, in
                    imitation of the Greek, admit of a variation of their article which relates to
                    gender; but this cannot be considered as essential to this species of words, and
                    it may be questioned whether it be an improvement to the language. In tongues of
                    which the nouns have no inflexion, it can only serve to perplex and confuse, as
                    it always presents a particular idea of sex where in many cases it is not
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>The articles already mentioned are allowed to be strictly and properly such by
                    every grammarian; but there are some words, such as <hi rend="italic">this,
                    that, any, some, all, other, &amp;c.</hi> which are generally said to be
                    sometimes articles and sometimes pronouns, according to the different modes of
                    using them. That words should change their nature in this manner, so as to
                    belong sometimes to one part of speech and sometimes to another, must appear
                    very extraordinary; and if it were a fact, language would be a thing so
                    equivocal, that all inquiries into its nature, upon principles of science and
                    reason, would be vain. But we cannot perceive any such fluctuation in any word
                    whatever; though we know it to be a general charge brought against words of
                    almost every denomination, of which we have already seen one instance in the
                    possessive case of nouns, and shall now see another in those words which are
                    commonly called pronominal articles.</p>
                <p>If it be true, as we acknowledge it to be, that the genuine <hi rend="italic"
                    >pronoun</hi> always stands by itself, assuming the power of a noun, and
                    supplying its place, then is it certain that the words <hi rend="italic">this,
                    that, any, some,</hi> &lt;⅛c. can never be <hi rend="italic">pronouns.</hi> We
                    are indeed told, that when we say <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is virtue, give me
                    <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> the words <hi rend="italic">this</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> are pronouns; but that when we say, <hi rend="italic"
                    >this habit</hi> is virtue, <hi rend="italic">that man</hi> defrauded me, then
                    are they articles or definitives. This, however, is evidently a mistake
                    occasioned by overlooking those abbreviations in construction which are frequent
                    in every language, and which, on account of that very frequency, have perhaps
                    escaped the attention of grammarians whose sagacity has been successfully
                    employed on matters less obvious. When we say <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is
                    virtue, it is evident that we communicate no intelligence till we add a
                    substantive to the word <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> and declare what is virtue.
                    The word <hi rend="italic">this</hi> can therefore in no instance assume the
                    power of a noun, since the noun to which it relates, though for the sake of
                    dispatch it may be omitted in writing or conversation, must always be supplied
                    by the mind of the reader or hearer, to make the sentence intelligible, or <hi
                    rend="italic">this</hi> itself of any importance. When we have viewed speech
                    analysed, we may then consider it as compounded. And here, in the first place,
                    we may contemplate that synthesis which by combining simple terms produces a
                    truth; then by combining two truths produces a third; and thus others and others
                    in continued demonstration, till we are led, as by a road, to the regions of
                    science. Now <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is that superior and most excellent
                    synthesis which alone applies itself to our intellect or reason, and which to
                    conduct according to rule constitutes the art of logic. After <hi rend="italic"
                    >this</hi> we may turn to those inferior compositions which are productive of
                    the pathetic, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> Here, if any where, the word <hi
                    rend="italic">this</hi> may be thought to stand by itself, and to assume the
                    power of a noun; but let any man complete the construction of each sentence, and
                    he will perceive that <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is no more than a definite
                    article. Thus, we may contemplate that synthesis which by combining simple terms
                    produces a truth; then by combining two truths produces a third truth; and thus
                    other truths and other truths in continued demonstration, till we are led, as by
                    a road, into the regions of science. Now <hi rend="italic">this</hi> combination
                    of truths is that superior and most excellent synthesis which alone applies
                    itself to our intellect or reason, and which to conduct according to rule
                    constitutes the art of logic. After we have contemplated <hi rend="italic"
                    >this</hi> art, we may turn, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">that</hi> is generally considered as still more
                    equivocal than <hi rend="italic">this</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for it is
                    said to be sometimes an article, sometimes a pronoun, and sometimes a
                    conjunction. In the following extract it appears in all these capacities; and
                    yet, upon resolving the passage into parts, and completing the construction, it
                    will be ſouud to be invariably a definite article. “It is necessary to <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> perfection, of which our present state is capable, <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> the mind and body should both be kept in action; <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> neither the faculties of the one nor of the other be
                    suffered to grow lax or torpid for want of use; but neither should health be
                    purchased by voluntary submission to ignorance, nor should knowledge be
                    cultivated at the expense of health; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522365"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2365-0646"/>for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> muet enable it
                    either tð give pleasure to its possessor, or assistance to others.” If this long
                    sentence be resolved into its constituent parts, and the words be supplied which
                    complete the construction, we shall see the import of the word <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">that</hi> to be precisely the same in each clause. “The mind
                    and body should both be kept in action; <hi rend="italic">that</hi> action is
                    necessary to <hi rend="italic">that</hi> perfection of which our present state
                    is capable; neither the faculties of the one nor of the other should be suffered
                    to grow lax or torpid for want of use: the degree of action proper to prevent
                    <hi rend="italic">that</hi> laxness is necessary; but neither should health be
                    purchased by voluntary submission to ignorance, nor should knowledge be
                    cultivated at the expense of health; for <hi rend="italic">that</hi> health must
                    enable it either to give pleasure to its possessor, or assistance to others.”
                    Again:</p>
                <p>He that’s unskilful will not toss a ball.</p>
                <p>A man unskilful (he is <hi rend="italic">that)</hi> will not toss a ball. Here
                    the word <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> though substituted for what is called the
                    relative pronoun, still preserves unchanged its definitive import; and in every
                    instance, except where it may be used very improperly, it will be found to be
                    neither more nor less than a definitive article.</p>
                <p>It appears, then, that if the essence of an article be to define and ascertain,
                    the words <hi rend="italic">this</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> as well
                    as <hi rend="italic">any, some, all,</hi> &amp;c. which are commonly called
                    pronominal articles, are much more properly articles than any thing else, and as
                    such should be considered in universal grammar. Thus, when we say, <hi
                    rend="italic">this</hi> picture I approve, but <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I
                    dislike, what do w e perform by the help of the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >this</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> but bring down the common
                    appellative to denote two individuals, the one as the more near, the other as
                    the more distant? So when we say, <hi rend="smallcaps">some</hi> men are
                    virtuous, but <hi rend="smallcaps">all</hi> men are mortal; what is the natural
                    effect of this <hi rend="italic">all</hi> and <hi rend="italic">some,</hi> but
                    to define that universality and that particularity which would remain indefinite
                    were we to take them away? The same thing is evident in such sentences as, “<hi
                    rend="smallcaps">some</hi> substances have sensation, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >others</hi> want it; choose <hi rend="smallcaps">any</hi> way of acting, and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">some</hi> men will find fault,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >&amp;c.</hi> For here <hi rend="italic">some, other,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >any</hi> serve all of them to define different parts of a given whole; <hi
                    rend="italic">some,</hi> to denote any indeterminate part; <hi rend="italic"
                    >any,</hi> to denote any indefinite mode of action, no matter what; and <hi
                    rend="italic">other,</hi> to denote the remaining part, when a part has been
                    assumed already.</p>
                <p>We have ’ said that the article is a part of speech so very necessary, that
                    without it, or some equivalent invention,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>As in the Persian and other eastern languages, in which the
                    place of our indefinite article is supplied by a termination to those nouns
                    which are meant to be particularized.</p></note> mankind could not communicate
                    their thoughts; and that of words falling under this description we know of no
                    language which is wholly destitute. We are aware that these positions may be
                    controverted; and that the Latin may be instanced as a language which, without
                    articles, is not only capable of communicating the ordinary thoughts of the
                    speaker to the mind of the hearer, but which, in the hands of Cicero, Virgil,
                    and Lucretius, was made to serve all the purposes of the most profound
                    philosopher, the most impassioned orator, and the most sublime poet. That the
                    Latin has been made to serve all these purposes cannot be denied, although
                    Lucretius and Cicero both complain, that on the subject of philosophy, where the
                    use of articles is most conspicuous, it is a deficient language. But should we
                    grant what cannot be demanded, that these two great men were unacquainted with
                    the powers of their native tongue, our positions would still remain unshaken;
                    for we deny that the Latin is wholly without articles. It has indeed no word of
                    precisely the same import with our <hi rend="italic">the</hi> or the Greek «;
                    but the place of the indefinite article <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> might be
                    always supplied, if necessary, with the numerical word <hi rend="italic"
                    >unus.</hi> It may be so even in English; for we believe there is not a single
                    instance where the words <hi rend="italic">one man, one horse, one virtue,</hi>
                    might not be substituted for the words <hi rend="italic">a man, a horse, a
                    virtue,</hi> without in the slightest degree altering the sense of the passage
                    where such words occur. This substitution, however, can be but seldom or never
                    necessary in the Latin tongue, of which the precision is much greater than that
                    of the English would be without articles, because the oblique cases of the Latin
                    nouns, and the inflexion of its verbs, will almost always enable the reader to
                    determine whether an appellative represents a whole species or a single
                    individual. The want of the definite article <hi rend="italic">the</hi> seems to
                    be a greater defect; yet there are few instances in which its place might not be
                    supplied by <hi rend="italic">this</hi> or by <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
                    without obscuring the sense; and the Latin tongue is by no means deficient of
                    articles corresponding to these two. Let us substitute the words <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the</hi> in some of the foregoing examples, and we
                    shall find, though the sound may be uncouth, the sense will remain. Thus, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">That</hi> man who hath not music in himself....</p>
                <p>Is fit for treasons, conveys to the mind of the reader the very same sentiment
                    which the poet expresses by the words <hi rend="italic">the</hi> man that hath
                    not music, &amp;c. Again, <hi rend="italic">Man</hi> was made for society, and
                    ought to extend his good will to <hi rend="italic">all men</hi>; but <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> man will naturally entertain a more particular regard for
                    <hi rend="italic">those men</hi> with whom he has the most frequent intercourse,
                    and enter into a closer union with <hi rend="italic">that man</hi> whose temper
                    and disposition suit best with his own. Now the words <hi rend="italic">hie</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">ille</hi> being exactly of the same import with the words
                    <hi rend="italic">this</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> it follows, that
                    wherever the place of the article <hi rend="italic">the</hi> may in English be
                    supplied by <hi rend="italic">this or</hi> by <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> it
                    may in Latin be supplied by <hi rend="italic">hie</hi> or by <hi rend="italic"
                    >Me.</hi> This is the case with respect to Nathan’s reproof of David, where the
                    definite article is indeed most emphatical. The original words might have been
                    translated into English, “thou art <hi rend="italic">that</hi> man,” as well as
                    “thou art <hi rend="italic">the</hi> man ;” and in Latin they may with the
                    utmost propriety be rendered, “Tu es <hi rend="italic">ille</hi> homo." Indeed
                    the words <hi rend="italic">hie</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ille,</hi> and we
                    might instance many more, though they are commonly called pronouns, are in truth
                    nothing but definite articles. <hi rend="italic">The</hi> is evidently ex«; and
                    <hi rend="italic">ille</hi> is most probably derived from the Hebrew word <hi
                    rend="italic">al,</hi> in the plural <hi rend="italic">ale,</hi> which may be
                    translated indifferently, either <hi rend="italic">the</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >that.</hi> But, what proves beyond dispute that these words are not pronouns,
                    but articles, is, that in no single instance will they be found to stand by
                    themselves and assume the power of nouns. For the sake of dispatch, or to avoid
                    disagreeable repetitions, the noun may indeed be often omitted; but it is always
                    supplied by the reader or hearer, when <hi rend="italic">hie</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ille</hi> appear in their proper place, and are seen to be
                    invariably definitive articles. We shall give an example of the use of each
                    word, and dismiss the subject in the first oration against Catiline, Cicero
                    begins with addressing himself in a very impassioned style to the traitor, who
                    was present in the senate-house. He then exclaims pathetically against the
                    manners of the age, and proceeds in these words: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Senatus</hi><hi rend="italic">h&lt;εc inteUigit, consul</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >videt,</hi> Hic <hi rend="italic">tamen vivit. Vivit</hi><hi rend="italic">ĩ
                    immo</hi><hi rend="italic">vero etiam in senatum venit; fit publici consilii
                    particeps.</hi> In this passage <hi rend="italic">hic</hi> cannot be a pronoun;
                    for from the beginning of the oration there occurs not a single noun of which it
                    can possibly supply the place. When the orator uttered it, he was probably
                    pointing with his finger at Catiline, and every <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522378" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2378-0647"/>one of his audience would
                    supply the noun in his own mind, as we do when we translate it, “<hi
                    rend="italic">yet</hi> this traitor lives.” When Virgil says, <hi rend="italic"
                    >lUe</hi> ego, qui quondam gracili modulatus avena</p>
                <p>Carmen, it is obvious that he means, I am <hi rend="italic">that man,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">that poet,</hi> who sung, &amp;c.; and though we may translate the
                    words “I am <hi rend="italic">he</hi> who tuned his song,” yet when we construe
                    the passage we are under the necessity of supplying either <hi rend="italic"
                    >vates</hi> or <hi rend="italic">vir,</hi> which shows that <hi rend="italic"
                    >tile</hi> is nothing more than a definite article signifying <hi rend="italic"
                    >that oτ the.</hi> It appears, then, that the Latin tongue is not wholly
                    destitute of articles, as few cases can occur where the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> and our <hi rend="italic">the</hi> may not be supplied by the words <hi
                    rend="italic">hie</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ille,</hi> which have in our
                    opinion been very improperly termed pronouns. If there be any such cases, we can
                    only confess that the Latin language is defective; whereas, had it no articles,
                    it is not easy to conceive how it could answer, to a cultivated people, the
                    ordinary purposes of speech.</p>
                <p>The articles <hi rend="italic">this</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> unlike
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the,</hi> are varied according as
                    the noun, with which they are associated, is in the singular or in the plural
                    number. Thus we say, <hi rend="italic">this</hi> and <hi rend="italic">that
                    man</hi> in the singular, and <hi rend="italic">these</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >those men</hi> in the plural. The Latin articles <hi rend="italic">hie</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">ille,</hi> for such we will call them, are varied, like the
                    Greek », not only with the number, but also with the gender of their nouns. In
                    languages where the structure of a sentence may be so changed from the order of
                    nature, as it commonly is in Greek and Latin, and where the reader is guided,
                    not by the position, but by the terminations of the words, to those which are in
                    concord and those which are not, these variations of the articles have their
                    use; but in English they are of no importance. Were it not that the custom of
                    the language, the <hi rend="italic">forma</hi><hi rend="italic">loquendi</hi> as
                    Horace calls it, has determined otherwise, there would be no more impropriety in
                    saying <hi rend="italic">this</hi> or <hi rend="italic">that men,</hi> than in
                    saying <hi rend="italic">some men</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the</hi></p>
                <p>As articles are by their nature definitives, it follows of course that they
                    cannot be united with such words as are in their own nature as definite as they
                    may be, nor with such words as, being undefinable, cannot properly be made
                    otherwise; but only with those words which, though indefinite, are yet capable
                    through the article of becoming definite. Hence the reason why it is absurd to
                    say, <hi rend="italic">the I</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the thou,</hi> because
                    nothing, as will be seen afterwards, can make these pronouns more definite than
                    they are of themselves; and the same may be said of proper names. Neither can we
                    say, <hi rend="italic">the both,</hi> because the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >both</hi> is in its own nature perfectly defined. Thus if it be said, “I have
                    read both poets,” this plainly indicates a definite pair, of whom some mention
                    has been made already. On the contrary, if it be said, “I have read two poets,”
                    this may mean any pair out of all that ever existed. And hence the numeral being
                    in this sense indefinite, as indeed are all others as well as itself, is forced
                    to assume the article whenever it would become definite. Hence also it is that
                    as <hi rend="italic">two,</hi> when taken alone, has reference to some primary
                    and indefinite perception, whilst the article <hi rend="italic">the</hi> has
                    reference to some perception secondary and definite, it is bad language to say
                    <hi rend="italic">two the men,</hi> as this would be blending of incompatibles,
                    that is, it would be representing two men as defined and undefined at the same
                    time. On the contrary, to say, <hi rend="italic">both the men,</hi> is good
                    language; because the substantive cannot possibly be less apt, by being defined,
                    to coalesce with a numeral adjective which is defined as well as itself. So
                    likewise it is correct to say, <hi rend="italic">the two men, these two
                    men,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">those two men·,</hi> because here the article,
                    being placed at the beginning, extends its power as well through the numeral
                    adjective as the substantive, and tends equally to define thern both.</p>
                <p>As some cf the above words admit of no article because they are by nature as
                    definite as may be, so there are others which admit it not because they are not
                    to be defined at all. of this sort are all <hi rend="italic"
                    >interrogatives.</hi> If we question about substances, we cannot say, <hi
                    rend="italic">the who is this,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">who is this</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">?</hi> And the same both as to qualities and quantities; for we
                    say, without an article, <hi rend="italic">what sort of, how many, how
                    great</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> The reason is, the article <hi rend="italic"
                    >the</hi> respects beings of which we can predicate something; but
                    interrogatives respect beings about which we are ignorant, and of which we can
                    therefore predicate nothing; for as to what we know, interrogation is
                    superfluous. In a word, the natural associates of articles are <hi rend="italic"
                    >all those common appellatives which denote the several genera and species of
                    beings;</hi> and it may be questioned whether in strictness of speech they are
                    ever associated with any other words.</p>
                <p>We have said that proper names admit not of the article, being in their own
                    nature definite. This is true, whilst each name is confined to one individual;
                    but as different persons often go by the same name, it is necessary to
                    distinguish these from one another, to prevent the ambiguity which this identity
                    of name would otherwise occasion. For this purpose we are obliged to have
                    recourse to adjectives or epithets. For example, there were two Grecian chiefs
                    who bore the name of Ajax; and it was not without reason that Mnestheus used
                    epithets when his intention was to distinguish the one from the other. “If both
                    <hi rend="italic">Ajaxes</hi> cannot be spared,” said he, “at least let mighty
                    Telamonian Ajax come.” But as epithets are diffused through various subjects, in
                    as much as the same adjective may be referred to many substantives, it has been
                    said to be necessary, in order to render both parts of speech equally definite,
                    that the adjective itself assume an article before it, which may indicate a
                    reference to some single person only. It is thus we say, Trypho <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> Grammarian, Apollodorus <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                    Cyrenian, &amp;c. This is the doctrine of Mr Harris, from which, with the
                    highest respect for the learning of the author, we feel ourselves obliged to
                    dissent. In the examples given, the article <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> is
                    certainly not associated with the words Grammarian and Cyrenian, in the same
                    manner in which it is associated with the word <hi rend="italic">man</hi> in the
                    sentence, “The man that hath not music in himself.” When we say Apollodorus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">the</hi> Cyrenian, we may, without folly or impertinence, be
                    asked, the Cyrenian <hi rend="italic">what î</hi> And the moment this question
                    is answered, it will be seen that the article defines, not an adjective, but a
                    substantive. If the answer be, the Cyrenian philosopher, the article <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> is associated with the word philosopher, and the phrase
                    Apollodorus <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> Cyrenian is an abbreviation of
                    Apollodorus <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> philosopher of Cyrene. In like manner,
                    Trypho <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> grammarian, is Trypho <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >the</hi> grammarian writer, or Trypho <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi> writer of
                    grammar. Such abbreviations are very common. We say familiarly <hi rend="italic"
                    >the Speaker,</hi> and are understood to mean a high officer in the British
                    parliament; yet as speaker is a name common to many men, we may without
                    impropriety be asked, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> speaker we mean; and if so, we
                    must reply, <hi rend="italic">the Speaker of the House of Commons.</hi> But that
                    which is eminent is supposed to be generally known; and therefore, in common
                    language, <hi rend="italic">the speaker</hi> is deemed a sufficient designation
                    of him who presides over the lower house of parliament. Hence, by an easy
                    transition, the definite article, from denoting reference, comes to denote
                    eminence also; that is to say, from implying an ordinary preacquaintance, to
                    presume a kind of general and universal notoriety. Thus <hi rend="italic">a
                    king</hi> is any king, but <hi rend="italic">the king</hi> is that person whom
                    we acknowledge as our sovereign, the king of Great Britain. In Greek, too, as in
                    English, the article is often a mark of eminence; for íAE <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poet</hi> meant Homer, and <hi rend="italic">the Stagyrite</hi> meant
                    Aristotle; not but that there were many poets besides Homer, and many stagyrites
                    besides Aristotle, but none equally illustrious.</p>

                <p>Before we dismiss the <hi rend="italic">Article,</hi> we shall produce one
                    example to show the utility of this species of words; which, although they may
                    seem to be of small importance, yet, when properly applied, serve to make a few
                    general terms sufficient for expressing with accuracy all the various objects
                    about which mankind can have occasion to converse. Let <hi rend="italic"
                    >man</hi> be the general term, which I have occasion to employ <hi rend="italic"
                    >for</hi> the purpose of denoting some particular. Let it be required to express
                    this particular as unknown, I say <hi rend="italic">a</hi> man; known, I say <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi> man; definite, <hi rend="italic">a certain</hi> man;
                    indefinite, <hi rend="italic">any</hi> man; present and near, <hi rend="italic"
                    >this</hi> man; present and at some distance, <hi rend="italic">that</hi> man;
                    like to some other, <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a man; different from some
                    other, <hi rend="italic">another</hi> man; an indefinite multitude, <hi
                    rend="italic">many</hi> men; a definite multitude, <hi rend="italic">a
                    thousand</hi> men; the ones of a multitude taken throughout, <hi rend="italic"
                    >every</hi> man; the same ones taken with distinction, <hi rend="italic"
                    >each</hi> man; taken in order, <hi rend="italic">first</hi> man, <hi
                    rend="italic">second</hi> man, &amp;c.; the whole multitude of particulars taken
                    collectively, <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men; the negation of that multitude,
                    <hi rend="italic">no</hi> man; a number of particulars present and near, <hi
                    rend="italic">these</hi> men; at some distance, or opposed to others, <hi
                    rend="italic">those</hi> men; a number of individuals separated from another
                    number, <hi rend="italic">other</hi> men; a small indefinite number, <hi
                    rend="italic">few</hi> men; a proportionally greater number, <hi rend="italic"
                    >more</hi> men; a smaller number, <hi rend="italic">fewer</hi> men. And so we
                    might proceed on almost to infinitude. But not to dwell longer upon this
                    subject, we shall only remark, that minute changes in principles lead to mighty
                    changes in effects; so that principles are well entitled to regard, however
                    trivial they may appear.</p>
                <p>III.— <hi rend="italic">Of Pronouns, or Substantives of the second
                    order.</hi></p>
                <p>To men who are neither intoxicated with their own abilities, nor ambitious of the
                    honour of building new systems, little pleasure can accrue from differing upon
                    points of science from writers of great and deserved reputation. In such
                    circumstances a man of modesty, although he will not upon the authority of a
                    celebrated name adopt an opinion of which he perceives not the truth, must
                    always advance his own notions with some degree of diffidence, as being
                    conscious that the truth which he cannot perceive, may be visible to a keener
                    and more perspicacious eye. In these circumstances we feel ourselves with regard
                    to some of the most celebrated writers on grammar, from whom, concerning one or
                    two points, comparatively indeed of but little importance, we have already been
                    compelled reluctantly to differ. In treating of pronouns we are likely to
                    deviate still farther from the beaten track; but that we may not be accused of
                    acting the part of dogmatists in literature, and of claiming from others that
                    implicit confidence which we refuse to give, we shall state with fairness the
                    commonly received opinions, point out in what respects we think them erroneous,
                    assign our reasons for calling them in question, and leave our readers to judge
                    for themselves. The most celebrated writer in English who has treated of
                    pronouns, and whom, since the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi>
                    most other writers have implicitly followed, is Mr Harris, who, after a short
                    introduction, proceeds thus :—</p>
                <p>“All conversation passes between individuals, who will often happen to be till
                    that instant unacquainted with each other. What, then, is to be done? How shall
                    the speaker address the other, when he knows not his name? or how explain
                    himself by his own name, of which the other is wholly ignorant? Nouns, as they
                    have been described, cannot answer this purpose. The first expedient upon this
                    occasion seems to have been pointing, or indicating by the finger or hand; some
                    traces of which are still to be observed, as a part of that action which
                    naturally attends our speaking. But the authors of language were not content
                    with this. They invented a race of words to supply this pointing; which words,
                    as they always stood for substantives or nouns, were characterized by the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">pronouns.</hi> These also they distinguished into three
                    several sorts, calling them pronouns of the first, the second, and the third
                    person, with a view to certain distinctions, which may be explained as follows
                    :—</p>
                <p>“Suppose the parties conversing to be wholly unacquainted, neither name nor
                    countenance on either side known, and the subject of the conversation to be the
                    speaker himself. Here, to supply the place of pointing by a word of equal power,
                    the inventors of language furnished the speaker with the pronoun I; <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> write, <hi rend="italic">1</hi> say, <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> desire, &amp;c.; and as the speaker is always principal with respect to
                    his own discourse, this they called, for that reason, the pronoun of the first
                    person.</p>
                <p>“Again, suppose the subject of the conversation to be the party addressed. Here,
                    for similar reasons, they invented the pronoun <hi rend="italic">thou; thou</hi>
                    writest, <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> walkest, &amp;c. And as the party addressed
                    is next in dignity to the speaker, or at least comes next with reference to the
                    discourse, this pronoun they therefore called the pronoun of the second
                    person.</p>
                <p>“Lastly, suppose the subject of conversation neither the speaker nor the party
                    addressed, but some third object different from both. Here they provided another
                    pronoun, <hi rend="italic">he, she,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">it</hi>; which, in
                    distinction to the two former, was called the pronoun of the third person. And
                    thus it was that pronouns came to be distinguished by their respective <hi
                    rend="italic">persons."</hi></p>
                <p>The description of the different <hi rend="italic">persons</hi> here given is
                    taken, we are told, from Priscian, who took it from Apollonius. But whatever be
                    the deference due to these ancient masters, their learned pupil, though guided
                    by them, seems not to have hit upon the true and distinguishing characteristic
                    of the personal pronouns. He supposes, that when the names of two persons
                    conversing together are known to each other, they may, by the use of these
                    names, express all that the personal pronouns express; but this is certainly not
                    true. To us, at least, there appears to be a very material difference between
                    saying “George did this,” and “I did this nor do we think that the power of the
                    pronoun would be completely supplied by the name, even with the additional aid
                    of indication by the hand. So, when one man says to another with whom he is
                    conversing, “James did so and so it is surely not equivalent to his saying “You
                    did so and so.” If such were the case, one might pertinently ask, when both
                    persons are known to each other, Why do they use the personal pronouns? Mr
                    Harris tells us, that “when the subject of conversation is the speaker himself,
                    he uses 1; and when it is the party addressed, he uses <hi rend="italic"
                    >thou."</hi> But, in fact, the nature of the personal pronouns has no sort of
                    connection with the subject of conversation, whether that conversation relate to
                    the speaker, the party addressed, or a Greek book. In this sentence, “I say that
                    the three angles of every triangle are equal to two right angles,” the speaker
                    is surely not the subject of the discourse; nor is the party addressed, but the
                    truth of his assertion, the subject of discourse in the following sentence: “<hi
                    rend="italic">You</hi> say, that Horne Tooke’s Diversions of Purley is the most
                    masterly treatise on grammar, as far as it goes, that you have ever seen.” Mr
                    Harris uses the phrase “becoming the subject of conversation,” in no other sense
                    than that when the speaker has occasion to mention <hi rend="italic"
                    >himself,</hi> he uses I; when the party addressed, <hi rend="italic"
                    >thou</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when some other person or thing, <hi
                    rend="italic">he, she,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">it.</hi> But we know that he
                    may use other words by no means equivalent to the two first of these pronouns,
                    which will sufficiently mark himself, and the party addressed; and that he may
                    use indifferently, and without the smallest injury to the sense, either the
                    third pronoun, or the word for <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522404"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2404-0649"/>which it is merely a substitute. A man who
                    sustains various characters may design himself by any one of them. Thus Mr Pitt
                    might have spoken of himself as the firsl lord of the treasury, chancellor of
                    the exchequer, or member for the university of Cambridge; and in each case he
                    would have been what Mr Harris calls the subject of conversation; yet every one
                    feels that none of these designations would have been equivalent to I. What,
                    then, is the force of the personal pronouns?</p>
                <p>It appears to be simply this: The first denotes the speaker, <hi rend="italic">as
                    characterised by the present act of speaking,</hi> in contradistinction to every
                    other character which he may bear. The second denotes the party addressed, as
                    <hi rend="italic">characterised by the present circumstance of being
                    addressed,</hi> in contradistinction to every other character. And what is
                    called the pronoun of the third person is merely a <hi rend="italic">negation of
                    the other two,</hi> as the neuter gender is a negation of the masculine and
                    feminine. If this account of the personal pronouns be true, and we flatter
                    ourselves that its truth will be obvious to every body, there is but one way of
                    expressing by other words the force of the pronouns of the first and second
                    person. Thus, “The person who now speaks to you did so and so,” is equivalent to
                    “Zdid so and so and “The person to whom I now address myself did so and so,” is
                    equivalent to <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">You</hi> did so and
                    so.”</p>
                <p>Hence we see why it is improper to say the <hi rend="italic">I</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">thou</hi>; for each of these pronouns has of itself the force of a
                    noun with the definite article prefixed, and denotes a person of whom something
                    is predicted, which distinguishes him from all other persons. <hi rend="italic"
                    >I</hi> is the person who now speaks, <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> is the person
                    who is now addressed by the speaker. Hence too we see the reason why the pronoun
                    Zis said to be of the first, and the pronoun <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> of the
                    second person. These pronouns can have place only in conversation, or when a
                    man, in the character of a public speaker, addressee himself to an audience; but
                    it is obvious that there must be a speaker before there can be a hearer; and
                    therefore, that the pronouns may follow the order of nature, <hi rend="italic"
                    >I,</hi> which denotes the person of the speaker, must take place of <hi
                    rend="italic">thou,</hi> which denotes the person of the hearer. Now the speaker
                    and the hearer being the only persons engaged in conversation or declamation,
                    <hi rend="italic">I</hi> is with great propriety called the pronoun of the
                    first, and <hi rend="italic">thou</hi> the pronoun of the second person. We have
                    said, that with respect to pronouns, the third person, as it is called, is
                    merely a negative of the other two. This is evident from the slightest attention
                    to the import of those Words which are called pronouns of the third person. <hi
                    rend="italic">He, s∕ιe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> denotes not the
                    person either of the speaker or of the hearer; and, as we have just observed, no
                    other person can have a share in conversation or declamation. An absent person
                    or an absent thing may be the subject of conversation, but cannot be the speaker
                    or the person addressed. <hi rend="italic">He, site,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >it,</hi> however, as they stand by themselves, and assume the power of nouns,
                    are very properly denominated pronouns; but they are not personal pronouns in
                    any other sense than as the negation of sex is the neuter gender.</p>
                <p>We have already seen that nouns admit of number; pronouns, which are their
                    substitutes, likewise admit of number, ſhere may be <hi rend="italic">many</hi>
                    speakers at once of the same sentiment, as well as one, who, including himself,
                    speaks the sentiment of <hi rend="italic">many,</hi> speech may likewise be
                    addressed to <hi rend="italic">many</hi> at a time, as well as to <hi
                    rend="italic">one;</hi> and the subject of the discourse may likewise be <hi
                    rend="italic">many.</hi> The pronoun, therefore, of every one of the persons
                    must admit of number to express this singularity or plurality. Hence the pronoun
                    of the first person <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> has the plural <hi rend="italic"
                    >we;</hi> that of the second person <hi rend="italic">thou,</hi> has the plural
                    <hi rend="italic">ye</hi> or <hi rend="italic">you</hi>; and that of the third
                    person <hi rend="italic">he, she,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> has the
                    plural <hi rend="italic">they,</hi> which is equally applied to all the three
                    genders.</p>
                <p>The Greeks and Romans, when addressing one person, used the pronoun in the
                    singular number <hi rend="italic">thou</hi>; whereas in the polite, and even in
                    the familiar style, we, and many other modern nations, use the plural <hi
                    rend="italic">you.</hi> Although in this case we apply <hi rend="italic"
                    >you</hi> to a single person, yet the verb must agree with it in the plural
                    number; it must necessarily be, <hi rend="italic">you have,</hi> not <hi
                    rend="italic">you hast. You was,</hi> the second person plural of the pronoun
                    placed in agreement with the first or third person singular of the verb, is an
                    enormous, though common solecism, which ought to be carefully avoided. In very
                    solemn style, as when we address the Supreme Being, we use <hi rend="italic"
                    >thou,</hi> perhaps to indicate that he is God alone, and that there is none
                    like unto him; and we sometimes use the same form of the pronoun in contemptuous
                    or very familiar language, to intimate that the person to whom we speak is the
                    meanest of human beings, or the dearest and most familiar of our friends. A
                    king, exerting his authority on a solemn occasion, adopts the plural of the
                    first person, “<hi rend="italic">we</hi> strictly command and charge ;” meaning,
                    that he acts by the advice of counsellors, or rather as the representative of a
                    whole people. But in all cases in which the use of the pronoun deviates from the
                    nature of things, the verb in concord deviates with it; for, as will be seen
                    afterwards, these two words universally agree in number and person.</p>
                <p>But though all these pronouns have number, neither in Greek, Latin, or any modern
                    language, do those of the first and second person carry the distinctions of sex.
                    The reason is obvious,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    other properties and attributes whatever, except those mentioned above as
                    descriptive of the nature of these pronouns, are foreign from the intention of
                    the speaker, who, when he uses the pronoun <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> means <hi
                    rend="italic">the person who now speaks,</hi> no matter whether man or woman;
                    and when the pronoun <hi rend="italic">thou, the person,</hi> no matter whether
                    man or woman, <hi rend="italic">to whom he now addresses himself,</hi> and
                    nothing more. But the pronoun of the third person denoting neither the speaker
                    nor the hearer, but the subject of the discourse, and being merely the
                    substitute of a noun which may be either masculine, feminine, or neuter, must of
                    necessity agree with the noun which it represents, and admit of a triple
                    distinction significant of gender. In English, which allows its adjectives no
                    genders, this pronoun is <hi rend="italic">he</hi> in the masculine, <hi
                    rend="italic">she</hi> in the feminine, and <hi rend="italic">it</hi> in the
                    neuter; the utility of which distinction may be. better found in supposing it
                    away. Suppose, for example, that we should in history read these words, <hi
                    rend="italic">He caused him to destroy him,</hi> and were informed that the
                    pronoun, which is here thrice repeated, stood each time for something different;
                    that is to say, for a man, for a woman, and for a city, whose names were
                    Alexander, Thais, and Persepolis. Taking the pronoun in this manner, divested of
                    its gender, how would it appear which was destroyed, which the destroyer, and
                    which the cause that moved to the destruction? But there is no ambiguity, when
                    we hear the genders distinguished: when we are told with the proper
                    distinctions, that <hi rend="italic">she</hi> caused <hi rend="italic">him</hi>
                    to destroy <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> we know with certainty that the prompter
                    was the woman; that her instrument was the hero; and that the subject of their
                    cruelty was the unfortunate city, prom this example we would be surprised how
                    the Italians, French, and Spaniards could <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522417"

                    no more than two variations of this pronoun.</p>
                <p>Although in every language with which we are acquainted, there is but one pronoun
                    for each of the first and second persons; and although it is obvious, from the
                    nature, and import of those words, that no more can be necessary; yet the mere
                    English reader may perhaps be puzzled with finding three distinct words applied
                    to each; <hi rend="italic">I, mine,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">me,</hi> for the
                    first person; <hi rend="italic">thou, thine,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >thee,</hi> for the second. The learned reader will see at once that the words
                    <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">me, thine</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">thee,</hi> are equivalent to the genitive and accusative cases of
                    the Latin pronouns of the first and second persons. That <hi rend="italic"
                    >mine</hi> is a pronoun in the possessive case is obvious; for if I were asked
                    “whose book is that before me ?” I should reply, “It is <hi rend="italic"
                    >mine,"</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>If we
                    mistake not, Dr Johnson has somewhere affected to ridicule Bishop Lowth for
                    considering the word <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> as the possessive case of the
                    pronoun of the first person. According to the doctor, <hi rend="italic"
                    >mine</hi> is the same word with the pronominal adjective my; and was anciently
                    used before a vowel, as <hi rend="italic">my</hi> was before a consonant. This
                    is not said with the lexicorapher’s usual precision. That mine was anciently
                    used before a vowel is certain; but it does not therefore follow that it is the
                    same word with <hi rend="italic">my.</hi> If it were, we might on every occasion
                    substitute either of these for the other, without offending against grammar,
                    however we might injure the sound; but we apprehend that this is not the case.
                    “That book is mine,” is good £nglish; but “that book is <hi rend="italic"
                    >my”</hi> would be a gross solecism. The reason is, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >mine</hi> is a genuine pronoun, and stands by itself with the power of a noun;
                    but <hi rend="italic">my,</hi> being an adjective, cannot stand by
                    itsel£</p></note> meaning that it belongs to me. That the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >me</hi> is the same pronoun in the case which the Latin grammarians call the
                    accusative, is evident from the import of that word in the sentence <hi
                    rend="italic">he admires me,</hi> where the admiration is supposed to proceed
                    from the person spoken of to the person who speaks. It appears, therefore, that
                    though English nouns have only two cases, the nominative and possessive, the
                    pronouns of that language have three, as, <hi rend="italic">I, mine, me</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">thou, thine, thee</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">he, his, him,</hi> &amp;c.; and that these are cases,
                    can be questioned by no man who admits that <hi rend="italic">met, mihi,
                    me,</hi> are cases of the Latin pronoun <hi rend="italic">ego.</hi> Both
                    pronouns, the Latin and the English, are irregularly inflected; and perhaps
                    those words which are called the oblique cases of each may have originally been
                    derived from nominatives different from <hi rend="italic">ego</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">I;</hi> but these nominatives are now lost, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >mei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mine</hi> have, beyond all dispute, the effect
                    of the genitives of the Latin and English pronouns of the first person. These
                    variations, however, cannot be looked upon as an essential part of language, but
                    only as a particular refinement, invented to prevent the disagreeable repetition
                    of the pronoun, which must frequently have happened without such a contrivance.
                    This seems to have been the only reason why pronouns have been endowed with a
                    greater variety of cases than nouns. Nouns are in themselves greatly
                    diversified. Every genus and every species of objects has a distinct name, and
                    therefore the sameness of sound does not so often occur among them as it would
                    among the pronouns, without cases, where the same <hi rend="italic">I, thou, he,
                    she,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> answers for every object which occurs in
                    nature; but by this diversity in the form of the words, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >caco-ρhonia,</hi> which would be otherwise disgusting, is in a great measure
                    avoided. It is, probably, for the same reason that the plural of each of these
                    pronouns is so very different from the singular. Thus from <hi rend="italic">I,
                    mine, me,</hi> in the singular, is formed, in the plural, <hi rend="italic">we,
                    ours, us</hi>; from <hi rend="italic">thou, thine,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >thee, ye or you, yours, you;</hi> and from <hi rend="italic">he, she, it, his,
                    hers, its, him, her, it,</hi> in the singular, <hi rend="italic">they, theirs,
                    them,</hi> in the plural. In all of which there is not the least resemblance
                    between the singular and plural of any one word; and except in <hi rend="italic"
                    >he, his, him} it, its; they, theirs, them;</hi> there is not any similarity
                    between the different cases of the same word in the same number.</p>
                <p>From the account here given of the personal pronouns, it appears that the first
                    or second will, either of them, coalesce with the third, but not with each
                    other. For ex ample, it is good sense, as well as good grammar, to say in any
                    language, <hi rend="italic">I am he, thou art he, toe were they, you were
                    they</hi>; but we cannot say, <hi rend="italic">lam thou,</hi> nor <hi
                    rend="italic">thou art I,</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">we are you,</hi> &amp;c.
                    The reason is, there is no absurdity for the speaker to be also the subject of
                    the discourse, as when it is said, I am he; or for the person addressed, as when
                    we say, thou art he. But for the same person, in the same circumstances, to be
                    at once the speaker and the party addressed, is impossible; for which reason the
                    coalescence of the pronouns of the first and second persons is likewise
                    impossible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">I, thou, he, site,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">it,</hi> are all
                    that are usually called personal pronouns. There is another class of words,
                    which are called sometimes pronominal adjectives, sometimes adjective pronouns,
                    sometimes possessive pronouns; and by one writer of grammar they have been most
                    absurdly termed pronominal articles. It is not worth while to dispute about a
                    name; but the words in question are <hi rend="italic">my, thy, her, our, your,
                    their.</hi> These words are evidently in the form of adjectives; for, like other
                    English adjectives, they have no variation to indicate either gender, number, or
                    case; and yet they are put in concord with nouns of every gender and both
                    numbers, as, <hi rend="italic">my wife, my son, my book</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">her husband, her sons, her daughters, &amp;c.</hi> But
                    though in the form of adjectives, they have the power of personal pronouns in
                    the possessive case: <hi rend="italic">my book</hi> is the book of <hi
                    rend="italic">me,</hi> or the book of <hi rend="italic">him who now
                    speaks</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">our house</hi> is the house
                    of <hi rend="italic">us,</hi> or the house occupied by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >persons who now speak</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">her
                    husband,</hi> is the husband of a woman who can be known only from something
                    preceding in the discourse; and <hi rend="italic">their property</hi> is the
                    property of them, of any persons, whether men or women, or both, who have been
                    previously mentioned. Words which have the form of adjectives, with the power of
                    pronouns, may, without impropriety, be called pronominal adjectives; and such is
                    the name by which we shall henceforth distinguish them. To these pronominal
                    adjectives, as well as to' the personal pronouns, are subjoined the words own
                    and self, and in the plural selves; in which case they are emphatica], and imply
                    a silent contrariety or opposition. Thus, <hi rend="italic">I lire in my own
                    house</hi>; that is, not in a hired house. <hi rend="italic">This I did with my
                    own hand</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, not by proxy. <hi rend="italic"
                    >This was done by myself</hi>; that is, not by another. The word self subjoined
                    to a personal pronoun forms also the reciprocal pronoun; as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >we hurt ourselves by vain rage</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">he
                    blamed himself for his misfortune. Himself, itself, themselves,</hi> are
                    supposed by Wallis to be put, by corruption, for <hi rend="italic">his self, its
                    self, their selves</hi>; so that <hi rend="italic">self</hi> is always a
                    substantive or noun, and not a pronoun. This seems to be a just observation; for
                    we say, <hi rend="italic">the man came himself, they went themselves</hi>; where
                    the words <hi rend="italic">himself</hi> and <hi rend="italic">themselves</hi>
                    cannot be accusatives, but nominatives, and were anciently written <hi
                    rend="italic">his self, their selves.</hi></p>
                <p>There are other words which are usually ranked under the class of pronouns; as
                    <hi rend="italic">who, which, what.</hi> These, when employed in asking
                    questions, are called interrogative pronouns; though a name more characteristic
                    might surely be found for them. Their import, however, will be more easily
                    ascertained after we have considered another species of pronouns, which have
                    been denominated relatives, and with which they are intimately connected.</p>
                <p>The pronouns already mentioned may be called prepositive, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522430" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2430-0651"/>as may indeed all
                    substantives, because they are capable of introducing or leading a sentence: but
                    there is another pronoun which has a character peculiar to itself, and which, as
                    it is never employed but to connect sentences, and must therefore have always a
                    reference to something preceding, is called the subjunctive or relative pronoun.
                    This pronoun is in Greek, ⅛ į, ∙; in Latin, <hi rend="italic">qui,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">qu&lt;ε, quod</hi>; and in English, <hi rend="italic">who, which,
                    what.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to determine with precision the nature and import of the <hi
                    rend="italic">relative pronoun,</hi> it will be necessary to ascertain the
                    powers which it contains, or the parts of speech into which it is capable of
                    being resolved. Now, it is obvious that there is not a single noun, or
                    prepositive pronoun, which the relative is not capable of representing; for we
                    say, I <hi rend="smallcaps">who</hi><hi rend="italic">saw him yesterday cannot
                    be mistaken</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">you who</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">did not see him may have been misinformed:</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">they who</hi><hi rend="italic">neither saw nor heard can know
                    nothing of the matter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">the
                    things which</hi><hi rend="italic">he exhibited were wonderful.</hi> From diese
                    examples, it is apparent, in the first place, that the relative contains in
                    itself the force of any other pronoun; but it contains something more.</p>
                <p>If from any sentence in which there is a relative, that relative be taken away,
                    and the prepositive pronoun which it represents be substituted in its stead, the
                    sentence will lose its bond of union, and stand quite loose and unconnected.
                    Thus, if instead of saying <hi rend="italic">the man is wise</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">who</hi><hi rend="italic">speaks little,</hi> we should say <hi
                    rend="italic">the man is wise</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> he</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">speaks little,</hi> the sentence would be resolved into two; and
                    what is affirmed of the man’s wisdom, would have no connection with the
                    circumstance of his speaking little. Hence it is evident, in die second place,
                    that the relative contains the force of a connective as well as of the
                    prepositive pronoun. What kind of connection it denotes is next to be
                    ascertained.</p>
                <p>It may be laid down as a general principle, that, by means of a relative pronoun,
                    a clause of a sentence, in which there is a verb, is converted into the nature
                    of an adjective, and made to denote some attribute of a substance, or some
                    property or circumstance belonging to the antecedent noun. Thus, when it is
                    said, <hi rend="italic">homo</hi><hi rend="italic">qui prudentia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">proeditus</hi><hi rend="italic">est,</hi> the relative clause, <hi
                    rend="italic">qui prudentia</hi><hi rend="italic">prce-ditus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est,</hi> expresses nothing more than the quality of prudence in
                    concrete with the subject <hi rend="italic">homo,</hi> which might have been
                    equally well expressed by the adjective <hi rend="italic">prudens.</hi> In like
                    manner, when we say, <hi rend="italic">vir sapit</hi><hi rend="italic">qui
                    pauca</hi><hi rend="italic">loquitur,</hi> the relative fact expresses the
                    property of speaking little as belonging to the man, and as being that quality
                    which constitutes, or from which we infer, his wisdom; but if there were such a
                    word as <hi rend="italic">pauciloquens,</hi> that quality might very properly be
                    expressed by it, and the phrase <hi rend="italic">vir sapù pauciloquens</hi>
                    would express the same assertion with <hi rend="italic">vir sapit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">qui pauca</hi><hi rend="italic">loquitur.</hi></p>
                <p>Now if a relative clause expresses that which might be expressed by an adjective,
                    the presumption is, that it may be resolved into the same constituent parts. But
                    every adjective contains the powers of an abstract substantive, together with an
                    expression of connection; and may be resolved into the genitive case of that
                    substantive, or into the nominative with the particle of prefixed, which, in
                    English, corresponds to the termination of the genitive in the ancient
                    languages. That the member of a sentence in which there is a relative, may, in
                    every instance, be analysed in the same manner, will be apparent from the
                    following examples. <hi rend="italic">Vir</hi><hi rend="italic">qui</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sapit,</hi><hi rend="italic">vir</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sapiens,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vir sapienti&lt;e,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi> a man who is wise, a wise man, and a man of wisdom,” are certainly
                    phrases of the same import. Again, <hi rend="italic">homo,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cui ingratus</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">animus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">malus</hi><hi rend="italic">fit amicus,</hi> may be translated
                    into Greek, <hi rend="italic">åtðļwnt</hi><hi rend="italic">inupertaq</hi> χαζό;
                    y∣wra∕ <hi rend="italic">φoj⅛</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Into English,
                    “the man of ingratitude is a bad friend.”</p>
                <p>Thus then it appears, that the relative pronoun contains in itself the force of
                    the prepositive pronoun, together with that connection implied in English by the
                    preposition <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> and in the ancient languages by the
                    genitive case. When one says, <hi rend="italic">vir</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sapit</hi><hi rend="italic">qui pauca</hi><hi rend="italic">loquitur,</hi> the
                    relative clause <hi rend="italic">qui pauca</hi><hi rend="italic">loquitur</hi>
                    expresses that attribute of the man from which his wisdom is inferred. It is
                    conceived by the mind, as stripped of its propositional form, and standing in
                    the place of a substantive noun governed in the genitive case by <hi
                    rend="italic">vir.</hi> The whole sentence might be thus translated, “the man
                    <hi rend="italic">of little speaking</hi> is wise ;” or, did the use of the
                    English language admit of it, “the man <hi rend="italic">of he speaks
                    little</hi> is wise.” In like manner, when it is said, “Man, who is born of
                    woman, is of few days and full of trouble,” the relative clause is equivalent to
                    an abstract noun in the genitive case, and the whole might be expressed in the
                    following manner: “Man <hi rend="italic">of he is born of woman</hi> is of few
                    days and full of trouble.”</p>
                <p>It is obvious that these expressions into which, in the instances adduced, the
                    relative clauses have been resolved, will appear extremely uncouth and
                    offensive; but it is not meant to recommend them as common modes of phraseology.
                    Against their being employed as such, present use loudly remonstrates.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is worthy ofrobservation,
                    however, that, repugnant as such expressions are to the present idiom of the
                    English language, there is nothing in the nature of the thing that couid render
                    the use of them improper. All prepositions, as will be seen afterwards, are
                    expressive of relations subsisting between those objects of which they connect
                    the signs in discourse. Those objects may be denoted, either by single words,
                    and then the preposition will govern a noun; or by assertions, and then it will
                    govern a nominative and a verb. Thus, when it is said, “I came after his
                    departure,” the preposition <hi rend="italic">after</hi> expresses the relation
                    between two events, <hi rend="italic">my coming</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hù
                    departure,</hi> and governs a substantive noun; but if it is said, “I came after
                    he departed,” the preposition in this case (for, as shall be shown afterwards,
                    it is absurd to call it in the one instance a preposition, and in the other a
                    conjunction) expresses the same relation as before, but governs a nominative and
                    a verb.</p><p>This last expression is exactly similar to those employed above,
                    when one says, for example, “the man <hi rend="italic">of he &gt;peakι
                    little</hi> is wise,” however uncouth the expression may appear from its not
                    being supported by the authority of custom, the preposition of is used precisely
                    in the same manner, and serves the very same purpose, as when it is said, “the
                    man <hi rend="italic">of little speaking</hi> is wise.” In both cases it denotes
                    the relation between the two objects, <hi rend="italic">man</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">little speaking</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> only in the one it is
                    prefixed to a noun, in the other to an assertive clause of a sentence, the
                    import of which is to be taken as a noun. ^ Custom has indeed determined that
                    prepositions shall more frequently govern a noun than a nominative and a verb;
                    but they are, in their own nature, equally well adapted to answer both
                    purposes.</p><p>But as the pronoun of the third person is merely the substitute
                    of some noun, an objector may ask, what noun is here represented by <hi
                    rend="italic">he ĩ</hi> “The man <hi rend="italic">of he speaks little</hi> is
                    Wise.” who is meant by the pronoun <hi rend="italic">heĩ</hi> we answer, <hi
                    rend="italic">the man</hi> who is declared to be wire. The objection proceeds
                    from inattention to the radical signification of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >of,</hi> which a late ingenious writer has shown to be the frag, ment of a
                    Gothic or Anglo-8axon word, signifying <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">offspring.</hi> If this be admitted, and, after the proofs which
                    he has given, we think it cannot be denied, the uncouth phrase, “The man <hi
                    rend="italic">of he epeakt little</hi> is wise,” may be thus resolved, “The man,
                    <hi rend="italic">a consequence</hi> (of his mind is) <hi rend="italic">he
                    speaks little,</hi> is wise or, in other words. “The man, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >consequence</hi> of his speaking little, is wise.” The same acute writer, Mr
                    Horne Tooke, has shown that of and∕w, though of different radical meanings, may
                    often be substituted the one for the other without injury to the sense. Let this
                    substitution be made in the present instance, and the propriety of the phrase
                    will be apparent: “The man is wise/or he speaks little.” It must be remembered,
                    however, that such a substitution cannot be made in every instance, because <hi
                    rend="italic">Jor</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">cause,</hi> and of signifies
                    <hi rend="italic">consequence.</hi></p></note> They are introduced only with a
                    view to show the true import of the relative pronoun; and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522443" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2443-0652"/>for that purpose they are
                    well adapted. That pronoun seems to be of use only when there is a deficiency of
                    ad- jectires or substantives to denote some complex attribute by which we want
                    to limit a general term or expression. Where such adjectives or substantives
                    exist in language, we may indeed use the relative or not at pleasure. Thus we
                    may say, <hi rend="italic">homo</hi><hi rend="italic">qui grandia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">loquitur,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">homo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >grandiloquus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> because the adjective and the
                    relative clause are precisely of the same meaning. But if the Latins were called
                    upon to translate αv⅛ωroς <hi rend="italic">aυτMaxroq,</hi> we believe they must
                    have made use of the relative pronoun, as we know not any corresponding
                    adjective in their language</p>
                <p>The learned and ingenious Mr Harris, in his Treatise on Universal Grammar, has
                    given an analysis of the relative pronoun very different from that which has
                    been given by us. The result of his inquiry is, that the relative is equivalent
                    to another pronoun, together with an expression of connection of that kind which
                    is denoted by the particle <hi rend="italic">and.</hi> This analysis he
                    exemplifies, and endeavours to confirm, by the sentence, “Light is a body which
                    moves with great celerity.” Now, says he, instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >which</hi> substitute the word <hi rend="italic">and it,</hi> and in their
                    united powers you see the force and character of the pronoun here treated. But
                    let any one attentively consider these two expressions, “Light is a body <hi
                    rend="italic">which</hi> moves with great celerity,” and “Light is a body <hi
                    rend="italic">and it</hi> moves with great celerity and he will find that they
                    are not precisely equivalent. For, to speak in the language of logic, there is
                    in the first but one proposition, of which the subject is light, and the
                    predicate a complex term expressed by the words, <hi rend="italic">body which
                    moves with great celerity.</hi> In the second there are two propositions, or two
                    predications, concerning light; first, that it is a body; and, secondly, that it
                    moves with great celerity. The relative clause, in the first case, expresses a
                    property of the antecedent body, which, with that property, is predicated of the
                    subject light; in the second case, this property is removed from the predicate
                    of which it was an essential part, and is improperly converted into a new
                    predication of the subject. The sentence may be resolved upon our principles,
                    and its precise import preserved; as “Light is a body <hi rend="italic">of it
                    moves with great celerity</hi> the clause “it moves with great celerity,” is
                    conceived by the mind as having the force of an abstract substantive, and is
                    connected with the antecedent body by the preposition <hi rend="italic">of,</hi>
                    answering to the termination of the genitive case. This abstract substantive
                    thus connected expresses a quality of the body light. But by this example Mr
                    Harris’s doctrine is not exhibited in all its absurdity; it may be proper to try
                    it by another.</p>
                <p>Let us suppose that the following assertion is true; “Charles XII. was the only
                    monarch who conquered kingdoms to bestow them on his friends.” Here it is
                    evident there is but one proposition, of which the predicate is expressed by the
                    words, “only monarch who conquered kingdoms to bestow them on his friends so
                    that the relative clause is a necessary part of the predicate, and has, like an
                    abstract noun in the genitive case, the effect of modifying the general term
                    monarch. Resolve this sentence on Mr Harris’s principles, and you have two
                    propositions of which the first is a notorious falsehood: “Charles XII. was the
                    <hi rend="italic">only monarch, and he</hi> conquered kingdoms to bestow them on
                    his friends.” But instead of <hi rend="italic">and</hi> substitute <hi
                    rend="italic">of,</hi> thus, “Charles XII. was the only monarch <hi
                    rend="italic">of he conquered kingdoms to bestow them on his friends,”</hi> and
                    you preserve the true import of the expression.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Harris was probably led into iiis opinion,
                    from considering the Latin ¢ni or <hi rend="italic">quit</hi> as compounded of
                    <hi rend="italic">que</hi> and <hi rend="italic">is</hi> (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermes,</hi> p. 81, 82, third edit.). But the notion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perizonìus</hi> is perhaps better founded, who, in his notes to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Minerva</hi> of Sanctius, considers it as immediately taken from
                    the Greek <hi rend="italic">τ</hi><hi rend="italic">t,</hi> which in the Doric
                    is ma&lt;le ««, and in the Latin <hi rend="italic">quit.</hi> For it seems
                    highly probable, as some ingenious writers have endeavoured to show, that the
                    Latin is a dialect of the Greek. Of this at least we may be certain, that many
                    words in the former are immediately adopted from the latter.</p></note> Are
                    there no cases, then, in which the relative may be resolved into the connective
                    <hi rend="italic">and</hi> with a prepositive pronoun? Undoubtedly there are,
                    and we shall now endeavour to ascertain them.</p>
                <p>Adjectives in language have two different effects upon the substantives to which
                    they belong, according to the nature of the attribute which they express. If the
                    attribute expressed by the adjective be competent to all the species of which
                    the substantive is the specific name, it is plain that the adjective does not
                    modify or limit the substantive, for this obvious reason, that nothing can
                    modify which is not discriminative. Thus, when Horace says, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prata canis albicant pruinis,</hi> the adjective <hi rend="italic">canis</hi>
                    denotes a quality common to all hoarfrost; and therefore cannot modify the
                    substantive, because it adds nothing to the conception of which that substantive
                    is the name. But when the attribute expressed by the adjective is competent to
                    some individuals only of the species of which the substantive is the name, the
                    adjective has then the effect of modifying or limiting the substantive. Thus
                    when one says <hi rend="italic">vir bonus,</hi> he makes use of an adjective
                    which modifies the substantive, <hi rend="italic">vir,</hi> because it expresses
                    a Quality or attribute which does not belong to all men.</p>
                <p>The clause of a sentence, in which there is a relative, as it is in every other
                    respect, so is it in this, equivalent to an adjective; it either modifies, or
                    does not modify, the antecedent, according as the attribute which it expresses
                    is or is not characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">species</hi> to which the
                    antecedent belongs. Thus, when it is said, “Man, who is born of woman, is of few
                    days and full of trouble,” the relative clause “who is born of woman,” expresses
                    an attribute common to all men, and therefore cannot modify. In like manner,
                    when we say, “<hi rend="smallcaps">Socrates,</hi> who taught moral philosophy,
                    was virtuous," the clause, “who taught moral philosophy,” does not modify. In
                    both these instances the relative clause might be omitted; and it might be said
                    with equal truth, “Man is of few days and full of trouble,” and “<hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Socrates</hi> was virtuous.”</p>
                <p>But if it be said, <hi rend="italic">vir</hi><hi rend="italic">sapit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">qui pauca</hi><hi rend="italic">loquitur,</hi> the relative
                    clause, <hi rend="italic">qui pauca</hi><hi rend="italic">loquitur,</hi>
                    modifies the antecedent <hi rend="italic">vir</hi>; for it is not affirmed of
                    every man that he is wise, but only of such men as speak little. So “Charles
                    XII. was the only monarch who conquered kingdoms to bestow them on his friends
                    and, “the man that endureth to the end shall be saved with many more examples
                    that will occur to every reader.</p>
                <p>Now it will be found that it is only when the relative clause expresses such a
                    property or circumstance of the antecedent as does not limit its signification,
                    that the relative pronoun can be resolved into a prepositive pronoun with the
                    conjunction <hi rend="italic">and,</hi> and that in these cases the relative
                    clause itself is of very little importance. Thus in the assertion, “Charles XII.
                    was the only monarch who conquered kingdoms to bestow them on his friends,”
                    where the relative clause is restrictive, the <hi rend="italic">who</hi> cannot
                    be resolved into <hi rend="italic">and he</hi> consistently with truth or common
                    sense. But in the expression, “Man, who is born of woman, is of few days and
                    full of trouble,” the relative <hi rend="italic">who</hi> may be so resolved, at
                    least without violating truth, thus, “man is of few days and full of trouble^
                    and he is born of a woman.” The only difference between the sentence with the
                    relative <hi rend="italic">who,</hi> and the same sentence thus resolved, is,
                    that, in the former case, it contains but one predication; in the latter two,
                    and these but loosely connected.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, it appears that the general analysis of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522456" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2456-0653"/>relative pronoun is into the
                    particle <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> and a prepositive pronoun; but that there
                    are also occasions on which it may be resolved into a prepositive pronoun and
                    the particle <hi rend="italic">and,</hi> without materially altering the sense.
                    Now, what is the reason of this distinction?</p>
                <p>If the relative clause be equivalent to an adjective, or to an abstract
                    substantive in the genitive case, it is easy to see that the relative itself
                    may, in every instance, be resolved into another pronoun and the particle of;
                    but it will not perhaps be quite so evident how it should in any instance be
                    resolved by <hi rend="italic">and.</hi> This last analysis has its foundation in
                    the nature of the particles of and <hi rend="italic">and</hi>; or, to speak more
                    properly, in the nature of the attribute which the relative clause expresses.
                    Both the particles of and <hi rend="italic">and</hi> are used to link or join
                    conceptions together; but with this difference, that of has the effect of making
                    the conceptions it connects figure in the mind as one object; whereas the
                    conceptions connected by <hi rend="italic">and</hi> are still conceived
                    separately as before. To explain ourselves by an example: suppose we take two
                    words, <hi rend="italic">man</hi> and <hi rend="italic">virtue,</hi> which
                    denote two distinct ideas or conceptions, and join them together by the particle
                    <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> saying <hi rend="italic">man of virtue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the mind no longer views them separately as significant of
                    two conceptions, but of one. Take the same words, and join them together by the
                    particle <hi rend="italic">and,</hi> saying <hi rend="italic">man and
                    virtue</hi>; the conceptions denoted by <hi rend="italic">man</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">virtue</hi> are still viewed separately as <hi rend="italic"
                    >two,</hi> and notice is only given that they are collaterally connected.</p>
                <p>This being the case, it follows, that when the relative modifies the antecedent,
                    or, in other words, when the relative clause and the antecedent denote but one
                    conception, the relative must then be resolved by <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> in
                    order to preserve this unity of conception. But when the relative does not
                    modify the antecedent; that is, when its clause does not express any necessary
                    part of a complex conception, then the conceptions or ideas denoted by the
                    relative clause and the antecedent may be viewed separately as two; and
                    therefore the relative may be resolved into the corresponding prepositive
                    pronoun and the particle <hi rend="italic">and.</hi></p>
                <p>To state this reasoning in a light somewhat different. As every relative clause,
                    which expresses an attribute that is not applicable to a whole genus or species,
                    must necessarily modify some general term, that is, restrict its signification;
                    and as that general term must belong either to the subject or to the predicate
                    of a proposition; it is evident, that every such relative clause is a necessary
                    part of that subject or predicate in which its antecedent stands. If therefore a
                    relative clause, which modifies, be taken away either from the subject or the
                    predicate of a proposition; or if that connection, in consequence of which it
                    modifies, be dissolved, which is always done when the relative is resolved by
                    <hi rend="italic">and·,</hi> then the proposition itself will not hold true. The
                    reason is, that the subject or the predicate becomes then too general; for, in
                    the one case, something is predicated of a whole genus or species, which can be
                    predicated only of some individuals of that genus or species; and in the other,
                    a general predication is made where only a particular one can be applied. -
                    Thus, if it be said, “all men who transgress the laws are deserving of
                    punishment ;” the subject of the proposition is expressed by the words, “all men
                    who transgress the laws.” Take away the clause of the relative “who transgress
                    the laws,” and say, “all men are deserving of punishment and you have a
                    proposition which is not true, because that is affirmed of the whole species
                    which can be affirmed only of some individuals. Retaining now the clause of the
                    relative, but resolving it by <hi rend="italic">and,</hi> you have the same
                    proposition as before; and together with it, in this instance, another which is
                    equally false, namely, “all men, <hi rend="italic">and they</hi> transgress the
                    laws, are deserving of punishment ;” that is, “<hi rend="italic">all men</hi>
                    are deserving of punishment, and <hi rend="italic">all men</hi> transgress the
                    laws."</p>
                <p>But when the attribute expressed by the clause of the relative is characteristic
                    of the genus or species of the antecedent, and consequently applicable to every
                    individual which that genus or species comprehends, the relative clause may be
                    entirely omitted without affecting the truth of the proposition, which is
                    already as general as it can be. As in this case the import of the relative
                    clause is not restrictive of the signification of the antecedent, it is of
                    little consequence whether the attribute be represented by the connective part
                    of the relative, as of the antecedent, or be affirmed to belong to the
                    antecedent in a separate assertion. Thus it matters not much, whether we say,
                    “man, who is subject to death, ought not to be too much elated,” that is,
                    according to our analysis, “man <hi rend="italic">of he is subject to
                    death,</hi> ought not to be too much elated or whether, forming the relative
                    clause into a separate assertion, and connecting the two by the particle <hi
                    rend="italic">and,</hi> we say “man, and he is subject to death, ought not to be
                    too much elated.” In the one sentence, indeed, the reason is implied why man
                    should not be too much elated, his being subject to death; and in the other, no
                    reason is assigned for this; we only affirm that man is subject to death, and
                    likewise that he should not be too much elated; but as both affirmations are
                    equally true and evident, it is of little consequence, in such a case as this,
                    whether the reason upon which either is founded be implied or not.</p>
                <p>From the whole of this investigation, the following conclusions may be deduced as
                    sufficiently established: lsr, That the relative pronoun contains in itself the
                    united powers of a connective and another pronoun, <hi rend="italic">%dly,</hi>
                    That of is the connective of which, together with another pronoun, it contains
                    the powers, as in every possible instance it may be resolved into these
                    constituent parts, and the import of the sentence in which it has place remain
                    unaltered. 3<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> That in the ancient languages the
                    relative clause of a sentence has the import of an abstract substantive in the
                    <hi rend="italic">genitive case</hi>; in English, with the particle of prefixed,
                    <hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi> That the relative pronoun is of necessary use only
                    where there is a deficiency of adjectives or substantives to denote some complex
                    attribute, by which we want to limit a general term or expression; but that
                    where such adjectives or substantives exist in language, we may use the <hi
                    rend="italic">relative</hi> or not at pleasure. And, <hi rend="italic"
                    >5thly,</hi> That though, in cases where the relative clause does not limit a
                    general term, the relative pronoun may, without violating truth, be analysed by
                    <hi rend="italic">and</hi>; yet such analysis is never proper, as it gives two
                    predicates to the same subject, which, ia the original proposition, had but one
                    predicate.</p>
                <p>If the clause of the relative be equivalent to an adjective, as in every instance
                    it seems to be, it will naturally occur, that in the ancient languages, the
                    relative should agree with its antecedent in gender, number, and case. They do
                    agree for the most part in gender and number; in case they cannot often, because
                    the very intention of introducing a relative into language is to represent the
                    antecedent in a different case. Whenever we have occasion to use a substantive
                    or noun in a clause of a sentence, and afterwards to express by another clause,
                    in which there is a verb, an attribute of the object denoted by that
                    substantive, we then employ the relative pronoun. Now it seldom happens that the
                    two clauses admit of the same regimen; and hence the case of the relative is
                    often necessarily different from that of the antecedent, as the case of each
                    must be accommodated to the clause in which it is found. Thus we cannot say,
                    “Deus <hi rend="italic">qui</hi> colimus bonus est ;” but, “Deus <hi
                    rend="italic">quem</hi> colimus bonus est ;” because the regimen of the verb <hi
                    rend="italic">colo</hi> is always the accusative.</p>
                <p>This shows the necessity of introducing a relative into <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522469" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2469-0654"/>those languages which give
                    inflexions to their nouns. Were all the nouns of a language indeclinable, there
                    would be little occasion for a relative; and accordingly in English it is often
                    omitted. Examples are frequent in our best authors. Suffice it to quote the
                    following.</p>
                <p>For I have <hi rend="italic">buuneu would employ</hi> an age <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rowe.</hi></p>
                <p>I had several <hi rend="italic">men died</hi> in my ship of calentures— <hi
                    rend="italic">Swift.</hi></p>
                <p>They affect to guess at the <hi rend="italic">object they</hi> cannot see— <hi
                    rend="italic">Bolingbroke.</hi></p>
                <p>We are not ignorant that our most eminent grammarians consider such expressions
                    as chargeable with impropriety; and we are far from recommending them in any
                    dignified or solemn composition. But in the instances adduced there is not the
                    smallest degree of obscurity; at least there is none occasioned by the omission
                    of the relative. The reason seems to be, that the mind can easily, by an effort
                    of its own, make the antecedent unite, first with the one clause, and then with
                    the other. Thus, when it is said, “I have business would employ an age,” the
                    mind can, without any difficulty, as the word business has no inflexions,
                    consider it first as the objective case after <hi rend="italic">leave,</hi> and
                    then as the nominative to <hi rend="italic">would employ</hi>; but this cannot
                    be so easily done in the ancient languages, where the termination of the noun is
                    changed by the variation of its cases.</p>
                <p>Both in the learned and in the living languages the relative has different forms,
                    corresponding to the different genders of nouns; and by these it gives notice
                    whether it is applied to persons, or to things without life. Thus in the English
                    language we say, The man or the woman <hi rend="italic">who</hi> went to Rome;
                    The tree <hi rend="italic">which</hi> stands on yonder plain. It admits
                    likewise, when applied to males or females, a variation of cases similar to that
                    of the personal pronouns. Thus we say, The man <hi rend="italic">whose</hi> book
                    is now before me; The man or woman <hi rend="italic">whom</hi> I saw yesterday;
                    but the neuter admits of no such distinction,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Whoιe</hi> is by some authors made the possessive case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >which,</hi> and applied to things as well as persons ∣ I think, improperly— <hi
                    rend="italic">booth.</hi></p></note> as we say, The tree <hi rend="italic"
                    >which</hi> I saw, as well as The tree <hi rend="italic">which</hi> stands on
                    yonder plain. In modern languages the relative admits not of any distinction to
                    denote number; for we say, The <hi rend="italic">man</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">men</hi> who came yesterday; The <hi rend="italic">man</hi> or the
                    <hi rend="italic">men</hi> of whom I speak.</p>
                <p>In English, the word <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> which by some has been called a
                    demonstrative pronoun, by others a pronominal article, and by us a definite
                    article, is often used instead of the relative, as in the following examples:
                    “He is the same man <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I saw yesterday; he was the
                    ablest prince <hi rend="italic">that</hi> ever filled a throne.” With regard to
                    the principle upon which this acceptation of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >that</hi> depends, we beg to offer the following conjecture.</p>
                <p>In English, from the phlegmatic arrangement of the language, occasioned by the
                    want of inflexions and conjugations, the place of every part of a sentence is
                    almost uniformly determined, and very little variety is allowed in the
                    collocation of the words. The adjective is almost always placed in apposition
                    with its substantive, and the nominative with its verb. In consequence of this
                    uniformity in the collocation of the words, the mind acquires a habit of
                    connecting in idea any kind of word with the place in which it is used to stand;
                    and is naturally led to consider every word which stands in such a place as
                    belonging to such a class. Hence it is, we imagine, that the definitive <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> passes into the nature of the relative pronoun; as in
                    those instances in which it occupies the place of the relative, it was natural
                    to consider it as having the same import. Yet the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >that</hi> has undoubtedly in itself no more the force of the relative pronoun
                    than <hi rend="italic">ihe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">this,</hi> or any other
                    definitive whatever. In such expressions as the foregoing, it is not improbable
                    that originally the clause of the definitive <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> which
                    we now call die <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> clause, was thrown in as a kind
                    of modifying circumstance, thus, “The book (I read that) is elegant,” where the
                    speaker, finding the word 1 book too general for his purpose, throws in a clause
                    to qualify and restrict it, or to confine his affirmation to that particular
                    book which he is then reading. We can easily suppose that through time the
                    definitive <hi rend="italic">that</hi> in such an expression might be transposed
                    or removed from its own place to that of the relative; so that the expression
                    would run thus, “The book <hi rend="italic">that</hi> I read is elegant which
                    would be considered as precisely equivalent to “The book <hi rend="italic"
                    >which</hi> I read is elegant.” This opinion is not a little confirmed by a
                    similar use of the article in Greek, which, though undoubtedly a definitive like
                    the English <hi rend="italic">the,</hi> is often used instead of the relative
                    pronoun. Numberless examples may be found in Homer and Herodotus, especially in
                    the latten who seldom uses what is properly called the relative. We shall
                    produce one instance from each.</p>

                <p>We have said that the interrogative pronouns, as they are called, <hi
                    rend="italic">who, which, what,</hi> are intimately connected with relatives; we
                    now affirm, that the two first of these words are nothing but relatives, and
                    that the last contains in itself the united powers of a relative and a
                    definitive. With respect to cases, number, and gender, the words <hi
                    rend="italic">who</hi> and <hi rend="italic">which,</hi> when employed as
                    interrogatives, differ not from the same words when employed as relatives; and
                    we hold it as a maxim, without which science could not be applied to the subject
                    of language, that the same word has always the same radical import, in whatever
                    different situations it may be placed. To understand this, it is necessary to
                    observe, that all men have a natural propensity to communicate their thoughts in
                    the fewest words possible: hence it follows, that words are often omitted which
                    are necessary to complete the construction of the sentence; and this nowhere
                    happens more frequently than in the use of <hi rend="italic">who</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">which.</hi> In sentences where these words are confessedly
                    relatives, we often find them without an antecedent; as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Who</hi> steals my purse steals trash— <hi rend="italic">Shakspeare.</hi> which
                    <hi rend="italic">who</hi> would learn, as soon may tell, &amp;c.— <hi
                    rend="italic">Dryden.</hi></p>
                <p>Qui <hi rend="italic">Bavium</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >odit, amet tua carmina,</hi><hi rend="italic">Afervi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—Virg.</hi></p>
                <p>That is, “<hi rend="italic">He</hi> who steals my purse <hi rend="superscript">
                    ,i</hi> Which <hi rend="italic">he</hi> who would learn, as soon may tell and
                    “Ille <hi rend="italic">qui Bavium</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">odit,"</hi> &amp;c. Such abbreviations occasion no obscurity,
                    because from previous circumstances the hearer knows the mind of the speaker and
                    the persons to whom he refers. But it is not with respect to the relative and
                    antecedent only that such abbreviations have place; in sentences of a different
                    form, whole clauses are sometimes omitted, whilst the meaning of the speaker is
                    made sufficiently plain. Thus, when King Richard III. having lost his horse in
                    battle, exclaims,</p>
                <p>A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse! there is no complete thought expressed;
                    but the circumstances in which the king then was, enabled those about him to
                    understand that he <hi rend="italic">wanted a horse.</hi> Accordingly Catesby
                    answers him, withdraw, my lord; I’ll help you to a horse.</p>
                <p>In like manner, when a person asks a question, his expression is frequently
                    incomplete; but the tone of his voice, or some other circumstance, enables us to
                    ascertain his meaning, and to supply, if we please, the words that are omitted.
                    Thus when it is said, <hi rend="italic">An</hi><hi rend="italic">fecisti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ĩ</hi> nothing more is expressed than <hi rend="italic">If you did
                    it,</hi> the Latin <hi rend="italic">an</hi> being nothing else but the Greek
                    αs, <hi rend="italic">si</hi>; but some circumstance enables the person who
                    hears it to know that the meaning is, “Say <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522482"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2482-0655"/>if you did it.” Let us apply these observations to
                    the ' words <hi rend="italic">who</hi> and <hi rend="italic">which.</hi> If
                    these words be relatives, and if our analysis of the relative be just, it is
                    obvious, that no complete meaning can be contained in the clause, “Who is your
                    principal friend ?” for that clause contains nothing more than the circumstance
                    of being your principal friend predicated of some unknown person; “of he is your
                    principal friend.” That this is indeed the case, every man may be convinced, by
                    asking himself what he means by the interrogative <hi rend="italic">who</hi> in
                    such a sentence; for he will find it impossible to affix to it any meaning
                    without supplying an antecedent clause, by which that which is called an
                    interrogative will be immediately converted into the relative pronoun. The
                    custom, however, of language, and the tone of voice with which the relative
                    clause is uttered, intimates, without the help of the antecedent, the wish of
                    the speaker to be informed by the person addressed of the name and designation
                    of h⅛ principal friend; and we know t)ιat the sentence when completed is, “Tell
                    me the name and designation of the person who is your principal friend.” Again,
                    when the prophet says, “Who is this that cometh from Ėdom, with dyed garments
                    from Bozrah ?” he utters but part of a sentence, which when completed will run
                    thus: “<hi rend="italic">Describe the person</hi> who cometh from Edom (this is
                    that <hi rend="italic">person),</hi> with dyed garments from Bozrah.” He sees a
                    person coming from Edom, of whose name and designation he is ignorant; he calls
                    upon some one for information concerning these particulars; and that there may
                    be no mistake, he describes the unknown person as having “dyed garments from
                    Bozrah but lest even that description should not be sufficiently accurate, he
                    throws in the definitive clause, “this is that person,” pointing at him, we may
                    suppose, with his finger. <hi rend="italic">Which,</hi> used as an
                    interrogative, indicates a wish of knowing a particular person or thing out of
                    more than one mentioned; as, “Which of the two did it?” that is, <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Tell me the one</hi> of the two which did
                    řt ?” for, in old English, <hi rend="italic">which</hi> as a relative is often
                    used, where in modern English we should say <hi rend="italic">who·,</hi> and
                    that mode of speech is still retained when the antecedent ia omitted, and the
                    relative clause employed to indicate such a wish as that before us. <hi
                    rend="italic">What</hi> includes in itself the signification of a definitive and
                    a relative pronoun; as, “from <hi rend="italic">what</hi> has gone before, <hi
                    rend="italic">what</hi> follows may easily be guessed where the word <hi
                    rend="italic">what</hi> is equivalent to <hi rend="italic">that which.</hi> When
                    therefore we say, “What rude fellow is that ?” our meaning is, “<hi
                    rend="italic">Describe</hi> that <hi rend="italic">person</hi> who is that rude
                    fellow.” Upon the whole, then, it is evident, that the words called
                    interrogatives are merely relative pronouns; and that interrogative sentences
                    are relative clauses uttered in such circumstances as to enable the hearer to
                    supply the antecedents necessary to complete the meaning.</p>
                <p>In fine, we have seen that substantives are either primary or secondary; or, in
                    other words, nouns or pronouns. Nouns denote substances, and those either
                    natural, artificial, or abstract. They moreover denote things either general, or
                    special, or particular; and a general or specific name is made to denote an
                    individual by means of words called articles or definitives. Pronouns are the
                    substitutes of nouns, and are either prepositive or subjunctive. The prepositive
                    is distinguished into three orders, called the first, the second, and the third
                    person. The subjunctive, otherwise called the relative, includes the powers of
                    all those three, having superadded as of its own the peculiar force of a
                    connective.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Verbs. '</hi></p>
                <p>The words which we have hitherto considered are com monly called substantives
                    primary or secondary, and definitives; because nouns are significant of
                    substances; pronouns are the substitutes of nouns; and the article serves to
                    ascertain the extent of the noun, and to determine whether on any occasion it be
                    significant of a whole class of substances, or only of one individual. But
                    substances are of importance to mankind only on account of their various
                    qualities or attributes; for their internal texture is a thing of which we are
                    profoundly ignorant, and with which we have no manner of concern. Thus,
                    experience teaches us that certain vegetables are pleasant to the taste, and
                    wholesome food; whilst others are unpleasant and poisonous. The former kinds are
                    valuable only for their qualities or attributes; and they are the qualities or
                    attributes of the latter that make them worthless or hurtful. A horse is strong,
                    and swift, and docile, and may be trained to carry a man on a journey, or to
                    drag a plough. It is for his strength, swiftness, and docility, that he is the
                    most valuable of all quadrupeds. One man is brave, another learned, and another
                    eloquent; and by possessing these different qualities or attributes, each is
                    fitted for a different station in society. It is plain, therefore, that in
                    contemplating substances, our attention must be principally bestowed upon their
                    qualities, and that the words which serve to denote these qualities must be an
                    essential part of language. Such words are in general called attributives, and
                    are of three sorts, verbs, participles, and adjectives.</p>
                <p>Of all the constituent parts of speech, none has given the grammarians greater
                    trouble than the verb. The vast variety of circumstances which it blends
                    together in one word throws very considerable difficulties in the way of him who
                    attempts to analyse it and ascertain its nature; at the same time that, by its
                    eminent use in language, it is entitled to al! the attention which can be
                    bestowed upon it. To the discussion of the verb, Mr Harris, whose notions of
                    this as of the other parts of speech have been generally adopted by the
                    subsequent writers on grammar, has dedicated a large proportion of his book, in
                    which he has thrown out many excellent observations, mixed, as it appears to us,
                    with several errors. We have already observed, that no man is ignorant when he
                    uses what is called a <hi rend="italic">verb</hi> and when a <hi rend="italic"
                    >noun.</hi> Every schoolboy knows that the words <hi rend="italic">is, loveth,
                    walketh, standeth,</hi> in English, and <hi rend="italic">est, amat, amatur,
                    ambulat, stat,</hi> in Latin, are verbs; he knows likewise that they are of
                    different kinds, that some of them are said to be active, some passive, and some
                    neuter. But it should seem that the first object of our investigation ought to
                    be the characteristic of the verb, or that which all these words have in common,
                    and which constitutes them <hi rend="italic">verbs,</hi> distinguishing them
                    from every other species of words. Now it is obvious to the slightest attention,
                    that every verb, whether active, passive, or neuter, may be resolved into the
                    substantive verb is, and another <hi rend="italic">attributive</hi>; for <hi
                    rend="italic">loveth</hi> is of the same import with is <hi rend="italic"
                    >loving</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">walketĥ,</hi> with is <hi
                    rend="italic">walking</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >amat,</hi> with <hi rend="italic">amans est.</hi> But <hi rend="italic">loving,
                    walking,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">amans,</hi> are not verbs; and hence it
                    follows, that the characteristic of the verb, that which constitutes it what it
                    is, and cannot be expressed by other words, must be that which is signified by
                    the word is; and to us that appears to be neither more nor less than
                    assertion.</p>
                <p>Assertion, therefore, or predication, is certainly the very essence of the verb,
                    as being that part of its office, and that part only, which cannot be discharged
                    by other kinds of words.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Hence a common noun, or even a proper name, may be converted into a verb by
                    being rendered assertive or predicative. Thus, in the indignant rebuke addressed
                    by Rob Hoy to Rashleigh Osbaldistone, “Don't Mr or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Campbell</hi> me, sir; my foot is on my native heath, and my name is Macgregor
                    the proper name “<hi rend="italic">Campbell,"</hi> being that which Rob usually
                    assumed in his lowland and southern expeditions, is converted into a verb, and
                    great force thereby given to the exclamation, (űr <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hunter.)</hi></p></note> Every other circumstance which the verb includes, such
                    as attribute, mode, time, it may be possible to express by adjectives,
                    participles, and adverbs; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522495"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2495-0656"/>but without a verb it is impossible to predicate,
                    to affirm or deny, any one thing of any other thing. The office of the verb,
                    then, when stript of all accidental circumstances, seems to be merely this: “To
                    join together the subject and predicate of a proposition.” Its powers are
                    analogous to those of the sign 4- in algebra, which does not affect the separate
                    value of the quantities’ between which it is placed, but only indicates their
                    union or coalescence. To explain by an example: When we say, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cicero</hi><hi rend="italic">eloquens,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cicero
                    wise</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> these are imperfect sentences, though they
                    denote a substance and an attribute. The reason is, that they want an assertion,
                    to show that such an attribute appertains to such a substance. But when we
                    insert the word <hi rend="italic">was,</hi> we join the substance and attribute
                    together; we give notice that the <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">eloquence</hi> are applied to <hi rend="italic">Cicero,</hi> and
                    we do nothing more; we neither increase the wisdom nor diminish it, we neither
                    make it real nor imaginary; for it was supposed in all its extent when the words
                    <hi rend="italic">Cicero</hi> and <hi rend="italic">toise</hi> stood independent
                    of each other. We may indeed use the verb in a form which implies not an
                    assertion only, but likewise an attribute; as when we say, <hi rend="italic"
                    >George writeth,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">George walketh.</hi> But as whiteness
                    or any other particular colour is not of the essence of a horse, an animal which
                    is found of all colours; so, in the phrases quoted, the attribute, though
                    implied, is not of the essence of the verb; for it may be equally well expressed
                    by other words, as <hi rend="italic">George</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
                    >meriting,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">George</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
                    >walking,</hi> which are phrases of the very same import with <hi rend="italic"
                    >George writeth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">George wcdketh.</hi></p>
                <p>In resolving every verb, whether active, passive, or neuter, into the substantive
                    verb is and another attributive, we have the honour to agree with all the
                    grammarians; but to the word is itself the learned author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hermes</hi> has given a meaning which, as a verb, it does not admit. He
                    observes, that before any thing can be the subject of a proposition, it must
                    exist; that all existence is either absolute or qualified, mutable or immutable;
                    that the verb is can by itself express absolute existence, but never the
                    qualified, without subjoining the particular form; and that it signifies both
                    mutable and immutable existence, having in these cases different meanings,
                    although the sentences which he gives as examples are evidently Constructed in
                    the same manner, and consist of the same parts of speech. His examples are: Of
                    absolute existence, B is: of qualified, B <hi rend="italic">is an</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">animal-,</hi> of mutable, <hi rend="italic">This orange</hi> is
                    <hi rend="italic">ripe·,</hi> of immutable, <hi rend="italic">The diagonal of
                    the square</hi> is <hi rend="italic">incommensurable with its sides.</hi> But if
                    predication be the essence of verb, all this is nothing to the purpose, and part
                    of it is not true. It is not true that the verb is ever varies its
                    signification; for it has as verb no connection with existence of any kind. All
                    such circumstances are superadded to its verbal nature; or, to speak more
                    accurately, we infer such circumstances from our previous knowledge of the
                    objects concerning which the predication is made. When we say, “<hi
                    rend="italic">This</hi> orange is ripe,” we do indeed mean, as Mr Harris
                    observes, that it ⅛ so now at this <hi rend="italic">present</hi> in opposition
                    to past and future time; but it is not the verb is, but the definitive <hi
                    rend="italic">this,</hi> which fixes the time of maturity, as well as the place,
                    of the orange. If we had said, Oranges <hi rend="smallcaps">are</hi> ripe, we
                    might have been properly asked, When and where are they ripe? although the same
                    verb is used in both sentences. Even in the sentence B is, absolute existence,
                    the most simple of all, is inferred, and not expressed, by the verb; and the
                    infe rence is made from this obvious principle, that when one utters a mark of
                    predication, we naturally conclude that he means to predicate something of the
                    subject. If he adds no specific predication, as B is <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >round,</hi> we apply to B the most general that we can; and what other species
                    is so general as existence?</p>
                <p>That the idea of existence, considered as mutable or immutable, is not contained
                    in the verb is itself, but is derived from our knowledge of the objects
                    concerning which the predication is made, appears manifestly from this, that if
                    a person be supposed ignorant of the meaning of the words <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >God</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">man,</hi> whilst he knows that of is, the
                    uttering of the two propositions, <hi rend="italic">God is happy,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">This man is happy,</hi> will give him no notice of existence
                    considered as mutable or immutable, temporary or eternal.<note anchored="true"

                    the nature of man.</p>
                <p>Some of our readers may possibly think this notion of verb too abstract and
                    metaphysical; yet what other circumstance than mere predication is essential to
                    that species of words? We say <hi rend="italic">essential·,</hi> for we are
                    inquiring, not what is expressed by each individual verb, but what it is which
                    is equally expressed by all verbs, and which distinguishes them from the other
                    parts of speech. And if it be true, that every thing which the verb implies,
                    predication alone excepted, may be expressed by other parts of speech, and that
                    no other parts of speech can predicate, then we think ourselves warranted to
                    affirm, that simple predication is the essential characteristic of <hi
                    rend="italic">verb</hi>; that every word which predicates is a <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">verb</hi>; and that nothing is so which does not predicate.</p>
                <p>It must not, however, be concealed, that a doctrine very different from this has
                    been maintained by a writer of distinguished abilities. “We have <hi
                    rend="italic">energy</hi> expressed,” says Dr Gregory,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Theory of the Moods of
                    verbs,</hi> published in vol. it of the Transactions of the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh.</p></note> “and of course a verb constituted without affirmation,
                    when we wish or command; without command, when we affirm or wish; without wish,
                    when we command or affirm; yet in all these cases we have equally and
                    indisputably a verb.”</p>
                <p>That in all these cases we have a verb, is indeed indisputable; but we hold it to
                    be equally indisputable, that in all these cases we have affirmation. The
                    ingenious author has given no direct example of a wish or command uttered
                    without affirmation; and a feeling or sentiment which is not uttered has nothing
                    to do with language; but he has given a sentence in which there are three verbs,
                    that in his opinion denote no affirmation, but a very plain supposition. If a
                    supposition can be expressed without affirmation, we shall very readily allow
                    that a wish or command may be so expressed likewise. The doctor’s supposition is
                    thus expressed: “<hi rend="italic">Had</hi> any punishment ever overtaken you
                    for your broken vows; <hi rend="italic">were</hi> but one of your teeth growing
                    black, or even <hi rend="italic">were</hi> but one of your nails growing less
                    beautiful, I should believe you.” It is almost superfluous to observe, that to
                    every verb not in the infinitive mode there must be a nominative, and to every
                    active verb an object, whatever be the arrangement of the sentence in which such
                    verbs are found. These are truths known to every schoolboy; the reasons of them
                    shall be afterwards given. It is likewise undeniable, that in the sentence
                    before us the nominative to “had" is “any punishment ;” to the first, “were one
                    of your teeth ;” and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522508"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2508-0657"/>to the second, “one of your nails.” But the
                    sentence arranged in grammatical order, with the several nominatives before
                    their respective verbs, is evidently elliptical; and the conjunction <hi
                    rend="italic">if</hi> must be supplied as well to complete the construction as
                    to make sense of the passage. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">If
                    any</hi> punishment had ever overtaken you; <hi rend="italic">if</hi> but one of
                    your teeth were growing black, or even ιfbut one of your nails were growing less
                    beautiful, I should believe you.” Now it has been proved, by such evidence as
                    leaves no room for doubt, that <hi rend="italic">if,</hi> though called a
                    conjunction, is in fact a verb in the imperative mode, of the same import with
                    <hi rend="italic">give</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> so that we may substitute
                    the one for the other without in the smallest degree altering the sense. The
                    sentence will then run thus: “<hi rend="italic">Give</hi> any punishment had
                    ever overtaken you; &lt;7⅛ebut0ne0f your teeth were growing black, &amp;c. I
                    should believe you.” It is therefore so far from being true, that <hi
                    rend="italic">had</hi> and <hi rend="italic">were,</hi> when the sentence is
                    completed, express no affirmation; that it is only upon granting the truth of
                    the affirmation which they denote that the speaker says, “I should believe you.”
                    “Any punishment had ever overtaken you,” is plainly an affirmation; <hi
                    rend="italic">if, give</hi> that affirmation, <hi rend="italic">admit its
                    truth,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> I should believe you.” But it cannot be
                    supposed that <hi rend="italic">had</hi> and <hi rend="italic">were</hi> change
                    their significations by a mere change of place, or that by being removed from
                    the middle to the beginning of a clause they lose their original import, and
                    come to denote something entirely different. Were this the case, every attempt
                    to ascertain and fix the general principles of grammar would be as ridiculous as
                    an attempt to arrest the course of time. For what purpose, then, it may be
                    asked, if the verb always denotes affirmation, is it removed from the middle to
                    the beginning of the clause, when supposition is implied, as in the present
                    instance? We answer, that supposition is neither more nor less than conditional
                    affirmation; that when such affirmation is completely expressed, the verb is not
                    removed to the beginning of the clause; and that such removal takes place only
                    when the clause is elliptical, being merely an artificial contrivance in
                    language, to show the reader or hearer that some such word as <hi rend="italic"
                    >if,</hi> demanding the truth of the affirmation, is omitted for the sake of
                    dispatch. This is evident; for when the word requiring the affirmation to be
                    granted is supplied, the verb must be restored to its place in the middle of the
                    clause. Such abbreviations, and such contrivances to mark them, are frequent in
                    all languages, as will be seen more clearly when we come to treat of modes or
                    moods. Upon the whole, then, we are compelled reluctantly to differ from this
                    writer, and still to think that simple predication is the essence of the
                    verb.</p>
                <p>Should we be required to exemplify our theory by language, and to produce
                    instances of this simplified verb in practice, we might answer, that the not
                    being able to produce such instances would be no good argument against the truth
                    of our principles. It is the nature of language to express many circumstances by
                    the same word, all of which, however, are not essential to distinguish the
                    species to which that word belongs from the other species of words; and it is
                    the nature of man to infer from discourse many things which are not actually
                    expressed. Perhaps, however, something very nearly approaching to an
                    exemplification of our idea of a simple verb will be found in the proposition,
                    “The three angles of every plane triangle <hi rend="italic">are</hi> equal to
                    two right angles.” What other office the verb <hi rend="italic">are</hi> here
                    performs than simply to join the subject and predicate, it is difficult to
                    perceive. It does not give notice of time; or such notice, if given, is an
                    imperfection; for the truth of the proposition is independent of time. Neither
                    ought it to imply existence; for the proposition would be true were there
                    neither a triangle nor a right angle in nature.</p>
                <p>This idea of verb, when well considered, will be found just; but should any of
                    our readers suspect it of novelty, and on that account be disposed to condemn
                    it, we have only to request that he will restrain his censure till he has
                    examined the writings of others, and nicely observed the several states of his
                    own mind in discourse; for meditation may perhaps show him that our theory is
                    not false, and inquiry will satisfy him that it is not novel.<note

                <p>But although it is certain that assertion, and assertion only, is essential to
                    the verb, yet the greater part of that species of words which grammarians call
                    <hi rend="italic">verbs</hi> are used to denote an attribute as well as an
                    assertion; or, in the language of logic, they express both the copula and the
                    predicate of a proposition; thus, <hi rend="italic">he liveth, he writeth, he
                    walketh,</hi> are phrases equivalent in all respects to <hi rend="italic">he is
                    living, he is writing, he is walking.</hi> Now, of attributes, some have their
                    essence in motion, as <hi rend="italic">walking</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    some in the privation of motion, as <hi rend="italic">resting·,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">others</hi> have nothing to do with either motion or its
                    privation, as <hi rend="italic">white</hi> and <hi rend="italic">black.</hi> But
                    all motion and all privation of motion imply <hi rend="italic">time</hi> as
                    their concomitant; and a substance may have an attribute to-day which it had not
                    yesterday, and will not have to-morrow. This is self-evident; for a man may be
                    at rest to-day who yesterday was walking, and to-morrow will be on horseback;
                    and a sheet of paper may have been white yesterday which to-day is black, and at
                    some future time will be of a different colour. As, therefore, all motions and
                    their privations imply time; and as a proposition may be true at one time which
                    is not true at another, all <hi rend="italic">verbs,</hi> as well those which
                    denote both an attribute and an assertion, as those which denote an assertion
                    only, come to denote <hi rend="italic">time</hi> also. Hence the origin and use
                    of <hi rend="italic">tenses,</hi> which are so many different forms assigned to
                    each verb, to show, without altering its principal signification, the various
                    <hi rend="italic">times</hi> in which the assertion expressed by it may be true.
                    Whether these various forms of the verb be essential to language, it is vain to
                    dispute. They have place in every language with which we are acquainted; and as
                    the use of the verb is to affirm one thing of another, it is absolutely
                    necessary that the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> when such or such an affirmation
                    is true be marked by <hi rend="italic">tenses,</hi> or some other contrivance.
                    Concerning tenses, therefore, we shall throw together some observations, which,
                    <hi rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic">mutandis,</hi> are applicable to
                    every language, ŋremising only a general remark or two which seem necessary in
                    order to proceed with precision.</p>
                <p>Time, although its essence consists in succession continued and unbroken, may yet
                    be considered by the mind as divided into an infinite number of parts. There is,
                    however, one grand division which necessarily occurs, and to which the different
                    <hi rend="italic">tenses</hi> of verbs are in all languages adapted. Computing
                    from some portion conceived to be <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522521"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2521-0658"/><hi rend="italic">present,</hi> all time is either
                    <hi rend="italic">past</hi> or to <hi rend="italic">come.</hi> Hence the tenses
                    of verbs are threefold; some denoting time <hi rend="italic">present,</hi> some
                    time <hi rend="italic">past,</hi> and others time <hi rend="italic"
                    >future.</hi></p>
                <p>Again, from the very nature of time, it must be obvious that all its parts are
                    relative; or, in other words, that no portion of it can be ascertained by any
                    thing <hi rend="italic">inherent in itself,</hi> but only by referring it to
                    some other portion, with respect to which it is past, present, or to come. In
                    this respect time is perfectly analogous to space; for as the space in which any
                    object exists cannot be described but by stating its relation to some other
                    space, so neither can the time of any attribute or action be determined, but by
                    stating its relation to some other time. When, therefore, we would mark the time
                    of any action or event, we must previously fix upon some point to which we may
                    refer it. If this point be known, the time referred to it will also be known;
                    but if the former be not known, neither will the latter.</p>
                <p>Lastly, in contemplating an <hi rend="italic">action,</hi> we may have occasion
                    to consider it as <hi rend="italic">going on,</hi> or as <hi rend="italic"
                    >finished.</hi> This distinction is likewise denoted by the different tenses of
                    verbs. In treating, therefore, of the tenses, there are two things to which
                    attention ought principally to be turned ;—the <hi rend="italic">relation</hi>
                    which the several tenses have to one another in respect of time; and the notice
                    which ,they give of an action’s being <hi rend="italic">completed</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">not completed.</hi></p>
                <p>Having premised these remarks, we proceed now to the tenses themselves; of which
                    Mr Harris has enumerated no fewer than twelve. Of this enumeration we can by no
                    means approve; for, without entering into a minute examination of it, nothing
                    can be more obvious, than that his inceptive present, <hi rend="italic">I am
                    going to write,</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">future</hi> tense; and his
                    completive present, <hi rend="italic">I have written,</hi> a <hi rend="italic"
                    >past</hi> tense. But, as was before observed of the classification of words, we
                    cannot help being of opinion, that to take the tenses as they are commonly
                    received, and endeavour to ascertain their nature and their differences, is a
                    much more useful exercise, as well as more proper for a work of this kind, than
                    to raise, as might easily be done, new and hypothetical theories on the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>It has already been observed that all the tenses must necessarily mark <hi
                    rend="italic">relative time.</hi> In one sense this is extremely obvious. The
                    present tense is used in contradistinction to both the past and future, and
                    marks an attribute or action as existing in neither. The past and the future are
                    in like manner used in contradistinction to the present, and mark an attribute
                    or action which exists not now, but which in the one case has existed formerly,
                    and in the other will exist at some time coming. But besides this relation of
                    contradistinction subsisting among the tenses, there is another of co-existence,
                    as we may call it, to which it is of great consequence to attend, especially in
                    examining the nature of the present.</p>
                <p>The present tense refers not only to something which is past or future, but also
                    to something with which the attribute or action of the verb is contemporary.
                    This reference is necessarily implied in its very name; for we cannot say of any
                    thing that it is present, without implying at the same time that there is
                    something else with which it is present. Hence it appears with how little reason
                    Mr Harris and others have given us an aorist of the present, as marking present
                    time indefinitely in contradistinction to <hi rend="italic">other</hi> presents,
                    which have been called <hi rend="italic">inceptive, extended,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">completive presents.</hi> For from what has been said, it follows,
                    that the present tense is necessarily and from its very nature perfectly
                    indefinite, and can of itself give notice of no precise or determinate portion
                    or point of time whatever. A thing may have been present fifty years ago, may be
                    present now, or at any future period. This tense implies the relation of
                    co-existence between two or more things; but without some auxiliary
                    circumstance, it cannot in any language mark the particular portion of time in
                    which those things exist. The indefinite nature of this tense is indeed most
                    clearly seen in that use of it in which Mr Harris has styled it the aorist of
                    the present; that is, in cases where it is employed to denote the repetition of
                    an action which the agent is accustomed frequently to perform, or to express
                    propositions of which the truth is evinced by general experience; as in the
                    following examples :—</p>
                <p>Hypocrisy the only evil that <hi rend="italic">walks</hi></p>
                <p>Invisible, except to God alone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ad</hi><hi rend="italic">pernitendum</hi> properat <hi
                    rend="italic">jui</hi><hi rend="italic">cito judicat.</hi></p>
                <p>In these instances it is plain that there is no particular time pointed out; the
                    propositions are <hi rend="italic">true,</hi> or apprehended as true, at all
                    times. Although the actions, therefore, of “walking” and “hastening” are
                    expressed as present, it is impossible from the expressions to determine any
                    precise point of time when they are present.</p>
                <p>But if the <hi rend="italic">present tense</hi> be thus indefinite, how, it may
                    be asked, are we to ascertain the particular time which is intended? We answer,
                    it is to be ascertained, either by stating the action of the verb as existing in
                    some time already known, or by inference. If, for example, we say, “Millions of
                    spiritual creatures <hi rend="italic">walk</hi> the earth unseen,” the
                    proposition is general, and the time of walking undetermined. But if we add,
                    “both <hi rend="italic">when</hi> we <hi rend="italic">wake</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">when</hi> we <hi rend="italic">sleep,”</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >time</hi> is by this addition ascertained and specified; for if the time when
                    men wake and sleep be known, the time when these spirits walk the earth is also
                    known. When no specifying clause is given by which to determine the time of the
                    present tense, it is very commonly determined by inference. Thus, if one use
                    such an expression as “He <hi rend="italic">sleeps</hi> while I am <hi
                    rend="italic">speaking to him,”</hi> the time of his sleeping is ascertained by
                    the subsequent clause of the sentence; but if it be said simply, “he sleeps,”
                    without assigning any data from which it may be concluded when his sleeping is
                    present, we very naturally infer that it is at the instant when we receive the
                    information of his sleeping. Such inferences as this are common in language. The
                    mind is desirous to obtain complete information on every subject, and therefore
                    frequently supplies to itself what is not expressed in the speech of others.</p>
                <p>Both these ways of ascertaining the precise time of the present tense are
                    excellently illustrated by the use of the word present as applied to space. Take
                    a familiar example: “His brother and he were <hi rend="italic">present</hi> when
                    I read the letter.” It is at first sight evident that this expression is
                    perfectly indefinite. But if it be said, “His brother and he were <hi
                    rend="italic">present at your house</hi> when I read the letter,” the place of
                    action is then determined by being referred to a portion of space which is
                    known. If no such reference be made, the person who hears the speech uttered
                    must either remain ignorant of the place intended, or he must ascertain it to
                    himself by inference; and he will probably infer it to be that in which the
                    speaker is at the time of his uttering the indefinite sentence. This leads us to
                    observe, that such inferences are not often made without sufficient foundation.
                    Various circumstances may assist the reader or hearer in making them, and
                    prevent all danger of mistake. He may have the evidence of sense, or of
                    something preceding in the discourse, and a number of other particulars, to
                    warrant his conclusion. Thus, if, when sitting by a large fire, any one
                    pronounce the words “I am too warm,” those to whom he addresses his speech are
                    authorized to conclude that he is too warm at the time of speaking, unless he
                    expressly prevent the drawing of that conclusion by adding some such clause as
                    “when I wear a great coat.”</p>
                <p>It is strictly demonstrable, and has been in fact demonstrated by Mr Harris, that
                    there is no such thing as present time. Yet do we not only conceive time as
                    present <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522534" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2534-0659"/>and
                    existing, but frequently as extended to a very great ’ degree. We speak not only
                    of the present instant, or the present day, but also of the present year, and
                    even of the present century. This manner of conceiving time is indeed loose and
                    unphilosophical, but it is sufficient for the ordinary purposes of language. To
                    express time as it really is, we ought to say, the passing day, the passing
                    year, and the passing century; but in common discourse we denominate any portion
                    of time present, in which the present now or instant is included, although it is
                    obvious that part of that portion is past, and the remainder of it future. From
                    the very nature of time thus conceived to be present, the tense now under
                    consideration must represent the action of the verb as commenced, and not
                    finished; for as time is in continued succession, and accompanies every action,
                    when any action is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> commenced, it exists not in any
                    time, although it may exist hereafter in time which is now future; and when it
                    is finished, it exists no longer in time present, but in <hi rend="italic">time
                    past.</hi> Hence the absurdity of introducing into a theory of the tenses an
                    inceptive present and a completive present; for these terms imply each a direct
                    contradiction.</p>
                <p>After having said so much respecting the present tense, we shall have but little
                    to say of the <hi rend="italic">prater-imperfect.</hi> It states an action in
                    regard to time as <hi rend="italic">past;</hi> and in respect of progress, as
                    <hi rend="italic">unfinished.</hi><hi rend="italic">Legebam,</hi> I was reading
                    at some time, but my reading was then incomplete; I had not finished the book or
                    the letter. We must here observe, however, as we did with respect to the present
                    tense, that although the praeter-imperfect represents the action as past, it
                    does not inform us in what precise portion of past time the unfinished action
                    was going on; this circumstance must either be given in separate words, or be
                    inferred by the hearer. If one say simply, <hi rend="italic">Legebam,</hi> the
                    person to whom he addresses his speech will conclude that the time of liis
                    reading is past with respect to the present time of his speaking. But if he say
                    <hi rend="italic">Legebam antequam venisti,</hi> he expressly states the action
                    of reading as past with respect to the time in which his hearer came to the
                    place where they both are at the time of speaking. The time of the
                    praeter-imperfect is always past with respect to the present instant when the
                    imperfect is used, and of this the tense itself gives notice; but it may also
                    b.e past with respect to some other time, and of this it conveys no
                    information.</p>
                <p>If we join two praeter-imperſects together, the expression will state the
                    co-existence of two progressive actions, both of which were going on at a time
                    <hi rend="italic">past</hi> in respect of some determinate time given or
                    supposed. <hi rend="italic">Oum</hi><hi rend="italic">tu scribebas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ego</hi><hi rend="italic">legebam</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    “when you were writing 1 was reading.” Hence the praeter-imperfect has by some
                    grammarians been called the relative present; a name which, however, is by no
                    means exclusively applicable to this tense. When the praeter-imperfect is by the
                    conjunction <hi rend="italic">and</hi> joined in the same sentence with a
                    plusquam-perſect, the two tenses express two actions, both prior to the time of
                    speaking; but the one as having continued after the other was finished. Thus
                    Aeneas, speaking of the destruction of Troy, says, that after having escaped
                    with his father and followers, he returned to the city in quest of his wife, and
                    went directly to his own house; but there, continues he, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Irruerant</hi> Danai, et tectum omne <hi rend="italic">tenebant,</hi> “the
                    Greeks <hi rend="italic">had rushed in,"</hi> that action was over and completed
                    <hi rend="italic">before his arrival;</hi> but the act of “possessing the whole
                    house,” <hi rend="italic">tenebant,</hi> was not over, but still continuing.</p>
                <p>But it is necessary 'that the verb should denote actions which were complete or
                    perfect in past time, as well as those which were incomplete or imperfect. For
                    this purpose Greek and English verbs have an aorist, a praeter-perfect, and a
                    plusquam-perfect. Of these the Latin has only the two last. The praeter-perfect
                    in that language sustains a twofold character; it performs the office of the
                    Greek and English aorist, as well as that of the praeter-perfect properly so
                    called; that is, it denotes a finished action at some indefinite past time, as
                    well as at some time which is both past and definite.</p>
                <p>In attempting to analyse the signification of complex terms, by which we here
                    mean words that include m their signification a variety of particulars, it is of
                    great advantage to have these particulars separately expressed by different
                    words in another language. Now the English has resolved the tenses, which in the
                    Greek and Latin languages are denominated the aorist and the praeter-perfect, by
                    means of what are commonly called auxiliary verbs, expressing the former by the
                    verb <hi rend="italic">did,</hi> and the latter by the verb <hi rend="italic"
                    >have.</hi> In examining therefore the aorist and praeter-perfect, it will be of
                    use to inquire into the import of these verbs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Did</hi> is evidently the aorist of the verb <hi rend="italic"
                    >to do</hi>; a verb of the most general signification, as it denotes action of
                    every kind. It expresses the finished performance of some action, the completion
                    of which must of course have taken place in some portion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >past time</hi><hi rend="italic">: “</hi><hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">did</hi><hi rend="italic">write,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">I
                    wrote</hi> (these expressions being equivalent) yesterday, a month, a year ago.”
                    But the import of <hi rend="italic">did</hi> being so very general, it can
                    convey no determinate meaning without being limited by the addition of some
                    particular action; and this addition, however expressed, is to be considered in
                    the same light as an accusative case, governed by the active verb <hi
                    rend="italic">did;</hi> for it produces exactly the same effect. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Eχsα∙ψα, <hi rend="italic">scripsi,</hi> I <hi
                    rend="italic">did</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">write;</hi> that is, “at some past
                    time 1 performed the <hi rend="italic">action</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                    >writing,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">finished it.”</hi></p>
                <p>The verb <hi rend="italic">have,</hi> which is included in the praeter-perfect,
                    is plainly a verb of the present tense denoting possession, But a man may
                    possess one thing as well as another; and therefore <hi rend="italic">have</hi>
                    requires limitation, for the very same reason that <hi rend="italic">did</hi>
                    requires it, namely, because its signification is perfectly general. Now this
                    limitation, whatever it is, must be conceived as the thing possessed; and in
                    instances where <hi rend="italic">have</hi> is limited by a noun, this is
                    obvious, and universally acknowledged. “I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> a gold
                    watch,” means “I <hi rend="italic">possess</hi> a gold watch." But to annex the
                    same meaning to the word <hi rend="italic">have,</hi> when used as an anxiliary
                    verb, is an idea we believe not common, and which may perhaps be thought
                    whimsical; yet what other meaning can be affixed to it? To suppose that words
                    have not each a radical and determinate signification, is to suppose language a
                    subject incapable of philosophical investigation; and to suppose, with Mr
                    Harris, that there are words entirely devoid of signification, is at once to
                    render all inquiries into the principles of grammar nugatory and ridiculous. We
                    conceive, then, that each of the phrases, <hi rend="italic">γtγςaφa</hi>
                    ⅛∕tfroai)v, <hi rend="italic">scripsi epistolam,</hi> I <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >have</hi><hi rend="italic">written a letter,</hi> is equivalent to the phrase,
                    “I <hi rend="italic">possess</hi> at present the <hi rend="italic">finished
                    action</hi> of writing a letter.” Such an expression may sound harsh to the ear,
                    because it is not in use; but we often employ expressions, to the precise and
                    proper meaning of which we do not attend; and if the above be attentively
                    considered, however awkward it may at first appear, nothing will be found in it
                    either improper or absurd.</p>
                <p>The aorist, then, we conceive to state an action as performed and finished in
                    some past portion of time; whilst the praeter-perfect represents the past
                    performance and completion of that action as <hi rend="italic">now</hi>
                    possessed. And here we may hazard a conjecture why <hi rend="italic">have,</hi>
                    when used as an auxiliary verb, is always joined with a past participle; whereas
                    <hi rend="italic">did</hi> is joined to a word expressing the simple action of
                    the verb, or, as it is called, present infinitive. Of the expression, “I <hi
                    rend="italic">have</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">written</hi> a letter,” <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> part, namely, the verb <hi rend="italic">have,</hi>
                    denotes <hi rend="italic">present time;</hi> the other part, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">written,</hi> must denote past time, to give notice that the
                    action is perſormed and finished. <hi rend="italic">Did,</hi> on the other <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193522547" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2547-0660"/> hand, implying
                    past time, has no occasion for the past part of another verb to give notice of
                    this circumstance; for “I <hi rend="italic">did</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >write</hi> a letter,” is equivalent to, “at some past time I performed and
                    finished the simple action of writing a letter.”</p>
                <p>The principal distinction in practice between the aorist and praeter-perſect (for
                    the difference seems litt)e in their real import) consists in the time by which
                    the performance of the action admits of being particularly specified. The
                    praeter-perſect is always joined with a portion of time which includes the
                    present <hi rend="italic">now or instant</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for
                    otherwise it could not signify, as it always does, the present possession of the
                    finishing of an action. But the aorist, which signifies no such possession, is
                    as constantly joined with a portion of past time which excludes the present <hi
                    rend="italic">now</hi> or <hi rend="italic">instant.</hi> Thus we not only say,
                    “I <hi rend="italic">have written</hi> a letter <hi rend="italic">this</hi> day,
                    <hi rend="italic">this</hi> week,” but “I <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> a letter
                    <hi rend="italic">yesterday,</hi> last week and to interchange these expressions
                    of time in Greek and English, where the aorist and praeter-perſect have
                    different forms, would be improper. In Latin, indeed, where they have but one
                    form, the impropriety does not appear.</p>
                <p>Besides the tenses already examined, which are expressive of past time, in most
                    languages the verb has another tense called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >plusquam-perfect,</hi> in which, however, no difficulty occurs to detain our
                    attention. What the praeter-imperfect is to the present tense, that the
                    plusquam-perfect is to the praeter-perſect. The verb <hi rend="italic">had,</hi>
                    by which it is resolved in English, being evidently the past time of <hi
                    rend="italic">have,</hi> sufficiently explains its meaning and relation to the
                    other tenses. “I <hi rend="italic">had</hi> written a letter,” is equivalent to
                    the phrase, “I <hi rend="italic">possessed</hi> at some <hi rend="italic">past
                    time</hi> the finished action of writing a letter.” It is justly observed by Dr
                    Beattie, that the imperfect and plusquam-perfect are very useful, and may be the
                    sources of much elegant expression; and that if one were not taught to
                    distinguish, in respect of meaning as well as of form, these tenses from each
                    other, and the praeterite from both, one could not pretend to understand, far
                    less to translate, any good classic author.</p>
                <p>Having considered the tenses which imply present and past time, it now remains
                    that we examine the import of those which are expressive of time <hi
                    rend="italic">future.</hi> In Latin and English there are two tenses for this
                    purpose, of which the first represents an action in point of time as <hi
                    rend="italic">not yet existing,</hi> but as about to exist at some period to
                    come; but it does not bring the completion of the action into view. The other
                    asserts the <hi rend="italic">futurity</hi> of an action together with its
                    completion. <hi rend="italic">Scribam,</hi> “I shall be writing,” denotes <hi
                    rend="italic">future</hi> time and <hi rend="italic">incomplete action;</hi> for
                    it does not say whether I am to write for a long or for a short time, or whether
                    I shall finish what I promise to begin. This part of the verb, therefore, to
                    which the Greek yja∙ψ*ι corresponds, is an imperfect future, or, in other words,
                    indefinite. The futurity of any action, it should seem, may always be computed
                    from the time of speaking; for every action must be future with respect to the
                    time at which its futurity is declared: but the time of its futurity may be more
                    precisely specified by fixing upon some other future time to which to refer it:
                    “I shall be writing after he shall have departed.” <hi rend="italic">Shall</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">will</hi> refers to future time indefinitely; and <hi
                    rend="italic">write</hi> or <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> refers to an action
                    which is indeed to <hi rend="italic">begin</hi> and so far to proceed, but of
                    which nothing is said concerning the completion.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, <hi rend="italic">scripsero,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> shall have written,” is a perfect future denoting complete
                    action; for <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> denotes future time; <hi rend="italic"
                    >written,</hi> finished action; and <hi rend="italic">have,</hi> present
                    possession. So that the meaning of the whole assertion is, that “at some future
                    period of time I shall possess the finished action of writing.” The completion
                    of the action, together with the possession of it, is always future with respect
                    to the time of assertion; but, with respect to some other time expressed or
                    understood, the completion of the action is to be past: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Promittis to scripturum</hi><hi rend="italic">si</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rogavero,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> you promise to write if I shall have
                    asked you.” In this sentence the action of asking is future with relation to the
                    time of promising, but it is past with relation to that of writing. This tense
                    the Latin grammarians call the future of the subjunctive mode, but very
                    improperly. The notice which it communicates respects not the power or liberty
                    of acting, which, as will be seen by and by, is the characteristic of that mode;
                    but only the action itself. It ought, therefore, to be ranked among the tenses
                    of the indicative mode; for <hi rend="italic">scripsero</hi> is, in every sense,
                    as really indicative as <hi rend="italic">scribam</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >scripturus ero.</hi></p>
                <p>These are all the tenses, essentially different from each other, which have place
                    in the indicative mode (or mood) of any language with which we are
                    acquainted;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“It will
                    perhaps occur,” says an elegant and ingenious writer, “that there are two Greek
                    tenses of which I have given no account; namely, the <hi rend="italic">ιccond
                    aorirt</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">second future.</hi> The truth is, that I
                    consider them as unnecessary. Their place, for any thing I know to the contrary,
                    might at all times be supplied by the <hi rend="italic">frit aorist</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">first future.</hi> Some grammarians are of opinion that the
                    first aorist signifies time past in general, and the second indefinite time
                    past; and that the first tuture denotes u nearer, and the second a more remote,
                    futurity. But this, I apprehend, is mere conjecture, unsupported by proof; and
                    therefore I incline rather to the sentiments of those who teach that the second
                    future and the second aorist have no meaning different from the first future and
                    the first aorist; and that they are the present and imperfect of some obsolete
                    theme of the verb; and wķen the other theme came into use, happened to be
                    retained for the sake of variety perhaps, or by accident, with a preterite and
                    future signification. Be this as it will, as these tenses are peculiar to the
                    Greek, and have nothing corresponding to them in other tongues, we need not
                    scruple to overlook them as superfluous.” (Beattie on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theory of Language,</hi> part ii. chap. 2.) To these judicious observations we
                    have nothing to add, except that they acquire no small degree of confirmation
                    from the circumstance that there are many Greek verbs which have no second
                    future, and which are yet employed to denote every possible modification of
                    future time. Of the <hi rend="italic">yaulo-jmt-futurum</hi> of the Greeks we
                    have taken no notice, because it is found only in the passive voice; to which,
                    if it were necessary, it is obvious that it would be necessary in <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> voices, as a man may be about to <hi rend="italic"
                    >act</hi> as well as to <hi rend="italic">sujļcr</hi> immediately.</p></note>
                    but as there are tenses in the mode called <hi rend="italic">subjunctive,</hi>
                    which bear the same names with those already examined, and which have yet a
                    different import, it will be necessary to consider them before we dismiss the
                    subject of tenses. Of <hi rend="italic">modes</hi> in general something will be
                    said hereafter; at present we shall only observe, that the mode with which we
                    are now concerned is not very properly distinguished by the name assigned to it
                    by the Latin grammarians. They call it the <hi rend="italic">subjunctive,</hi>
                    because it is often subjoined to another verb, and forms the secondary clause of
                    a sentence; but the mode called <hi rend="italic">indicative</hi> frequently
                    appears in the same circumstances. The difference between these two modes
                    appears to us to consist in this, that the indicative asserts something directly
                    concerning the action, and the subjunctive, something concerning the power or
                    liberty of the agent to perform it; for that the latter asserts as well as the
                    former, admits not of dispute.</p>
                <p>The present tense of the <hi rend="italic">subjunctive mode,</hi> in the learned
                    languages, answers to the English auxiliaries may and <hi rend="italic"
                    >can.</hi> Let us consider these a little. <hi rend="italic">May</hi> is
                    evidently a verb of the present tense denoting <hi rend="italic">liberty.</hi>
                    When I assert that I <hi rend="smallcaps">may</hi><hi rend="italic">write,</hi>
                    I give notice that I am under no <hi rend="italic">compulsion</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">abstain</hi> from writing; that there is no impediment from
                    without by which I am restrained from writing. <hi rend="italic">Can</hi> is
                    also a verb of the present tense, expressive of internal power or skill. “I <hi
                    rend="italic">can</hi> write” is equivalent to such an <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522560" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2560-0661"/>expression as this: “There is
                    nothing in myself which incapacitates me for performing the operation of
                    writing.” This verb seems originally to have denoted knowledge or skill, and to
                    have been afterwards extended to signify power or ability of any kind. There is
                    little doubt of its being the same with the old English verb <hi rend="italic"
                    >to con,</hi> which signifies to <hi rend="italic">know.</hi> The difference
                    between the import of these two verbs, <hi rend="italic">may</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">can,</hi> will be best perceived in a familiar example. Suppose we
                    say to any one, “You <hi rend="italic">may</hi> write a treatise on grammar,” to
                    which he returns for answer, “I <hi rend="italic">cannot;"</hi> our assertion
                    evidently supposes him at liberty to write the treatise; his answer implies that
                    he is unable or unskilled to do it. We may conclude, then, that the present
                    tense of this mode contains a declaration of present liberty, ability, or skill;
                    and its other tenses will be found to have reference to the same capacities.</p>
                <p>The observation is here to be repeated which was enlarged upon when treating of
                    the present of the indicative. The liberty or ability signified by this tense is
                    always represented as present, but the time of this presence is indefinite. If
                    no particular time be specified, we generally refer it to the time of speaking;
                    but another point may be given from which we are to compute. “When he shall have
                    finished, you <hi rend="italic">may</hi> then proceed as you propose.” Here the
                    liberty of proceeding is stated as present, not at the time of speaking, but at
                    the time of his finishing, which is future to the time of speaking. But though
                    the liberty, ability, or skill, denoted by this tense, be represented as
                    present, the action itself is stated as <hi rend="italic">contingent</hi>; for
                    it is not necessary that a man should perform an action because he has the
                    capacity to perform it.</p>
                <p>From this idea of the present of the subjunctive some of its most peculiar uses
                    seem capable of being explained. And, in the first place, it appears to have a
                    near affinity with the future of the indicative, insomuch that in many instances
                    they may be used promiscuously. Without materially altering the effect of the
                    expression, we may say, “Dicome facturum esse quae <hi rend="italic"
                    >imperet"</hi> or “quae <hi rend="italic">imperabit”</hi> The reason of this,
                    perhaps, may be, that with respect to <hi rend="italic">as, futurity</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">contingency</hi> are in most cases nearly the same, both being
                    involved in equal obscurity; and therefore it is often of little consequence
                    which mode of expression we employ.</p>
                <p>Secondly, the present of the subjunctive is used to denote the right of which a
                    person is possessed. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">I may,</hi> or I
                    <hi rend="italic">can,</hi> sell this book.” This application, which Dr
                    Priestley considers as the primary signification of the tense, is easily
                    deduced, or rather it follows immediately from the foregoing account of its
                    import. For if one be under no restraint, either external or internal, to
                    prevent him from performing an action, he has surely a right to perform it.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, the present of the subjunctive is often used to signify command or
                    request; as when one says, “You <hi rend="italic">may give</hi> my compliments
                    to such a person.” This use of the tense under consideration seems to have
                    arisen from a desire to soften the harshness of a command, by avoiding the
                    appearance of claiming superiority. When a man utters the above sentence, he
                    certainly utters no command, but only asserts that the person to whom he speaks
                    has liberty or power to do him a favour. This assertion, however, may contain no
                    new information; and therefore the person addressed, reflecting upon the
                    intention of the speaker in making it, infers that it indicates a <hi
                    rend="italic">wish or desire</hi> that his compliments should be made to such a
                    person.</p>
                <p>Of the subjunctive as well as of the indicative, the praeter-imperfect is
                    evidently the past time of the present. As the latter asserts liberty or ability
                    to perform some action, as existing at present, the former asserts the same
                    liberty or ability to have existed in time past; but the precise portion of time
                    past in which these capacities existed must be specified by other words, or it
                    will remain unknown. Thus, in the following sentence, “Dixi me facturum esse
                    quae <hi rend="italic">imperaret”</hi> the time of <hi rend="italic"
                    >imperaret</hi> is referred to that of <hi rend="italic">dixi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the person having the right to command is supposed to have
                    had it at the time when the other said that he would obey. This tense, as well
                    as the present, states the action as going on and incomplete; and also as future
                    with respect to the liberty or ability to perform it. It is rendered into
                    English by the verbs <hi rend="italic">could</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >might,</hi> of which the first is the past time of <hi rend="italic">can,</hi>
                    and the second of <hi rend="italic">may.</hi> From the near affinity which the
                    present of the subjunctive has to the future of the indicative, the tense now
                    under consideration appears in many instances as the past time of the latter as
                    well as the former. Thus, <hi rend="italic">Dixi me</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >facturum</hi><hi rend="italic">quae</hi><hi rend="italic">imperaret,</hi> may
                    be rendered “I said that I would do whatever he might, or whatever he <hi
                    rend="italic">should,</hi> command.”</p>
                <p>Of the praeter-perfect it is sufficient to observe, that as the present states
                    the agent as at <hi rend="italic">liberty</hi> to be performing an unfinished
                    action, so this tense states him as at liberty to perform the action considered
                    as finished. “I <hi rend="italic">may be writing</hi> a letter when you come
                    that is, “I <hi rend="italic">am at liberty to be writing</hi> a letter when you
                    come.” “I <hi rend="italic">may have written</hi> a letter when you come that
                    is, “I <hi rend="italic">am at liberty to be in possession of the finished
                    action</hi> of writing a letter when you come.” It is a common mode of
                    expression to say, “I may have done such or such a thing in my time,” when he
                    who speaks can have little doubt whether he has done the thing or not. In that
                    case, the words <hi rend="italic">may have done,</hi> cannot be considered as
                    the praeter-perfect of the subjunctive of the verb <hi rend="italic">do</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> for it is nonsense to talk of liberty with respect to the
                    performance of an action, which at the time of speaking is supposed to be past
                    and completed. What, then, is the import of the phrase? We are persuaded that it
                    is elliptical, and that the word <hi rend="italic">say</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >affirm</hi> is understood: “1 may (say that I) have done such or such a thing
                    in my time for liberty or contingency can relate to actions only as they are
                    conceived to be present or future.</p>
                <p>Of all the tenses, the most complex is the plusquam-perfect of this mode. It
                    combines a past and a future time with a finished action. It may be considered
                    as the past time both of the perfect future and the praeter-perfect of the <hi
                    rend="italic">subjunctive;</hi> for it represents an action, future and
                    contingent at some <hi rend="italic">past time,</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >finished before</hi> another <hi rend="italic">period specified</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> which period, therefore, though past at the time of
                    speaking, was itself future with respect to the time when the futurity or
                    contingency of the action existed. “Promisisti to scripturum fuisse si <hi
                    rend="italic">rogassem;”</hi> “You promised that you would write, if I should
                    have asked you.” Here the futurity of the action of <hi rend="italic"
                    >asking,</hi> which is represented as complete and finished, is stated as <hi
                    rend="italic">co-ecisting</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">past promise</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but the action itself must be <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior</hi> to that promise. It is however supposed to be past with respect
                    to the action of writing, which is also posterior to the promise.</p>
                <p>Before we dismiss the subject of tenses, it may not be improper just to mention
                    number and person; for these have place in every tense of the verb in the
                    learned languages, and in many tenses even of the English verb. They cannot,
                    however, be deemed essential to the verb; for affirmation is the same, whether
                    it be made by you, by me, or by a third person, or whether it be made by one man
                    or by a thousand. The most that can be said .is, that verbs in the more elegant
                    languages are provided with a variety of terminations which respect the number
                    and person of every substantive, that we may know with more precision, in a
                    complex sentence, each particular substance, with its attendant verbal
                    attributes. The same <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522573"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2573-0662"/>may be said of sex with respect to adjectives.
                    They have terminations which vary as they respect beings male or female, though
                    it is past dispute that substances alone are susceptible of sex. We therefore
                    pass over these matters, and all of like kind, as being rather amongst the
                    elegancies of particular languages, and therefore to be learned from the
                    particular grammar of each tongue, than amongst the essentials of language;
                    which essentials alone are the subject of inquiry in a treatise on universal
                    grammar.</p>
                <p>Besides tenses, number, and person, in every tongue with which we are acquainted,
                    verbs are subject to another variation, which grammarians have agreed to call
                    <hi rend="italic">mode»</hi> or <hi rend="italic">moods.</hi> Of modes, as of
                    tenses, it has been warmly disputed whether or not they be essential to
                    language. The truth seems to be, that the only part of the verb absolutely
                    necessary for the purpose of communicating thought is the indicative mode; for
                    all the others, as has been well observed by Dr Gregory, are resolvable, by
                    means of additional verbs and a word denoting the action of the pritaary verb,
                    into circuitous expressions which fully convey their meaning.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The imperative, for instance,
                    may be resolved into a verb of commanding in the first person of the present of
                    the indicative, and a word denoting the action of the primary verb, commonly
                    called the infinitive mode of that verb. Thus, <hi rend="italic">I nunc</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">versus tecum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >meditare</hi><hi rend="italic">canoros,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jubco to
                    nunc ire</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">tecum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">meditari,</hi><hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> are sentences of the
                    very same import. The subjunctive may be resolved in the same manner by means of
                    a verb denoting power or capacity; for <hi rend="italic">credam,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">possum credere,</hi> may oftéh be used indifferently. The
                    indicative mode, however, is not thus convertible with another verb of affirming
                    in the first person of the present of the indicative, and a word denoting the
                    action of the primary verb; for <hi rend="italic">Titius scribit,</hi> “Titius
                    writes,” is not of the same import with <hi rend="italic">dicoTitium
                    scribere,</hi><hi rend="italic">quad</hi><hi rend="italic">Titius scribat,</hi>
                    “1 say that Titius writes.”· The first of these sentences, as has already been
                    shown, contains but one assertion; the second obviously contains two. <hi
                    rend="italic">Titius</hi><hi rend="italic">writes,</hi> is equivalent to <hi
                    rend="italic">Titius</hi> is <hi rend="italic">writing</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi><hi rend="italic">I say that</hi><hi rend="italic">Titius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">writes,</hi> is equivalent to <hi rend="italic">I</hi><hi

                    >Titius</hi> is <hi rend="italic">writing.</hi> The reason why the imperative
                    and sultjunctive are resolvable into expressions into which the <hi
                    rend="italic">indicative</hi> cannot be resolved, will be seen when the import
                    of each of those modes is ascertained.</p></note> But such expressions
                    continually repeated would make language very prolix and wholly devoid of
                    animation; and for this reason the import of each of the commonly received modes
                    is a subject worthy of the philologist’s investigation. About the number of
                    modes, whether necessary or only expedient, as well as about the import of each,
                    the writers on grammar have differed in opinion. Mr Harris, one of the most
                    celebrated of those writers, has enumerated four modes of the verb, besides the
                    infinitive: viz. the <hi rend="italic">indicative</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >declarative,</hi> to assert what we think certain; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >potential</hi> or <hi rend="italic">subjunctive,</hi> for the purposes of
                    whatever we think contingent; the <hi rend="italic">interrogative,</hi> when we
                    are doubtful, to procure us information; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >requisitive,</hi> to assist us in the gratification of our volitions. The
                    requisitive, too, according to him, appears under two distinct species; either
                    as it is <hi rend="italic">imperative</hi> to inferiors, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >precative</hi> to superiors. For establishing such a variety of modes as this,
                    there appears to be no sort of foundation whatever. The same reasoning which
                    induced the author to give us an interrogative and requisitive mode, might have
                    made him give us a hortative, a dissuasive, a volitive, and innumerable other
                    modes, with which no language is acquainted. But besides perplexing his reader
                    with useless distinctions, we cannot help thinking that Mr Harris has fallen
                    into some mistakes with regard to the import of those modes which are
                    universally acknowledged. According to him, <hi rend="italic">assertion</hi> is
                    the characteristic of the indicative, and that which distinguishes it from the
                    subjunctive or potential; but this is certainly not true, for, without an
                    assertion, the verb cannot be used in any mode. Of this the learned author
                    indeed seems to have been aware, when he observed respecting the subjunctive
                    mode, that it is employed “when we do not <hi rend="italic">strictly</hi>
                    assert,” and that “it implies but a <hi rend="italic">dubious</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">conjectural</hi> assertion.” The truth is, that the assertion
                    implied in this mode, though it is not concerning the same thing, is equally
                    positive and absolute with that conveyed by the indicative. An example quoted by
                    himself should have set him right as to this matter:</p>
                <p>Sed tacitus pasci si posset corvus, <hi rend="italic">haberet</hi> Plus
                    dapis.</p>
                <p>Who does not feel that the assertion contained in <hi rend="italic">haberet</hi>
                    is as absolute and positive as any assertion whatever?</p>
                <p>Perhaps we may be asked to define what we mean by a mode. We know not that we can
                    define it to the satisfaction of all. Thus much, however, seems to be obvious,
                    that those variations which are called modes do not imply <hi rend="italic"
                    >different modifications</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">action</hi> of the verb.
                    <hi rend="italic">Amo, Ämem, Ama,</hi> do not signify modes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >loving;</hi> for modes of loving are, loving <hi rend="italic">much,</hi>
                    loving <hi rend="italic">little,</hi> loving <hi rend="italic">long,</hi> loving
                    <hi rend="italic">short,</hi> and the like. Shall we then get over the
                    difficulty by saying, with Mr Harris, that “modes exhibit some way or other the
                    <hi rend="italic">soul</hi> and its <hi rend="italic">affections</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">?”</hi> This is certainly true, but it is nothing to the purpose;
                    for it does not distinguish the meaning of mode from the object of language in
                    general, all languages being intended to exhibit the soul and its
                    affections.</p>
                <p>Grammatical modes of verbs have been defined by Dr Gregory to be “concise modes
                    of expressing some of those combinations of thoughts which occur most
                    frequently, and are most important and striking.” This is a just observation;
                    but perhaps he would have given a more complete definition had he said, that
                    grammatical modes of verbs are concise modes of expressing some of those
                    combinations of thoughts which occur most frequently, and of which <hi
                    rend="italic">assertion</hi> is an essential part.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Every verb, except the simple verb <hi
                    rend="italic">am, art, is,</hi> &amp;c. expresses without modes a combination of
                    thoughts, namely, affirmation and an attribute. The affirmation, however, is
                    alone essential to the verb, for the attribute may be expressed by other words.
                    It is indeed extremely probable, that in the earliest ages of the world, the
                    affirmation and attribute were always expressed by different words; and that
                    afterwards, for the sake of conciseness, one word, compounded perhaps of these
                    two, was made to express both the affirmation and the attribute; hence arose the
                    various classes of verbs, <hi rend="italic">active, passive,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">neuter.</hi> Of a process of this kind there are evident signs in
                    the Greek and some other tongues. But the improvers of language stopped not
                    here. The same love of conciseness induced them to modify the compound verb
                    itself, that it might express various combinations of thought still more
                    complex; but in aU these combinations <hi rend="italic">assertion</hi> was of
                    necessity included; for if the word had ceased to assert, it. would have ceased
                    to be a verb of any kind.</p></note> This indeed seems to be the real account of
                    the matter, especially if our notion of the nature of verb be well founded, that
                    its essence consists in affirmation. And in this opinion we are the more
                    confirmed, from a conviction that no man ever employs language on any occasion
                    but for the purpose of affirming something. The speaker may affirm something
                    directly of the action itself, something of the agent’s power or capacity to
                    perform it, or something of his own desire that it should be performed, but
                    still he must affirm. If this be so, then are all the modes equally indicative.
                    Some may be indicative of perceptions, and others of volitions; but still they
                    all contain <hi rend="italic">indications.</hi> On this idea the three foregoing
                    modes of <hi rend="italic">ano</hi> will be thus distinguished: When a man
                    indicates his present <hi rend="italic">feeling of</hi> the passion of love, he
                    uses the first; when he indicates his present <hi rend="italic">capacity</hi> of
                    feeling it, he uses the second; and when he indicates his present <hi
                    rend="italic">desire</hi> that the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522586"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2586-0663"/>person to whom he is speaking would entertain that
                    passion, he uses the third.</p>
                <p>As to what Mr Harris calls the interrogative mode, he observes that it has a near
                    affinity to the indicative. It has in fact not only a near affinity to it, but,
                    as far as language is concerned, there is not between the one and the other the
                    slightest difference. For, in written language, take away the mark of
                    interrogation, and, in spoken language, the peculiar tone of voice, and the
                    interrogative and indicative modes appear precisely the same. That such should
                    be the case is extremely natural. To illustrate this, let us for once speak in
                    the singular number, and conceive one of our readers to be present. “J assert a
                    thing, taking the truth of it for granted; but if you know me to be wrong, I
                    presume that you will set me right.” In this case, assertion produces the same
                    effect as interrogation. Instances of the same kind perpetually occur in common
                    conversation. An acquaintance says to me, “You took a ride this morning.” I
                    answer yes or no, according to the case; and the same effect is produced as if
                    he had said, “Did you take a ride this morning?” In this way simple assertions
                    would at first be employed to procure information wanted. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fecisti,</hi> you <hi rend="italic">did</hi> such a thing; <hi rend="italic"
                    >feãsti</hi><hi rend="italic">ne,</hi> you did it <hi rend="italic">not;</hi>
                    either would produce the proper reply, and the information wanted would be
                    gained.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of a question
                    put in the form of an assertion we have a remarkable instance in the gospel of
                    St Matthew, when Christ stood before tilate, the governor asked him, saying, 2«
                    1; ∙ ¢enXivr “Thou art the king of the Jews.” That this sentence was pronounced
                    with a view to obtain some answer, is evident from the context; yet it is as
                    plainly an <hi rend="italic">affirmation,</hi> though uttered probably in a
                    scoffing tone, as the serious confession of Nathaniel, ï« L ό (Una∣w <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">to«</hi> lσξ&lt;sλ, “Thou art the king of Israel” Had not the
                    question been put in this form, which <hi rend="italic">asserts</hi> Christ to
                    be the king of the Jews, the reply could not have been I« λrχm, “Thou readest
                    for without an assertion the governor would have said nothing. .(See Dr
                    Campbell’s <hi rend="italic">Translation of the Gospels,</hi> where the form
                    used in the original is with great propriety retained in the
                    version.)</p></note> This being observed as language improved, men would
                    accompany such a sentence with a peculiar tone of voice, or other marks, to
                    signify more unequivocally that they wanted information, or that such
                    information was the only object of their speech. Further progress in refinement
                    would lead them to alter the position of the words of a sentence when they meant
                    to ask a question, as we do in English, saying, when we <hi rend="italic"
                    >assert,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">You have</hi> read
                    Euripides,” and when we <hi rend="italic">interrogate,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">Have you</hi> read Euripides ?”</p>
                <p>In Greek and Latin, questions are asked commonly enough by the particles <hi
                    rend="italic">ìı</hi> and <hi rend="italic">an.</hi> These particles we know to
                    be exactly equivalent to the English particle <hi rend="italic">if,</hi> at
                    least to the sense in which that particle is commonly taken. <hi rend="italic"
                    >An</hi><hi rend="italic">fecisti,</hi> is “<hi rend="italic">If</hi> you did it
                    and the sentence may either be an abbreviation for <hi rend="italic">die
                    an</hi><hi rend="italic">fecisti,</hi> “tell me if you did it or <hi
                    rend="italic">an</hi> may perhaps be, as <hi rend="italic">if</hi> certainly is,
                    the imperative mode of some obsolete verb equivalent to <hi rend="italic"
                    >give</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in that case, <hi rend="italic"
                    >an</hi><hi rend="italic">fecisti</hi> will be a complete interrogative
                    sentence, signifying, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">you</hi> did it,
                    <hi rend="italic">give that'.'</hi> But of the interrogative mode of Mr Harris
                    we have said enough; perhaps our readers will think too much, since it is a
                    useless distinction not found in any language. It will, however, be proper to
                    say something of his precative mode, as far as it is the same with the optative
                    mode of the Greek grammarians.</p>
                <p>And nothing, we think, can be clearer, than that the Greek optative constitutes
                    no distinct mode of the verb, whatever meaning be annexed to the word mode. The
                    different tenses of the optative are evidently nothing but the past tenses of
                    the corresponding tenses of the subjunctive. Thus, pres, suby. rurra, I <hi
                    rend="italic">may</hi> strike; pres, optat. ruwrw∕4∕, I <hi rend="italic"
                    >might</hi> strike, &amp;c. This is proved to be indubitably the case by the
                    uniform practice of the Greek writers. Examples might be found without number
                    were one to read in search of them. The following sentence will illustrate our
                    meaning: ’ Ejχ&lt;nreu ’Aŵjra/w <hi rend="italic">ha β&lt;∏6ωβι ro</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">i Aζγtio</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">i,</hi> “The Athenians <hi rend="italic">come</hi> that they <hi
                    rend="italic">may assist</hi> the Argives.” Here the leading verb <hi
                    rend="italic">iξχmra</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi> being of the present tense,
                    the dependent verb <hi rend="italic">βoηDωa</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi> is the
                    present subjunctive. But change the former to the <hi rend="italic">past
                    time,</hi> and the latter must also be changed. ’ Hjxorro ’Aŵp¢uw <hi
                    rend="italic">ha βtnio</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">w mt
                    'Atytnuf,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> The Athenians <hi rend="italic">came</hi>
                    that they <hi rend="italic">might assist</hi> the Argives.” Here it is plain
                    that <hi rend="italic">βonihitv,</hi> the present of the optative, is the past
                    time of <hi rend="italic">βor</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >6ωβι,</hi> the present of the subjunctive; and the same holds in other
                    instances.</p>
                <p>It is almost unnecessary to add, that when this mode is employed to denote a
                    wish, the wish is not expressed by the verb, but is understood. Such abbreviated
                    expressions to denote a wish are common in all languages. Thus, in Greek, ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">Tμw μt∙ tιm ìonr, iλuμr&gt;a itμaτ' lχtsnt</hi> ’ E**l(mw <hi
                    rend="italic">Tlfuųuu rshn,</hi><hi rend="italic">«.</hi> τ. λ.</p>
                <p>signifies, “The gods might give you (or, as we say in English, <hi rend="italic"
                    >changing</hi> the position of the verb, <hi rend="italic">might the gods give
                    you)</hi> to destroy,” &amp;C. So in Latin, <hi rend="italic">Ut to omnes
                    dii</hi><hi rend="italic">deceque</hi><hi rend="italic">perdant,</hi> “That all
                    the gods and goddesses may destroy you.” Again, in English, “O that my head were
                    waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears.” In all these, and such like sentences,
                    words equivalent to <hi rend="italic">I wish, I pray,</hi> are understood. In
                    Greek a wish is sometimes introduced by the particle <hi rend="italic">ìı or
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">rt, if;</hi> as in Homer,</p>
                <p>Έ/Ζ 0p∣λιt <hi rend="italic">r’hµm τ</hi> iuι&gt;αι, <hi rend="italic"
                    >iγa</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">u</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">rìrAtriiu.</hi></p>
                <p>“ /fit had been your fate not to be born, or to die unmarried.” The supplement
                    is, “It would have been fortunate for your country,” or some such thing. In like
                    manner, a poor person not uncommonly entreats a favour by saying, “Sir, <hi
                    rend="italic">if</hi> you would be so good.” Here he stops; but the completion
                    of his sentence is, “it would make me happy.” In all these cases a wish is not
                    formally expressed by the speaker, but inferred by the hearer. They are
                    therefore instances of that tendency which mankind universally discover to
                    abbreviate their language, especially in cases where the passions or feelings
                    are interested.</p>
                <p>The interrogative and optative modes being set aside as superfluous, it would
                    appear from our investigation, that the real distinct modes of the verb, which
                    are found in the most copious and varied language, are only three; the <hi
                    rend="italic">indicative,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">subjunctive,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">imperative:</hi> And these are all that can be considered as
                    <hi rend="italic">necessary</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the first to indicate
                    the speaker’s feeling or acting, the Second to indicate his capacity of feeling
                    or acting, and the third to indicate his desire that the person to whom he
                    speaks should feel or act.</p>
                <p>Here again we have the misfortune to differ in opinion from Dr Gregory, who seems
                    to think that a greater number of modes, if not absolutely necessary, would, at
                    any rate, be highly useful. His words are, “All languages, I believe, are
                    defective in respect of that variety and accuracy of combination and of
                    distinction, which we know with infallible certainty take place in thought. Nor
                    do I know of any particular in which language is more deficient than in the
                    expressing of those energies or modifications of thought; some of which always
                    are, and all of which might be, expressed by the grammatical moods of verbs. Of
                    this there cannot be a clearer proof than the well-known fact, that we are
                    obliged to express by the same mood very different modifications or energies of
                    thought. As, for instance, in the case of the grammatical mood <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522599" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2599-0664"/>called the imperative, by
                    which we express occasionally prayer to God, command to a slave, request to a
                    superior, advice to an equal or to any one, order as from an officer to his
                    subaltern, supplication to one whom we cannot resist” If these be, as the author
                    calls them, specific differences of thought, he will not surely object to their
                    being all ranked under one genus, which may be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >desire.</hi> That the internal feelings which prompt us to pray to God, to
                    command a slave, to request a superior, to advise an equal, to give an order to
                    an inferior, and to supplicate one whom we cannot resist, are all different in
                    degree, cannot be denied. Each of them, however, is desire; and the predication
                    by which the desire is made known to the person whom we address, is the same in
                    all, when we utter a prayer as when we utter a command, when we request as when
                    we supplicate. But predication alone is that which constitutes the verb; for
                    desire by itself, however modified, can be expressed only by an abstract noun;
                    and the mere energy of desire, when not applied to a particular agent, can be
                    expressed only by a <hi rend="italic">participle,</hi> or by what is commonly,
                    though improperly, called the infinitive mode. Now it is certainly conceivable
                    that a few shades of meaning, or a few degrees of one general energy, might be
                    marked by corresponding variations of such verbs as combine energy with
                    predication;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Gregory
                    seems to think, that not merely a few, but a vast number, of these energies
                    might be so marked. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Affirming, deny,

                    &amp;c.” says he, “all admit very readily of being combined with the general
                    import of a verb.” And he adds, that “if every one of them had been expressed in
                    all languages by variations as striking as those of rw™, <hi rend="italic"
                    >τmmipι,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nm,</hi> they must have been acknowledged as
                    distinct moods of the verb.”</p><p>If all these words denote different energies
                    of thought, which, however, may be doubted, and if all those different energies,
                    with many others for which, as the author justly observes, it is not easy to
                    find names, could, like capacity and desire, be combined with the general,
                    action or energy of one verb; and if those combinations could be marked by
                    corresponding variations of that verb; we should indeed acknowledge such
                    variations to be distinct modes, or modes of modes, of the verb. But we doubt
                    much if all this be possible, we are certain that it would be no improvement;
                    for it seems to be evident, either that, in some &lt;ιf the modes, the radical
                    letters of the original verb must be changed, and then it would cease to be the
                    same verb; or that many of the modes must be expressed by words of very
                    unmanageable length; not to mention, that the additional complication introduced
                    by so many minute distinctions into a part of speech already exceedingly
                    complex, would render the import of the verb absolutely unintelligible to nine
                    tenths even of those who are justly styled the learned.</p></note> and there
                    could be no great impropriety in calling those variations modes, or rather modes
                    of modes; but that such a multiplication of modes would be an improvement in
                    language, is by no means evident. The verb, with the modes and tenses which it
                    has in all languages, is already a very complex part of speech, which few are
                    able, and still fewer inclined, to analyse; and it would surely be of no
                    advantage to make it more complex by the introduction of new modes, especially
                    when those degrees of energy which could be marked by them are with equal and
                    perhaps greater precision marked, in the living speech, by the different tones
                    of voice adapted to them by nature; and, in written language, by the reader’s
                    general knowledge of the subject, and of the persons who may be occasionally
                    introduced. If there be any particular delicacy of sentiment or energy which
                    cannot thus be made known, it is better to express it by a name appropriated to
                    itself, together with the simple and original verb of affirmation, than to clog
                    the compound verb with such a multiplicity of variations as would render the
                    acquisition of every language as difficult as is said to be that of the Chinese
                    written characters. The indicative, subjunctive, and imperative, are therefore
                    all the modes of the verb which to us appear to be in any degree necessary or
                    expedient; and they are in fact all the modes that are really found in any
                    language with which we are acquainted.</p>
                <p>For the <hi rend="italic">infinitive,</hi> as has already been observed, seems on
                    every account to be improperly styled a mode. To that name it has no title which
                    we can perceive, except that its termination sometimes (for even this is not
                    universally true) differs in the learned languages from the terminations of the
                    other parts of the verb. Nay, if affirmation be, as it has been proved to be,
                    the very essence of verb, it will follow that the infinitive is no part of the
                    verb at all; for it expresses no affirmation. It forms no complete sentence by
                    itself, nor even when joined to a noun, unless it be aided by some real part of
                    a verb either expressed or understood. <hi rend="italic">Scribo, scribebam,
                    scripsi, scripseram, scribam, scripsero,</hi> “I am writing, I was writing, I
                    have written, I had written, I shall write, I shall have written,” contain each
                    of them an <hi rend="italic">affirmation,</hi> and constitute a complete

                    to any one person than to another. In a word, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >infinitive</hi> is nothing more than an <hi rend="italic">abstract
                    noun,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In our idea
                    of the infinitive, we have the good fortune to agree with the learned Ruddiman,
                    whose words are, “Non inepte hic modus a veteribus quibusdam <hi rend="italic"
                    >verbi</hi><hi rend="italic">nomen</hi> est appellatum. Est enim, si non vere ac

                    infinitive used by the best Roman writers as a substantive noun in every
                    case.</p><p>This opinion ofRuddiman and the ancient grammarians has been
                    controverted with much ingenuity by Dr Gregory, who seems to think that in the
                    infinitive alone we should look for the essence of the verb divested of every
                    accidental circumstance, time only excepted. If this be indeed the case, almost
                    every thing which we have said of the verb, its tenses, and its modes, is
                    erroneous; and he who takes his principles of grammar from the Encyclopaedia
                    Britannica will fill his head with a farrago of absurdities. But it may without
                    much difficulty be shown, that the error does not attach to the doctrine
                    respecting the infinitive, which has been stated and illustrated in this
                    article, but to the strange inversion of all recognised principle involved in
                    the notion which Dr Gregory has espoused, apparently by reason of its novelty
                    alone.</p><p>The Doctor acknowledges <hi rend="italic">(Transactions of the
                    Royal Society of Edinburgh,</hi> vol. ii. liter, class, p. 195), that the
                    infinitive is most improperly called a’mode, and on that account he thinks we
                    ought to turn our thoughts exclusively to it, “when we endeavour to investigate
                    the general import of the verb, with a view to ascertain the accident which it
                    denotes, and be led, step by step, to form a distinct notion of what is common
                    in the accidents of all verbs, and what is peculiar in the accidents of the
                    several classes of them, and thereby be enabled to give good definitions,
                    specifying the <hi rend="italic">essence</hi> of the verb,” &amp;c. It may be
                    true, that to the infinitive exclusively we should turn our attention when we
                    wish to ascertain the accident denoted by a particular verb or class of verbs;
                    that is, the kind of action, passion, or state of being, of which, superadded to
                    affirmation, that verb or class of verbs is expressive; but in accidents of this
                    kind it may be doubted if there be any thing that with propriety can be said to
                    be common to all verbs. There seems indeed to be nothing common to all verbs but
                    that which is essential to them, and by which they are distinguished from every
                    other part of speech; but every kind of action, passion, and state of being, may
                    be completely expressed by participles and abstract nouns, and therefore <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0710-2612-0665" xml:id="pbn7665"/> in such accidents we cannot
                    find the essence of the verb, because surh accidents distinguish it not from
                    other parts of speech, were a man called upon to specify the essence of verse or
                    metre, he would not say that it consists in the meaning of the words, or in the
                    using of these words according to the rules of syntax. In every kind of verse
                    where words are used, they have indeed a meaning, and in all good verses they
                    are grammatically constructed; but this is likewise the case in prose, and
                    therefore it cannot he the essence of verse. The essence of verse must consist
                    in something which is not to be found in prose, namely, a certain harmonic
                    succession of sounds and number of syllables; and the essence of the verb must
                    likewise consist in something which is not to be found in any other part of
                    speech, and that is nothing but affirmation. But if affirmation be the very
                    essence of the verb, it would surely be improper, when we endeavour to ascertain
                    the general import of that part of speech, to turn our thoughts exclusively to a
                    word which implies no affirmation; for what does not affirm, cannot in
                    strictness of truth be either a verb or the mode of a verb.</p><p>In the same
                    page it is said that “the infinitive denotes that kind of thought or combination
                    of thoughts which is common to all the other modes.” In what sense this is true
                    we are unable to conceive; it denotes indeed the same accident, but certainly
                    not the same thought or combination of thoughts. Iu the examples quoted. <hi

                    >uã</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">vaxere</hi><hi rend="italic">vita,</hi> the
                    infinitives have evidently the effect of abstract nouns, and not of verbs; for
                    though <hi rend="italic">vivcre</hi> and <hi rend="italic">valere</hi> express
                    the same states of being with <hi rend="italic">vivo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >valeo,</hi> they by no means express the same combination of thoughts, <hi
                    rend="italic">Vivo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">valco</hi> affirm that <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">am</hi><hi rend="italic">riving,</hi>
                    and that <hi rend="smallcaps">am</hi><hi rend="italic">well;</hi> and he who
                    utters these words must think not of life and health in the abstract, but of
                    life and health as belonging to himself. <hi rend="italic">Virere</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">vakre,</hi> on the other hand, affirm nothing; and he who utters
                    them thinks only of the states of living and of being in health, without
                    applying them to any particular person.</p><p>The learned author of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Origin and Progress of Language</hi> having said that the
                    infinilive is used either as a noun, or that it serves to connect the verb with
                    another verb or noun, and so is useful in syntax, the doctor combats this
                    opinion, and infers that the infinitive is truly a <hi rend="italic">verb,</hi>
                    because “the thought expressed by means of it may be expressed in synonymous and
                    convertible phrases, in difierent languages, by means of other parts or moods of
                    the verb.” Of these synonymous and convertible phrases he gives several
                    examples, the first of which ∙is taken from Hamlet’s soliloquy. <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">To he</hi> or <hi rend="italic">not to
                    be,</hi> that is the question,” he thinks equivalent in meaning to, “The
                    question is, <hi rend="italic">whether we shall be or shall not be."</hi> But we
                    are persuaded he is mistaken. “whether we shall be or shall not be,” involves a
                    question, whether we shall exist at some future and indefinite time; but the
                    subject of Hamlet’s debate with himself was not, whether, if his conscious
                    existence should be interrupted, it would be afterwards at some future and
                    indefinite time restored, but whether it was to continue uninterrupted by his
                    exit from this world. This, we think,, must be self-evident to every reader of
                    the soliloquy. It is likewise obvious that the word “question” in this sentence
                    does not signify interrogatory, but <hi rend="italic">subject of debate,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">matter to be examined</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and that
                    the word “that” serves no other purpose than to complete the verse, and give
                    additional emphasis, perhaps, to an inquiry so important. “<hi rend="italic">To
                    be</hi> or <hi rend="italic">not to be,</hi> that is the question,” is therefore
                    equivalent in aU respects to “The continuance or non-continuance of my existence
                    is the matter to be examined and the infinitive is here indisputably used as an
                    abstract noun in the nominative case. Should it be said that, the doctor may
                    have taken the sentence by itself; unconnected with the subject of Hamlet’s
                    soliloquy, we reply, that the supposition is impossible; for, independently of
                    the circumstances with which they are connected, the words “<hi rend="italic">To
                    be</hi> or <hi rend="italic">not to be"</hi> have no perfect meaning, were it
                    not for the subject of the soliloquy, from which every reader supplies what is
                    wanting to complete the sense, it might be asked, “<hi rend="italic">To be</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">not to be"</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    reasonable, and which in that case could not be answered.</p><p>with the same
                    view, to prove that the infinitive is truly a <hi rend="italic">verb,</hi> the
                    doctor proceeds to remark upon the following phrases, <hi rend="italic">Dico
                    credo, puto, TUium</hi><hi rend="italic">existera,</hi><hi rend="italic">valere,

                    as thus used, acquire not any further meaning, in addition to the radical import
                    of the verb with tense, like the proper moods; but the subjunctives after <hi
                    rend="italic">quod</hi> lose their peculiar meaning as moods, and signify no
                    more than bare infinitives.” In the sense in which this observation is made by
                    the author, the very reverse of it seems to be the truth. The infinitives, as
                    thus used, acquire, at least in the mind of the reader, something like the power
                    of affirmation, which they certainly have not when standing by themselves;
                    whereas the subjunctives neither lose nor acquire any meaning by being placed
                    after <hi rend="italic">quod. Dico credo,</hi><hi rend="italic">puto,

                    though now not elegant, was common with the best writers in the days of
                    Shakspeare, and is frequently to be found in the writings of Warburton at a much
                    later period. <hi rend="italic">Dico credo, puto, quod</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Titius</hi><hi rend="italic">existât,</hi><hi rend="italic">quod</hi><hi

                    exist, may lie along, &amp;c.</hi> Remove the verbs in the indicative mode from
                    the former set of phrases, and it will be found that the infinitives had
                    acquired a meaning, when conjoined with them, which they have not when left by
                    themselves; for <hi rend="italic">Titium</hi><hi rend="italic">existerβ,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">jacere,</hi> “Titius to exist, to lie along,” have no complete
                    meaning, because they affirm nothing. On the other hand, when the indicative
                    verbs are removed, to- <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> gether with the
                    wonder-working <hi rend="italic">quod,</hi> from the latter set of phrases, the
                    meaning of the subjunctives remains in all respects as it was before the
                    removal; for <hi rend="italic">Titius</hi><hi rend="italic">existât,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">jaceat,</hi> Ac. signify, <hi rend="italic">Titius</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">may exist, may lie along,</hi> as well when they stand by
                    themselves as when they form the final clauses of a compound sentence. Every one
                    knows that <hi rend="italic">quod,</hi> though often called a conjunction, is
                    always in fact the relative pronoun. <hi rend="italic">Dico credo, puto,
                    quod</hi><hi rend="italic">Titius</hi><hi rend="italic">existât,</hi> must
                    therefore be construct! thus: <hi rend="italic">Titius</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >existât (est</hi><hi rend="italic">id) quod dico credo,</hi> &amp;c. “Titius
                    may exist—is that thing, that proposition, which I say, believe, think.” In the
                    former set of phrases, the infinitives are used as abstract nouns in the
                    accusative case, denoting, in conjunction with <hi rend="italic">Titium,</hi>
                    one complex conception, the <hi rend="italic">existence,</hi> &lt;⅛c. of <hi

                    idea, that the infinitive is truly a <hi rend="italic">verb,</hi> Dr Gregory
                    quotes frbm Horace a passage, which, had we thought quotations necessary, we
                    should have urged in support of our own opinion:</p><p>Nec quicquam tibi prodest
                    Aërias <hi rend="italic">tentasse</hi> domos, animoque rotundum <hi
                    rend="italic">Percurrisse</hi> polum, morituro.</p><p>To our apprehension,
                    nothing can be clearer than that <hi rend="italic">tentasse</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">percurrisse</hi> are here used as nouns; for if they be not, where
                    shall we find a nominative to the verb <hi rend="italic">prodest?</hi> It was
                    certainly what was signified by <hi rend="smallcaps">tentasse</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aërias domus,</hi><hi rend="italic">animoque rotundum</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">percurrisse</hi><hi rend="italic">polum,</hi> that is said to
                    have been no advantage to Archytas at his death. This, indeed, if there could be
                    any doubt about it, would be made evident by the two prose versions which-the
                    professor subjoins to these beautiful lines. The first of them is as follows:
                    <hi rend="italic">Nec quicquam</hi><hi rend="italic">tibi prodest</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quod aërias</hi><hi rend="italic">domos</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >tentaveris,</hi><hi rend="italic">et animo</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >percurreris</hi><hi rend="italic">polum;</hi> which must be thus constructed:
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Tentaveris</hi><hi rend="italic">aërias</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">domos, et</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">percurreris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">animo polum (est id) quod nec quicquam tibi prodest.</hi> This
                    version, however, is not perfectly accurate; for it contains two propositions,
                    whereas Horace’s lines contain but one. The second, which, though it may be a
                    crabbed and inelegant sentence, expresses the poet’s sense with more precision,
                    is in these words: <hi rend="italic">Nec</hi><hi rend="italic">quicquam
                    Obi</hi><hi rend="italic">prodest morituro</hi><hi rend="italic">tua</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">tentatio</hi><hi rend="italic">domuum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aëriarum, et</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">cursus</hi><hi rend="italic">tuus circa
                    polum.</hi> Having observed, with truth, that this sentence has the very same
                    meaning with the lines of Horace, Dr Gregory asks, “why are not <hi
                    rend="italic">tentatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cursus</hi> reckoned verbs as
                    well as <hi rend="italic">tentasse</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >percurrisse</hi><hi rend="italic">?”</hi> Let those answer this question who
                    believe that any of these words are truly verbs; for they are surely, as he
                    adds, all very near akin; indeed so near, that the mind, when contemplating the
                    import of each, cannot perceive the difference. Meanwhile, we beg leave in <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0710-2625-0666" xml:id="pbn7666"/> our turn to ask, why are not
                    <hi rend="italic">tentasse</hi> and <hi rend="italic">percurrisse</hi> reckoned
                    abstract nouns as well as <hi rend="italic">tentatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >cursus</hi><hi rend="italic">ĩ</hi> To this question it is not easy to conceive
                    what answer can be returned upon the doctor’s principles. In his theory there is
                    nothing satisfactory; and what has not been done by himself, we need scarcely
                    expect from any of his followers. On the other hand, our principles furnish a
                    very obvious reason for excluding <hi rend="italic">tentatio</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">cursus</hi> from the class of verbs; it is, because these words
                    express no predication. <hi rend="italic">Tentasse</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >percurrisse</hi> indeed denote predication no more than <hi rend="italic"
                    >tentatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cursus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    therefore upon the same principle we exclude them likewise from a class to
                    which, if words are to be arranged according to their import, they certainly do
                    not belong.</p></note> denoting the simple <pb corresp="pbn7665"

                    of the verb, in conjonction with time; and <hi rend="smallcaps">m</hi> not a
                    mode as far as we can conceive of any thing. Thus, <hi rend="italic">Scire tuum
                    nihil ext,</hi> is the same with <hi rend="italic">Scientia</hi><hi

                    and “<hi rend="italic">Death</hi> is certain,” is identical with “<hi
                    rend="italic">To die</hi> is certain."</p>
                <p>Before we dismiss the subject of modes, it may not be improper to take nθt⅛e of
                    the connection which Mr Harris, after Apollonius, has found between commanding
                    and futurity. “Intreating and commanding,” he says, “have a necessary respect to
                    the future only. For what have they to do with the present and the past, the
                    natures of which are immutable and necessary ?" This is surely confounding<pb
                    corresp="pbn7666" facs="nls:193522625" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2625-0666"/> commands
                    with the execution of commands. But the learned writer proceeds to informs us,
                    that “it is from the connection of futurity with commands that the future of the
                    indicative is sometimes used for the imperative mode.” The connection of which
                    he speaks appears to us entirely imaginary; for futurity has nothing to do with
                    commands, though it may with the execution of them. The present time is the time
                    of commanding, the future of obeying. But supposing the connection real, it
                    would not account for the future tenses being used imperatively. For although it
                    were true, as it is evidently false, that commands are future, it would not
                    follow that the relation is convertible, or that employing the future should
                    imply a command. The principle upon which such expressions as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thou shalt not kill,</hi> come to have the force of a command, seems to be
                    this: When a person, especially one possessed of authority, asserts that an
                    action depending on the will of a free agent, and therefore in its own nature
                    contingent, shall or shall not actually take place; what are we to conclude from
                    such an assertion? Why, surely it is natural to conclude that it is his will,
                    his command, that his assertion be verified. The English word <hi rend="italic"
                    >shall,</hi> if we be well informed, denoted originally obligation; a sense in
                    which its past tense <hi rend="italic">should</hi> is still commonly employed.
                    In English, therefore, the foregoing process of inferring a command from an
                    assertion of futurity seems to have been reversed; and the word <hi
                    rend="italic">shall,</hi> from denoting a command or obligation, has come to
                    denote futurity simply.</p>
                <p>Having considered the verb in its essence, its tenses, and its modes, we might
                    seem to have exhausted the subject; but there is still something more to be
                    done. Grammarians have distinguished verbs into several species; and it remains
                    with us to inquire upon what principle in nature this distinction is made, and
                    how far it proceeds. Now it must be obvious, that if predication be the essence
                    of verbs, all verbs as such must be of the same species; for predication is the
                    same in every proposition, under every possible circumstance, and by whomsoever
                    it is made. But the greater part of verbs contain the predicate as well as the
                    predication of a proposition; or, to speak in common language, they denote an
                    attribute as well as an affirmation. Thus, <hi rend="italic">lego</hi> is “I am
                    <hi rend="italic">reading”</hi><hi rend="italic">ambulo,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi> I am <hi rend="italic">walking,”</hi><hi rend="italic">sto,</hi> “I am
                    <hi rend="italic">standing”</hi><hi rend="italic">verbero,</hi> “I am <hi
                    rend="italic">striking,”</hi><hi rend="italic">verberor,</hi> “I am <hi
                    rend="italic">stricken.”</hi> But the attributes expressed by these verbs are
                    evidently of different kinds; some consisting in action, some in suffering, and
                    some in a state of being which is neither active nor passive. Hence the
                    distinction of verbs, according to the attributes which they denote, into <hi
                    rend="italic">active, passive,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">neuter. Lego,</hi>
                    which is an assertion that I am employed in the act of reading, is an active
                    verb; <hi rend="italic">verberor,</hi> which is an assertion that I am suffering
                    under the rod, is a passive verb, because it denotes a passion; and <hi
                    rend="italic">sto,</hi> which is an assertion that I am standing still, is said
                    to be a neuter verb, because it denotes neither action nor passion. But it is
                    self-evident that there cannot be action without an agent, nor passion without a
                    passive being; neither can we make a predication of any kind, though it denote
                    neither action nor passion, without predicating of something. All verbs,
                    therefore, whether active, passive, or neuter, have a necessary reference to
                    some noun expressive of the substance of which the attribute denoted by the verb
                    is predicated. This noun, which in all languages must be in the nominative case,
                    is said to be the nominative of the verb; and in those languages in which the
                    verb has person and number, it must in these respects agree with its
                    nominative.</p>
                <p>Of action, and consequently of verbs denoting action, there are obviously two
                    kinds. There is an action which passes from the agent to some subject upon which
                    he is employed, and there is an action which respects no object beyond the agent
                    himself. Thus <hi rend="italic">lego</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ambulo</hi> are
                    verbs which equally denote action; but the action of <hi rend="italic">lego</hi>
                    refers to some external object as well as to the agent; for when a man is
                    reading, he must be reading something, a book, a newspaper, or a letter, whereas
                    the action of <hi rend="italic">ambulo</hi> is confined wholly to the agent; for
                    when a man is walking he is employed upon nothing beyond himself, his action
                    produces no effect upon any thing external. These two species of verbs have been
                    denominated transitive and intransitive; a designation extremely proper, as the
                    distinction which gave rise to it is philosophically just. Verbs of both species
                    are active; but the action of those only which are called transitive respects an
                    external object; and therefore in those languages of which the nouns have cases,
                    it is only after verbs which are transitive as well as active, that the noun
                    denoting the subject of the action is put in the accusative or objective case.
                    Verbs which are intransitive, though they be really active, are in the structure
                    of sentences considered as neuter, and govern no case.</p>
                <p>So much, then, for that most important of all words, the verb. We proceed now to
                    the consideration of participles, adjectives, and adverbs, which, as they have a
                    near relation to one another, we shall treat of under one head or division.</p>
                <p>V.— <hi rend="italic">Of Participles, Adjectives, and Adverbs.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Of Participles.</hi></p>
                <p>The nature of verbs being understood, that <hi rend="italic">of participles</hi>
                    is not of difficult comprehension. Every verb, except that which is called the
                    substantive verb, is expressive of an attribute, of time, and of an assertion.
                    Now if we take away the assertion, and thus destroy the verb, there will remain
                    the attribute and the time; and these combined make the essence of that species
                    of words called <hi rend="italic">participles.</hi> Thus, take away the
                    assertion from the verb <hi rend="italic">γ1afu, wrilelh,</hi> and there remains
                    the participle <hi rend="italic">γζaφωr, writing,</hi> which, without the
                    assertion, denotes the same attribute and the same time. In the same manner, by
                    withdrawing the assertion, we discover yja∙ψαs, <hi rend="italic">written,</hi>
                    in syga∙ψs, <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> yja∙ψan, <hi
                    rend="italic">about to write,</hi> in yfa∙ψw, <hi rend="italic">shall be
                    writing.</hi> This is the doctrine of Mr Harris respecting participles; and, in
                    our opinion, it is equally elegant, perspicuous, and just. But as it has been
                    controverted by an author of some note in the republic of letters, we should
                    perhaps be wanting in duty to our readers were we to pass his objections wholly
                    unnoticed.</p>
                <p>It is acknowledged by Dr Beattie, the writer to whom we allude, that the view
                    which we have taken is the most convenient in which the participle can be
                    considered in universal grammar; but he affirms that present participles do not
                    always express present time, nor preterite participles past time; nay, that
                    participles have often no connection with time at all. He thus exemplifies his
                    assertion in Greek, in Latin, and in English:</p>
                <p>“When Cebes says, <hi rend="italic">Erυγχa,n</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">w τsξ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">rarmwrις h
                    rγ</hi> rou Xjovou <hi rend="italic">itļ'įi,</hi> ‘ We <hi rend="italic">were
                    walking</hi> in the temple of Saturn,’ the participle of the present <hi
                    rend="italic">walking</hi> is, by means of the verb <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522638" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2638-0667"/><hi rend="italic">were,</hi>
                    applied to time past, and therefore of itself cannot be understood to signify
                    any sort of time.” Again, after observing, that in English we have but two
                    simple participles, such as <hi rend="italic">writing</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >written,</hi> of which the former is generally considered as the present and
                    the latter as the past, the doctor ad⅛, but “the participle <hi rend="italic"
                    >writing,</hi> joined to a verb of different tenses, may denote either past or
                    future action; for we may say not only, <hi rend="italic">1</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">am</hi><hi rend="italic">writing,</hi> but also, <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">was</hi><hi rend="italic">writing</hi>
                    yesterday, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Zshall be</hi><hi rend="italic">writing</hi>
                    to-morrow and hence he infers that <hi rend="italic">no time whatever</hi> is
                    denoted by the present participle. But this is obviously a hasty inference,
                    drawn from the doctrine of absolute time and a definite present, which we have
                    already shown to be groundless and contradictory. When we speak simply of an
                    action as present, we must mean that it is present with respect to something
                    besides itself, or we speak a jargon which is unintelligible; but we do not
                    ascertain the time of its presence. From the very nature of time, an action may
                    be present now, it may have been present formerly, or it may be present at some
                    future period; but the precise time of its presence cannot be ascertained even
                    by the present of the indicative of the verb itself; yet who ever supposed that
                    the present of the indicative denotes no time ř The participle of the present
                    represents the action of the verb as going on; but an action cannot be going on
                    without being present in time with something. When, therefore, Cebes says, “We
                    were walking in the temple of Saturn,” he represents the action of the verb
                    walking as present with something; but by using the verb expressive of his
                    assertion in a past tense, he gives us to understand that the action was not
                    present with any thing at the period of his speaking, but at some portion of
                    time prior to that period; and what that portion of time was, must be collected
                    from the subsequent parts of his discourse. The same thing may also be said of
                    the phrases <hi rend="italic">I was writing yesterday,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">I shall be writing to-morrow.</hi> They indicate that the action
                    of the verb <hi rend="italic">write</hi> was present with me yesterday, and will
                    again be present with me to-morrow. The action and the time of action are
                    denoted by the participle; that action is affirmed to belong to me by means of
                    the verb; and the time at which it belonged to me is pointed out by the tenses
                    of that verb, <hi rend="italic">am, was,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">shall
                    be.</hi> All this is so plain, that it could not have escaped Dr Beattie’s
                    penetration, if he had not hastily adopted the absurd and contradictory notion
                    of a definite present.</p>
                <p>Of the truth of his assertion respecting past participles he gives a Greek and a
                    Latin example. The former is taken from St Mark, viz. ó uffriuaας <hi
                    rend="italic">βω6∙ηβιra</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi>; and the latter is that
                    which is commonly called the perfect future of the passive verb <hi
                    rend="italic">amor,</hi><hi rend="italic">amatus fuero.</hi> In the first
                    instance, he says that the participle, though belonging to the aorist of the
                    past time, must be rendered either by the indefinite present, “he who <hi
                    rend="italic">believeth ∙</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> or by the
                    <hi rend="italic">future,</hi> “he who <hi rend="italic">will</hi> believe and
                    the reason which he gives for this rendering of the word is, that “the believing
                    here spoken of is considered as posterior in time to the enunciation of the
                    promise.” This is indeed true, but it is not to the .purpose; for with the
                    enunciation of the promise the time of the participle has no manner of concern.
                    The time of <hi rend="italic">-rιβnυβat</hi> depends entirely upon the time of
                    <hi rend="italic">βu⅛βιraι,</hi> with respect to which it must undeniably be
                    past. Our Lord is not here asserting, that he who shall believe at the day of
                    final retribution shall be saved, but that he who shall on that day be found to
                    <hi rend="italic">have believed</hi> in time past shall be saved; and if the
                    participle had not been expressive of a finished action and a past time, the
                    whole sentence would have conveyed a meaning not friendly to the interests of
                    the gospel. In like manner, the time of <hi rend="italic">amatus</hi> is
                    referred, not to the time of speaking, but to the time of <hi rend="italic"
                    >fuero,</hi> with respect to which, who sees not that it is past? The two words,
                    taken together, contain a declaration, that he who utters them shall, at some
                    time posterior to that of speaking, <hi rend="italic">have</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">been</hi><hi rend="italic">loved;</hi> the expression <hi
                    rend="italic">shall have been loved</hi> denotes two times, both future with
                    respect to the time of speaking; but when the time denoted by <hi rend="italic"
                    >shall have</hi> comes to be present, that of the participle <hi rend="italic"
                    >loved</hi> must be <hi rend="italic">past,</hi> for it is declared that the
                    action of it shall <hi rend="italic">then</hi> be complete and finished.</p>
                <p>We conclude, then, that it is essential to a participle to express both an
                    attribute and time; and that such words as denote no time, though they may be in
                    the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of participles, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >doctus,</hi> “learned,” <hi rend="italic">eloquens,</hi> “eloquent,” &amp;c.
                    belong to another part of speech, which we now proceed to consider.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Of Adjectives.</hi></p>
                <p>The nature of verbs and participles being understood, that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >adjectives</hi> becomes easy. A verb implies, as we have said, an attribute,
                    time, and an assertion; a participle implies only an attribute and time; and an
                    <hi rend="italic">adjective</hi> implies only an attribute as belonging to some
                    substance. In other words, an <hi rend="italic">adjective</hi> has no assertion,
                    and it denotes only such an attribute as has not its essence either in motion or
                    its privation. Thus, in genera), the attributes of quantity, quality, and
                    relation, such as <hi rend="italic">many, few, great, little, black, white,
                    good, bad, double, treble,</hi> and the like, are all denoted by <hi
                    rend="italic">adjectives.</hi></p>
                <p>To understand the import and the use of this species of words, it must be
                    observed that every adjective is resolvable into a substantive and an expression
                    of connection equivalent to <hi rend="italic">of.</hi> Thus, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >good man</hi> is a <hi rend="italic">man of goodness</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> where we see the attribute denoted by the adjective fully expressed by
                    an abstract noun. But it is evident that the noun <hi rend="italic"
                    >goodness</hi> does not express the <hi rend="italic">whole meaning</hi> of the
                    adjective <hi rend="italic">good</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for every
                    adjective expresses not only an attribute, but also the connection between the
                    attribute and its substance; whereas in the abstract noun, the attribute is
                    considered as a substance unconnected with any other substance.</p>
                <p>In the next place, it is to be observed, that the connection expressed by
                    adjectives, like that expressed by <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> is of a nature so
                    general and indefinite, that the particular kind of connection must, in some
                    languages, be inferred from our previous knowledge of the objects between which
                    it subsists, or it wall for ever remain unknown. This might be proved by a
                    variety of examples, but will perhaps be sufficiently evident from the
                    following: <hi rend="italic">Color</hi><hi rend="italic">salubris</hi> signifies
                    colour that <hi rend="italic">indicates</hi> health; <hi rend="italic"
                    >exercitatio salubris,</hi> exercise that <hi rend="italic">preserves</hi>
                    health; <hi rend="italic">victus salubris,</hi> food that <hi rend="italic"
                    >improves</hi> health; <hi rend="italic">medicina salubris,</hi> medicine that
                    <hi rend="italic">restores</hi> health. In all these examples the connection
                    expressed by the adjective form of <hi rend="italic">salubris</hi> is different;
                    and though it may be known from previous experience, there is nothing in any of
                    the expressions themselves by which it can be ascertained. Thus, adjectives are
                    each significant of an attribute and connection; but the particular kind of
                    connection is ascertained by experience. The usual effect of adjectives in
                    language, is to modify or particularize a general term, by adding some quality
                    or circumstance which may distinguish the object meant by that term, from the
                    other objects of the same species. I have occasion, for example, to speak of a
                    particular man, of whose name I am ignorant. The word <hi rend="italic">man</hi>
                    is too general for my purpose, it being applicable to every individual of the
                    human species. In what way then do I proceed, in order to particularize it, so
                    as to make it denote that very man whom I mean to specify? I annex or conjoin to
                    it such words as are significant of objects and qualities with which he is
                    connected, and which are not equally applicable to others from whom I mean to
                    distinguish him. Thus I can say, <hi rend="italic">a man of prudence</hi> or a
                    <hi rend="italic">prudent man,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">wise man,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">good man,</hi> a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522651"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2651-0668"/><hi rend="italic">. brave man,</hi> and so on. By
                    means of these additions the general term <hi rend="italic">man</hi> is limited
                    or modified, and can be applied only to certain men to whom belong the
                    attributes expressed by the adjectives <hi rend="italic">prudent, wise,
                    good,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">brave.</hi> If it be stiÚ too general for my
                    purpose, I can add to it other qualities and circumstances, till I make it so
                    particular as to be applicable to but one individual man in the universe.</p>
                <p>This is the way in which adjectives are commonly used, but this is not the only
                    way. Instead of being employed to modify a substantive, they sometimes appear as
                    the principal words in the sentence, when the sole use of the substantive seems
                    to be to modify the abstract noun, contained under the adjective to which that
                    substantive is joined. In order to understand this, it will be necessary to
                    attend to the following observations.</p>
                <p>It may be laid down as a general proposition, that when any term or any phrase is
                    employed to denote a complex conception, the mind has a power of considering, in
                    what order it pleases, the simple ideas of which the complex conception is
                    composed. To illustrate this observation by an example: The word <hi
                    rend="italic">eques</hi> in Latin denotes a complex conception, of which the
                    constituent simple ideas are those of a man and a horse; with this connection
                    subsisting between them, that the man is conceived as on the back of the horse.
                    In the use of this word, it is well known that the idea first in order, as being
                    the principal subject of the proposition, is commonly the <hi rend="italic"
                    >man</hi> on the back of the horse; but it is not always so, for the mind may
                    consider the <hi rend="italic">horse</hi> as the principal object. Thus, when
                    Virgil says,</p>
                <p>Eraena Pelethronii Lapithae gyrosque dedere, Impositi dorso; atque <hi
                    rend="italic">equitem</hi> docuere sub armis <hi rend="italic">Intultare
                    solo,</hi> et <hi rend="italic">gressus glomerare</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tuperoos</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the energies attributed to the object
                    signified by <hi rend="italic">equitem</hi> make it evident that the horse, and
                    not the man, is meant; for it is not the property of a man, <hi rend="italic"
                    >insultare</hi><hi rend="italic">solo,</hi><hi rend="italic">et gressus
                    glomerare superbos.</hi></p>
                <p>The same observation holds true where the <hi rend="italic">complex object</hi>
                    is denoted by two or more words; an adjective, for instance, and a substantive.
                    Thus in the phrase <hi rend="italic">summus mons</hi><hi rend="italic">se
                    inter</hi><hi rend="italic">nubila condit,</hi> the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >summus mons</hi> represent a complex conception, of which the constituent ideas
                    are those of <hi rend="italic">height</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mountain,</hi>
                    connected together by the adjective form of <hi rend="italic">summus.</hi>
                    Either of these ideas may be the subject of the proposition; and the expression
                    will accordingly admit of two different significations. If <hi rend="italic"
                    >mans</hi> be made the subject of the proposition, the meaning will be, “the
                    highest mountain hides itself amongst the clouds.” If the substantive included
                    in the radical part of <hi rend="italic">summus</hi> be made the subject of the
                    proposition, the expression will signify, “the summit, or highest part, of the
                    mountain, hides itself amongst the clouds.” The latter is the true import of the
                    sentence.</p>
                <p>From these observations and examples, we shall be enabled to understand the two
                    uses of the adjective. It is either employed, as has been already observed, to
                    restrict or modify a general term; or the abstract substantive contained in the
                    adjective is modified by the noun, with which, in the concrete or adjective
                    form, that abstract substantive is joined. The first may be called the <hi
                    rend="italic">direct,</hi> the second the <hi rend="italic">inverse,</hi>
                    acceptation of adjectives.</p>
                <p>The inverse acceptation of adjectives and participles, for both are used in the
                    same manner, has scarcely been noticed by any grammarian excepting Dr Hunter of
                    St Andrews; yet the principle is of great extent in language. In order to
                    explain it, we shall produce a few examples, which on any other principle it is
                    impossible to understand. Livy, speaking of the abolition of the regal authority

                    >annos ducentos quadraginta</hi><hi rend="italic">quatuor,</hi> “Monarchy
                    subsisted at Rome <hi rend="italic">{not</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">city
                    built,</hi> which would convey no meaning, but) from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >building of the city</hi> to its <hi rend="italic">deliverance.”</hi> Both the
                    participles <hi rend="italic">condita</hi> and <hi rend="italic">liberatam</hi>
                    are here used inversely; that is, the abstract substantives contained in <hi
                    rend="italic">condita</hi> and <hi rend="italic">liberatam</hi> are modified or
                    restricted by the substantives <hi rend="italic">urbe</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >urbem,</hi> with which they unite. Again, Ovid, speaking of the contest between
                    Ajax and Ulysses for the arms of Achilles, has these lines:</p>
                <p>Qui, licet eloquio fidum quoque Nestora vincat, Haud tamen efficiet, <hi
                    rend="italic">detortum</hi> ut <hi rend="italic">Nestora ertmen</hi> Nullum esse
                    rear.</p>
                <p>Here also the adjective or participle <hi rend="italic">desertum</hi> is taken
                    inversely, and the general notion of <hi rend="italic">desertion</hi> contained
                    in it is modified or rendered particular by being joined with the substantive
                    <hi rend="italic">Nestora.</hi> The meaning of the passage is, “I will never be
                    induced to believe that the <hi rend="italic">desertion of Nestor</hi> was not a
                    crime.” Were <hi rend="italic">desertum</hi> to be taken directly as an
                    adjective modifying its substantive, the sentence must be translated, “I cannot
                    believe that <hi rend="italic">Nestor deserted</hi> was not a crime.” But it is
                    evident that this is nonsense; as <hi rend="italic">Nestor,</hi> whether
                    deserted or not deserted, could not be a crime.</p>
                <p>It were easy to produce many more examples of adjectives taken inversely; but
                    these may suffice to illustrate the general principle, and to show, that without
                    attending to it, it is impossible to understand the ancient authors. We shall
                    produce one instance of it from Shakspeare, to evince that it is not confined to
                    the ancient languages, though in these it is certainly more frequent than in the
                    modern:</p>
                <p>Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky, Thou canst not bite so nigh As <hi rend="italic"
                    >beiu∙JHt ft&gt;rgot</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi></p>
                <p>Though thou the waters warp, Thy sting is not so sharp <hi rend="italic">As
                    friends renumber'd not.</hi></p>
                <p>Here it is evident that the adjective <hi rend="italic">forgot</hi> is taken
                    inversely; for it is not a benefit, but the <hi rend="italic">forgetting of</hi>
                    a benefit, which bites more than the bitter sky; and therefore, in this passage,
                    the adjective serves not to modify the noun, but the noun <hi rend="italic"
                    >benefits</hi> is employed to modify the abstract substantive contained in the
                    adjective <hi rend="italic">forgot,</hi> which is the subject of the
                    proposition, and the principal word in the sentence.</p>
                <p>Had Mr Harris attended to this principle, and reflected upon what he could not
                    but know, that all adjectives denote substances; not indeed subsisting by
                    themselves, as those expressed by nouns, but concretely, as the attributes of
                    other substances; he would not have classed adjectives with verbs, or have
                    passed so severe a censure upon the grammarians for classing them with nouns. It
                    matters very little how adjectives are classed, provided their nature and effect
                    be understood; but they have at least as good a title to be ranked with nouns as
                    with verbs, and in our opinion a better. To adopt Mr Harris’s Ianguage, they are
                    homogeneous with respect to nouns, as both denote substances; they are
                    heterogeneous with respect to yerbs, as they never do denote assertion.</p>
                <p>Besides original adjectives, there is another class, which is formed from
                    substantives. Thus, when we say, <hi rend="italic">the party of Pompey, the
                    style cf Cicero, the philosophy of Socrates</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in
                    these cases the <hi rend="italic">party,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">style,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">philosophy</hi> spoken of, receive a stamp and
                    character from the persons whom they respect; and those persons, therefore,
                    perform the part of attributes. Hence they actually pass into attributives, and
                    assume as such the form of adjectives. It is thus we say, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pompeian party,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Ciceronian style,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Socratic philosophy.</hi> In like manner, for a trumpet <hi
                    rend="italic">of brass,</hi> we say a <hi rend="italic">brazen</hi> trumpet, and
                    for a crown <hi rend="italic">of gold,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">golden</hi>
                    crown, &amp;c. Even pronominal substantives admit a similar mutation. Thus,
                    instead of saying the book <hi rend="italic">of me,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >of thee,</hi> we say <hi rend="italic">my</hi> book, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >thy</hi> book; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522664" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2664-0669"
                    />and instead of saying the country <hi rend="italic">of us</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">of you, we</hi><hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> say <hi rend="italic"
                    >our</hi> country and <hi rend="italic">your</hi> country. These words, <hi
                    rend="italic">my, thy, our, your,</hi> &amp;c. have therefore been properly
                    called pronominal adjectives.</p>
                <p>It has been already observed, and must be obvious to all, that substances alone
                    are susceptible of sex; and that therefore substantive nouns alone should have
                    distinctions respecting gender. The same is true with respect to number and
                    person. An <hi rend="italic">attribute</hi> admits of no change in its nature,
                    whether it belong to <hi rend="italic">you</hi> or to <hi rend="italic">me,</hi>
                    to a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">woman,</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">one man</hi> or to <hi rend="italic">many</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and therefore the words expressive of attributes ought on all occasions,
                    and in every situation, to be fixed and invariable. For as the qualities <hi
                    rend="italic">good</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bad, black</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">white,</hi> are the same, whether they be applied to a man or a
                    woman, to many or to few; so the word which expresses any one of these
                    attributes ought in strictness to admit of no alteration, with whatever
                    substantive it may be joined. Such is the order of nature, and that order, on
                    this as on other occasions, the English language most strictly observes; for we
                    say equally, <hi rend="italic">a good man</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a good
                    woman</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">good men</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">good women</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">a good
                    house</hi> or <hi rend="italic">good houses.</hi> In some languages, indeed,
                    such as Greek and Latin, of which the nouns admit of cases, and the sentences of
                    an inverted structure, it has been found necessary to endow adjectives with the
                    threefold distinction of gender, number, and person; but as this is only an
                    accidental variation, occasioned by particular circumstances, and not in the
                    least essential to language, it belongs not to our subject, but to the
                    particular grammars of these tongues.</p>
                <p>There is, however, one variation of the adjective, which has place in all
                    languages, is founded in the nature of things, and properly belongs to universal
                    grammar. It is occasioned by comparing the attribute of one substance with a
                    similar attribute of another, and falls naturally to be explained under the next
                    section.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Of Adverbs, and the Comparison of Adjectives.</hi></p>
                <p>As adjectives denote the attributes of substances, so there is an inferior class
                    of words which denote the modifications of these attributes. Thus, when we say,
                    “Cicero and Pliny were both of them <hi rend="italic">eloquent</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> Statius and Virgil both of them <hi rend="italic"
                    >wrote</hi> the attributes expressed by the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >eloquent</hi> and <hi rend="italic">wrote</hi> are immediately referred to
                    Cicero, Virgil, &amp;c.; and as denoting the attributes of substances, these
                    words, the one an adjective, and the other a verb, have been both called <hi
                    rend="italic">attributives of the first order.</hi> But when we say, “Pliny was
                    <hi rend="italic">moderately</hi> eloquent, but Cicero <hi rend="italic"
                    >exceedingly</hi> eloquent; Statius wrote <hi rend="italic">indifferently,</hi>
                    but Virgil wrote <hi rend="italic">admirably</hi> the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >moderately, exceedingly, indifferently,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >admirably,</hi> are not referrible to substantives, but to other attributes;
                    that is, to the words <hi rend="italic">eloquent</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >wrote,</hi> the signification of which they modify. Such words, therefore,
                    having the same effect upon adjectives that adjectives have upon substantives,
                    have been called <hi rend="italic">attributives of the second order.</hi> By
                    grammarians they have been called <hi rend="italic">adverbs ,∙</hi> and if we
                    take the word <hi rend="italic">verb</hi> in its most comprehensive
                    signification,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristotle
                    and his followers called every word a verb which denotes the predicate of a
                    proposition. This classification was certainly absurd; for it confounds not only
                    adjectives and participles, but even substantives, with <hi rend="italic"
                    >verbs</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the authority of Aristotle was great;
                    and hence the name of adverb, though that word attaches itself only to an
                    aċĳective or participle, or a verb significant of an attribute, and does not
                    attach itself to the pure verb.</p></note> as including not only verbs properly
                    so called, but also every species of words which, whether essentially or
                    accidentally, are significant of the attributes of substances, we shall find the
                    name <hi rend="italic">adverb</hi> to be a very just appellation, as denoting
                    <hi rend="italic">a part of speech, the natural appendage of such verbs.</hi> So
                    great is this dependence in grammatical syntax, that an adverb can no more
                    subsist without its verb, that is, without some word significant of an
                    attribute, than a verb or adjective can subsist without its substantive. It is
                    the same here as in certain natural subjects. Every colour, for its existence,
                    as much requires a superficies, as the superficies for its existence requires a
                    solid body.</p>
                <p>Amongst the attributes of substance are reckoned quantity and quality; thus we
                    say a <hi rend="italic">white garment,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">high
                    mountain,</hi> and the like. Now some of these quantities and qualities are
                    capable of intension or remission; or, in other words, one substance may have
                    them in a greater or less degree than another. Thus we say, <hi rend="italic">a
                    garment</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">exceedingly</hi><hi rend="italic">white, a
                    mountain</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">tolerably</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >moderately</hi><hi rend="italic">high.</hi> Hence, then, one copious source of
                    secondary attributes or <hi rend="italic">adverbs</hi> to denote these two, that
                    is, intension and remission; such as <hi rend="italic">greatly, tolerably,
                    vastly, extremely, indifferently.</hi></p>
                <p>But where there are different intensions of the same attribute, they may be
                    compared together. Thus, if the garment A be <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >exceedingly</hi><hi rend="italic">white,</hi> and the garment B be <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">moderately</hi><hi rend="italic">white,</hi> we may say, the
                    garment A is <hi rend="smallcaps">more</hi><hi rend="italic">white</hi> than the
                    garment B. This paper is <hi rend="italic">white,</hi> and snow is <hi
                    rend="italic">ìohite;</hi> but snow is <hi rend="smallcaps">more</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">white</hi> than this paper. In these instances the adverb <hi
                    rend="italic">more</hi> not only denotes intension, but relative intension; nay,
                    we stop not here, as we not only denote intension merely relative, but relative
                    intension than which there is none greater. Thus we say, Sophocles was <hi
                    rend="italic">wise,</hi> Socrates was <hi rend="smallcaps">more</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">wise</hi> than he, but <hi rend="italic">Solomon</hi> was the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">most</hi><hi rend="italic">wise</hi> of men. Even verbs,
                    properly so called, which denote an attribute as well as an assertion, must
                    admit both of simple and of comparative intensions; but the ample verb <hi
                    rend="italic">to be</hi> admits of neither the one nor the other. Thus, in the
                    following example, <hi rend="italic">Fame he</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">loveth
                    more</hi><hi rend="italic">than riches, but virtue of all things he</hi> LOVETH
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">most</hi>; the words <hi rend="italic">more</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">most</hi> denote the different comparative intensions of the
                    attribute included under the verb <hi rend="italic">loveth</hi>; but the
                    assertion itself, which is the essential part of the verb, admits neither of
                    intension nor remission, and is the same in all possible propositions.</p>
                <p>From this circumstance of quantities and qualities being capable of intension and
                    remission, arise the <hi rend="italic">comparison</hi> of adjectives, and its
                    different <hi rend="italic">degrees,</hi> which cannot well be more than the two
                    species above mentioned; one to denote simple excess, and one to denote
                    superlative. Were we indeed to introduce more degrees than these, we ought
                    perhaps to introduce an infinite number, which is absurd. For why stop at a
                    limited number, when in all subjects susceptible of intension, the intermediate
                    excesses are in a manner infinite? Between the first simple <hi rend="italic"
                    >white</hi> and the superlative <hi rend="italic">whitest</hi> there are
                    infinite degrees of <hi rend="italic">more white</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and the same may be said of <hi rend="italic">more</hi> great, <hi rend="italic"
                    >more</hi> strong, <hi rend="italic">more</hi> minute, and so on. The doctrine
                    of grammarians about <hi rend="italic">three</hi> such degrees of comparison,
                    which they call the <hi rend="italic">positive,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comparative,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">superlative,</hi> must be absurd;
                    both because in their positive there is no comparison at all, and because their
                    superlative is a comparative as much as their comparative itself. Examples to
                    evince this may be met with everywhere. <hi rend="italic">Socrates was
                    the</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">most wise</hi><hi rend="italic">of all the
                    Athenians</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Homer was the</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">most sublime</hi><hi rend="italic">of all poets.</hi> In this
                    sentence Socrates is evidently compared with the Athenians, and Homer with all
                    other poets. Again, if it be said that <hi rend="italic">Socrates was</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">more wise</hi><hi rend="italic">than any other Athenian, but

                    men,</hi> is not a comparison of Solomon with mankind in general, as plainly
                    implied in the last clause of the sentence, as a comparison of Socrates with the
                    other Athenians in the first?</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522677" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2677-0670"/>
                <p>But if both imply comparison, it may be asked, in what consists the difference
                    between the comparative and superlative? Docs the superlative always express a
                    greater excess than the comparative? It does not; for though Socrates was the
                    <hi rend="italic">most</hi> wise of the Athenians, yet is Solomon affirmed to
                    have been <hi rend="italic">more</hi> wise than he; so that here a higher
                    superiority is denoted by the comparative <hi rend="italic">more</hi> than by
                    the superlative <hi rend="italic">most.</hi> Is this then the difference between
                    these two degrees, that the superlative implies a comparison of <hi
                    rend="italic">one with many,</hi> whilst tile <hi rend="italic">comparative</hi>
                    implies only a comparison of <hi rend="italic">one with one ĩ</hi> No, this is
                    not always the case neither. The Psaloust says, that “he is <hi rend="italic"
                    >wiser</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">more wise)</hi> than all his teachers where,
                    though the comparative is used, there is a comparison of one with many.</p>
                <p>The real difference between these two degrees of comparison may be explained thus
                    :—When we use the superlative, it is in consequence of having compared
                    individuals with the species to which they belong, or one or more species with
                    the genus under which they are comprehended. Thus <hi rend="italic">Socrates was
                    the</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">most wise</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Athenians,
                    and the Athenians were the</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">most enlightened</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of ancient nations.</hi> In the first clause of this sentence,
                    Socrates, although compared with the Athenians, is at the same time considered
                    as one of them; and in the last the Athenians, although compared with ancient
                    nations, are yet considered as one of those nations. Hence it is that in English
                    the superlative is followed by the preposition <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> and in
                    Greek and Latin by the genitive case of the plural number; to show that the
                    object which has the pre-eminence is considered as belonging to that class of
                    things with which it is compared. But when we use the comparative degree, the
                    objects compared are set in direct opposition; and the one is considered not as
                    a part of the other, or as comprehended under it, but as something altogether
                    distinct and belonging to a different class. Thus, were any one to say, “Cicero
                    was <hi rend="italic">more eloquent</hi> than the Romans," he would speak
                    absurdly; because every body knows, that of the class of men expressed by the
                    word <hi rend="italic">Romans,</hi> Cicero was one, and such a sentence would
                    affirm that orator to have been more eloquent than himself. But when it is said
                    that “Cicero was <hi rend="italic">more eloquent</hi> than all the <hi
                    rend="italic">other</hi> Romans, or than <hi rend="italic">any other</hi>
                    Roman,” the language is proper, and the affirmation true; for though the persons
                    spoken of were all of the same class or city, yet Cicero is here set in
                    contradistinction to the rest of his countrymen, and is not considered as one of
                    the persons with whom he is compared. It is for this reason that in English the
                    comparative degree is followed by a noun governed by the word of
                    contradistinction <hi rend="italic">than,</hi> and in Latin by a noun in the
                    ablative case governed by the preposition <hi rend="italic">proe</hi><note

                    Although it is certainly true, that when we use the superlative, we ought in
                    propriet <hi rend="italic">y</hi> to consider the things compared as of the same
                    class; and when we use the comparative, as of different classes; yet this
                    distinction is not always attended to by the best writers in any language. In
                    Latin and Greek the comparative is sometimes used, where in English we should
                    use the superlative; as <hi rend="italic">dextra est fortion manuum;</hi> and in
                    the Gospel it is said, that “a grain of mustard-seed is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >smaller</hi> (/««(«»«) of all seeds, but when grown up it is the <hi
                    rend="italic">greater (μuζtn)</hi> of herbs.” Even in English, the custom of the
                    language permits us not to say, “he is the <hi rend="italic">tallest</hi> of the
                    two,” it must be the <hi rend="italic">taller</hi> of the two; but we cannot say
                    “he is the <hi rend="italic">taller</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">three,"</hi>
                    it must be the <hi rend="italic">tallcrt.</hi> For these and other deviations
                    from the general rule no reason is to be found in the nature of things; they are
                    errors made proper by use.</p></note> either expressed or understood. We have
                    already observed, that the ablative case denotes concomitancy; and therefore
                    when an adjective in the comparative degree is prefixed to a noun, that noun is
                    put in the ablative case, to denote that two things are compared together in
                    company; but by means of the preposition, expressed or understood, that which is
                    denoted by the comparative adjective is seen to be preferred before that which
                    is denoted by the noun.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto considered the comparative as expressed by the words <hi
                    rend="italic">more</hi> and <hi rend="italic">most</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    but the authors or improvers of language have contrived a method of retrenching
                    the use of these adverbs, by expressing their force by an inflexion of the
                    adjective. Thus, instead of <hi rend="italic">more fair,</hi> they say <hi
                    rend="italic">fairer;</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">most fair, fairest;</hi>
                    and the same method of comparison takes place both in the Greek and Latin
                    languages; witiι this difference, however, between the genius of these languages
                    and ours, that we are at liberty to form the comparison either in the one method
                    or in the other; whereas in those languages the comparison is seldom or never
                    formed by the assistance of the adverb, but always by the inflexion of the
                    adjective. Hence this inflexion is by the Greek and Latin grammarians considered
                    as a necessary accident of the adjective; but it has reached no further than to
                    adjectives, and participles sharing the nature of adjectives. The attributes
                    expressed by verbs are as susceptible of comparison as those expressed by
                    adjectives; but they are always compared by means of adverbs, the verb being too
                    much diversified already to admit of more variations without perplexity.</p>
                <p>It must be confessed, that comparatives, as well the simple as the superlative,
                    seem sometimes to part with their relative nature, and to retain only their
                    intensive. Thus in the degree denoting simple excess, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tristion,</hi> et lacrymis oculos suffusa nitentes— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Virg.</hi><hi rend="italic">Tristion</hi> means nothing more than that Venus
                    was very sad. In the degree called the superlative this is more usual. Phrases
                    extremely common are, <hi rend="italic">Vir doctissimus, vir
                    fortissimus,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> a most learned man, a most brave man
                    that is, not the bravest and most learned man that ever existed, but a man
                    possessing those qualities in an eminent degree. In English, when we intimate
                    that a certain quality is possessed in an eminent degree, without making any
                    direct comparison between it and a similar quality, we do it by the intensive
                    word <hi rend="italic">very,</hi> more commonly than by <hi rend="italic"
                    >most;</hi> as, Cicero was <hi rend="italic">very</hi> eloquent, the mind of
                    Johnson was <hi rend="italic">very</hi> vigorous. This mode of expression has
                    been called the superlative of eminence, to' distinguish it from the other
                    superlative, which is superlative upon comparison. Yet it may be said, that even
                    in the superlative of eminence something of comparison must be remotely or
                    indirectly intimate⅛ as we cannot reasonably call a man <hi rend="italic"
                    >very</hi> eloquent, without comparing his eloquence with the eloquence of other
                    men. This is indeed true; but we cannot therefore affirm that comparison is more
                    clearly intimated in this superlative than in the simple adjective <hi
                    rend="italic">eloquent</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for when we say that a man
                    is eloquent, we mark between his eloquence and that of other men a distinction
                    of the same kind, though not in the same degree, as when we say that he is very
                    eloquent.</p>
                <p>In English we distinguish the two superlatives, by prefixing to the one the
                    definite article <hi rend="italic">the,</hi> to show that something is
                    predicated of the object expressed by it, which cannot be predicated of any
                    other object; and by subjoining the preposition <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> to
                    show that the objects with which it is compared are of the same class with
                    itself; as, “Solomon was <hi rend="italic">the</hi> wisest of men; Hector was
                    <hi rend="italic">the</hi> most valiant <hi rend="italic">o]</hi> the Trojans.”
                    To the other superlative<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In English, the termination <hi rend="italic">est</hi> is peculiar to the
                    superlative of comparison, to which the definite article is prefixed. Thus we
                    may say, “Homer was the <hi rend="italic">sublimest</hi> of poets but we cannot
                    say, “Homer was a sublimest poet.” Again, we may say, “Homer was <hi
                    rend="italic">a very</hi> sublime poet but not, “Homer was <hi rend="italic">the
                    very</hi> sublime poet.”</p></note> we only prefix <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522690" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2690-0671"/>the indefinite article <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, “he was a <hi rend="italic"
                    >very</hi> good man; he was <hi rend="italic">a most</hi> valiant soldier.”</p>
                <p>As there are some qualities which admit of comparison, so there are others which
                    admit of none; such, for example, are those which denote that quality of bodies
                    arising from their figure, as when we say, a <hi rend="italic">circular</hi>
                    table, a <hi rend="italic">quadrangular</hi> court, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >conical</hi> piece of metal, and the like. The reason is, that a million of
                    things participating the same figure, participate it equally, if they do it at
                    all. To say, therefore, that whilst A and B are both quadrangular, A is <hi
                    rend="italic">more</hi> or <hi rend="italic">less</hi> quadrangular than B, is
                    absurd. The same holds true in all attributives denoting definite quantities of
                    whatsoever nature; for as there can be no comparison without intension or
                    remission, and a&amp; there can be no intension or remission in things always
                    definite, therefore these attributives can admit of no comparison. By the same
                    method of reasoning, we discover the cause why no substantive is susceptible of
                    these degrees of comparison. A mountain cannot be said <hi rend="italic">more to
                    be</hi> or <hi rend="italic">to exist</hi> than a mole-hill; but the <hi
                    rend="italic">mare</hi> or <hi rend="italic">less</hi> must be sought for in
                    their quantities. In like manner, when we refer many individuals to one species,
                    the lion A cannot be called <hi rend="italic">more</hi> a lion than the lion
                    B;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>when Pope says of a

                    to lying, the word <hi rend="italic">liar</hi> having the effect of an

                <p>And here it may be worth while to observe, how the same thing, participating the
                    same essence, assumes different grammatical forms from its different relations.
                    For example, suppose it should be asked, How differ <hi rend="italic">honest,

                    essence the same; but they differ in as much as <hi rend="italic">honest</hi> is
                    the attributive of a noun; <hi rend="italic">honestly,</hi> of a verb or
                    adjective; and <hi rend="italic">honesty</hi> being divested of these its
                    attributive relations, assumes the power of a noun or substantive, so as to
                    stand by itself.</p>
                <p>The adverbs hitherto mentioned are common to verbs of every species; but there
                    are some which are confined to verbs properly so called, that is, to such verbs
                    as denote motions or energies with their privations. All motion and rest imply
                    time and place as a kind of necessary coincidence. Hence, when we would express
                    the place or time of either, we have recourse to adverbs formed for this
                    purpose; of <hi rend="italic">place,</hi> as when we say, he stood <hi
                    rend="italic">there,</hi> he went <hi rend="italic">hence,</hi> he came <hi
                    rend="italic">hither</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> of time, as when we say, he
                    stood <hi rend="italic">then,</hi> he went <hi rend="italic">afterwards,</hi> he
                    travelled <hi rend="italic">formerly.</hi> To these may be added the adverbs
                    which denote the intensions and remissions peculiar to <hi rend="italic"
                    >motion,</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">speedily, hastily, swiftly, slowly,
                    &amp;c.</hi>; as also adverbs of place made out of prepositions, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">upwards</hi> and <hi rend="italic">downwards,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">up</hi> and <hi rend="italic">down.</hi> It may, however, be
                    doubted whether some of these words, as well as many others, which do not so
                    properly modify attributes, as mark some remote circumstance attending an
                    attribute or our way of conceiving it, are truly adverbs, though so called by
                    the grammarians. The simple affirmative and negative <hi rend="italic">yes</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">no</hi> are called adverbs, though they surely do not
                    signify that which we hold to be the very essence of the adverb, a modification
                    of attributes. “Is he learned? No.” “Is he brave? Yes.” Here the two adverbs, as
                    they are called, signify not any modification of the attributes <hi
                    rend="italic">brave</hi> and <hi rend="italic">learned,</hi> but a total
                    negation of the attribute in the one case, and in the other a declaration that
                    the attribute belongs to the person spoken of.</p>
                <p>Adverbs are indeed applied· to many purposes; and their general nature may be
                    better understood by reading a list of them, and attending to their etymology,
                    than by any general description or definition. Many of them seem to have been
                    introduced into language in order to express by one word the meaning of two or
                    three, and are mere abbreviations of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Thus, the
                    import of the phrase, <hi rend="italic">in what place,</hi> is expressed by the
                    single word <hi rend="italic">where</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> to what place,
                    by <hi rend="italic">whither</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> from this place, by
                    <hi rend="italic">hence;</hi> in a direction ascending, by <hi rend="italic"
                    >upwards;</hi> at the present time, by <hi rend="italic">now;</hi> at what time,
                    by <hi rend="italic">when;</hi> at that time, by <hi rend="italic">then</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> many times, by <hi rend="italic">often</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> not many times, by <hi rend="italic">seldom</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and so of others.</p>
                <p>Mr Horne Tooke has, with great industry and accuracy, traced many of the English
                    adverbs from their origin in the ancient Saxon and other northern tongues, and
                    shown them to be either corruptions of other words or abbreviations of phrases
                    and sentences. He observes, “that all adverbs ending in <hi rend="italic"
                    >ly,</hi> the most prolific branch of the family, are sufficiently under⅝tood;
                    the termination being only the word <hi rend="italic">like</hi> corrupted, and
                    the corruption so much the more easily and certainly discovered, as the
                    termination remains more pure and distinguishable in the other sister languages,
                    in which it is written <hi rend="italic">lick, lyh, lig, ligen.”</hi> He might
                    have added, that in Scotland the word <hi rend="italic">like</hi> is, at this
                    day, frequently used instead of the English termination <hi rend="italic"
                    >ly</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as for a <hi rend="italic">goodly figure,</hi>
                    the common people say a <hi rend="italic">good-like</hi> figure. Upon this
                    principle the greater part of adverbs are resolved into those parts of speech
                    which we have already considered, as <hi rend="italic">honestly</hi> into <hi
                    rend="italic">honest-like, vastly,</hi> into <hi rend="italic">vast-like,</hi>
                    &amp;c.; so that when we say of a man he is <hi rend="italic">honestly
                    industrious,</hi> we affirm that he is <hi rend="italic">honest-like
                    industrious,</hi> or that his industry has the appearance of being honest.
                    Adverbs of a different termination the same acute writer resolves thus; <hi
                    rend="italic">aghast</hi> into the past participle <hi rend="italic"
                    >agazed;</hi></p>
                <p>The French exclaimed, the Devil was in arms.</p>
                <p>All the whole army stood <hi rend="italic">agaxed</hi> on him— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shaktp.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ago,</hi> into the past participle <hi
                    rend="italic">agone</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gone. Asunder</hi> he derives from
                    <hi rend="italic">asundered,</hi> separated; the past participle of the
                    Anglo-Saxon verb <hi rend="italic">asundrien,</hi> a word which, in all its
                    varieties, is to be found in all the northern tongues, and comes originally from
                    <hi rend="italic">send,</hi> that is, sand. <hi rend="italic">To wit,</hi> from
                    <hi rend="italic">wittan,</hi> to know; as <hi rend="italic">videlicet</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">scilicet,</hi> in Latin, are abbreviations of <hi
                    rend="italic">videre-licet</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scire-licet. Needs,</hi>
                    he resolves into <hi rend="italic">need is,</hi> used parenthetically; as, “I
                    must <hi rend="italic">needs</hi> do such a thing.” “I must (need is) do such a
                    thing that is, “I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> do it, there <hi rend="italic">is
                    need</hi> of it.” <hi rend="italic">Anon,</hi> which our old authors use for <hi
                    rend="italic">immediately, instantly,</hi> means, he says, <hi rend="italic">in
                    one,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">in one instant, moment, minute.</hi>
                    As,</p>
                <p>And right <hi rend="italic">anon</hi> withouten more abode. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anon</hi> in all the haste I can.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alone</hi> and <hi rend="italic">only</hi> are resolved into
                    <hi rend="italic">all one,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">one-like.</hi> In the
                    Dutch, <hi rend="italic">cen</hi> is one; and <hi rend="italic">all cen</hi>
                    alone; and <hi rend="italic">all-cen-like,</hi> only, anciently <hi
                    rend="italic">alonely. Alive</hi> is on live, or in life. Thus, in Chaucer, <pb

                    >ought; a whit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">o whit; o</hi> being formerly written
                    for the article α, or for the numeral <hi rend="italic">one</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">whit</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >hwit,</hi> in Saxon, signifying a small thing, as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >point</hi> or <hi rend="italic">jot. Awhile,</hi> which is usually classed with
                    adverbs, is evidently a noun with the indefinite article prefixed; <hi
                    rend="italic">a while,</hi> that is, <hi rend="italic">a time. Whilst,</hi>
                    anciently and more properly <hi rend="italic">whiles,</hi> is plainly the Saxon
                    <hi rend="italic">hwilees, time that. Aloft</hi> was formerly written <hi
                    rend="italic">on-left.</hi> As, in Chaucer,</p>
                <p>And ye, my mother, my soveregne pleasance Over al thing, <hi rend="italic">out
                    talce</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Cnxist on lofte.</hi></p>
                <p>Now, says Mr Home Tooke, <hi rend="italic">lyft,</hi> in the Anglo-Saxon, is the
                    air or the clouds, as, <hi rend="italic">in lyfie cummende,</hi> coming in the
                    clouds (St Luke). In the Danish, <hi rend="italic">luft</hi> is air; and “at
                    spronge i <hi rend="italic">lüften?</hi> to blow up into the air, or <hi
                    rend="italic">aloft.</hi> So in the Dutch, <hi rend="italic">de loer
                    hebben,</hi> to sail before the wind; <hi rend="italic">loeven,</hi> to ply to
                    windward; <hi rend="italic">loer,</hi> the weather gage, &amp;c. From the same
                    root are our other words, <hi rend="italic">Loft, lofty,</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">luff, lee, leeward, lift,</hi> &amp;c. It would be needless, as
                    the ingenious author observes, to notice such adverbs as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >afoot, adays, ashore, astray, aslope, aright, abed, aback, abreast, afloat,
                    aloud, aside, afield, aground, aland,</hi> &amp;c. These are at first view seen
                    for what they are. Nor shall we follow him through the analysis which he has
                    given of many other adverbs, of which the origin is not so obvious as of these.
                    Of the truth of his principles we are satisfied; and have not a doubt, but that
                    upon those principles a man conversant with our earliest writers, and thoroughly
                    skilled in the present languages, may trace every English adverb<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The same resolution might
                    probably be made of the Greek and Latin adverbs, were we as intimately
                    acquainted with the sources of those tongues as Mr Horne Tooke is with the
                    sources of the English language. “Many of the Latin adverbs,” says Ruddiman,
                    “are nothing else but adjective nouns or pronouns, having the preposition and
                    substantive understood; as <hi rend="smallcaps">jmo,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >co,</hi><hi rend="italic">eodem,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ad quee,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ea,</hi><hi rend="italic">cadem (loco)</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >cui, ei, eidem</hi><hi rend="italic">(loco)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for of
                    old these datives ended in <hi rend="italic">o.</hi> Thus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >qua, hoc, iliac,</hi> &amp;c. are plainly adjectives in the abla. tive singular
                    feminine, the word <hi rend="italic">via,</hi> “a way,” and the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">in,</hi> being understood. Many of them are compounds; as, <hi
                    rend="italic">quonu&gt;- do,</hi> i. e. <hi rend="italic">quo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">modo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    leisure to pursue the subject, and were masters of all the Ian-guages from which
                    the Latin is derived, we doubt not but we should be able to resolve every adverb

                    no part of speech separate from those which we have already considered. The
                    adverbs, however, of affirmation and negation, are of too much importance to be
                    thus passed over; and as we have never seen an account of them at all
                    satisfactory, except that whiβh has been given by Mr Horne Tooke, we shall
                    transcribe the substance of what he says concerning <hi rend="italic">aye, yea,
                    yes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">no.</hi> To us these words have always appeared
                    improperly classed with adverbs, upon every definition which has been given of
                    that part of speech. Accordingly, our author says, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >aye</hi> or <hi rend="italic">yea</hi> is the imperative of a verb of northern
                    extraction; and means <hi rend="italic">have, possess, enjoy.</hi> And <hi
                    rend="italic">yes</hi> is a contraction of <hi rend="italic">ay-es,</hi> have,
                    possess, enjoy, <hi rend="italic">that.</hi> Thus, when it is asked whether a
                    man be learned, if the answer be by the word <hi rend="italic">yes,</hi> it is
                    equivalent to <hi rend="italic">have that, enjoy that</hi> belief or that
                    proposition.</p>
                <p>The northern verb of which <hi rend="italic">yea</hi> is the imperative, is in
                    Danish <hi rend="italic">ejer,</hi> to possess, have, enjoy. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eja,</hi> aye or yea; <hi rend="italic">eje,</hi> possession; <hi rend="italic"
                    >ęįer,</hi> possessor. In Swedish it is <hi rend="italic">ega,</hi> to possess,
                    of which the imperative is <hi rend="italic">ja,</hi> aye, yea; <hi
                    rend="italic">égaré,</hi> possessor. In German, <hi rend="italic">ju</hi>
                    signifies aye or yea; <hi rend="italic">eigener,</hi> possessor, owner; <hi
                    rend="italic">eigen,</hi> own. In Dutch, <hi rend="italic">eigenen</hi> is to
                    possess <hi rend="italic">∙,ja,</hi> yea. Greenwood derives <hi rend="italic"
                    >not</hi> and its abbreviate <hi rend="italic">no</hi> from the Latin; Minshow,
                    from the Hebrew; and Junius, from the Greek. Our author very properly observes,
                    that the inhabitants of the north could not wait for a word expressive of
                    dissent till the establishment of those nations and languages; and adds, that we
                    need not be inquisitive nor doubtful concerning the origin and signification of
                    <hi rend="italic">not and no</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> since we find that, in
                    the Danish <hi rend="italic">nodig,</hi> in the Swedish <hi rend="italic"
                    >nodig,</hi> and in the Dutch, <hi rend="italic">noode, node,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">no,</hi> mean averse, unwilling. So that when it is asked whether
                    a man be brave, if the answer be <hi rend="italic">no,</hi> it is a declaration
                    that he who makes it is averse from or unwilling to admit-that proposition.</p>
                <p>Most writers on grammar have mentioned a species of adverbs, which they call
                    adverbs of interrogation, such as <hi rend="italic">where, whence, whither,
                    how,</hi> &amp;c. But the truth is, that there is no part of speech which, of
                    itself, denotes interrogation. A question is never asked otherwise than by
                    abbreviation, by a single word, whether that word be a noun, a pronoun, a verb,
                    or an adverb. The word <hi rend="italic">where</hi> is equivalent to in what
                    place; <hi rend="italic">whence,</hi> to from what place; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >how,</hi> to in what manner, &amp;c. In these phrases, <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi> what place, <hi rend="italic">from</hi> what place, and <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> what manner, the only word that can be supposed to have
                    the force of an interrogative, is <hi rend="italic">what,</hi> which is
                    resolvable into <hi rend="italic">that which.</hi> But we have already
                    explained, under the head of Pronouns, the principles upon which the relative is
                    made to denote interrogation; and the same reasoning will account for the
                    adverbs <hi rend="italic">where, whence, whither, how,</hi> &amp;c. being
                    employed as interrogatives. When we say, “Where were you yesterday? whence have
                    you come? whither are you going? how do you perform your journey ?” we merely
                    use so many abbreviations for the following sentences: “Tell us, or describe to
                    us, <hi rend="italic">the place where</hi> (or in which) you were yesterday; <hi
                    rend="italic">the place whence</hi> (or from which) you have come; <hi
                    rend="italic">the place to which</hi> you are going; <hi rend="italic">the
                    manner in which</hi> you perform your journey? And so much for adverbs. We now
                    proceed to those parts of speech which are usually called prepositions and
                    conjunctions, and of which the use is to connect the other words of a sentence,
                    and to combine two or more simple sentences into one compound sentence.</p>

                <p>It has been observed, that a man whilst awake is conscious of a continued train
                    of perceptions and ideas passing in his mind, which depends little upon his own
                    will; that he cannot to the train add a new idea; and that he can but very
                    seldom break its connection. To the slightest reflection these truths must be
                    apparent. Our first ideas are those which we derive from external objects making
                    impressions on the senses; but all the external objects which fall under our
                    observation are linked together in such a manner as indicates them to be parts
                    of one great and regular system. When we take a view of the things by which we
                    are surrounded, and which are the archetypes of our ideas, their inherent
                    qualities are not more remarkable than the various relations by which they are
                    connected. Cause and effect, contiguity in time or place, high and low, prior
                    and posterior, resemblance and contrariety, with a thousand other relations,
                    connect things together without end. There is not a single thing which appears
                    solitary and altogether devoid of connection. The only difference is, that some
                    are intimately and some slightly connected, some neariy and some at a distance.
                    That the relations by which external objects are thus linked together must have
                    great influence in directing the train of human thought, so that not one
                    perception or idea can appear to the mind wholly unconnected with all other
                    perceptions or ideas, will be admitted by every man who <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193522716" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2716-0673"/>believes that his senses and
                    intellect represent things as they are.</p>
                <p>This being the case, it is necessary, if the purpose of language be to
                    communicate thought, that the speaker be furnished with words, not only to
                    express the ideas of substances and attributes which he may have in his mind,
                    but also to indicate the order in which he views them, and to point out the
                    various relations by which they are connected. In many instances all this may be
                    done by the parts of speech which we have already considered. The closest
                    connection which we can conceive, is that which subsists between a substance and
                    its qualities; and in every language with which we are acquainted, that
                    connection is indicated by the immediate coalescence of the adjective with the
                    substantive; as we say, <hi rend="italic">a good man·, a learned man</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">υiτ bonus, vir</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >doctus.</hi> Again, there is a connection equally intimate, though not so
                    permanent, between an agent and his action; for the action is really an
                    attribute of the agent; and therefore we say, the <hi rend="italic">boy
                    reads,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">man writes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    noun coalescing with the verb so naturally, that no other word is requisite to
                    unite them. Moreover, an action and that which is acted upon being contiguous in
                    nature, and mutually affecting each other, the words which denote them should in
                    language be mutually attractive, and capable of coalescing without external aid;
                    as, he <hi rend="italic">reads a book,</hi> he <hi rend="italic">builds a
                    house,</hi> he <hi rend="italic">breaks a stone.</hi> Further, because an
                    attribute and its modifications are inseparably united, an adjective or a verb
                    is naturally connected with the adverb which illustrates or modifies its
                    signification; and therefore, when we say, he <hi rend="italic">walks
                    slowly,</hi> he is <hi rend="italic">prudently brave,</hi> it is plain that no
                    other word is necessary to promote the coalescence of the attributes “walking”
                    and “bravery” with their modifications of “slowness” and “prudence." The
                    agreement between the terms of any proposition which constitutes truth is
                    absolutely perfect; but as either of the terms may agree with many other things
                    besides its correlate, some word is requisite in every proposition to connect
                    the particular predicate with the particular subject; and that is the office of
                    the simple verb <hi rend="italic">to be</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as, the
                    three angles of every triangle <hi rend="italic">are</hi> equal to two right
                    angles.</p>
                <p>Thus we see that many of the relations subsisting between our ideas may be
                    clearly expressed by means of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and adverbs; and in
                    those languages of which the nouns have cases, there is perhaps no relation of
                    much importance which might not be thus pointed out, without being under the
                    necessity of employing the aid of any additional part of speech. In English,
                    however, the case is otherwise; for were we to say, “He rode Edinburgh, went the
                    parliament-house, walked his counsel the court met,” we should speak
                    unintelligibly; as in these expressions there is either a total want of
                    connection, or such a connection as produces falsehood and nonsense. In order to
                    give meaning to the passage, the several gaps must be filled up by words
                    significant of the various relatione by which the different ideas are connected
                    in the mind; as, “He rode <hi rend="italic">to</hi> Edinburgh, went <hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi> the parliament-house, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> walked
                    <hi rend="italic">with</hi> his counsel <hi rend="italic">till</hi> the court
                    met.” Of these <hi rend="italic">connecting</hi> words, <hi rend="italic"
                    >to</hi> and <hi rend="italic">with</hi> are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >prepositions, and</hi> and <hi rend="italic">till</hi> are usually called <hi
                    rend="italic">conjunctions.</hi> Although these prepositions and conjunctions
                    are not so absolutely necessary in Greek and Latin as they are in English, yet
                    as there is no language wholly without them, nor any language in which it is not
                    of importance to understand their force, they well deserve a place in universal
                    grammar.</p>
                <p>The sole use of conjunctions and prepositions in language is to connect either
                    sentences or other words; but the theory of these connectives themselves has
                    certainly never been understood, unless Mr Horne Tooke has at last hit upon the
                    truth. Mr Harris writes about them and i about them, quoting passages from Greek
                    and Latin au-there, and produces at last no information. His defini- ' tions of
                    both, as parts of speech void of signification, are highly absurd; and even the
                    principal distinction which he makes between them seems not to be well founded.
                    Prepositions and conjunctions denote the relations subsisting between the ideas
                    expressed by those words or sentences which they serve to connect; and as
                    relations are contemplated by the mind as well as positive ideas themselves, the
                    words which denote these relations cannot be insignificant. The essential
                    difference between the conjunction and preposition, according to the same
                    author, consists in this, that the former connects sentences, and the latter
                    words; but the fact is often otherwise. An obvious example occurs where the
                    conjunction <hi rend="italic">and</hi> connects not sentences but words. “A man
                    of wisdom <hi rend="italic">and</hi> virtue is a perfect character.” Here it is
                    not meant to be asserted, “that the man of <hi rend="italic">wisdom</hi> is a
                    perfect character, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> that the man of <hi rend="italic"
                    >virtue</hi> is a perfect character;” for both these assertions would be false.
                    This sentence therefore (and many such will occur) is not resolvable into two;
                    whence it follows, that the conjunction <hi rend="italic">and</hi> does not
                    always connect sentences; and the same is frequently the case with other
                    conjunctions.</p>
                <p>Mr Horne Tooke’s idea of prepositions and conjunctions is, that they do not form
                    distinct classes of words, but are merely abbreviations of nouns and verbs; and,
                    with respect to the English language, he has been remarkably successful in
                    proving his position. But though such be undeniably the case in English, it
                    would be rash to conclude <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> that it is so in all
                    other tongues. To establish this general conclusion would require a long and
                    tedious deduction in each particular language; and how much language, leisure,
                    industry, and acuteness, such an undertaking would require, even in one tongue,
                    it is not easy to determine. In the languages with which we are best acquainted,
                    many conjunctions, and most prepositions, have the appearance at least of
                    original words; and though this most acute grammarian, from his knowledge of the
                    northern tongues, has been able to trace the most important of those in English
                    to very plausible sources, the same thing would be difficult in other languages
                    of which the sources are obscure, and absolutely impossible in those of which
                    they are wholly unknown. It is, however, a strong presumption in favour of his
                    opinion, that grammarians have never been able to assign any general
                    characteristic of those species of words, which, did they constitute distinct
                    parts of speech, one would think could not have so long remained undiscovered.
                    It is a further presumption in his favour, that many words in Greek and Latin,
                    as well as in English, which have been called conjunctions, are obviously
                    resolvable upon his principles, and indeed discover their meaning and origin
                    upon mere inspection. We shall therefore content ourselves with retailing the
                    common doctrine respecting these parts of speech so far as it is intelligible,
                    subjoining at the bottom of the page the analysis given by Mr Horne Tooke, of
                    the most important English conjunctions and prepositions; and requesting our
                    readers, who would understand the subject, to attend more to the relations
                    between their various ideas, than to the frivolous distinctions which, in
                    compliance with custom, we are compelled to lay before them. We shall treat
                    first of the <hi rend="italic">conjunction.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Of Conjunctions.</hi><hi rend="italic">A</hi> conjunction is
                    a part of speech of which, as its name indicates, the use is to connect either
                    two or more words in a sentence, or to make of two simple sentences one compound
                    sentence. It is usually said that conjunctions never connect words, but
                    sentences only, and that this is the circumstance which distinguishes them from
                    <hi rend="italic">prepositions.</hi> We <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522729"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-2729-0674"/>have already given one example which proves this
                    distinction to be ill founded; we shall now give from Mr Home Tooke one or two
                    more, which will place its absurdity in a still clearer light: Two <hi
                    rend="italic">and</hi> two are four; John <hi rend="italic">and</hi> Jane are a
                    handsome couple; AB <hi rend="italic">and</hi> BC <hi rend="italic">and</hi> CA
                    form a triangle. Are <hi rend="italic">two four ĩ</hi> Is <hi rend="italic"
                    >John</hi> a <hi rend="italic">couple</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jane</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">couple</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> Does <hi rend="italic">one
                    straight line</hi> form a <hi rend="italic">triangle ĩ</hi> It appears indeed
                    that <hi rend="italic">and</hi> may connect any two things which can be
                    connected, as it signifies addition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">And</hi> is a 8axon word, being, according
                    to Mr Horne Tooke, an abbreviation of <hi rend="smallcaps">an ad,</hi> the
                    imperative of the verb <hi rend="smallcaps">anaxad,</hi><hi rend="italic">to add
                    to</hi> or <hi rend="italic">heap up.</hi> So that when we say <hi rend="italic"
                    >two</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi><hi rend="italic">two are four,</hi> we
                    only declare that <hi rend="italic">two</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">added
                    to</hi><hi rend="italic">two are four.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>Conjunctions connecting sentences sometimes connect their meaning, and sometimes
                    not. For example, let us take these two sentences, “Rome was enslaved, Caesar
                    was ambitious,” and connect them together by the conjunction <hi rend="italic"
                    >because</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> “Rome was enslaved <hi rend="italic"
                    >because</hi> Caesar was ambitious.” Here the meanings, as well as the
                    sentences, appear to be connected by that natural relation which subsists
                    between an effect and its cause; for the enslaving of Rome was the effect of
                    Caesar’s ambition. That particular relation therefore is that which is denoted
                    by the conjunction <hi rend="italic">because,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Because</hi> is compounded
                    of the 8axon <hi rend="smallcaps">be,</hi><hi rend="italic">by,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">cause</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and by some of our most ancient
                    authors it was written <hi rend="smallcaps">by cause.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">Rome was enslaved</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >because</hi><hi rend="italic">Casar was ambitious,"</hi> is therefore
                    equivalent to, “<hi rend="italic">Rome was enslaved by the cause</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">caesar was ambitious</hi> taking the phrase, “caesar was
                    ambitious,” as an abstract noun in concord with the other noun cause.</p></note>
                    which would be improperly used to connect two sentences between which the
                    relation of an effect to its cause exists not. But if it be said, “manners must
                    be reformed, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> liberty will be lost here the conjunction
                    or, though it joins the sentences, yet as to their meaning is a perfect
                    disjunctive. Between the reformation of manners and the loss of liberty there is
                    certainly a natural relation; but it is not the relation of contiguity or
                    similitude, or of cause and effect, but of contrariety. The relation of
                    contrariety therefore is the signification of the word or.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Or</hi> seems to be a mere
                    contraction of the Saxon <hi rend="smallcaps">oder,</hi> which signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">other,</hi> that is, something different and often contrary. So
                    that the conjunction <hi rend="italic">or</hi> must always denote diversity, and
                    very often contrariety.</p></note> And thus it appears, that though all
                    conjunctions may combine sentences, yet, with respect to the sense, some are <hi
                    rend="italic">conjunctive</hi> and others <hi rend="italic"
                    >disjunctive.</hi></p>
                <p>Those conjunctions which conjoin both sentences and their meanings are either <hi
                    rend="italic">copulatives</hi> or <hi rend="italic">continuances.</hi> The
                    principal copulative in English is <hi rend="italic">and,</hi> which we have
                    already considered. The continuatives are much more numerous; <hi rend="italic"
                    >if, an, because, therefore, wherefore, hence,</hi> &amp;c. The difference
                    between them is this: The copulative does no more than barely couple words or
                    sentences, and is therefore applicable to all subjects of which the natures are
                    not incompatible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As <hi
                    rend="italic">day</hi> and <hi rend="italic">night, heat</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">cold</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for we cannot say of the same
                    portion of time, <hi rend="italic">it is day</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >and</hi><hi rend="italic">it is night</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or of the
                    same body, it is both <hi rend="italic">hot</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cold.</hi></p></note> The relation which it denotes is that of
                    juxtaposition, or of one thing added to another. Continuatives, on the contrary,
                    by a more intimate connection, consolidate sentences into one continuous whole;
                    and are therefore applicable only to subjects which have an essential relation
                    to each other, such as that of an effect to its cause, or of a cause to its
                    effect. For example, it is no way improper to say, “Lysippus was a statuary, <hi
                    rend="italic">and</hi> Priscian a grammarian; the sun shineth, <hi rend="italic"
                    >and</hi> the sky is clear because these are things that can co-exist, and yet
                    imply no absurdity. But it would be absurd to say, “Lysippus was a statuary <hi
                    rend="italic">because</hi> Priscian was a grammarian though not to say, “the sun
                    shineth <hi rend="italic">because</hi> the sky is clear.” With respect to the
                    first, the reason is, that the word <hi rend="italic">because</hi> denotes the
                    relation which an effect bears to its cause; but the skill of Priscian in
                    grammar could not possibly be the cause of Lysippus’s skill in statuary; the
                    coincidence between the skill of the one and that of the other, in arts so very
                    different, was merely accidental. With respect to the shining of the sun and the
                    clearness of the sky, the case is widely different; for the clearness of the sky
                    is the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of the sun’s shining, at least so as to be
                    seen by us.</p>
                <p>As to the continuatives, they are either <hi rend="italic">suppositive,</hi> such
                    as <hi rend="italic">if, an</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive,</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">because, therefore, as,</hi> &amp;c.
                    Take examples of each: “You will live happily if you live honestly; you live
                    happily <hi rend="italic">because</hi> you live honestly; yon live honestly, <hi
                    rend="italic">therefore</hi> you live happily.” The difference between these
                    continuatives is this: The suppositives denote connection, but do not assert
                    actual existence; the positives imply both the one and the other.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘ The reason of all this will
                    Ėe apparent from the analysis given by Mr Home Tooke of those words which we
                    have called suppositive conjunctions. <hi rend="italic">If</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">an</hi> may be used mutually and indifferently to supply each
                    other’s place ţ for they are both verbs, and of the same import. <hi
                    rend="italic">If</hi> is merely the imperative of the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon
                    verh <hi rend="smallcaps">gifan,</hi><hi rend="italic">to give</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and in those languages, as well as in the English formerly,
                    this supposed conjunction was pronounced and written as the common imperative
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">gif.</hi> Thus,</p><p>My largesse</p><p>Hath lotted her to
                    be your brother’s mistresse,</p><p>Gi∕shee can be reclaimed; ^∕not, his prey.
                    <hi rend="italic">Sad Shepherd.</hi></p><p>Gawin Douglass almost always uses <hi
                    rend="italic">gif</hi> for <hi rend="italic">if,</hi> as the common people in
                    some counties of Scotland do even at this day; and it is obvious, that our ∙∕has
                    always the signification of the English imperative <hi rend="italic">give,</hi>
                    and no other. So that the resolution of the construction in the sentence, “<hi
                    rend="smallcaps">If</hi><hi rend="italic">you live honestly you will live
                    happily,"</hi> is simply this, “<hi rend="smallcaps">Give</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >you live honestly</hi> (taking <hi rend="italic">you live honestly</hi> as an
                    abstract noun) <hi rend="italic">you will live happily."</hi> γur living <hi
                    rend="italic">happily</hi> is declared to depend upon your living <hi
                    rend="italic">honestly</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">condition</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but <hi rend="italic">give that,</hi> and your happiness is
                    positively asserted. In like manner may such sentences be resolved as,</p><p>I
                    wonder he can move! that he’s not fixed!</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">If that</hi>
                    his feelings be the same with mine.</p><p>Thus, “His feelings be the same with
                    mine, <hi rend="italic">give that,</hi> I wonder he can move,” &amp;c. And here
                    we cannot forbear giving our assent to the truth of Mr Horne Tooke’s
                    observation, that when the datum upon which any conclusion depends is a
                    sentence, the article <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> if not expressed, may always
                    be inserted, we do not, however, think the insertion at all times absolutely
                    necessary to complete the syntax; for active verbs govern whole sentences and
                    clauses of sentences as well as substantive nouns. Instances of this occur so
                    frequently in the Latin classics, that they can have escaped no man’s notice who
                    has ever read Horace or virgil with attention, we agree likewise with this most
                    ingenious author, that where the datum is not a sentence, but some noun governed
                    by the verb <hi rend="italic">if</hi> or <hi rend="italic">give,</hi> the
                    article <hi rend="italic">that</hi> can never be inserted. For example, if we be
                    asked how the weather will dispose of us to-morrow, we cannot say: <hi
                    rend="italic">"If that</hi> fair, it will send us abroad; <hi rend="italic">if
                    that</hi> foul, it will keep us at home but “f∕ ’ fair, it will send us abroad,”
                    &lt;⅛c. The reason is obvious. The verb in this case directly governs the noun;
                    and the resolved construction is, “<hi rend="italic">give</hi> fair weather, it
                    will send us abroad; <hi rend="italic">give</hi> foul weather, it will keep us
                    at home.”</p><p><hi rend="italic">An,</hi> the other suppositive conjunction
                    mentioned, is nothing else than the imperative of the Anglo-Saxon verb <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">an ax,</hi> which likewise means Io <hi rend="italic">give</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">to grant.</hi> As, “<hi rend="italic">An</hi> you had an
                    eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels than fortune before
                    you that is, “<hi rend="italic">Grant</hi> y <hi rend="subscript"> ou</hi> had
                    an eye behind you, you might see,” &amp;c. This account of the two conditional
                    conjunctions in English is so rational and satisfactory, that we are strongly
                    inclined to believe that all those words which are so called, are in all
                    languages to be accounted for in the same manner. Not indeed that they must all
                    mean precisely <hi rend="italic">to give</hi> or <hi rend="italic">grant,</hi>
                    but some word equivalent; such as, <hi rend="italic">be it, suppose, allow,
                    permit i</hi> which meaning is to be sought for in the particular etymology of

                    the moon intervenes the collectives subjoin effects to causes; as, “the moon

                    of little consequence what name any class of words be called, provided the

                    and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> evidently denote the relation of a cause to
                    its effects. They are compounds of the saxon words nwAEn and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">tiiaeb</hi> with <hi rend="smallcaps">fob</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">voor;</hi> and signify <hi rend="italic">for which, for

                    We therefore use causais in those instances where, the effect being conspicuous,
                    we seek for its cause; and collectives, in demonstration and science, properly
                    so called, where the cause being first known, by its help we discern
                    effects.</p>
                <p>As to causal conjunctions, we may further observe, that there is not one of the
                    four species of causes which they are not capable of denoting. For example, the
                    <hi rend="italic">material</hi> cause; “The trumpet sounds <hi rend="italic"
                    >because</hi> it is made of metal.” The <hi rend="italic">formal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> “The trumpet sounds <hi rend="italic">because</hi> it is
                    long and hollow.” The <hi rend="italic">efficient</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    “The trumpet sounds <hi rend="italic">because</hi> an artist blows it” The <hi
                    rend="italic">final ,∙</hi> “The trumpet sounds <hi rend="italic">that</hi> it
                    may raise our courage.” It is worth observing, that the first three causes are
                    expressed by the strongest affirmation; because if the effect actually be, these
                    must be also. But this is not the case with respect to the last, which is only
                    affirmed as a thing that may happen. The reason is obvious; for whatever may be
                    the end which set the artist first to work, that end it may still be beyond his
                    power to obtain; as, like all other contingents, it may either happen or not.
                    Hence also it is connected by a particular conjunction, <hi rend="italic"
                    >that,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>have already
                    considered the word <hi rend="italic">that,</hi> and seen that it is never a
                    conjunction, but uniformly a definite article. “The trumpet sounds (for) <hi
                    rend="italic">that</hi> it may raise our courage taking the clause “it may raise
                    our courage” as an abstract noun in concord with <hi rend="italic">that</hi> and
                    governed by <hi rend="italic">for.</hi> Gr the sentence may be resolved thus:
                    “The trumpet may raise our courage (for) that (purpose) it sounds.”</p></note>
                    absolutely confined to this cause.</p>
                <p>We come now to the <hi rend="italic">disjunctive conjunctions,</hi> a species of
                    words which bear this contradictory name, because whilst they <hi rend="italic"
                    >conjoin</hi> the sentences, they <hi rend="italic">disjoin</hi> the sense; or,
                    to speak a language more intelligible, they denote relations of <hi
                    rend="italic">diversity</hi> or <hi rend="italic">opposition.</hi></p>
                <p>That there should be such words, whether called conjunctions or not, is extremely
                    natural. For as there is a principle of <hi rend="italic">union</hi> diffused
                    throughout all things, by which <hi rend="italic">this whole</hi> is kept
                    together and preserved from dissipation; so is there in like manner a principle
                    of <hi rend="italic">diversity</hi> diffused throughout all, the source of
                    distinction, of number, and of order. Now it is to express in some degree the
                    modifications of this diversity, that those words called <hi rend="italic"
                    >disjunctive conjunctions</hi> are employed.</p>
                <p>Of these disjunctives some are <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> and some <hi
                    rend="italic">adversative</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> Simple, as when we say,

                    say, “it is not day, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> it is night.” The difference

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Horne Tooke has favoured us with some
                    ingenious remarks on the two different derivations of the word <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">but,</hi> when used in the two acceptations which are usually
                    annexed to it, viz. that which it bears in the beginning of a sentence, and that
                    which it has in the middle. He has given it as his opinion, that this word, when
                    employed in the former way, is corruptly put for <hi rend="smallcaps">bot,</hi>
                    the imperative of the Saxon verb <hi rend="smallcaps">botan,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">to boot, to tuperadd, to supply,</hi> &amp;c. and that when used
                    in the latter it is a contraction of <hi rend="smallcaps">be-utan,</hi> the
                    imperative of <hi rend="smallcaps">beon-ütan,</hi><hi rend="italic">to be
                    out.</hi> Our ancient writers made the proper distinction between the
                    orthography of the one word and that of the other. Gawin Douglass, in
                    particular, although he frequently confounds the two words, and uses them
                    improperly, does yet abound with many instances of their proper use; and so
                    contrasted, as to awaken, says our author, the most inattentive reader. Of the
                    many examples quoted by him, we shall content ourselves with the two
                    following:</p><lg part="N">

                    </lg><p>If this derivation of the word <hi rend="smallcaps">but</hi> from <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">botan,</hi><hi rend="italic">to superadd,</hi> be just, the
                    sentence in the text, “the number three is not an even number, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">but</hi> an odd,” will be equivalent to “the number three is
                    not an even number, superadd (it is) an odd number ;” and if so, the opposition
                    is not marked (at least directly) by the word <hi rend="italic">but,</hi> but by
                    the adjectives <hi rend="italic">even</hi> and <hi rend="italic">odd,</hi> which
                    denote attributes in their own nature opposite. It is only when <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">but</hi> has this sense that it answers to <hi rend="italic"
                    >ted</hi> in I-atin, or to <hi rend="italic">mais</hi> in French. In the second
                    line of the quotation from Gawin Douglass’s Fretace the word <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">but</hi> is evidently a contraction of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >be-utan,</hi> and has a sense very different from <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0710-2755-0676" xml:id="pbn7676"/> that of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >dot</hi> in the preceding line. The meaning of the couplet is, “<hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Superadd</hi> (to something said or supposed to be said before)
                    thy worke shall endure in )aude and glorie, <hi rend="smallcaps">be out</hi> (id
                    est, <hi rend="italic">without)</hi> spot or fault.” In the foilowing passage
                    from Donne, the word <hi rend="smallcaps">but,</hi> although written in the same
                    manner, is used in both its meanings: “You must answer that she was brought very
                    near the fire, and as good as thrown in; or else, that she was provoked to it by
                    a divine inspiration. <hi rend="smallcaps">But</hi> that another divine
                    inspiration moved the beholders to believe that she did therein a noble act,
                    this act of her’s might have been calumniated.” That is, “You must answer that
                    she was brought very near the fire,” &amp;c. “Superadd (to that answer) <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">be out</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">without,</hi> for, as will be seen by and by, all those words are
                    of the same import) that another divine inspiration moved,” &amp;c. To these
                    remarks and examples it may be worth while to add, that even now <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">but</hi> is often used by the illiterate Scotch for <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">without</hi>; as nothing is more common than to hear a clown
                    say, “He came from home <hi rend="italic">but</hi> his breakfast.”</p><p>Having
                    mentioned <hi rend="italic">without</hi> as a word of the same import with <hi
                    rend="italic">but</hi> when distinguished from <hi rend="italic">bot,</hi> it
                    may not be improper to consider that word herei for though in modem English it
                    is entirely confined to the office of a preposition, it was formerly used
                    indifferently either as a preposition or a conjunction. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Without,</hi> then, is nothing but the imperative <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >wikthax-utas,</hi> from the Anglo-Saxon and Gothic verb <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >weobthan, withan,</hi> which in the Anglo-Saxon language is incorporated with
                    the verb <hi rend="smallcaps">beon,</hi><hi rend="italic">esse.</hi> According
                    to this derivation, which is Mr Home Tooke's, the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >without,</hi> whether called conjunction or preposition, is the same as <hi
                    rend="italic">be out,</hi> and such will be its import, should it after all be
                    nothing more than a compound of <hi rend="italic">with,</hi> which signifies to
                    join, and sometimes to be, and <hi rend="italic">ute,</hi> out.</p></note> an

                    belong to the subject, and deny the other. But when we say, “the number of the

                    be, and the other not to be, yet the alternative is notwithstanding left
                    indefinite.</p>
                <p>As to adversative disjunctives, it has been already said, after Mr Harris, that
                    they imply <hi rend="italic">opposition</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the
                    truth seems to be, that they only unite in the same sentence words or phrases of
                    opposite meanings. Now it is obvious, that opposite attributes cannot belong to
                    the same subject; as when we say, “Nereus was beautiful,” we cannot <hi
                    rend="italic">superadd</hi> to this sentence that he was ugly; we cannot say,
                    “he was beautiful <hi rend="italic">but</hi> ugly.” When there is opposition, it
                    must be either of the same attribute in different subjects; as when we say,
                    “Brutus was a patriot, <hi rend="italic">but</hi> Caesar was not or of different
                    attributes in the same subject, as when we say, “Georgius was a sophist, <hi
                    rend="italic">but</hi> not a philosopher or of different attributes in different
                    subjects, as when we say, “Plato was a philosopher, <hi rend="italic">but</hi>
                    Hippias was a sophist.” The conjunctions used for all these purposes have been
                    called absolute adversatives, we think improperly, as the opposition is not
                    marked by the conjunctions, but by the words or sentences which they serve to
                    connect. Mr Locke, speaking of the word <hi rend="italic">but,</hi> says, that
                    “it sometimes intimates a stop of the mind, in the course it was going, before
                    it came to the end of it to which Mr Horne Tooke replies with truth, that <hi
                    rend="italic">but</hi> itself is the farthest of any word in the language from
                    intimating a stop. On the contrary, it always intimates something to follow;
                    insomuch that when any man in discourse finishes his words with <hi
                    rend="italic">but,</hi> instead of supposing him to have stopped, we always ask,
                    <hi rend="italic">but</hi> what?</p>
                <p>Besides the adversatives already mentioned, there are two other species, of which
                    the most important are <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >although.</hi> For example, “Troy will be taken, <hi rend="italic">unless</hi>
                    the palladium be preserved; Troy will be taken, <hi rend="italic">although</hi>
                    Hector defend it” The nature of these adversatives may thus be explained. As
                    every event is naturally allied to its cause, so by parity of reason it is
                    opposed to its preventive; and as every cause is either adequate or inadequate
                    (inadequate when it endeavours without being effectuaD, so in like manner is
                    every preventive. Now adequate preventives are expressed by such adversatives as
                    <hi rend="italic">unless:</hi> “Troy will be taken, <hi rend="italic"
                    >unless</hi> the palladium be preserved ;” that is, this alone is sufficient to
                    prevent it. The inadequate are expressed by such adversatives as <hi
                    rend="italic">although:</hi> “Troy will be taken, <hi rend="italic"
                    >although</hi> Hector defend it ;” that is, Hector’s defence will prove
                    ineffectual. These may be called adversatives <hi rend="italic">adequate</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">inadequate.</hi></p>
                <p>Such is the doctrine of Mr Harris, which, although we can discover in it no
                    determinate meaning, we have ventured with others to retail, from respect to our
                    readers, who may be more perspicacious than ourselves. The author was a man of
                    great learning, and the subject, as he has treated it, appears to be intricate.
                    But whatever sense or nonsense there may be in what he says of causes and
                    preventives, adequate and inadequate, we have no hesitation in affirming that he
                    has totally mistaken the import of the words <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">although.</hi> From these being called both preventives, the
                    one adequate and the other inadequate, an unwary reader might be led to infer
                    that they denote the same idea or the same relation; and that the whole
                    difference between them is, that the expression of the one is more forcible than
                    that of the other. Nothing, however, can be further than this from the truth.
                    The meaning of <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> is directly opposite to that of <hi
                    rend="italic">although. Unless</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    again, in “A necessary doctrine and erudition for any Christian man, set ftirthe
                    by the king’s majestie of England,” 1543, “<hi rend="italic">Onlcs</hi> ye

                    multiplying subdivisions there is no end; and systems in which they abound
                    convey for the most part no information. The nature of conjunctions can be
                    thoroughly understood only by tracing each to its original in some parent or
                    cognate tongue; and when that shall be done in other languages with as much
                    success as it has been done by Mr Horne Tooke in English, then, and not till
                    then, may we hope to see a rational, comprehensive, and consistent theory of
                    this part of speech. Then too shall we get rid of all that farrago of useless
                    distinctions into conjunctive, adjunctive, disjunctive, subjunctive, copulative,
                    continuative, subcon-tinuative, positive, suppositive, causal, collective,
                    preventive, adequate and inadequate, adversative, conditional, illative, and the
                    like, which explain nothing, and which serve only to veil ignorance and perplex
                    sagacity.</p>
                <p>That Mr Home Tooke’s principles will apply exactly to the conjunctions of every
                    language both dead and living, is what our limited knowledge of these languages
                    does not authorize us positively to affirm. It is, however, a strong presumption
                    in favour of his opinion, that illiterate savages, the first cultivators of
                    language, are little likely to have sent out their faculties in quest of words
                    to denote the abstract relations subsisting among their ideas, when we have such
                    evidence as his book affords, that the names of the most common substances and
                    qualities could answer that and every other purpose, which in the ordinary
                    intercourse of life can be answered by the faculty of speech. It is a further
                    presumption in his favour, that in the rudest languages there are few if any
                    conjunctions; and that even in others which are the most highly polished, such
                    as Greek and Latin, as well as English, many of those words which have been
                    called conjunctions are obviously resolvable into other parts of speech. Thus
                    αλλα, translated <hi rend="italic">but,</hi> is evidently the neuter gender of
                    either the nominative or accusative plural of αλλoς, <hi rend="italic"
                    >another</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and when used as a conjunction, it
                    intimates that you are going to add something to what you have already said. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cceterum</hi> has the same meaning, and is nothing but xαι
                    irijo&gt;. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mais,</hi><hi rend="italic">but,</hi> in French,
                    is the Latin <hi rend="italic">majus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ut, uti,</hi><hi rend="italic">irι, quod,</hi> is the relative
                    pronoun. Of <hi rend="italic">quocirca,</hi><hi rend="italic">quia,
                    proeterea,</hi><hi rend="italic">antequam,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quεnquam,</hi><hi rend="italic">quemvis, quantumvis, quamlibet,</hi> &amp;c.
                    the resolution is too obvious to require being mentioned. Where such resolutions
                    as these can be made, or when the conjunctions of any particular tongue can be
                    traced to their origin in any other, there needs be no dispute about their true
                    import; but when the case is otherwise, and the conjunction either appears to be
                    an original word, or is derived from a source to which it cannot be traced, we
                    would advise such of our readers as wish to speak or write correctly, to dismiss
                    from their minds all consideration of copulatives, continuatives, causais, and
                    disjunctives, with the rest of that jargon which we have already mentioned; and
                    to inquire diligently in what manner and for what purpose the conjunction in
                    question is used by the best writers, both ancient and modern, of the particular
                    language which they are studying. This will indeed be found a work of labour;
                    but it appears to us to be the only means left of discovering the precise
                    relations which such conjunctions were intended to express; and, by consequence,
                    of knowing what words or sentences they are fitted to connect, so as to produce
                    a style at once accurate and perspicuous.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Of Prepositions.</hi></p>
                <p>By Mr Harris and his followers, a <hi rend="italic">preposition</hi> is defined
                    to be a part of speech devoid itself of signification, but so formed as to unite
                    two words that are significant, and that refuse to coalesce or unite of
                    themselves. We have already expressed our opinion of that theory which holds
                    certain words to be devoid of signification; but its absurdity, in the present
                    instance, is more, than ever glaring. Concerning the number of <hi rend="italic"
                    >prepositions,</hi> it is well known that hitherto authors have never been
                    agreed. The ancient Greek grammarians admitted only eighteen, the ancient Latin
                    grammarians above fifty; though the moderns, Sanctius, Sciopius, Perizonius,
                    Vossius, and Ruddiman, have endeavoured to lessen the number without fixing it.
                    Bishop <pb break="no" facs="nls:193522781" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2781-0678"/>Wilkins
                    thinks that thirty-six are sufficient; and Girard . says that the French
                    language has done the business effectually with thirty-two. But if prepositions
                    be words devoid of signification, why should there be disputes respecting their
                    numbers? or why in any language should there be more than <hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi> preposition, since a single unmeaning mark of connection would
                    certainly answer the purpose as well as a thousand? The cipher, which has no
                    value of itself, and only serves, if we may use the language of grammarians, to
                    connote and consignify, and to change the value of figures, is not several and
                    various, but uniformly one and the same. That “the preposition is so formed as
                    to unite two words which refuse to coalesce or unite of themselves,” is indeed
                    true; and this union it effects, not by having no signification of its own, but
                    by signifying the relation by which the things expressed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">united</hi> words are connected in nature. Prepositions are to be
                    accounted for in much the same manner as the cases of nouns. The necessity of
                    this species of words, or of some equivalent invention, follows from the
                    impossibility of having in language a distinct complex term for each distinct
                    collection of ideas which we may have occasion to put together in discourse. The
                    addition or subtraction of any one idea to or from a collection of ideas, makes
                    it a different collection; and if, after either of these operations, it were to
                    be expressed by the same word as before, nothing could ensue but
                    misrepresentation and falsehood. Now, to use in language a different and
                    distinct complex term for each different and distinct collection of ideas, is
                    equally impossible as to use a distinct particular term for each particular and
                    individual idea. To supply, therefore, the place of the complex terms which are
                    wanting in a language, are the cases of nouns and prepositions employed; by the
                    aid of which, complex and general terms are prevented from being infinite or too
                    numerous, and are used .only for those collections of ideas which we have most
                    frequent occasion to mention in discourse. By means of prepositions this end is
                    obtained in the most simple manner. For, having occasion to mention a collection
                    of ideas, for which there is no single complex term in the language, we either
                    take that complex term which includes the greatest number, though not all, of
                    the ideas we would communicate; or else we take that complex term which includes
                    all and the fewest ideas more than those we would communicate; and then, by the
                    help of the preposition, we either make up the deficiency in the one case, or
                    retrench the superfluity in the other. For instance, having occasion to mention
                    a house of a particular description, and knowing that the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >house</hi> is too general for our purpose, and that the building we have in
                    view has no appropriate name, we say, perhaps, “a house <hi rend="italic"
                    >with</hi> a partywall,” or a “house <hi rend="italic">without</hi> a roof.” In
                    the first instance, the complex term <hi rend="italic">house</hi> is deficient,
                    and the preposition directs to add what is wanting; in the second instance, the
                    complex term is redundant, as it denotes a complete house. The preposition,
                    therefore, directs to take away what is superfluous.</p>
                <p>Now, considering prepositions in this the most simple light, as serving only to
                    limit or modify general terms, it is absolutely necessary that they should have
                    meanings of their own; for otherwise, how could we, in the instance before us,
                    make known by them our intention, whether of adding to, or retrenching from, the
                    same general term <hi rend="italic">house.</hi> If, to a disciple of Mr Harris,
                    we should say, <hi rend="italic">a house</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">join</hi>; he
                    would reply <hi rend="italic">join what ĩ</hi> But he would not contend that <hi
                    rend="italic">join</hi> is an indeclinable word which has no meaning of its own,
                    because he knows that it is the imperative of a verb, of which the other parts
                    are still in use; and its own meaning is clear, though the sentence is not
                    completed. If, instead of <hi rend="italic">join,</hi> we should say to him, <hi
                    rend="italic">a house</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">with,</hi> he would still ask the
                    same question, <hi rend="italic">with what ĩ</hi> But if we were to discourse
                    with him concerning the word <hi rend="italic">with,</hi> he would probably tell
                    us that <hi rend="italic">with</hi> is a preposition, an indeclinable word,
                    which is itself devoid of signification, but so formed as to unite two words
                    that are significant. And yet it would be evident by his question, that he felt
                    it had a meaning of its own; which is in reality the same as <hi rend="italic"
                    >join.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> This
                    account of prepositions is taken from Mr Horne Tooke, who adds, that the only
                    difference between the two words r»iM and <hi rend="italic">join,</hi> is, that
                    the other parts of the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon verb <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >withan,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Io</hi><hi rend="italic">join</hi> (of
                    which <hi rend="italic">with</hi> is the imperative), have ceased to be employed
                    in the language. As <hi rend="smallcaps">with</hi> means join, so the
                    corresponding French preposition <hi rend="italic">avec</hi> means, <hi
                    rend="italic">and have that,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">have that alto.</hi> But
                    though <hi rend="italic">with,</hi> as the im∣&gt;erative of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">withak,</hi> means join, it has sometimes a very different
                    signification. Mr Tyrwhit in his <hi rend="subscript"> -</hi> Gloa-sary has
                    truly observed, that <hi rend="italic">with</hi> and <hi rend="italic">by</hi>
                    are often synonymous. They certainly are so; but then <hi rend="italic"
                    >with</hi> seems to be an abbreviation of the imperative of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >wyhthax,</hi><hi rend="italic">to be;</hi> as <hi rend="italic">without</hi> is
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">wvrthan-utan,</hi><hi rend="italic">to be out.</hi> This
                    being the case, our two instances in the text will stand thus: <hi rend="italic"
                    >a house</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">join</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    party-wall</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">a house</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">be-out</hi><hi rend="italic">a roof.</hi> Nor let any one be
                    surprised that we make no difference between the conjunction <hi rend="italic"
                    >without</hi> and the preposition <hi rend="italic">without.</hi> The word is
                    the same, whether it be employed to unite words or sentences. Prepositions were
                    originally, and for a long time, classed with conjunctions; and when first
                    separated from them, they were only distinguished by the name’of prepositive
                    conjunctions. They are generally used to unite words, but not always; for we may
                    say indifferently, “ï came after <hi rend="italic">his departure,”</hi> or “I
                    came after <hi rend="italic">he departed^'</hi> By the greater part of
                    grammarians indeed, <hi rend="italic">after,</hi> when employed’as in the first
                    sentence, is classed with the prepositions; when employed as in the second, it
                    is classed with the conjunctions. The word, however, is the same in both
                    sentences; its meaning is the same, and its effect precisely the same. The only
                    circumstance of discrimination is, that in the first example it is prefixed to a
                    noun, “his departure ;” in the second, it is prefixed to a nominative and a
                    verb, “he departed.” But even the nominative and the verb, thus applied, express
                    no more than a specifying circumstance annexed to the other proposition, “J came
                    ;” and whenever they are rightly apprehended by the mind, they are stripped of
                    their prepositionary form, and considered abstractedly under a new phasis, “his
                    departure.” Thus then the two sentences are synonymous in every respect,
                    excepting the apparent giammatical nature of the words “his departure,” and “he
                    departed ;” and even these are reduced to one grammatical form in the mind,
                    whenever the import of the propositions is rightly apprehended. <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ithout,</hi> and many other prepositions, especially in the learned languages,
                    are used exactly as <hi rend="italic">after</hi> is used in the two instances
                    which we have given. Mr Horne Tooke quotes Lord Mansfield for saying, “It cannot
                    be read <hi rend="italic">without</hi> the attorney-general consents to it."
                    This, in modern English, is net the common phraseology; but it offends not
                    against any principle of grammar. The nominative and the verb are here, as in
                    the former instance, considered as an abs¢ract noun. "It cannot be read <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">without</hi> the consent of the attorney-general.”</p></note>
                    Indeed, so far has always been plainly perceived, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >with</hi> and <hi rend="italic">without</hi> are directly opposite and
                    contradictory; and it would puzzle the most acute philosopher to discover
                    opposition and contradiction in two words where neither of them had any
                    signification. Wilkins, therefore, has well expressed their meaning, where he
                    says, that <hi rend="italic">with</hi> is a preposition “relating to the notion
                    of social, or circumstance of society <hi rend="italic">affirmed;</hi> and that
                    <hi rend="italic">without</hi> is a preposition relating to the same notion of
                    social, or circumstance of society <hi rend="italic">denied.”</hi></p>
                <p>But to denote the relations of adding and taking away, is not the only purpose
                    for which prepositions are employed. They all indeed serve to modify some
                    general term or general affirmation, but not precisely in the same way as <hi
                    rend="italic">with</hi> and <hi rend="italic">without.</hi> It has already been
                    observed, that words significant of those things which coincide in nature,
                    coalesce with one another in syntax, without being beholden to any auxiliary
                    tie. For instance, an adjective coalesces with its substantive, a verb with its
                    nominative; a noun expressing an object acted upon, with a verb denoting<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193522794" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2794-0679"/> action; and an
                    adverb with its verb. Take the following example: “<hi rend="italic">The
                    splendid sun genially warmeth the fertile earth"</hi> But suppose we were
                    desirous to modify this affirmation by the addition of other substantives, <hi
                    rend="italic">air,</hi> for instance, and <hi rend="italic">beams</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> how would these coincide with the other words of the
                    sentence, or under what character could they be introduced? Not as nominatives
                    or accusatives to the verb, for both these places are already filled; the
                    nominative by the substance <hi rend="italic">sun,</hi> which is certainly the
                    agent in this operation; the accusative by the substance <hi rend="italic"
                    >earth,</hi> which is as certainly the object acted upon. Not as qualities of
                    the <hi rend="italic">sun</hi> and <hi rend="italic">earth;</hi> for qualities
                    inhering in ⅛eir substances can only be expressed by adjectives, and the words
                    air and beams are both substantives. Here then we must have recourse to
                    prepositions; but we can employ only such prepositions as point out the
                    relations which the <hi rend="italic">air</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >beams</hi> have to the sun warming the earth. In English we should say, “the
                    splendid sun <hi rend="italic">with</hi> his beams genially warmeth <hi
                    rend="italic">through</hi> the air the fertile earth.” The sentence, as before,
                    remains entire and one; the substantives required are both introduced; and not a
                    word which was there before is detruded from its proper place. The import of <hi
                    rend="italic">with</hi> we have already discovered; it directs to <hi
                    rend="italic">unite</hi> the beams to the sun, as <hi rend="italic">jointly</hi>
                    with him performing the operation. But the <hi rend="italic">air</hi> has no
                    other connection with this operation, than as the <hi rend="italic">medium</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">passage</hi> between the <hi rend="italic">sun</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">earth</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and therefore the
                    preposition <hi rend="italic">through<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Thorough, thourough, thorow, through,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">thro',</hi> is no other, says Mr Horne Tooke, than the
                    Gothic substantive <hi rend="smallcaps">dauro,</hi> or the Teutonic substantive
                    τπuκυu, and, like them, means <hi rend="italic">door, gate, postage.</hi> S0
                    that the sentence in the text, resolved upon his principles, stands thus: “The
                    splendid sun— <hi rend="italic">-Join</hi> his beams—genially wanneth— <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">passage</hi><hi rend="italic">the air</hi> (or, the air being
                    the∕&gt;&lt;wagv or <hi rend="italic">medium)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the
                    fertile earth.” And in the same manner may we translate the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">through</hi> in every instance where <hi rend="italic"
                    >through</hi> is used in English, or its equivalent preposition in any language;
                    as from the Latin and Italian word <hi rend="italic">porta,</hi> in Spanish <hi
                    rend="italic">puerta,</hi> and in French <hi rend="italic">porte,</hi> have come
                    the Latin and Italian preposition <hi rend="italic">per,</hi> the French <hi
                    rend="italic">par,</hi> and the Spanish <hi rend="italic"
                    >por.</hi></p></note></hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript">
                    1</hi> must denote that relation which subsists between an object in motion and
                    the medium in which it moves; nor could a preposition of a different import have
                    been employed, without altering tire meaning of the whole sentence.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>If, for instance, we were to
                    substitute <hi rend="italic">with or</hi> of instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >through,</hi> we should in the one case alter the meaning, and in the other
                    speak nonsense. “The sun warmeth <hi rend="italic">with</hi> the air the fertile
                    earth,” is an affirmation that “the sun warmeth <hi rend="italic">both the air
                    and the earth</hi> whereas the original sentence affirmed nothing more than that
                    “he warmeth the <hi rend="italic">earth."</hi> “The sun warmeth of the air the
                    fertile earth,” is nonsense, as it makes the earth a <hi rend="italic"
                    >part,</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">consequence,</hi> of the air. So necessary is
                    it that prepositions have a meaning, and that the meaning of each be attended
                    to.</p></note></p>
                <p>Mr Harris is of opinion that most, if not all, prepositions were originally
                    formed to denote the relations of <hi rend="italic">place.</hi> For this opinion
                    we see not sufficient evidence. If indeed we could suppose the inventors or
                    earliest improvers of language to have at all concerned themselves with
                    relations as abstracted from the objects related, we must believe that those
                    which first attracted their attention were the relations subsisting among
                    themselves, and the various bodies with which they were surrounded. We must
                    likewise agree with our author, that place is the grand relation which bodies or
                    natural substances maintain at all times to one another; but we do not therefore
                    think that it would attract the earliest notice of untaught barbarians. On the
                    contrary, we are of opinion that mankind must have made very considerable
                    progress in science before they attempted to abstract place from body; an
                    attempt which, according to some of the most profound philosophers,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bishops Berkeley and Law,

                    But whatever be in this, the relations of cause and effect, of duration and
                    motion, are in themselves as obvious, and as likely to arrest the attention and
                    obtain names, as those of place. Amongst men totally illiterate they are
                    evidently more so; for pain and pleasure would suggest some idea of cause and
                    effect as matters of importance. There is, however, no probability that the
                    inventors of any language had the least idea of abstract relations. They
                    doubtless expressed complex conceptions by nouns and verbs, significant at once
                    of the particular ideas and of the various relations by which they viewed those
                    ideas as combined together in a complex conception. Afterwards, when men’s minds
                    became enlarged, and when, from the fluctuation inseparable from a living
                    language, objects or ideas received new names, the old words, whether nouns or
                    verbs, which were originally employed to express a particular complex
                    conception, of which certain particular <hi rend="italic">relations</hi> made a
                    part, might be retained for the purpose of denoting those and all similar <hi
                    rend="italic">relations</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and thus verbs and nouns
                    would degenerate into particles bearing the names of prepositions and
                    conjunctions. For instance, one Anglo-Saxon being desirous to communicate to
                    another his own conception of a house with a party-wall, and having, we shall
                    suppose, no such word in his tongue as a preposition, would naturally utter the
                    word <hi rend="italic">house,</hi> desiring his friend, at the same time, to add
                    to that well-known sound another sound (uttering it) significant of the
                    particular circumstance wanting to complete his complex conception, viz. a house
                    <hi rend="italic">with</hi> (that <hi rend="italic">is join)</hi> a party-wall.
                    The word <hi rend="italic">with,</hi> as the imperative of a verb, denotes of
                    course three ideas combined together, namely, a command or wish, an affirmation,
                    and the idea of junction. But when the verb <hi rend="italic">withan</hi> was
                    dismissed from the English language, the imperative <hi rend="italic">with</hi>
                    was still retained; but losing its verbal and modal nature, it was thenceforth
                    employed to denote only one of the three ideas for which it originally stood,
                    viz. the idea of junction. And thus it is that verbs, and also nouns and
                    adjectives, in passing from one language to another, may become
                    prepositions<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As the
                    Italian substantive <hi rend="italic">casa,</hi> a house, race, family, nation,
                    &amp;c. in passing to the French, becomes the preposition <hi rend="italic"
                    >chez,</hi> to which there is not, so far as we know, a preposition of precisely
                    the same import in any language. <hi rend="italic">Sensa</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">sense,</hi> in Italian, becomes <hi rend="italic">sans</hi> in
                    French, and means <hi rend="italic">absence.</hi> Nor is it necessary that verbs
                    and nouns should always pass from one language to another, in order to be
                    converted into prepositions. The Greek preposition <hi rend="italic">χi{</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> is evidently the corrupted imperative of <hi rend="italic"
                    >χuζ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">ζm, to sever, to
                    disjoin, to separate.</hi> The Latin <hi rend="italic">sine</hi> is <hi

                    The German <hi rend="italic">sonder</hi> is the imperative of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sondern,</hi> which has the same meaning as <hi rend="italic">χu</hi><hi

                    >&gt;.</hi></p></note> and conjunctions. Thus too it is that some of those
                    prepositions come to denote the contiguous, and some the detached, relation of
                    body. The contiguous, as when we say, “Caius walked <hi rend="italic">with</hi>
                    a staff that is, “Caius <hi rend="italic">join</hi> a staff, walked “the statue

                    a just account of the origin of these words, the sentences in the text, where
                    <hi rend="italic">upon, over,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">above,</hi> occur, will
                    run thus: “The statue stood <hi rend="italic">on high</hi> a pedestal “the river

                    high</hi> the hills.” And here we may observe, that the mere relation between
                    standing, running, &amp;c. and place, is rather inferred from the verb itself,
                    than expressed by a separate word. The reason is obvious. For if a statue stand,
                    every one knows that it must stand on some thing as well as at some time. There
                    is therefore no necessity, whatever elegance there may be in it, for employing
                    any word to denote that relation, which is commonly believed to be signified by
                    on; but it is <pb corresp="kp-eb0710-2807-0680" xml:id="pbn7680"/>necessary to
                    insert, between the verb and pedestal, a word significant of place, that
                    pedestal may not be mistaken, by an ignorant person, for a portion of time, or
                    any thing else connected with the standing of the statue.</p></note> a pedestal

                    >higher part</hi> of a sand.” The detached relation, as when we say, “He is
                    going to<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>That <hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi> is significant of detached relation, is the language of Mr
                    Harris, which, though it may be allowed in a loose and vulgar sense, is
                    certainly not philosophically just. The preposition <hi rend="italic">to,</hi>
                    in Dutch written <hi rend="italic">toe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tot,</hi> is
                    the Gothic substantive <hi rend="smallcaps">taui</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >tauhts,</hi> signifying <hi rend="italic">act, effect, result,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">consummation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which Gothic substantive
                    is itself no other than the past participle <hi rend="smallcaps">tauid</hi> or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">tauids</hi> of the verb <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >taujan,</hi><hi rend="italic">agere.</hi> And it is obvious that what is done
                    is terminated, ended, finished. In the Teutonic this verb is written TUAN or
                    ruox; whence the modern German <hi rend="smallcaps">thun,</hi> and its
                    preposition <hi rend="italic">tu.</hi> In the Anglo-Saxon, the verb is <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">teooax,</hi> and the preposition <hi rend="italic">to. Do,</hi>
                    the auxiliary verb, as it has been called, is derived from the same root, and is
                    indeed the same word as <hi rend="italic">to.</hi> The difference between a τ
                    and a <hi rend="smallcaps">d</hi> is so very small, that an etymologist knows by
                    the practice of languages, and an anatomist by the reason of that practice, that
                    in the derivation of words it is scarcely worth regarding. To support this
                    etymon of <hi rend="italic">to,</hi> Mr Horne Tooke gives a similar instance in
                    the Latin tongue. The preposition <hi rend="italic">ad,</hi> he says, is merely
                    the past participle of <hi rend="italic">agere,</hi> which past participle is
                    likewise employed as a Latin substantive. He exhibits the derivation of <hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi> thus:</p><table cols="4" rows="3">

                    </table><p>The most superficial reader of Latin verse, he observes, knows how
                    readily the Romans dropped their final <hi rend="italic">urn.</hi> And a little
                    consideration of the organs and practice of speech will convince him how easily
                    i¾ŗd or <hi rend="italic">act</hi> would become <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">at</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as indeed this preposition was
                    indifferently written either way by the ancients. By the later writers of Rome,
                    the preposition was written <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> with <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> only, in order to distinguish it from the other corrupt word called the
                    conjunction <hi rend="italic">at</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> which for the same
                    reason was written with the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> only, though that likewise
                    had anciently been written, as the preposition, either <hi rend="italic">ad</hi>
                    or at. The preposition <hi rend="italic">to</hi> and the conjunction too in
                    English, are both in syntax and in meaning used exactly as the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi> and the conjunction <hi rend="italic">at</hi> in Latin.
                    From the specimens prefixed to Johnson’s Dictionary, as a history of our
                    language, it appears that, as late as the reign of Elizabeth, the preposition
                    and conjunction were both written with one <hi rend="italic">o.</hi> And it has
                    been shown in the first volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society of
                    Edinburgh, that <hi rend="italic">to</hi> and <hi rend="italic">too,</hi> as
                    well as <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">at,</hi> are precisely
                    of the same import. The only difference, in either language, between the
                    preposition and the conjunction, is, that the former directs, as a modification
                    of some previous proposition, the addition of some substantive or noun; the
                    latter, sometimes a sentence or clause of a sentence considered abstractedly as
                    a noun; and that, when the former is used, the preposition to which the
                    modifying circumstance is to be added, is formally expressed, but omitted when
                    the latter is employed. Thus Denham says,</p><lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">Wisdom he has, and <hi rend="italic">to</hi> his wisdom courage;</l>
                    <l part="N">Temper <hi rend="italic">to</hi> that, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >unto</hi> all success.</l>
                    </lg><p>In this example, every succeeding circumstance is by the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">to</hi> marked as an addition to the preceding. “Wisdom he has,
                    and courage <hi rend="italic">additional</hi> to his wisdom.” But Denham might
                    with equal propriety have omitted the object which <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    governs, or to which it directs something to be <hi rend="italic">added,</hi>
                    though he must then, from the custom of the language, have employed the
                    conjunction instead of the preposition. As,</p><l part="N">Wisdom he has, and
                    courage, <hi rend="italic">too.</hi></l><p>That this mode of expression would
                    have been more concise than, and as intelligible as, the other, “wisdom he has,
                    and courage <hi rend="italic">to</hi> bis wisdom,” must be evident to every
                    one.</p><p>Not only is the object governed by <hi rend="italic">to</hi> omitted,
                    when it is represented by a substantive in the context, but also when it is
                    involved in a preposition; and then the conjunction, as it is caUed, is always
                    used. Thus,</p><lg part="N">
                    <l part="N">Let those eyes that view</l>
                    <l part="N">The daring crime, behold the vengeance <hi rend="italic"
                        >too.</hi></l>
                    </lg><p>So, “He made him prisoner, and killed him <hi rend="italic">too."</hi>
                    In the one example, the circumstance of beholding the vengeance is stated as an
                    <hi rend="italic">addition</hi> to the viewing of the crime; and in the other,
                    the <hi rend="italic">killing him</hi> is stated as an <hi rend="italic"
                    >addition</hi> to the making him a prisoner. In both examples, the object
                    governed by <hi rend="italic">too</hi> is the amount of the preceding
                    proposition taken abstractedly as a noun or substantive. Thus then it appears,
                    that <hi rend="italic">to</hi> and <hi rend="italic">too,</hi> though classed
                    the one with the prepositions, and the other with the conjunctions, are really
                    one and the same word. The same is true of <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">at.</hi> Thus, “<hi rend="smallcaps">Ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hoc,</hi> promissa barba et capilli efferaverant speciem oris,” signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Additional to this,</hi> his long beard
                    and hair had given a wildness to his aspect.” But when the object governed by
                    <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> is not formally stated, <hi rend="italic">ad</hi>
                    itself is classed with the conjunctions, and written differently, <hi
                    rend="italic">at.</hi> Thus Terence, “<hi rend="italic">Ph.</hi> Fac ita ut
                    jussi, deducantur isti. <hi rend="italic">Pa.</hi> Faciam. <hi rend="italic">Ph.
                    At</hi> diligenter. <hi rend="italic">Pa.</hi> Fiet. <hi rend="italic">Ph.
                    At</hi> mature.” By the means of <hi rend="italic">at,</hi> the circumstances of
                    <hi rend="italic">diligence</hi> and <hi rend="italic">haste</hi> are <hi
                    rend="italic">superadded</hi> to the action commanded. <hi rend="italic"
                    >“</hi><hi rend="italic">Ph.</hi> It is not enough that you do it; you must do
                    it carefully <hi rend="italic">too. Pa.</hi> well, it shall be carefuUy done.
                    <hi rend="italic">Ph.</hi> In good time too.” <hi rend="italic">At,</hi> taken
                    in this sense, is most commonly employed, like the English <hi rend="italic"
                    >but,</hi> to mark the unexpected union of incongruous objects; as, “Aulam
                    tyranni frequentabat, <hi rend="italic">at</hi> patriam amabat literally, “He
                    frequented the court of the tyrant; joined <hi rend="italic">even to</hi> that
                    he loved his country.” “He was a courtier and a patriot <hi rend="italic"
                    >too."</hi> But if <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">at</hi> in
                    Latin, and <hi rend="italic">to</hi> and <hi rend="italic">too</hi> in English,
                    be derived from verbs which signify <hi rend="italic">to do or act,</hi> it may
                    be asked how they come themselves to denote <hi rend="italic">addition.</hi> The
                    answer is obvious. If a man should utter a sentence, and to the end of it
                    subjoin the very general word <hi rend="italic">do,</hi> the person to whom he
                    spoke would naturally ask, <hi rend="italic">do</hi> what? and this question
                    would, of course, produce an additional sentence or clause of a sentence.
                    Besides, it is to be observed, that <hi rend="italic">agere,</hi> from which the
                    Latin preposition is derived, as well as the Gothic verb, which is the source of
                    the English particles, means not only <hi rend="italic">to do,</hi> but also to
                    adduce or bring; so that when we say, “he is going <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    Italy,” we do nothing more than affirm that “he is going,” and desire the person
                    to whom we speak, “to <hi rend="italic">add</hi> Italy to the
                    journey.”</p><p>From this derivation of the preposition <hi rend="italic"
                    >to,</hi> it will be seen at once upon what principle it is employed to mark the
                    infinitive mode-In the learned languages that mode is generally known by its
                    termination; but in English it would be impossible, without the aid pf <hi
                    rend="italic">to,</hi> or of some other word significant of action, to
                    distinguish the verb <hi rend="italic">love</hi> from the noun or
                    substantive.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> Italy,” that is, “He is
                    going, <hi rend="italic">the end</hi> (of his journey) Italy “the sun is risen
                    <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the hills,” that is, “the sun is risen (the place)
                    <hi rend="italic">the top</hi> of the hills ·” “these figs <hi rend="italic"
                    >came from</hi> Turkey,” that is “these figs came <hi rend="italic"
                    >beginning</hi> (their journey at) Turkey.”</p>
                <p>Besides the detached relation of body, Mr Harris is of opinion that the
                    preposition <hi rend="italic">from</hi> denotes two other relations not less
                    different than those of motion and rest. Thus, if we say, “That lamp hangs <hi
                    rend="italic">from</hi> the ceiling,” the preposition <hi rend="italic"
                    >from</hi> assumes a character of quiescence. But if we say, “That lamp is
                    falling <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the ceiling,” the preposition in such case
                    assumes a character of motion. But this is evidently a mistake. The detached
                    relation in the former instance of the <hi rend="italic">figs,</hi> as well as
                    the motion and rest in the present instances, are expressed not by the
                    preposition, but by the verbs, <hi rend="italic">came,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fallt,</hi><hi rend="italic">hangs.</hi> The word <hi rend="italic">from</hi>
                    has as clear, as precise, and at all times as uniform and unequivocal a meaning,
                    as any word in the language. <hi rend="italic">From</hi> means merely <hi
                    rend="italic">beginning,</hi> and nothing else. It is simply the Anglo-Saxon and
                    Gothic noun <hi rend="smallcaps">frum,</hi><hi rend="italic">beginning, origin,
                    source, fountain, author.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This derivation is Mr Horne Tooke’s; and he supports it by the following
                    sentence: <hi rend="italic">Ne</hi><hi rend="italic">rxdd ge se the on frumman
                    worhte, he worhte wapman and wiſmcn;</hi> which is the Anglo-Saxon of St

                    Harris’s instances, <hi rend="italic">from</hi> will speak clearly for itself,
                    without the assistance of the interpreting verbs, which are supposed by him to
                    <hi rend="italic">vary its character.</hi></p>

                    impossible; and therefore nothing can be more natural or more simple than to add
                    the signs of those ideas, viz. the word <hi rend="italic">beginning,</hi> which
                    will remain always the same, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">name</hi> of <hi

                <p>It has been said by no less a man than Bishop Wilkins, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >from</hi> refers primarily to place, and secondarily to time. But the truth is,
                    that <hi rend="italic">from</hi> relates to every thing to which <hi
                    rend="italic">beginning</hi> relates, and to nothing else.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">From</hi> mom till night the eternal larum rang.</p>
                <p>That is, the “larum rang <hi rend="italic">beginning</hi> morning,” or morning
                    being the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> of its <hi rend="italic">beginning,</hi>
                    till night.</p>
                <p>As <hi rend="italic">from</hi> always denotes beginning, so <hi rend="italic"
                    >to</hi> and <hi rend="italic">till</hi> always denote the end. There is,
                    however, this difference between them, that <hi rend="italic">to</hi> denotes
                    the end of any thing; <hi rend="italic">till</hi> the end only of time. We may
                    say indifferently, “From mom <hi rend="italic">to</hi> night,” or “from morn <hi
                    rend="italic">till</hi> night, the eternal larum tang but we cannot say, “These
                    figs came from Turkey <hi rend="italic">till</hi> England.” That <hi
                    rend="italic">till</hi> can, with propriety, be opposed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >from</hi> only when we are talking of time, is evident; for it is a word
                    compounded of <hi rend="italic">to</hi> and <hi rend="italic">while,</hi> that
                    is, time. And as the coalescence of these two words <hi rend="italic"
                    >to-whiĭe</hi> took place in the language long before the present superfluous
                    use of the article <hi rend="italic">the,</hi> the phrase, “From morn <hi
                    rend="italic">till</hi> night” is neither more nor less than “From morn <hi
                    rend="italic">to time</hi> night.” When we say, “from morn <hi rend="italic"
                    >to</hi> night,” the word <hi rend="italic">time</hi> is omitted as
                    unnecessary.</p>
                <p>Besides <hi rend="italic">from,</hi> Mr Harris mentions <hi rend="italic"
                    >over</hi> as significant sometimes of motion and sometimes of rest; and quotes
                    as instances the two following passages from Milton:</p>
                <p>To support uneasy steps <hi rend="italic">Over</hi> the burning marl.</p>
                <p>Here, says he, <hi rend="italic">over</hi> denotes <hi rend="italic">motion.</hi>
                    Again,</p>
                <p>» He with looks of cordial love</p>
                <p>Hung <hi rend="italic">over</hi> her enamoured.</p>
                <p>Here <hi rend="italic">over</hi> denotes rest. But the truth is, that <hi
                    rend="italic">over</hi> denotes neither motion nor rest in either of these
                    passages. In the first quotation, indeed, <hi rend="italic">motion</hi> is
                    implied; but it is implied in the word <hi rend="italic">steps,</hi> and not in
                    <hi rend="italic">over,</hi> which denotes only that the place of the steps was
                    the top of the burning marl. In the second quotation, rest is implied, and that
                    too a particular <hi rend="italic">species</hi> of rest; but it is implied, or
                    rather expressed, by the verb <hi rend="italic">hung,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >over</hi> denotes the place of that species of rest.</p>
                <p>But though the original use of prepositions was to denote the relations of body,
                    they could not be confined to this office only. They by degrees extended
                    themselves to subjects incorporeal, and came to denote relations, as well
                    intellectual as local. Thus, because in point of place he who is above has
                    commonly the advantage of him who is below; hence we transfer <hi rend="italic"
                    >over</hi> and <hi rend="italic">under<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Under</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >beneath</hi>, though by the sound they seem to have little connection, are yet
                    in fact almost the same word, and may very well supply each other’s place. <hi
                    rend="italic">Under</hi> is nothing but <hi rend="italic">on-neder,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">beneath</hi> is compounded of the imperative <hi rend="italic"
                    >be</hi> and the noun <hi rend="italic">ncath.</hi><hi rend="italic">Neath</hi>
                    uncompounded having slipped away from our language, would perhaps be
                    unintelligible, had not the nouns <hi rend="italic">nether</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">nethermost</hi> still continued in common use. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> Neałh</hi>, Anglo-Saxon, <hi rend="italic">ncothan,
                    ncothe</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Dutch, <hi rend="italic">neden</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> Danish, <hi rend="italic">ned</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    German, <hi rend="italic">niedre</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Swedish, <hi
                    rend="italic">nedre</hi> and <hi rend="italic">neder;</hi> is undoubtedly as
                    much a substantive, and has the same meaning, as the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >nadir.</hi> In common language it denotes the bottom.</p></note></hi> to
                    dominion and obedience. Of a king we say, ’ ∙ lie ruled <hi rend="italic"
                    >over</hi> his people and of a soldier, “he served <hi rend="italic">under</hi>
                    his general.” So too we say, <hi rend="italic">with</hi> thought; <hi
                    rend="italic">without</hi> attention; thinking <hi rend="italic">over</hi> a
                    subject; <hi rend="italic">under</hi> anxiety; <hi rend="italic">from</hi> fear;
                    <hi rend="italic">through</hi> jealousy, and the like. All which instances, with
                    many others of a similar kind, show that the first words of men, like their
                    first ideas, had an immediate reference to sensible objects; and that in after
                    days, when they began to discern with their intellect, they took those words
                    which they found already made, and transferred them by metaphor to intellectual
                    conceptions.</p>
                <p>Amongst the relations which may be considered rather as intellectual than
                    corporeal, are those of cause and consequence; and for the denoting of these we
                    have two prepositions, which sometimes <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> in direct
                    opposition to one another, and at other times may exchange places without injury
                    to the sense.</p>
                <p>“Well! ’ tis e’en so! I have the London disease they call love. I am sick of my
                    husband, and <hi rend="italic">for</hi> my gallant.” (Wycherley’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Country Wife.)</hi></p>
                <p>Here of and <hi rend="italic">for</hi> seem almost placed in opposition; at least
                    their effects in the sentence appear to be very different; for, by the help of
                    these two prepositions alone, and without the assistance of any other words, she
                    expresses the two contrary affections of loathing and desire. The truth,
                    however, is, that the author, if it had pleased him, might have used of where he
                    has employed <hi rend="smallcaps">for,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">for</hi>
                    where he has put <hi rend="italic">of.</hi> This is evident from the following
                    quotation from the <hi rend="italic">Sad Shepherd:</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Marian.</hi> Come, Amie, you’ll go with us.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Amie.</hi> I am not well.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lionel.</hi> She’s sick of the young shepherd that bekist
                    her.</p>
                <p>In the same manner we may, with equal propriety, say, “We are sick of hunger ;”
                    or, “We are sick <hi rend="italic">for</hi> hunger.” And in both cases we shall
                    have expressed precisely the same thing, with only this difference, that, in the
                    former sentence, we declare sickness to be a <hi rend="italic"
                    >consequence</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in the latter we declare hunger to be
                    a <hi rend="italic">cause.</hi> But to return to the Country Wife, that poor
                    lady seems to have had a complication of distempers; she had at least two
                    disorders; a sickness <hi rend="italic">of loathing,</hi> and a sickness <hi
                    rend="italic">of love.</hi> She was sick <hi rend="italic">for</hi> disgust, and
                    sick <hi rend="italic">for</hi> love. She was</p>
                <p>Sick of disgust <hi rend="italic">for</hi> her husband.</p>
                <p>Sick of love <hi rend="italic">for</hi> her gallant. Sick <hi rend="italic"
                    >for</hi> disgust of her husband. Sick <hi rend="italic">for</hi> love of her
                    gallant.</p>
                <p>In the first sentence, as thus stated, sickness is declared to be the <hi
                    rend="italic">consequence</hi> of disgust, of which her husband is declared to
                    be the <hi rend="italic">cause.</hi> In the second, sickness is declared to be
                    the <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> of love, of which her gallant is declared
                    to be the <hi rend="italic">cause.</hi> In the third sentence, disgust is
                    declared to be the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of her sickness, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">consequence</hi> or <hi rend="italic">offspring</hi> of her
                    husband. In the fourth, love is declared to be the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi>
                    of her sickness, and the <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >offspring</hi> of her gallant.</p>

                <p>Thus, then, it appears, that though the first two of these sentences, taken
                    entire, convey the very same meaning with the last two, yet the import of the
                    preposition <hi rend="italic">for</hi> is as different from that of <hi
                    rend="italic">of,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> is from <hi rend="italic"
                    >consequence.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Junius derives <hi rend="italic">for</hi> from the Greek «;·; Skinner from
                    the Latin <hi rend="italic">pro</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but I believe, says
                    Mr Horne Tooke, that it is no other than the Gothic substantive <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">fairina,</hi><hi rend="italic">caute.</hi> He imagines also
                    that <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> in the Gothic and Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic"
                    >of,</hi> is a fragment of the Gothic and Saxon words <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >λfλrλ</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">afora,</hi><hi rend="italic">poiteritaι,
                    prolcι.</hi> In a word, he considers <hi rend="italic">for</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">of as</hi> nouns or substantives; the former always meaning <hi
                    rend="italic">caute,</hi> the latter always meaning <hi rend="italic"
                    >contequence, offspring, tuccetior, follower,</hi> &amp;c. If this account of
                    these words be just, and we have no doubt of it, the prepositions <hi
                    rend="italic">for</hi> and of are in syntax to be considered as nouns in
                    apposition with other nouns, or with sentences taken abstractedly as
                    nouns.</p></note> When two words or sentences are linked together by the former
                    of these prepositions, the object expressed by the last word or sentence is
                    declared to be the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of that which is expressed by
                    the preceding; when two words or sentences are linked together by the latter
                    preposition, the object expressed by the first word or sentence is declared to
                    be the <hi rend="italic">consequence of,</hi> or to <hi rend="italic">proceed
                    from,</hi> the object expressed by the second. It is therefore a matter of
                    perfect indifference to the sense whether we say “sickness of hunger,” or
                    “sickness <hi rend="italic">for</hi> hunger “the man, of he speaks little, is
                    wise,” or “the man is wise, <hi rend="italic">for</hi> he speaks little.” By
                    means of the preposition <hi rend="italic">of,</hi> we declare sickness to be
                    the <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> proceeding from hunger, and wisdom to be
                    the <hi rend="italic">consequence</hi> we infer from the man’s speaking little;
                    by means <hi rend="italic">of for,</hi> we declare hunger to be the <hi
                    rend="italic">cause</hi> of sickness, and the circumstance of speaking little to
                    be the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> from which we infer the man’s wisdom. In the
                    one sentence, of is to be considered as a noun in apposition to <hi
                    rend="italic">sickness</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in the other, as a noun in
                    apposition to <hi rend="italic">the man. is wise</hi> taken abstractedly as a
                    noun. In the one sentence∕or (id est, <hi rend="italic">cause)</hi> is to be
                    considered as a noun in apposition to <hi rend="italic">hunger</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> in the other, as the same noun in apposition to <hi
                    rend="italic">he speaks little</hi> taken abstractedly as a noun.</p>
                <p>In· the foregoing use of prepositions, we have seen how they are applied by way
                    of juxtaposition; that is to say, where they are prefixed to a word without
                    becoming a part of it. But they are used also by way of composition; that is,
                    they are prefixed to other words so as to become real parts of them. Thus in
                    Greek we have <hi rend="italic">iitiβrasi)aι</hi>; in Latin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >intelligere</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in English, <hi rend="italic"
                    >usDERStand.</hi> So also, to <hi rend="italic">F0REtell,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ovERact,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">VNDERυalue,</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">owgo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in Greek and Latin other
                    instances innumerable. In this case the prepositions commonly transfuse somet
                    hing of their own peculiar meaning into the word with which they are compounded.
                    For example, if we suppose some given space, E and <hi rend="smallcaps">ex</hi>
                    signify <hi rend="italic">out of</hi> that space; <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >per,</hi><hi rend="italic">through it;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">in,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">within it</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>Before we dismiss this part of our subject, we shall make the same general remark
                    upon prepositions which we formerly made on conjunctions, viz. that the precise
                    import of each can with certainty be known only by tracing it to its source in
                    some word of known and determinate meaning, either in the language where the
                    preposition itself has place, or in some parent or cognate tongue. And it may be
                    laid down as an infallible rule, that where different languages use the same or
                    a similar particle, that language ought to be considered as its legitimate
                    parent, in which the true meaning of the word can be found, and where its use is
                    as common and familiar as that of any other verbs and substantives. When
                    prepositions can be traced to such sources as these, no room can be left for
                    disputes concerning their meaning. In carrying on this etymological pursuit, we
                    find advantages in the nature of prepositions which conjunctions do not afford
                    us. <hi rend="italic">With</hi> and <hi rend="italic">without, from</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">to,</hi> with many other words belonging to this class, have
                    meanings directly opposite and contradictory to each other. It, then, by the
                    total or partial extinction of an original language, the root of any one
                    preposition be lost, whilst that of its opposite remains, the philosopher ought
                    to be satisfied with reasoning from contrariety, as nothing is more evident than
                    that the meaning of a word is known when we know with precision the meaning of
                    its opposite. When we meet, however, with a luckless preposition of which no
                    root is left to be dug up, and which has itself no direct opposite in the
                    language, nothing remains but that we inquire for what purpose it is used by the
                    best writers both ancient and modem; and if we can fix upon one meaning which
                    will apply, however awkwardly, to all the places where it occurs, or to the
                    greater part of them, the probability is, that we have discovered the true and
                    original meaning of the preposition;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For instance, let us suppose that Mr Home Tooke’s derivation
                    of <hi rend="italic">for,</hi> from the Gothic substantive <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >fairina,</hi> is fencifol and ill founded; yet there can be little doubt but
                    <hi rend="italic">caute</hi> is its true and original meaning, when it is found,
                    that of sixteen examples brought by Greenwood and forty-six by Johnson, of
                    different significations of the word/»·, there is not one where the noun <hi
                    rend="italic">caute</hi> may not be substituted instead of the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">for</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> sometimes indeed awkwardly
                    enough, but always without injury to the sense. Even where <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jbr</hi> seems to be <hi rend="italic">loco alteriut,</hi> which Lowth asserts
                    to be its primary sense, it will be found to be <hi rend="italic">caute,</hi>
                    and nothing else. Thus, “He made considerable progress in the study of the law
                    before be quitted that profession <hi rend="italic">Jbr</hi> this of poetry that
                    is, “before he quitted that profession, this of poetry” being the <hi
                    rend="italic">cauιe</hi> of his quitting it.</p></note> and by keeping that
                    meaning constantly in view, we shall ourselves be enabled to use the word with
                    perspicuity and precision.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Of Interjections.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the above parts of speech, there is another acknowledged in all the
                    languages ofEurope, called the <hi rend="italic">interjection</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> a word which cannot be comprehended under any of the
                    foregoing classes. The genuine interjections are very few in number, and of very
                    little importance, as they are thrown into a sentence without altering its form
                    either in syntax or in signification. In the words of Mr Horne Tooke, the
                    brutish inarticulate interjection has nothing to do with speech, and is only the
                    miserable refuge of the speechless. The dominion of speech, according to the
                    same author, is erected on the downfall of interjections. Without the artful
                    contrivances of language, mankind would have nothing but interjections with
                    which to communicate orally any of their feelings. “The neighing of a horse, the
                    lowing of a cow, the barking of a dog, the purring of a cat, sneezing, coughing,
                    groaning, shrieking, and every other involuntary convulsion with oral sound,
                    have almost as good a title to be called parts of speech as interjections. In
                    the intercourse of language, interjections are employed only when the suddenness
                    or vehemence of some affection or passion returns men to their natural state,
                    and makes them for a moment forget the use of speech; or when, from some
                    circumstance, the shortness of speech will not permit them to exercise it.” The
                    genuine interjection, which is always expressive of some very strong sensation,
                    such as <hi rend="smallcaps">ah</hi>! when we feel pain, does not owe <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193522846" xml:id="kp-eb0710-2846-0683"/> its
                    characteristical expression to the arbitrary form of articulation, but derives
                    its whole force from the tone of voice and modification of countenance and
                    gesture. Of consequence, these tones and gestures express the same meaning,
                    without any relation whatever to the articulation they may assume; and are
                    therefore universally understood by all mankind. Voluntary inteijections are
                    used in books only for embellishment, and to mark forcibly a strong emotion. But
                    where speech can be employed, they are totally useless, and are always
                    insufficient for the purpose of communicating thought. Dr Beattie ranks <hi
                    rend="italic">strange, prodigious, amazing, wonderful, 0 dear, dear me,</hi>
                    &amp;c. when used alone, and without apparent grammatical syntax, amongst the
                    interjections; but he might with as much propriety have considered <hi
                    rend="italic">hardly, truly, really,</hi> and even many Latin verbs, as
                    interjections; for these too are often used alone to supply the place of whole
                    sentences. The truth is, that all men, when suddenly and violently agitated,
                    have a strong tendency to shorten their discourse by employing a single word to
                    express a sentiment. In such cases, the word employed, whether noun, adjective,
                    or verb, would be the principal word of the sentence, if that sentence were
                    completed; and the agitation of the speaker is such, and the cause of it so
                    obvious, that the hearer is in no danger of mistaking the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sense,</hi> and can himself supply the words which are wanting. Thus, if a
                    person, after listening to a romantic narrative, were to exclaim, <hi
                    rend="italic">strange!</hi> would any man of common sense suppose, that the word
                    <hi rend="italic">strange,</hi> because uttered alone, had lost the power of an
                    adjective and become an interjection? No, surely; every one sees that the
                    exclamation is equivalent to, “that is <hi rend="italic">strange"</hi> or “that
                    is a <hi rend="italic">strange</hi> story.” Real interjections are never
                    employed to convey truth of any kind. They are not to be found amongst laws, in
                    books of civil institutions, in history, or in any treatise of useful arts or
                    sciences; but in rhetoric and poetry, in novels, plays, and romances, where in
                    English, so far from giving pathos to the style, they have generally an effect
                    that is disgusting or ridiculous.</p>
                <p>Having now analysed every part of speech which can be necessary for the
                    communication of thought, or which is acknowledged in any language with which we
                    are acquainted, we shall dismiss the subject, after annexing an abstract, which
                    may present at one view the several classes and subdivisions of words. Of the
                    different modes of dividing the parts of speech, as well as of the little
                    importance of systematic classifications, we have already declared our decided
                    opinion; but for the sake of those who may think differently from us, we shall
                    in the abstract subjoined adopt Mr Harris’s classification as far as it is
                    intelligible; after informing our readers that Mr Horne Tooke admits only three
                    parts of speech, the article, the noun, and the verb, and considers all other
                    words as corruptions or abbreviations of the two last of these.</p>
