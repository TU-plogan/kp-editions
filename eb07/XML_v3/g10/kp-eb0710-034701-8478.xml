                    English poet and physician, was descended from a good family in Yorkshire. He
                    was admitted into the college of physicians at London in 1663. He at that time
                    zealously promoted and encouraged the erecting of the dispensary for the relief
                    of the sick poor, by giving them advice <hi rend="italic">gratis,</hi> and
                    medicines at low rates. This work of charity having exposed him and many other
                    physicians to the envy and resentment of several persons of the same faculty, as
                    well as apothecaries, he ridiculed them, with peculiar spirit and vivacity, in a
                    poem called the <hi rend="italic">Dispensary,</hi> in six cantos, which is
                    highly esteemed. He was one of the most eminent members of the famous society
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Kit Kat Club,</hi> which consisted of noblemen and
                    gentlemen distinguished by excellent parts, and affection to the house of
                    Hanover. Upon the accession of George I. he was knighted, and made physician in
                    ordinary to his majesty, and physician general to the army. Nor were these more
                    than just rewards of his merit as a physician. He had gone through the office of
                    censor of the college in 1702; and had practised with great reputation, and a
                    strict regard to the honour and interest of the faculty, never stooping to
                    prostitute the dignity of his profession, through mean and sordid, views of
                    self-interest, to any, even the most popular and wealthy characters. In a steady
                    adherence to this noble principle, he concurred with the celebrated Dr
                    Radcliffe, with whom he was also frequently joined in physical consultations. He
                    had a most extensive practice, but was very moderate in his views of advancing
                    his own fortune; his humanity and good nature inclining him more to make use of
                    the great interest he had with persons in power, for the support and
                    encouragement of other men of letters. He chose to live with the great in that
                    degree of independence and freedom which became a man possessed of a superior
                    genius, of which he was daily giving fresh proofs to the public. One of his last
                    performances in polite letters was his translation of the fourteenth book, and
                    the story of Cinnus in the fifteenth book, of Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses.</hi> These, together with an English version of the rest, were
                    published in 1717; and he has prefixed to the whole an excellent preface, in
                    which he not only gives an idea of the work, and points out its principal
                    beauties, but shows the uses of the poem, and how it may be read to most profit.
                    The distemper which seized him the ensuing year, and terminated his life, caused
                    a general concern, which was particularly testified by Lord Lansdowne, a brother
                    poet. He died, after a short illness, which he bore with great patience, in
                    January 1719.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
