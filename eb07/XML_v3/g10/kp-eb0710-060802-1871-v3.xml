                <p><label type="entry">GOLIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a professor
                    of Arabic and mathematics at Leyden, was descended from a considerable family of
                    the same name, and born at the Hague in the year 1596. He was early sent to the
                    university of Leyden, where he studied under Erpenius; and having made himself
                    master of the learned languages, applied himself to the study of mathematics,
                    physic, and divinity. He afterwards travelled into Africa and Asia; and was
                    greatly esteemed both by the king of Morocco and the sultan of Turkey. He at
                    length returned to Leyden loaded with manuscripts; and in 1624 succeeded
                    Erpenius in the Arabic chair. As <pb break="no" facs="nls:193521884"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-1884-0609"/>he had been an eye-witness of the wretched state
                    of Christianity in the Mahommedan countries, he was filled with the compassion
                    of a fellow Christian; and none ever solicited for a place of honour and profit
                    with greater eagerness than he did for procuring a new edition of the New
                    Testament, in the original language, with a translation into the modern Greek by
                    an archimandrite; and as there are some of these Christians who use the Arabic
                    tongue in divine service, he also caused to be dispersed amongst them an Arabic
                    translation of the confession of the^Protestants, together with the Catechism
                    and Liturgy. In 1626 he was chosen professor of mathematics, and discharged the
                    functions of both professorships with the greatest applause during forty years.
                    He was likewise appointed interpreter in ordinary to the states for the Arabic,
                    Turkish, Persian, and other eastern languages, and had an annual pension
                    conferred upon him, together with a present of a gold chain and a beautiful
                    medal, which he wore as a badge of his office. Although entitled to be
                    considered as an universal scholar, Golius excelled chiefly in philology and
                    languages, in the acquisition of which he evinced equal ability and application.
                    At the age of fifty-four he made himself master of Persian, in which he wrote a
                    dictionary, afterwards printed in Castell’s <hi rend="italic">Lexico
                    Heptaglotton;</hi> he was intimately acquainted with the Turkish; and he had
                    made such progress in the Chinese that, though he applied late in life to the
                    study of it, he was able to read and understand books written in that language.
                    Besides the works which he had printed and published, he left several unfinished
                    manuscripts, which, if he had lived to complete them, would have done credit to
                    his talents and learning. His published works are, 1. <hi rend="italic"
