                <p><label type="entry">GEMINIANI</label>, a celebrated musician and composer, was
                    born at Lucca in the year 1680. He received his first instructions in music from
                    Alessandro Scarlatti; and after that became a pupil of Carlo Ambrosio Lunati,
                    surnamed <hi rend="italic">Il Gobbo,</hi> a most celebrated performer on the
                    violin; after which he became a disciple of Corelli, and under him finished his
                    studies on that instrument. In the year 1714 he came to England, where in a
                    short time he so recommended himself by his exquisite performance, that all who
                    professed to love and understand music were captivated with hearing him. Many of
                    the nobility laid claim to the honour of being his patrons; but he seemed
                    chiefly to attach himself to Baron Kilmansegge, chamberlain to King George I. as
                    elector of Hanover, and a favourite of that prince. In 1716 he published and
                    dedicated to his patron twelve sonatas <hi rend="italic">a violino, violone, e
                    cembalo</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the first six with fugues, or double stops
                    as they are vulgarly called; the last with airs of various measures, such as
                    allemandes, courantes, and jiggs. This publication was so well relished by the
                    baron, that he mentioned Geminiani to the king as an excellent performer; in
                    consequence of which our musician had the honour to perform before his majesty,
                    in concert with the celebrated Handel, who played on the harpsichord. But though
                    Geminiani was exceedingly admired, yet he had not a talent for associating music
                    with poetry, nor do we find that he ever became a public performer; he was
                    therefore obliged to depend for his subsistence on the friendship of his patrons
                    and the profits which accrued to him from teaching. He had also the misfortune
                    to be an enthusiast in painting; and the versatility of his temper was such,
                    that, in order to gratify this passion, he not only suspended his studies, and
                    neglected to exercise his talents, but involved himself in debts. In 1727 he was
                    offered the place of master and composer of the state music in Ireland; but this
                    could not be conferred on a Catholic, and Geminiani refused to change his
                    religion; upon which it was given to Matthew Dubourg, a young man who had been
                    one of his pupils, and was a celebrated performer on the violin. Geminiani then
                    set himself to compose parts to the <hi rend="italic">opera quinta</hi> of
                    Corelli; or, in other words, to make concertos of the first six of his solos.
                    This work he completed, and, with the help of a subscription, at the head ol
                    which were the names of the royal family, published in 1726. In 1732 he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">opera</hi><hi rend="italic">seconda,</hi> which
                    contains a celebrated minuet that goes by his name. He published many other
                    pieces, the profits of which did not much mend his circumstances; but this
                    perhaps was owing to his rambling disposition and enthusiastic fondness for
                    painting. He was also an utter stranger to the business of an orchestra, and had
                    no idea of the labour and pains necessary in the instruction of singers for the
                    performance ol music to which they were strangers. The consequence of this was,
                    that a <hi rend="italic">concerto</hi><hi rend="italic">spirituale,</hi> which
                    he had advertised for his own benefit in 1748, failed in the performance. The
                    audience, however, compassionated his distress, and sat very silent till the
                    books were changed; when the performance was continued with compositions of the
                    author’s own, which he executed in such a manner as has never been forgotten.
                    The profits arising from this performance enabled him to take a journey to
                    Paris, where he staid long enough to get plates engraven for a score of solos,
                    and the parts of two operas of concertos. About the year 1755 he returned to
                    England, and advertised them for sale. In 1761 Geminiani went over to Ireland,
                    and was kindly entertained there by Mr Matthew Dubourg, who had been his pupil,
                    and was then master of the king’s band in Ireland. This person, through the
                    course of his life, had ever been disposed to render him friendly offices; and
                    it was but a short time after Geminiani’s arrival at Dublin that he was called
                    upon to do him the last. It appears that Geminiani had spent many years in
                    compiling an elaborate treatise on music, which he intended for publication; but
                    soon after his arrival at Dublin, by the treachery of a female servant, who, it
                    was said, had been recommended to him for no other end than that she might steal
                    it, it was conveyed away, and could not be recovered. The greatness of this
                    loss, and his inability to repair it, made a deep impression on his mind, and,
                    as it is conjectured, hastened his end; at least he survived it but a short
                    time, ending his days on the 17th of September 1762. The following list
                    comprehends the whole of his publications, except two or three articles <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193518907" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8907-0380"/> of small account,
                    viz. twelve solos for a violin, <hi rend="italic">opera</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >prima;</hi> six concertos in seven parts, <hi rend="italic">opera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seconda;</hi> six concertos in seven parts, <hi rend="italic"

                    six solos for a violoncello, <hi rend="italic">opera quinta;</hi> the same made
                    into solos for a violin; six concertos from his <hi rend="italic">opera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quarta</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> six concertos in eight parts,
                    <hi rend="italic">opera settima</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> rules for playing
                    in taste; a treatise on good taste; the art of playing the violin; twelve
                    sonatas from his first solos, <hi rend="italic">opera</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >undecima</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Ripieno parts to ditto; lessons for the
                    harpsichord; <hi rend="italic">Guido Armonica</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    supplement to this; the art of accompaniment, two books; his first two operas of
                    concertos in score; and the Enchanted Forest. Of his solos the <hi rend="italic"
                    >opera</hi><hi rend="italic">prima</hi> is esteemed the best. Of his concertos
                    some are excellent, others of them scarcely pass the bounds of mediocrity. The
                    sixth of the third opera not only surpasses all the rest, but, in the opinion of
                    the best judges of harmony, is the finest instrumental composition extant.</p>
