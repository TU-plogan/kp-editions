                <p><label type="entry">GROSE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis</hi></label>, born about
                    the year 1731, was the son of Francis Grose, a jeweller of Richmond, by whom the
                    coronation crown of George H. was filled up. Young Grose obtained an independent
                    fortune by the death of his father, which happened in the year 1769. He was then
                    paymaster and adjutant in the Surrey militia, but dissipation so far prevented
                    him for some time from giving proper attention to his duty, that, in his own
                    humorous mode of expressing himself, he kept but two books of accounts, his
                    right and left hand pockets. The losses which this thoughtless conduct
                    occasioned him awakened his dormant talents, and he resolved to turn his
                    attention to literary pursuits. Having received a classical education, he united
                    to it an excellent taste for drawing, which induced him to commence his <hi
                    rend="italic">Views of Antiquities in England and Wales.</hi> He began this work
                    in numbers in 1773, and completed it in 1776; and by it he obtained both
                    reputation and profit, which last his unpardonable prodigality had rendered
                    extremely welcome. In 1777 he added to his English Views other two volumes,
                    including the islands of Guernsey and Jersey, finished in 1776. All his
                    expectations were fully gratified by the publication of this work; and during
                    the remainder of his life he continued to publish others, which in general
                    increased his reputation<pb break="no" facs="nls:193524120"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-4120-0781"/> as an author, and tended to augment his
                    substance. In the summer of 1789 he paid a visit to Scotland, and in 1790 began
                    to publish in numbers, the Views taken by him in that country. He next proceeded
                    to Ireland, with a view to give a similar description of that country; but on
                    the 6th of May 1791, whilst at Dublin, in the house of Mr Horne, he Was suddenly
                    seized at table with an apoplectic fit, and immediately expired. He was buried
                    in Drumcondra churchyard, near Dublin. Although his literature was very
                    respectable, it was exceeded by his good humour, his convivial turn of mind, and
                    his friendly disposition. Both at home and abroad he was always in the best
                    company, and his knowledge of the world was so extensive that his conversation
                    was useful and entertaining. He was free from the malignity and pride of some
                    authors; for as he felt the independence of his own talents, he scorned to
                    depreciate those of others. Of the most careless, open, and artless disposition,
                    he was often the prey of the designing, and more than once embarrassed himself
                    by placing too implicit confidence in the probity of others. A tale of distress
                    never failed to touch his heart, and to bedew his cheek with tears of
                    commiseration. His works are, 1. The Antiquities of England and Wales, in 8
                    vols. 4to and 8vo; 2. The Antiquities of Scotland, in 2 vols. 4to and 8vo; 3.
