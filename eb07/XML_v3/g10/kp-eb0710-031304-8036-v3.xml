                <p><label type="entry">GANGES</label>. This great river has its rise in the northern
                    face of the Himalaya Mountains, and, after a course of about two thousand miles,
                    falls into the Bay of Bengal through numerous channels. The remote sources of
                    the Ganges were long imperfectly known, and afforded a fertile subject of
                    conjecture and controversy to the geographers of Europe. Prior to the
                    commencement of the nineteenth century, this river had been traced by Hindoo
                    pilgrims to Gangoutri, the point at which it issues from the Himalaya Mountains;
                    but all accounts agreed that its origin was still more remote. On the side of
                    Thibet it had been surveyed by lamas or priests, sent for that purpose by the
                    Emperor Camhi, whose route terminated at Rentaisse, a range of snowy mountains
                    on the west and south of Thibet. The most general notion was, that it flowed
                    within the Himalaya chain of snowy mountains for many hundred miles, from the
                    imaginary lake of Mapama, to Gangoutri. In 1808, Lieutenant Webb was sent by the
                    Bengal government to explore the sources of the Ganges. About seventeen miles
                    beyond Gangoutri his further progress was stopt by the diflicu)ties of the
                    country, but the Moonshee who accompanied the party went forward; and as he
                    proceeded upwards, after leaving Gangoutri, he occasionally perceived the river
                    among the snow, which a little higher up so completely filled its bed that no
                    trace of it could be discovered. Five hundred yards further on it again showed
                    itself; but in front was a steep mountain, rising up like a huge wall, from an
                    angle of which the Ganges appeared to issue, whilst all beyond was an
                    impenetrable mass of snow. This is the furthest point to which the Ganges has
                    been traced, and may be considered as its source; though others think the Dauli
                    to be the main stream, owing to the length of its course from Gangoutri. Two
                    miles higher up the river is the place called the Cow’s Mouth. It is a large
                    stone in the middle of the river, the water passing it on each side, and leaving
                    only a small piece above the surface, to which the fancy of superstition has
                    given the form of a cow’s head, an animal held sacred by the Hindoos. From
                    Gangoutri the Ganges flows, in the upper part of its course among the mountains,
                    from south-east to north-west; and it is only from Sookie, where it fairly
                    pierces through the Himalaya range, that it assumes a course south-west to
                    Hurdwar. Here, in the latitude of 30° N. it gushes through an opening in the
                    mountains, and flows with a smooth navigable stream to its conflux with the
                    Jumna at Allahabad, the first large river that joins it in Hindustan proper. Its
                    bed is of very unequal breadth. From its first arrival in the plains at Hurdwar
                    to the conflux of the Jumna, it is generally from a mile to a mile and a quarter
                    wide, and, compared with the latter part of its course, tolerably straight. From
                    hence downward it becomes more winding; till, having successively received the
                    waters of the Goggrah, the Soane, and Gunduck, besides numerous smaller streams,
                    its bed has attained its full width, which varies from half a mile to three
                    miles. The stream is always increasing or decreasing, according to the season;
                    and in April, when it is lowest, the principal channel varies from four hundred
                    yards to about a mile and a quarter. At the height of the inundation the breadth
                    of the river is of course greater; and Bishop Heber mentions, that at Boglipoor,
                    about six hundred miles from the sea, including the turnings of the river, the
                    breadth was nine measured miles across. Though the Ganges be fordable in some
                    places above the conflux of the Jumna, the navigation is never interrupted.
                    Below, the depth of the channel is increased, the additional streams bringing a
                    greater accession of depth than breadth. At five hundred miles from the sea, the
                    channel is thirty feet deep when the river is lowest, and it continues at least
                    this depth to the sea, when the sudden expansion of the stream deprives it of
                    the force necessary to sweep away the bars of sand and mud thrown across it by
                    strong southerly winds; so that the principal branch of the Ganges cannot be
                    entered by large vessels. At about two hundred and twenty miles from the sea, or
                    three hundred reckoning the windings of the river, commences the head of the
                    Delta of the Ganges. The two easternmost branches, named Cossimbazar and
                    Jellinghy rivers, unite and form what is afterwards denominated the Hooghly,
                    which is the port of Calcutta, and the only branch of the Ganges that is
                    commonly navigated by ships. Below the channel named the Songti Mohana, where
                    the Ganges sends off these two branches which go to Calcutta, the main stream
                    loses not only its name, but the greater part of its sanctity in the eyes of the
                    natives. The Cossimbazar river is almost dry from October to May, nor is the
                    Jellinghy river navigable during two or three of the driest months; so that the
                    only subordinate branch of the Ganges which is at all times navigable is the
                    Chandnah river, which separates at Moddapoor, and terminates in the Hooringotta
                    river. That part of the Delta called the Sunderbunds consists of a labyrinth of
                    rivers and creeks, which is two hundred miles broad at the junction of the
                    Ganges with the sea. This tract is covered with woods which are infested with
                    tigers, and its numerous canals form a complete inland navigation across the
                    lower part of the Delta. The Ganges, like all tropical rivers, overflows
                    periodically during the season of the rains in Bengal, on which it depends for
                    its supplies, and not, as may be supposed, on the melting of the mountain snows.
                    Its rise is thirty-two feet, fifteen and a half of which it rises by the latter
                    end of June, and it is not until this time that the rainy season commences in
                    the plains. By the end of April, when the rains from the mountains have reached
                    Bengal, the rivers begin to rise at the rate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518049"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-8049-0314"/>of an inch per day for the first fortnight, which
                    augments to two and three inches before any quantity of rain has fallen; and
                    when the rain becomes general, the river increases, at a medium, to five inches
                    per day. By the latter end of July all the lower parts of Bengal are inundated.
                    The inundation is at a stand in the middle of August; and it gradually and
                    slowly decreases in August and September, and until April, when it again begins
                    to rise. The quantity of water discharged is calculated in the dry season to
                    amount to 80,000 cubic feet per second, and during the inundation to 405,000
                    cubic feet. The descent of the river is about nine inches per mile, and
                    estimating the windings of the stream, four inches per mile. In the dry season
                    the current is three miles an hour; it increases during the wet season to five
                    or six miles, and in particular situations to seven or eight miles. On the banks
                    of the Ganges, where the soil is loose, and the current rapid, “such tracts of
                    land,” says Major Rennell, “are swept away in one season as would astonish those
                    who have not been eye-witnesses to the magnitude and force of the mighty streams
                    occasioned by the periodical rains of the tropical regions." Great changes are
                    in this manner produced in the course of the river, what is lost on one side
                    being gained on the other by the mere operation of the stream. In its course
                    through the plains the Ganges receives eleven rivers, some of which are larger
                    than the Rhine, besides many others of less importance. The Goggrah, the Soane,
                    and the Coosy, are the largest of the tributary streams in Bengal and Bahar. The
                    Brahmapootra has its rise near the source of the Ganges, and from hence the two
                    rivers diverge widely asunder; but afterwards they intermix their waters before
                    they fall into the sea, the Ganges having then performed a course, including its
                    windings, of about 1500 miles.</p>
