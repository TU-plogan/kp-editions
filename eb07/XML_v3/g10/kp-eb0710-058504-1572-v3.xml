                <p><label type="entry">GLOUCESTER</label>, a city, the capital of the county of the
                    same name, 106 miles from London. It is situated in a rich and beautiful valley,
                    on the banks of the river Severn. It is sheltered on the east by a range of
                    hills, on descending which the vale displays itself, containing the verdant
                    plains, the ancient buildings of the city, the winding river, and, in the
                    distance, the group of picturesque eminences called the Malvern Hills. The city
                    consists of four streets, distinguished by the names of the cardinal points, and
                    crossing each other in the centre at right angles. They are broad, well built,
                    clean, and excellently paved. The chief building ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>
                    h <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> cathedral, begun in 1047, and the ecclesiastical
                    residences around it. That edifice was enlarged at subsequent periods, till it
                    was erected into a bishop’s see m the reign of Henry VIII. It is four hundred
                    and twenty feet in length, a hundred and forty-four in breadth, and adorned with
                    a tower a hundred and ninety-nine feet in height. The interior has an impressive
                    aspect, and is decorated with several monuments and a lofty choir. For municipal
                    purposes the city is divided into three wards, and is governed by a mayor, six
                    aidermen, and seventeen councillors. This city <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi> i

                    conferred upon a member of the royal family. The principal manufacturing
                    employment is making pins, great quantities of which are sent to London; but,
                    besides this, making malt and cordage, and building barges, afford some
                    occupation. There is a little foreign trade in the importation of wine, spirits,
                    and West India produce; and this has been increased by the construction of a
                    canal parallel to the Severn, which allows ships to avoid the shoals and
                    sinuosities of that river. There is also some transit trade in iron ware,
                    pottery, salt, and in timber, which ,descend the Severn from the counties to the
                    northward. Some mineral springs, similar to those of Cheltenham, have lately
                    been discovered, which have been resorted to by visitors, and have occasioned an
                    increase of buildings appropriated for their reception. There are well-supplied
                    markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays. It returns two members to parliament. The
                    population amounted in 1801 to 7ã97, in 1811 to 8280, in 1821 to 9744, and in
                    1831 to 11,993.</p>

                    unimportant to require separate notice.</p>
