                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    prelate of considerable talents, but of a temporising and interested character,
                    was the son of John Gauden, vicar of Mayfield in Essex, where he was born in the
                    year 1605. Having received <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518777"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-8777-0370"/>the rudiments of his education at Bury St Edmund’s
                    in Suffolk, he was removed to St John’s College, Cambridge, where he made
                    considerable proficiency in learning, and took his degree in arts. About 1630 he
                    was presented to the vicarage of Chippenham in Cambridgeshire, and he also
                    obtained the rectory of Brightwell in Berkshire. This last preferment having
                    brought him near Oxford, he entered himself of Wadham College in that
                    university, and became tutor to some noblemen and several young gentlemen who
                    were placed under his care. In 1635, he took his degree as bachelor in divinity,
                    and in 1641 he was received as doctor in the theological faculty. At the
                    commencement of the civil war he had become chaplain to the Earl of Warwick, a
                    Presbyterian leader; and having ranged himself on the same side as his patron,
                    he, in the end of November, after the close imprisonment of Lord Strafford,
                    preached a sermon before the House of Commons, which proved so agreeable to that
                    assembly, that it is said they presented him with a large silver tankard,
                    bearing the inscription, <hi rend="italic">Donum honorarium</hi><hi

                    story be true, may seem to be the stronger for its singularity and

                    the ecclesiastical policy of the court; and it was not only preached at a
                    critical time, but on the solemn occasion of the sacrament being first taken by
                    the whole house. As a reward for so conspicuous a service to the parliamentary
                    cause, he soon afterwards received the valuable living of Bocking in Essex,
                    which he held through all the succeeding changes of government; forbearing of
                    necessity to use the liturgy, and complying with all the conditions which the
                    law then required from the beneficed clergy. He was also chosen one of the
                    assembly of divines who met at Westminster in 1643; but it has been disputed
                    whether he took the covenant, though his own evasive answers seem rather to
                    confirm the opinion that he had. It is said that he wrote a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protestation</hi> against the trial of the king in 1648, and likewise an <hi
                    rend="italic">Invective</hi> against those of the army and their abettors who
                    murdered Charles I.; but neither of these pieces was published until two years
                    after the Restoration; and even if the former had appeared at the needful time,
                    it would have been disregarded, seeing that the solemn declaration of all the
                    Presbyterian clergy of London against bringing Charles to trial had proved
                    unavailing.</p>
                <p>But the most remarkable production with which the name of Gauden has been
                    connected is the famous <hi rend="smallcaps">E∕xmi</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >∣</hi> BαΛλjχi1, or Portraiture of his Sacred Majesty in his Solitude and
                    Sufferings, which appeared after the execution of Charles I., and in the course
                    of a year passed through filly editions. The <hi rend="italic">Eihon
                    Basìliké</hi> seems to have been intended to produce a favourable effect during
                    the king’s trial; but its publication was retarded until some days after his
                    death, by the jealous and rigorous precautions adopted by the regicides. The
                    impression made on the public by a work which purported to convey the pious and
                    eloquent language of a dying king could not fail to be very considerable; and
                    though its genuineness was from the beginning doubted or disbelieved by some,
                    including Milton, Goodwyn, and Lilly, yet unbounded faith in its authenticity as
                    the production of Charles himself soon became one of the fundamental articles of
                    the royalist creed. At the Restoration, Gauden was promoted to the see of
                    Exeter, whence he was in 1662 translated to that of Worcester. But he was so far
                    from being satisfied with this promotion, that he looked upon it as an act of
                    injustice. He had, it appears, applied to the king for the rich bishopric of
                    Winchester, which he flattered himself with the hopes of obtaining; and, when he
                    failed, the vexation he suffered on account of this disappointment is believed
                    to have hastened his death, which took place on the 20th of September 1662.
                    Gauden was the author of many controversial pieces, suited to the temper of the
                    times, and to his own views, which were always those of a selfish and
                    temporising divine.</p>
                <p>The question, Who wrote the <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilikėĩ</hi> which Gauden
                    published as King Charles’s private meditations, has, as our readers must be
                    aware, been long agitated; but the controversy seems at length to have been
                    ended by a verdict upon the whole case in favour of Gauden as the author. At the
                    moment of the Restoration, this complying person, who had thundered before the
                    parliament against the ecclesiastical policy of the court, appears to have had
                    as little <hi rend="italic">public</hi> claim on the favour of Charles II. as
                    any clergyman who had conformed to the religious principles of the parliament
                    and the protectorate; and he was accordingly stigmatized by some zealous
                    royalists as “the false apostate.” He was sufficiently a Presbyterian in party
                    to make him no favourite with the court; yet he was not so decided a
                    Presbyterian in principle as to have that influence amongst his party which
                    could make him worth so high a price as a mitre. Those who dispute his claim to
                    be acknowledged as the writer of the <hi rend="italic">Eikon,</hi> will not
                    ascribe his preferment to transcendent abilities; he is not mentioned as having
                    ever shown kindness to the royalists; there is no trace of his having
                    corresponded with the exiled court; he contributed nothing to the recall of the
                    king, nor indeed had he the power of performing such atoning services. Yet,
                    though thus without the shadow of a claim to preferment on any <hi rend="italic"
                    >public</hi> ground, and indeed one of the last persons whom the court might be
                    supposed to have been inclined to promote, Gauden was, nevertheless, on the 3d
                    of November 1660, appointed Bishop of Exeter, and, in a few months, he received
                    no less than L.20,000 for the renewal of leases. Nor was he at all satisfied
                    with this advancement In fact, he had scarcely arrived at his episcopal palace,
                    when, on the 21st of December, he wrote a letter to Lord Chancellor Clarendon,
                    complaining bitterly of the “distress, infelicity, and horror” of such a
                    bishopric, and lamenting “a hard fate which,” he reminds the chancellor, he “had
                    before deprecated.” “I am not so unconscious," he adds, “to <hi rend="italic"
                    >the service done to the church and to his Majesty’s family,</hi> as to bear
                    with patience the ruin heaped on me. Are these the effects of his liberal
                    expressions, who told me I might have what I would desire ?” Five days
                    afterwards (26th December 1660) he wrote another letter, in which he says, “Dr
                    Morley once offered me my option, <hi rend="italic">upon account of some service
                    which he thought I had done extraordinary for the church and royal family,</hi>
                    of which he told me <hi rend="italic">your Lordship was informed.”</hi> Gauden
                    appears soon afterwards to have written to Sir E. Nicholas, secretary of state,
                    a letter expressed so as to be read by the king; and on the 19th January 1661,
                    he received an answer, in which there is the following sentence: “As for your
                    own particular, he (the king) desires you not to be discouraged at the poverty
                    of your bishopric at present, and if that answer not the expense that was <hi
                    rend="italic">promised</hi> you, <hi rend="italic">his Majesty will take you so
                    particularly into his care,</hi> that he bids me assure you shall have no cause
                    to remember Bocking.” On the 21st of January the importunate prelate again
                    addressed to Clarendon a letter explicitly stating the nature of the services,
                    which was probably rendered necessary, in his opinion, by the continued silence
                    of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193518790" xml:id="kp-eb0710-8790-0371"
                    />chancellor, and distinctly claiming “what goes under the late blessed king’s
                    name, the <hi rend="italic">or Portraiture of hys Majesty in hys Solitudes and
                    Sufferings,"</hi> as his own production. “This book and figure,” he says, “<hi
                    rend="italic">was wholly and only my invention, making, and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">designe,</hi> in order to vindicate the king’s wisdome, honor, and
                    piety. My wife indeed was conscious to it, and had an hand in <hi rend="italic"
                    >disguising the letters of that copy which I sent to the king in the Isle of
                    Wight</hi> by favour of the late Marquise of Hertford, which was delivered to
                    the king by the now Bishop of Winchester (Duppa): hys majesty graciously
                    accepted, owned, and adopted it as hys sense and genius, not only with great
                    approbation, but admiration. Hee kept it with hym; and though hys cruel
                    murtherers went on to perfect hys martyrdome, yet God preserved and prospered
                    the book to revive hys honor, and to redeeme hys majesty’s name from that grave
                    of contempt and abhorrence or infamy, in which they aymed to bring hym.” The
                    bishop wrote three more letters to Clarendon on the 25th January, the 20th
                    February, and the 6th March; and, at last, the chancellor replied to his
                    numerous applications in a letter dated the 13th of March 1661, in which
                    Gauden’s claim is unequivocally admitted. After many apologies for delay, and
                    professions of good will towards his importunate correspondent, Clarendon says,
                    “<hi rend="italic">The particular which you often renewed, I do</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">confesse</hi><hi rend="italic">was imparted to me under secrecy,
                    and of which I did not take myself to be at liberty to take notice, and
                    truly,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">when it ceases to be a</hi> SECRET, <hi
                    rend="italic">I know nobody will be gladd of it but Mr Milton</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">I have very often wished I had never been
                    trusted with it.”</hi></p>
                <p>Now this, taken in conjunction with Gauden’s immediate promotion to the episcopal
                    dignity after the Restoration, and the letter of the secretary of state, Sir E.
                    Nicholas, above referred to, appears to us to be decisive of the whole question
                    as to the authorship of the <hi rend="italic">Eikon.</hi> “It is proper to
                    remark here,” says Sir James Mackintosh,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> vol. xliv. p.
                    lδ.</p></note> “that all the letters of Gauden are still extant, indorsed by
                    Lord Clarendon, or by his eldest son. In the course of three months, then, it
                    appears that Gauden, with unusual importunity and confidence, with complaints
                    which were disguised reproaches, and sometimes with an approach to menaces,
                    asserted his claim to be richly rewarded <hi rend="italic">as the author of the
                    Eikon.</hi> He affirms that it was sent to the king by the Duke of Somerset, who
                    died about a month before his first letter, and delivered to his majesty by Dr
                    Duppa, bishop of Winchester, who was still alive. He adds, that he had
                    acquainted Charles II. with the secret through the Duke of York; that Morley,
                    then bishop of Worcester, had informed Clarendon of it; and that Morley himself
                    had declared the value of the service to be such as to entitle Gauden to chuse
                    his own preferment. Gauden thus enabled Clarendon to convict him of falsehood,
                    if his tale was untrue, in three or four circumstances, differing indeed in
                    their importance as to the main question, but equally material to his own
                    veracity. A single word from Duppa would have overwhelmed him with ∙∏famy∙ Some
                    of the communications were made before the Duke of Somerset’s death, on the 24th
                    of October. How easy was it f <hi rend="subscript"> 0r the</hi> chancellor to
                    ascertain whether the information had been given to the king and his brother!
                    Morley was his bosom friend, and the spiritual director of his daughter Anne,
                    duchess of York. How many other persons might have been quietly sounded by the
                    numerous confidential agents of a great minister, on a transaction which had
                    occurred only twelve years before! To suppose that a statesman then at the
                    zenith of his greatness could not discover the truth on this subject without a
                    noise like a judicial inquiry, would betray a singular ignorance of affairs. Did
                    Clarendon relinquish without a struggle his belief in a book which had doubtless
                    touched his feelings when he read it as the work of his royal master? Even
                    curiosity might have led Charles II <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> when receiving
                    the blessing of Duppa on his (Duppa’s) deathbed, to ask him a short confidential
                    question. To how many chances of detection did Gauden expose himself? How nearly
                    impossible is it that the king, the duke, the chancellor, and Morley, should
                    have abstained from the safest means of inquiry, and, in opposition to their
                    former opinions and prejudices, yielded at once to Gauden’s assertion, without
                    any evidence of its truth?”</p>
                <p>Sir James Mackintosh then goes on to show, that the previous belief of the
                    royalist party in the genuineness of the <hi rend="italic">Eikon</hi> very much
                    magnifies the improbability of such suppositions. “The truth,” says he, “might
                    be discovered from the parties appealed to, and conveyed to the audacious
                    pretender without any scandal. There was no need of any public exposure. A
                    private intimation of the falsehood of one material circumstance must have
                    silenced Gauden. But what, on the contrary', is the answer of Lord Clarendon?
                    The decisive words, at length extorted from him, ’ When it ceases to be a
                    secret, I know nobody will be glad of it but Mr Milton,’ express such an
                    unhesitating assent to the claim as could only have flowed from inquiry and
                    evidence. By confessing that the secret had been imparted to him, he admits the
                    other material part of Gauden’s statement, that the information came through
                    Morley. It may also be remarked, that Gauden, if his story was true, chose the
                    persons to whom he imparted it both prudently and fairly. He dealt with it as a
                    secret the disclosure of which would injure the royal cause; and he therefore
                    confined his communications to the king’s sons and the chancellor, who could not
                    be indisposed to the cause by it, and whose knowledge of it was necessary to
                    justify his own legitimate claims. Had it been false, no choice could have been
                    more unfortunate. He appealed to those who, for ought he knew, might have in
                    their possession the means of instantly demonstrating that he was guilty of a
                    falsehood so impudent and perilous that nothing parallel to it has ever been
                    hazarded by a man of sound mind. How could Gauden know that the king did not
                    possess his father’s manuscript, and that Royston the printer was not ready to
                    prove that he received it from Charles I. through hands totally unconnected with
