                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    a Roman general celebrated for his eloquence, his victories, and his riches. In
                    his youth he made a figure at the bar; but,being afterwards sent as quaestor
                    into Asia, and praetor into Africa, he governed those provinces with great
                    moderation and justice. Scarcely was he known as a military man, when he twice
                    defeated the fleet of Hamilcar, and gained two great victories over him. His
                    happy genius was greatly improved by study; for he employed his leisure in
                    reading the best authors on military affairs. Being made consul along with
                    Aurelius Cotta, during the third war with Mithridates king of Pontus, he was
                    sent against that prince; and this expedition was attended with a series of
                    victories, which did him less honour than an act of generosity towards his
                    colleague. The latter, willing to take advantage of his absence to signalize
                    himself by some great exploit, hastened to fight Mithridates, but was defeated
                    and shut up in Chalcedonia, where he must have perished, if Lucullus,
                    sacrificing his resentment to the pleasure of saving a Roman citizen, had not
                    flown to his assistance, and disengaged him. All Pontus then submitted to
                    Lucullus, who being continued in his government of Asia, entered the territories
                    of Tigranes, then the most powerful king in Asia. That prince marched with a
                    formidable army against Lucullus, who defeated him with a handful of men, and
                    killed great numbers of his forces; took Tigranocertes, the capital of his
                    kingdom; and was ready to put an end to the war, when the intrigues of a tribune
                    got him deposed, and Pompey nominated in his stead. Lucullus having brought home
                    prodigious riches, now gave himself up to excessive luxury; and his table was
                    served with a profusion and splendour until that time unknown. He brought from
                    the East a great number <hi rend="italic">of</hi> books, which he formed into a
                    library, and gave admission to all men of learning, who frequented it in great
                    numbers. Towards the end of his life, he fell into a kind of madness; and
                    Lucullus, his brother, was appointed his guardian. He is said to have been the
                    first who brought cherries into Europe, having imported the grafts from the
                    kingdom of Pontus.</p>
