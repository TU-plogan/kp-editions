                    Harwich in 1629, and was bred to the sea. At the Restoration, he was made master

                    Dutch war distinguished himself by his skill and bravery in two extraordinary
                    actions; one against fifteen sail of Dutch men of war; and another in 1667
                    against two Danes in the Baltic, in which, the commanding officers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Princess</hi> being killed or desperately wounded, the command,
                    according to the rules of war at that time, fell to the gunner. In 1669 he was
                    promoted to be gunner of the <hi rend="italic">Poyal Prince,</hi> a first-rate
                    man of war. He was engaged, with his two sons, Henry and John, in the battle
                    against Van Tromp, in 1673, when the <hi rend="italic">Royal Prince</hi> had all
                    her masts shot away, nearly 4Ό0 of her men killed and disabled, and most of her
                    upper tier of guns dismounted. As she lay thus like a wreck upon the water, a
                    great Dutch man of war came down upon her with two fire-ships, either to burn or
                    carry her oft’; and Captain, afterwards Sir George Rooke, thinking it impossible
                    to defend her, ordered the men to save their lives, and the colours to be
                    struck. Mr Leake hearing this, ordered the lieutenant off the quarter-deck, and
                    took the command himself, saying, “the <hi rend="italic">Royal Prince</hi> shall
                    never be given up to the enemy while I am alive to defend her.” The undaunted
                    spirit of the brave gunner inspired with resolution the small residue of the
                    ship’s company; they returned with alacrity to the fight, and, under the
                    direction of this valiant gunner and his two sons, sunk both the fire-ships, and
                    having obliged the man of war to sheer off, saved the <hi rend="italic">Royal
                    Prince,</hi> and brought her into Chatham. But Mr Leake’s joy in obtaining this
                    victory was damped by the loss of Henry, his eldest son, who was killed near
                    him. Soon afterwards Mr Leake was preferred to the command of a yacht, and also
                    made gunner of Whitehall. In 1677 he obtained a grant for life of the office of
                    master gunner of England, and storekeeper of the ordnance at Woolwich. In this
                    situation he had full scope for his genius. He accordingly, amongst other
                    things, invented the cushee piece; and contrived to fire a mortar by the blast
                    of a piece, which has been used ever since. He was also the principal contriver
                    of what the French call <hi rend="italic">infernals,</hi> used at the
                    bombardment of St Malo in 1693. Mr Leake had a surprising genius for all
                    inventions of this kind; and had frequent trials of skill with French and Dutch
                    gunners and engineers in Woolwich Warren, at which Charles II. and the Duke of
                    York were often present, and in which he never failed to excel all his
                    competitors. Nor was he less skilled in the art of contriving compositions for
                    fireworks, of which he likewise made frequent trials with equal success.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Leake,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir John,</hi> an English
                    admiral, distinguished by his bravery and success, was born in 1656, and taught
                    mathematics and gunnery by Mr Richard Leake, his father, master gunner of
                    England. Having early entered into the navy, he distinguished himself under his
                    father in 1673, in the memorable engagement between Sir Edward Spragg and Van
                    Tromp, when only sixteen years of age; and being afterwards appointed captain,
                    he signalized himself on various occasions, particularly by executing the
                    desperate attempt of convoying some victuallers into Londonderry, which obliged
                    the enemy to raise the siege, and also at the famous battle of La Hogue. In
                    1702, being made commodore of a squadron, he destroyed the French trade and
                    settlements at Newfoundland, and restored to the English the possession of the
                    whole island. On his return he was created rear-admiral; and soon afterwards he
                    was made vice-admiral of the blue, and knighted. He was engaged with Admiral
                    Rooke in taking Gibraltar; after which he particularly distinguished himself in
                    the general engagement off Malaga, when, commanding the leading squadron or the
                    van, consisting only of six ships, he drove that of the enemy, consisting of
                    thirteen, out of the line of battle,* so disabled that they never returned to
                    the fight. In 1705, he relieved Gibraltar, which the French had besieged by sea,
                    and the Spaniards by land, so seasonably, that the enemy was to have attacked
                    the town that very night in several places, and would undoubtedly have made
                    themselves masters of it. Five hundred Spaniards had, by the help of
                    rope-ladders, climbed up the rocks by a way which was thought inaccessible; and
                    at the same time they had got a great number of boats, to land, at the New Mole,
                    three thousand men, who, by making a vigorous assault on the side next the sea,
                    were to draw the garrison to oppose the attack, whilst the five hundred men
                    concealed rushed into the town. The latter being the next day forced by hunger
                    to quit their ambuscade, were discovered; upon which, Sir John assisting the
                    garrison with sailors and marines, they were attacked with such vigour, that,
                    though they had taken an oath not to surrender to the English, a hundred and
                    ninety common soldiers and thirty-five officers accepted quarter, two hundred
                    were killed on the spot, and the rest who endeavoured to make their escape fell
                    headlong down the rock. He was soon afterwards made vice-admiral of the white,
                    and then twice relieved the same fortress. The last time, he attacked five ships
                    of the French fleet coming out of the bay, <hi rend="italic">of</hi> which two
                    were taken, and two driven ashore and destroyed. Baron Pointi died soon
                    afterwards of the wounds he received in the battle; and in a few days the enemy
                    raised the siege. In the year 1706, Sir John engaged in the reduction of
                    Barcelona, and next year relieved that city when it was reduced to the last
                    extremity, obliging King Philip to raise the siege. Soon afterwards he took the
                    city of Carthagena, whence he proceeded to Alicant and Joyce, which both
                    submitted to him; and he concluded the exploits of that year with the reduction
                    of the city and island of Majorca. Upon his return home, Prince George of
                    Denmark made him a present of a ring valued at L.400, and he had the honour of
                    receiving L.1000 from the queen as a reward for his services. Upon the unhappy
                    death of Sir Cloudesly Shovel, in 1707, he was made admiral of the white, and
                    commander-in-chief of her majesty’s fleet; and the next year, having surprised a
                    convoy of the enemy’s corn, he sent it to Barcelona, and thus saved both that
                    city and the confederate army from the danger of famine. He then proceeded to
                    the island of Sardinia, which he reduced to the obedience of King Charles; and
                    soon afterwards assisted Lord Stanhope in the conquest of Minorca. On his return
                    home, he was appointed one of the council to the lord high admiral; and in 1709
                    he was made rear-admiral of Great Britain. He was several times chosen member of
                    parliament for Rochester; and in 1712 conducted the English forces to take
                    possession of Dunkirk. But upon the accession of King George I. he was
                    superseded, and allowed a pension of L.600 a year. After this he lived privately
                    till his death, which happened at his house in Greenwich in 1720.</p>

                    Captain Martin, went through different ranks in the herald’s office till he came
                    to be garter king at arms. He was the first person who wrote professedly on our
                    English coins, two editions of his Historical Account of which were published
                    with plates, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Nummi Britannici

                    1745, 8vo. He printed, in 1750, a Life of Sir John Leake, admiral of the fleet,
                    to whom he was indebted for a considerable estate, which the admiral devised to
                    trustees for the use of his son for life, and upon his death to Captain Martin,

                    account of his life, of which only fifty copies were printed. In 1766, he
                    printed also fifty copies of the statutes of the order of the garter, 4to. He
                    died in 1773, and was buried in the chancel of the parish church of Thorp in
                    Essex.</p>
