                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">LYONET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter</hi></label>, an ingenious
                    naturalist, and member of several learned societies, was born at Maestricht, and
                    descended from a very ancient and respectable family of Lorraine. He had
                    scarcely attained his seventh year when he displayed an uncommon strength and
                    agility in all bodily exercises; but he was not less diligent in the improvement
                    of his mind. Being placed at the Latin school, he learned chronology, and
                    exercised himself in Latin, Greek, and French poetry, as also in Hebrew, logic,
                    and the Cartesian physics. I4e was particularly fond of the study of languages,
                    of which he understood no less than nine, living and dead. Having entered the
                    university of Leyden, he studied the Newtonian philosophy, geometry, and
                    algebra; but his father, who was a clergyman, desiring that he should apply
                    himself to divinity, he reluctantly abandoned the former studies, his passion
                    for which was not to be easily overcome. At the same time he applied himself to
                    anatomy, and also to music and drawing. He afterwards began to practise
                    sculpture, and executed several pieces in wood, some of which are preserved, and
                    have been greatly admired by the artists. He then betook himself to drawing
                    portraits of his friends from life, in which, after three or four months’
                    practice, he became a great proficient. Having attained the degree of candidate
                    in divinity, he resolved to study law, to which he applied himself with so much
                    zeal, that he was promoted at the end of the first year. Having arrived at the
                    Hague, he undertook the study of deciphering, and became secretary of ciphers,
                    translator of the Latin and French languages, and patentmaster to their High
                    Mightinesses. Meanwhile, having taken a strong liking to the study of insects,
                    he undertook to give an historical description of such as are found about the
                    Hague, and with that view collected materials for several volumes; and having
                    invented a method of drawing adapted thereto, he enriched this work with a great
                    number of plates, universally admired by all connoisseurs. In the year 1724 was
                    printed, at the Hague, a French translation of a German work entitled the
                    Theology of Insects, by Mr Lesser. Love of truth induced Mr Lyonet to defer the
                    publication of his description above mentioned, and to make some observations on
                    that work, to which he added two beautiful plates, engraved from his designs.
                    This performance caused his merit to be universally known. The celebrated Μ. de
                    Reaumur had this translation reprinted at Paris, not so much on account of the
                    work itself, as of Mr Lyonet’s observations; and bestowed upon it, as did also
                    many other authors, the highest encomiums. He afterwards executed drawings of
                    the fresh-water polypus for Mr Trembley’s beautiful work, 1744. The ingenious
                    Wandelaar had engraved the first five plates, when Mr Lyonet, who had never
                    witnessed this operation, concerned at the difficulties he experienced in
                    getting the remaining eight finished in the superior style he required, resolved
                    to perform the task himself. He accordingly took a lesson of one hour from Mr
                    Wandelaar, engraved <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209379"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-9379-0612"/>three or four small plates, and immediately began
                    upon the work himself, which he executed in such a manner as attracted the
                    highest praise, both from Mr Trembley and from many other artists, particularly
                    the celebrated Van Gool,' who declared that the performance astonished not only
                    the amateurs, but also the most experienced artists. In 1748 he was admitted a
                    member of the Royal Society of Loudon. In 1749 he began, by mere chance, his
                    collection of horns and shells, which, according to the universal testimony of
                    all travellers and amateurs who visited it, became the most beautiful, and
                    certainly one of the most valuable, in Europe. In 1753 he was chosen a member of
                    the Dutch Society of Sciences at Haerlem, then recently established; and in
                    1757, after the celebrated Μ. le Cat, professor of anatomy and surgery, had seen
                    Mr Lyonet’s <hi rend="italic">Traité Anatomique de la Chénille qui ronge le Bois
                    de Saule,</hi> with the drawings belonging to it (a work which was afterwards
                    published), he was elected member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Rome, of
                    which Μ. le Cat was perpetual secretary. After the publication of this treatise,
                    he became, in 1760, member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Berlin; in 1761,
                    of the Imperial Academy of Naturalists; and, in 1762, of the Imperial Academy of
                    Sciences at St Petersburg. In order to enable such as might be desirous of
                    following him in his intricate and astonishing discoveries respecting the
                    structure of this animal, Mr Ly∙∙ onet published, in the Transactions of the
                    Dutch Society of Sciences at Haerlem, a description and plate (as he afterwards
                    did in French at the beginning of his <hi rend="italic">Traite Anatomique)</hi>
                    of the instrument and tools he had invented for the purpose of dissection, and
                    likewise of the method he had used to ascertain the degree of strength of his
                    magnifying glasses. But notwithstanding all his labours, which were considerably
                    increased by the extensive correspondence which he had for many years carried on
                    with several learned persons, he still found means to set apart a large
                    proportion of his time for the immediate service of his country; but he was not
                    fortunate enough to get any other recompense for his exertions than sorrow and
                    disappointment. During the last fifteen or twenty years of his life, Mr Lyonet
                    added to the valuable treasure he had already collected of natural curiosities,
                    a superb cabinet of paintings, consisting of more than 560 performances, amongst
                    which are many of the most eminent works of the first Dutch masters. His object
                    in doing so was to procure him self some amusement during the latter part of his
                    life, when old age and infirmities had weakened his powers, and set bounds to
                    his activity. He had always indeed accustomed himself to employment, insomuch
                    that he wrote some pieces of Dutch poetry; and this disposition remained with
                    him until within a fortnight of his death, when he was attacked with an
                    inflammation in the chest, which, though apparently cured, proved in the end the
                    cause of his death. He died at the Hague in January 1789, aged eighty-thrèe
                    years, leaving behind him a most estimable character.</p>
