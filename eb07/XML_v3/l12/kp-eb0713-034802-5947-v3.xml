                <p><label type="entry">LIMERICK</label>, a maritime county of the province of
                    Munster, in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the estuary of the Shannon and
                    the county of Tipperary, on the east by the same county, on the south by the
                    county of Cork, and on the west by that of Kerry. In extent of surface it ranks
                    as tenth amongst the counties of Ireland. It contains 674,783 acres, of which
                    582,802 acres are fit for cultivation, and only 91,981 are bog or unprofitable
                    mountain.</p>
                <p>It was formerly inhabited by the tribe of the Velaborii. The principal Irish
                    families in it afterwards were the O’Briens, O’Gradys, O’Gormans, M‘Enerys,
                    M‘Sheehys, Moronys, M‘Mahons, and O’Quins. Much of it was confiscated in the
                    time of Cromwell, since which period the proprietorship <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the soil has mostly devolved upon settlers <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    English descent. The county is now divided into the ten baronies of Clanwilliam,
                    Upper and Lower Conello, Coonagh. Coshma, Costlea, Kenry, Owneybeg,
                    Pubble-brian, and Small County, which are again subdivided into 126
                    parishes.</p>
                <p>According to the ecclesiastical arrangements of the country, the county of
                    Limerick comprehends portions of the dioceses of Limerick, Emly, Killaloe, and
                    Cashel. The whole of the first named <hi rend="italic">of</hi> these dioceses, a
                    small portion excepted, is within the county; eighty-five of the parishes which
                    constitute it being within its limits, and three only in the county of Clare.
                    This see is one of the few which is unaffected by the changes introduced into
                    the ecclesiastical divisions of Ireland by the late consolidation or the
                    bishoprics. It is still, as before, to continue united with those of Ardfert and
                    Aghadoe in Kerry. Its revenue is estimated at L.5369 per annum. The cathedral,
                    an ancient and venerable pile, stands in the city <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    Limerick; and the bishop’s palace, a modern mansion, is situated on the bank of
                    the Shannon, at the western extremity of the city. The chapter consists of a
                    dean, precentor, chancellor, treasurer, and archdeacon, and has eleven
                    prebendaries and six vicars-choral connected with it. The see of Emly, united
                    with that of Cashel, has thirty-eight parishes in the county of Limerick, and
                    twenty in that of Tipperary. The seat of the see is in the latter county. One
                    parish of the diocese <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Cashel, and two of that <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Killaloe, are within the limits of the county of
                    Limerick.</p>
                <p>The face of the country, though diversified by numerous small hills, is not
                    mountainous, except on the southeast, where it is bounded by the Galtees, a
                    ridge of considerable extent, and 2500 feet high at its most elevated point,
                    extending into the adjoining county of Tipperary. On the borders of Kerry the
                    surface also rises into a grand amphitheatre of low but steep mountains, that
                    spread themselves out in a wide curve from Loghill to Drumcol-logh. The only
                    river of any size is the Maig, which rises in the Galtees, and discharges itself
                    into the Shannon west of Limerick. It is navigable by barges as far as the town
                    of Adare. A plan to make this river available for the purpose of connecting the
                    cities of Limerick and Cork, by an inland navigation from Adare to Mallow on the
                    Blackwater, has not been carried into effect. The Feale and the Gale, which rise
                    in the western mountain range, are considered as belonging to Kerry, and the
                    Blackwater, which rises in the same range, to Cork. The county is well watered
                    by numerous smaller streams. Its only lake is Lough Gur, about five miles in
                    circumference, and studded with several small islands.</p>
                <p>The soil in the level parts is considered as the richest in Ireland. The Golden
                    Vale, a district which obtained its name from the remarkable exuberance of its
                    fertility, lies mostly in this county. Along the banks of the Shannon are large
                    tracts of marsh land, called corcachs, also celebrated for their richness; a
                    circumstance attributed to the quantity of alluvial mould deposited there by the
                    Shannon when it overflows its banks. In a geological point of view the low
                    country forms part of the great floetz limestone plain of Ireland; but the
                    mountainous district in the south and west consists chiefly of sandstone. A mine
                    of coal or culm is worked at Loghill, but it is found to be better adapted for
                    kilns than for domestic use. At Castleconnel, a town beautifully situated, is a
                    mineral spa of great celebrity from its sanative effects. It is of the same
                    quality as the Poutron at Spa.</p>

                <p>Of the numbers in the latter of these statements, 2064 were Protestants of the
                    established church, 27,735 were Roman Catholics, and 45 were dissenters; but the
                    religious persuasion of 244 was not ascertained. The total number of seliools
                    was 461; of which 27, affording education to 2841 children, were maintained by
                    grants of public money; 29, educating 3274 children, were supported by the
                    voluntary contributions of societies or individuals, and the remaining 405
                    schools, in which 24,040 children were educated, depended wholly on the fees of
                    the pupils.</p>
                <p>The county returned eight members to the Irish parliament; two for the county at
                    large, two for the city of Limerick, and two for each of the boroughs of
                    Askeaton and Kilmallock. The boroughs having been disfranchised at the union,
                    the number of representatives sent to the imperial parliament was fixed at
                    three, two for the county and one for the city. The reform act has added one
                    representative to the latter place.</p>
                <p>The land in the level parts is divided into large farms, many of which are almost
                    exclusively devoted to grazing. In the more hilly region the farms are smaller,
                    and in some parts cut up into holdings much too small for the profitable culture
                    of the soil, or the comfortable support of the cultivators. Still, however, the
                    agricultural produce is considerable. Wheat, barley, oats, and rape, are raised
                    in large quantities. In the year 1709, a colony of Palatines brôught from
                    Germany by Lord Southwell settled near Bruff, Rathkeale, and Adarc. They tended
                    much to improve the state of agriculture, as also that of the linen manufacture.
                    The rich lands on the borders of the rivers produce a kind of flax very
                    different from that of the north; it grows to a great height, and is well
                    adapted for sail-cloth. Hemp was formerly cultivated extensively on the lands of
                    the same quality. The horses are of large size, strong, active, and generally
                    well bred; the heaviest and fattest beasts slaughtered in the southern markets
                    are reared in this county. The sheep are also of a good description, but they
                    are not bred here. Hogs of large size are sent to the same markets. The
                    exportation of cattle and grain is very considerable, constituting the main
                    source of the wealth of the inhabitants. The Shannon, which here assumes the
                    character rather of an estuary of the ocean than of an inland river, supplies
                    marine fish, both round and flat, in great abundance. Pike, carp, tench, trout
                    of large size, and salmon highly esteemed for its flavour, are caught in most of
                    the rivers.</p>
                <p>The manners of the people are similar to those in other parts of the province.
                    Their habits are almost exclusively agricultural. Their dwellings are poor,
                    their food chiefly the potato; their fuel is turf, except near the collieries at
                    Loghill, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the city, where British coal is
                    much used. The Irish language is still spoken by the peasantry in their
                    colloquial intercourse, but the English is universally understood and spoken,
                    excepting perhaps in some of the more retired mountain districts.</p>
                <p>The county possesses many remains of antiquity. The most remarkable of the
                    ancient monastic buildings are in the city of Limerick, where, besides the
                    cathedral, there was a Dominican friary founded by Carbreagh O’Brien, king of
                    Thomond, in which he was interred. Some remains of the monument erected to his
                    memory still exist. In the same city was an Augustinian friary, a convent of
                    black nuns, a Franciscan friary, and a preceptory of knights-templars, besides
                    several other minor religious establishments. Amongst the most admired of the
                    many fine monastic ruins in various parts of the county is the the abbey of
                    Adare.</p>
                <p>The city of Limerick, the capital of the county, is situated on the Shannon,
                    about 100 miles from its mouth, partly <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> on an
                    island and partly on the main land. It is the third city in Ireland in
                    population and importance, being surpassed in these respects only by Dublin and
                    Cork. The number of its inhabitants in 1821 and 1831 was 59,045 and 66,575
                    respectively. The city consists of three principal divisions; the Irish town,
                    the English town, and Newtown Pery. The first is the most ancient, having been
                    built before the arrival of the English in 1172. The second occupies King’s
                    Island, on the Shannon, and was formerly a strongly fortified position. The
                    third was commenced in 1769, by Mr Sexton Pery, from whom it takes its name. It
                    is laid out along the eastern banks of the river, in streets, intersecting each
                    other at right angles with the utmost geometrical precision. The city was
                    formerly considered as the strongest place in Ireland. In 1174 it was taken by
                    the English, but shortly afterwards evacuated by them, and burned, to prevent
                    its occupation being serviceable to the enemy. In 1651 it was taken by Ireton,
                    Cromwell’s lieutenant-general, after a vigorous resistance; and in 1690, its
                    garrison baffled the army of Ki ng William, who conducted the siege in person;
                    but it surrendered on terms the next year to General Ginckel, on which occasion
                    the celebrated treaty of Limerick was concluded. Most of the walls and gates
                    have been demolished, and quays, warehouses, and streets built on their site.
                    The different parts of the town are connected with each other by bridges, of
                    which Thomond Bridge is worthy of notice from its antiquity, and Wellesley
                    Bridge, lately erected, still more so, as being one of the finest specimens of
                    this kind of architecture in the island. Besides the cathedral, and three parish
                    churches, and two chapels of ease of the established church, there are seven
                    Roman Catholic places of worship. The methodists, presbyterians, baptists,
                    independents, and quakers, have each a meeting-house. The court-house is a
                    handsome building. The prison is constructed according to the modern
                    improvements in prison discipline. The other more remarkable public buildings
                    are the Tholsel, which is ornamented with a Tuscan colonnade, the custom-house,
                    the commercial buildings, and the lunatic asylum. The city was originally
                    incorporated by King John, whose charter was confirmed and extended by several
                    succeeding sovereigns. It was first governed by a bailiff, but obtained the
                    privilege of electing mayors and sheriffs ten years before that right was
                    conferred on London. The city officers at present are, the mayor, two sheriffs,
                    a recorder, four charter justices, to which the lord chancellor is empowered to
                    add six more, and a common council, whose number fluctuates from thirty-seven to
                    forty. This body is self-elective. It has also a military governor, constable,
                    and town-major, and is a permanent rmlitary station. The jurisdiction of the
                    city extends over a considerable space, the city and liberties comprehending
                    twenty-one parishes or parts of parishes. One of the principal public
                    institutions is the Chamber of Commerce, incorporated by charter and act of
                    parliament. It is possessed of considerable property, a savings bank, and a
                    mechanics’ institute consisting of about 200 members. The charitable endowments
                    are nu <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205973" xml:id="kp-eb0713-5973-0350"/>merous,
                    and some of them extensive. They are, the house of industry, which supports an
                    average number of 336; the lunatic asylum, fever hospital, lying-in hospital,
                    Magdalen asylum, dispensary, Barrington’s hospital, Villars’s alms-house, asylum
                    for the blind, Hall’s alms-houses, the forty-shillings alms-houses, Craven’s
                    charity, Mrs Rose’s charity, and the jubilee, Pery, and London tavern loan
                    funds. The trade of this place is extensive, and various linen, woollen, cotton,
                    and paper manufactures are carried on in it. Several breweries, distilleries,
                    and saltworks, find permanent employment. The exports chiefly consist of
                    provisions and grain. The imports are, coal, turf, for the carrying of which
                    from Clare and Kerry, 200 barges of twenty tons each are employed; timber, wine,
                    spirits, and all the articles of British and foreign production which the wants
                    or luxuries of a numerous and well-employed population require. Vessels of 400
                    tons’ burden ride at the quay. The navigation from the Atlantic to the city is
                    open and secure, and the inland navigation connects it with Dublin, and all the
                    intermediate line of country. The estimated value of the exports and imports for
                    1832 was, exports L.l,005,727, imports L.289,596. Large quantities of
                    merchandise are brought by the Grand Canal from Dublin.</p>

                <p>Eleven vessels, of about 1760 tons in all, belonged to Limerick ship owners in
                    1832.</p>
                <p>The other towns of some note in the county are, Rathkeale, Shanagolden,
                    Ballingarry, Newcastle, Adare, As-keyton, and Castleconnel. Kilmallock is more
                    remarkable for its remaining vestiges of former greatness than for its present
                    condition. It was the second town in the county, having a charter of
                    incorporation, being surrounded by substantial fortifications, and consisting of
                    a number of large houses, so durably constructed of cut stone, that their ruins
                    have induced some modern topographers to distinguish the place, somewhat
                    quaintly, by the title of the Irish Balbec.</p>
