                <p><label type="entry">LUCIANUS</label>, a celebrated Greek writer, was born at
                    Samosata, the chief city of Commagene, a district situated upon the right bank
                    of the river Euphrates. The precise dates of his birth and death are unknown;
                    but it seems to be generally allowed that he flourished during the reign of the
                    Antonines and of Commodus. Reitz, who has examined this point with much
                    minuteness, makes his life extend between the years 120 and 200 of our era. His
                    own writings supply us with what scanty information we have respecting his
                    private history. His parents, he tells us, were poor, and*found it necessary
                    that their son should at an early period choose the profession by which he was
                    to gain his livelihood. IÍis maternal uncle was a sculptor of some fame at
                    Samosata, and was willing to teach his nephew his own profession; but the youth
                    having contrived awkwardly to break a marble slab which he was set to polish,
                    received a severe beating from his cross-grained uncle. Lucian refused to submit
                    to such treatment, and gave up all thoughts of succeeding to the lucrative
                    business of his uncle. He then turned his attention to a more liberal
                    profession, and devoted himself to the study of law; but becoming disgusted with
                    the chicanery and deceit of which he was obliged to be cognisant, he abandoned
                    his new profession, and applied himself to philosophy. He then visited the
                    different parts of the civilized world; he resided several years in Gaul and in
                    Italy, of which he gives an account in his treatises entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nigrinus,</hi> but chiefly in Athens, where he became thoroughly master of the
                    Greek language. It is believed, from incidents mentioned in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nigrinus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hermotimus,</hi> that Lucian approached his
                    fortieth year when he left Gaul, where he appears to have resided from ten to
                    fifteen years. Massieu imagines that he returned to Samosata, and remained in
                    his native place till Marcus Aurelius conferred upon him a lucrative situation
                    in Egypt. Wieland, however, who examined this part of his life minutely, gives
                    satisfactory reasons for believing that he spent most of his time at Athens,
                    where he composed the greater part of his finest dialogues. He was certainly
                    resident in Greece <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 165, where he witnessed the
                    self-sacrifice of the enthusiast Peregrinus Proteus on the funeral pile, during
                    the celebration of the Olympic games. He spent the latter part of his life in
                    Egypt, but he does not state the precise nature of the office which he filled in
                    that country.</p>
                <p>Lucian is distinguished as a writer for fertility of genius, wit, taste, and
                    elegance, and for the talent of conferring the grace of novelty upon the most
                    common and familiar topics. Notwithstanding the great change in customs and
                    manners, after a lapse of seventeen hundred years, the wit of Lucian is still
                    amusing, his satire still applicable, and his pictures of manners still fresh
                    and vivid. It must be confessed that he sometimes exceeds reasonable bounds
                    whilst he ridicules the absurd superstitions of his countrymen, and laughs at
                    the mountebanks who were decked out with the name of philosophers. Whilst he
                    merely intends <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209080" xml:id="kp-eb0713-9080-0589"
                    />to attack superstition, he is often so carried away by his wit as to ridicule
                    all religious sentiments. He strikes at the very foundation of morality; and the
                    blows which he aims at the hypocrites amongst philosophers, sometimes fall on
                    the good and virtuous. In depicting the manners of the vicious, he is at times
                    obscene and licentious. Amongst the most spirited of his works we may mention,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues of the Gods,</hi> in which Lucian makes the gods
                    converse, as it were, in their domestic capacity and undress, and in moments of
                    weakness, when, not being aware that they were privily overheard by men, they
                    exposed themselves to the view of their worshippers in all their nakedness. In
                    these dramatic scenes they show themselves, by their follies, baseness, and
                    vices, unworthy of the esteem and confidence of mankind. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialogues of the Dead,</hi> in which he ridicules with his peculiar humour the
                    vulgar tenets respecting the state of souls after death, hell-torments, and the
                    deification of dead persons. <hi rend="italic">Timon,</hi> in which there is
                    considerable resemblance to the <hi rend="italic">Plutus</hi> of Aristophanes;
                    <hi rend="italic">the Dream of Micyllus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the
                    Cock</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Jupiter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tragoedus,</hi> the comic title of a little drama of much wit and humour, in
                    which Jupiter gets such serious wounds as he has never since been able to
                    recover. <hi rend="italic">The Convicted Jupiter,</hi> in which Lucian shows the
                    inconsistency of the pagan doctrines concerning fate, the providence of the
                    gods, and the rewards and punishments after death. <hi rend="italic">The Sale of
                    the Philosophers,</hi> in which he exposes the absurd tenets, manners, and
                    principles of every sect. <hi rend="italic">The Angler,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">the resuscitated Philosophers.</hi> In the story of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucius,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Enchanted Ass,</hi> there
                    are several indecent and licentious scenes, though it abounds with humour. This
                    story has been ascribed by some to Lucius of Patrae, and there seems good reason
                    for believing that Lucian merely abridged it; but no one has ever doubted his
                    claim to the story entitled <hi rend="italic">The True History,</hi> a long
                    tissue of incredible adventures, and extraordinary voyages made in seas full of
                    wonders. His intention was to ridicule the impostures which Etesias and lambulus
                    had attempted to palm upon the world as true (stories. The tract entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">How to write History</hi> has been ^unanimously pronounced one of
                    the best and most instructive of his writings. There have been numerous editions
                    of the works of Lucian. The first was published in 1496; Dut the best is that of
                    Hemsterhuys and Reitz, Amster-Ïam, 1743, three vols. 4to, to which is added a
                    fourth olume, <hi rend="italic">Lexico Lucianeum,</hi> by Conrad Reitz, 1746. It
                    ιas been translated into German by Wieland, into Italian ry Gozzi, and into
                    English by Franklin (1780), and Tooke 1820).</p>
