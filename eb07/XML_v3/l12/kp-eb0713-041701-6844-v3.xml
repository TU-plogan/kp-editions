                <p>I.—HISTORY OF LOGARITHMS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> labour and time required for performing the
                    arithmetical operations of multiplication, division, and the extraction of
                    roots, were at one time considerable obstacles to the improvement of various
                    branches of knowledge, and in particular the science of astronomy. But about the
                    end of the sixteenth century and the beginning of the seventeenth, several
                    mathematicians began to consider by what means they might simplify these
                    operations, or substitute for them others more easily performed. Their efforts
                    produced some ingenious contrivances for abridging calculations; but of these
                    the most complete by far was that of John Napier, baron of Merchiston, in
                    Scotland, who invented a system of numbers called <hi rend="italic"
                    >logarithms,</hi> so adapted to the numbers to be multiplied or divided, that
                    these being arranged in the form of a table, each opposite the number called its
                    logarithm, the product of any two numbers in the table was found opposite that
                    formed by the addition of their logarithms; and, on the contrary, the quotient
                    arising from the division of one number by another was found opposite that
                    formed by the subtraction of the logarithm of the divisor from that of the
                    dividend; and similar simplifications took place in the still more laborious
                    operations of involution and evolution. But before we proceed to relate more
                    particularly the circumstances of this invention, it will be proper to give a
                    general view of the nature of logarithms, and of the circumstances which render
                    them of use in calculation.</p>
                <p>Let there be formed two series of numbers, the one constituting a geometrical
                    progression, whose first term is unity or 1, and the common ratio any number
                    whatever; and the other an arithmetical progression, whose first term is 0, and
                    the common difference also any number whatever; for example, suppose the common
                    ratio of tþe geometrical series to be 2, and the common difference of the
                    arithmetical series 1, and let them be written thus:</p>

                <p>Here the terms in the arithmetical series are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >logarithms</hi> of the corresponding terms of the geometrical series; that is,
                    0 is the logarithm of 1, and 1 is the logarithm of 2, and 2 is the logarithm of
                    4, and 3 that of 8, and so on.</p>
                <p>From the manner in which the two series are related to each other, it will
                    readily appear by induction that the logarithms of the terms of the geometrical
                    series have the two following properties:</p>
                <p>1. The sum of the logarithms of any two numbers or terms in the geometrical
                    series is the logarithm of that number, or term of the series, which is equal to
                    their product.</p>
                <p>For example, let the terms of the geometrical series be 4 and 32; the
                    corresponding terms of the arithmetical series (that is, their logarithms) are 2
                    and 5: now the product of the numbers is 128, and the sum of their logarithms is
                    7; and it appears by inspection of the two series, that the latter number is the
                    logarithm of the former, agreeing with the proposition we are illustrating. In
                    like manner, if the numbers or terms of the geometrical series be 16 and 64, the
                    logarithms of which are 4 and 6, we find from the table that 10=4 + 6 is the
                    logarithm of 1024= 16 × 64; and so of any other numbers in the table.</p>
                <p>2. The difference of the logarithms of any two numbers or terms of the
                    geometrical series is the logarithm of that term which is the quotient arising
                    from the division of the one number by the other.</p>
                <p>Take, for example, the terms 128 and 32, the logarithms of which are 7 and 5; the
                    greater of these numbers divided by the less is 4, and the difference of their
                    logarithms is 2; and by inspecting the two series, this, last number will be
                    found to be the logarithm of the former. In like manner, if the terms of the
                    geometrical series be 1024 and 16, the logarithms of which are 10 and 4, we find
                    that 1024 ÷ 16 = 64, and that 10 — 4 = 6; now, in the table, the latter number,
                    viz. 6, is the logarithm of the former, 64.</p>
                <p>These two properties of logarithms, the second of which indeed is an immediate
                    consequence of the first, enable us to find with great facility the product or
                    the quotient of any two terms of a geometrical series to which there is adapted
                    an arithmetical series, so that each number has its logarithm opposite to it, as
                    in the preceding short table. For it is evident, that to multiply two numbers,
                    we have only to add their logarithms, and opposite to that logarithm which is
                    the sum we shall find the product required. Thus, to multiply 16 by 128; to 4
                    the logarithm of 16, add 7 the logarithm of 128, and opposite the sum 11, we
                    find 2048, the product sought. On the other hand, to divide any number in the
                    table by any other, we subtract the logarithm of the divisor from that of the
                    dividend, and look for the remainder among the logarithms, and opposite to it we
                    find the number sought. Thus, to divide 2048 by 128; from 11, the logarithm of
                    2048, we subtract 7, the logarithm of 128, and opposite the remainder 4, we find
                    16, the quotient sought.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose any number of geometrical means to be interposed between each
                    two adjoining terms of the preceding geometrical series, and the same number of
                    arithmetical means between every two adjoining terms of the arithmetical series;
                    then, as the results will still be a geometrical and an arithmetical series, the
                    interpolated terms of the latter will be the logarithms of the corresponding
                    terms of the former, and the two new series will have the very same properties
                    as the original series.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the number of interpolated means to be very great, it will follow
                    that among the terms of the resulting geometrical series, some one or other will
                    be found nearly equal to any proposed number whatever. Therefore, although the
                    preceding table exhibits the logarithms of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, &amp;c. but does not
                    contain those of the intermediate numbers, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, &amp;c. yet it is
                    easy to conceive that a table might be formed by interpolation which should
                    contain, amongst the terms of the geometrical series, all numbers whatever to a
                    certain extent (or at least others very nearly equal to them), together with
                    their logarithms. If such a table were constructed, or at least if such terms
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206857" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6857-0418"/>of the
                    geometrical progression were found, together with their logarithms, as were
                    either accurately equal to, or coin-eided nearly with, all numbers within
                    certain limits (for example, between 1 and 100,000), then, as often as we had
                    occasion to multiply or divide any numbers contained in that table, we might
                    evidently obtain the products or quotients by the simple operations of addition
                    and subtraction.</p>
                <p>The first invention of logarithms has been attributed by some to Longomontanus,
                    and by others to Juste Byrge, two mathematicians contemporary with Napier; but
                    there is no reason to suppose that either of these anticipated him, for
                    Longomontanus never published any thing on the subject, although he lived
                    thirty-three years after Napier had made known his discovery; and as to Byrge,
                    he is indeed known to have printed a table containing an arithmetical and a
                    geometrical progression written opposite to each other, so as to form in effect
                    a system of logarithms of the same kind as those invented by Napier, without
                    however explaining their nature and use, although it appears from the title he
                    intended to do so, but was probably prevented by some cause unknown to us. But
                    this work was not printed till 1620, six years after Napier had published his
                    discovery, namely, in 1611, in a book entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mirifici</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonis
                    Descriptio</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he reserved the construction of the
                    numbers till the opinion of the learned concerning his invention should be
                    known. It is therefore with good reason that Napier is now universally
                    considered as the first, and most probably the only inventor. His work contains
                    a table of the natural sines and cosines, and their logarithms, for every minute
                    of the quadrant, as also the differences between the logarithmic sines and
                    cosines, which are in effect the logarithmic tangents. There is no table of the
                    logarithms of numbers; but preeepts are given, by which they, as well as the
                    logarithmic tangents, may be found from the table of natural and logarithmic
                    sines.</p>
                <p>In explaining the nature of logarithms, Napier supposes some determinate line
                    which represents the radius of a circle to be continually diminished, so as to
                    have successively all possible values, and thus to be equal to every sine, one
                    after another, throughout the quadrant. And he supposes this diminution to be
                    effected by a point moving from one extremity towards the other extremity (or
                    rather some point very near it), with a motion that is not uniform, but
                    deereases gradually in such a manner, that if the whole time between the
                    beginning and the end of the motion be conceived to be divided into a very great
                    number of equal portions, the decrements taken away in each of these shall be to
                    one another as the respective remainders of the line. According to this mode of
                    conceiving the line to deerease, it is easy to show that at the end of any
                    successive equal intervals of time from the beginning of the motion, the
                    portions of the line which remain will constitute a decreasing geometrical
                    progression.</p>
                <p>Again, he supposes another line to be generated by a point which moves along it
                    equably, or which passes over equal intervals of it in equal times. Thus the
                    portions of the line generated at the end of any equal successive intervals of
                    time from the beginning of the motion will form a series of quantities in
                    arithmetical progression. Now if the two motions be supposed to begin together,
                    the remainders of the one line at the end of any equal intervals of time will
                    form a series of quantities in geometrical progression, while the corresponding
                    portions generated of the other-line will constitute a series in arithmetical
                    progression, so that the latter will be the logarithms of the former. And as the
                    terms of the geometrical progression deerease continually from radius, which is
                    the greatest term, to 0, while the terms of the corresponding arithmetical
                    progression increase from 0 upwards, according to Napier’s system the logarithm
                    of radius is 0, and the logarithms of the sines from radius down to 0 are a
                    series of numbers increasing from 0 to infinity.</p>
                <p>The velocities or degrees of quickness with which the motions commence may have
                    to each other any ratio whatever, and by assuming different ratios we obtain
                    different systems of logarithms. Napier supposed the initial velocities to be
                    equal; but the system of logarithms produced in consequence of this assumption
                    having been found to have some disadvantages, it has been long superseded by a
                    more convenient one, as we shall presently have occasion to explain.</p>
                <p>Napier’s work having been written in Latin, was translated into English by Mr
                    Edward Wright, an ingenious mathematician of that period, and inventor of the
                    principles of what is commonly though erroneously called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercator s sailing.</hi> The translation being sent to Napier for his perusal,
                    was returned with his approbation, and with the addition of a few lines,
                    intimating that he intended to make some alterations in the system of logarithms
                    in a second edition. Mr Wright died soon after he received back his translation;
                    but it was published after his death in 1616, accompanied with a dedication by
                    his son to the East India Company, and a preface by Henry Briggs, who afterwards
                    distinguished himself by improving the form or system of logarithms. Mr Briggs
                    likewise gave in this work the description and draught of a scale which had been
                    invented by Wright, as also various methods of his own for finding a logarithm
                    to a given number, and a number to a given logarithm, by means of Napier’s
                    table, the use of which had been attended with some inconvenience, on account of
                    its containing only such numbers as were the natural sines to every minute of
                    the quadrant and their logarithms. There was an additional inconvenience in
                    using the table, arising from the logarithms being partly positive and partly
                    negative. The latter of these was, however, well remedied by John Speidell in
                    his <hi rend="italic">New Logarithms,</hi> first published in 1619, which
                    contained the sines, cosines, tangents, cotangents, secants, and cosecants, and
                    given in such a form as to be all positive; and the former was still more
                    completely removed by an additional table, which he gave in the sixth impression
                    of his work in 1624, and which contained the logarithms of the integers 1, 2,
                    3,4, &amp;c. to 1000, together with their differences and arithmetical
                    complements, &amp;c. This table, which is of great use in finding fluents, is
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">hyperbolic logarithms,</hi> because the
                    numbers serve to express the areas contained between a hyperbola and its
                    asymptote, and limited by ordinates drawn parallel to the other asymptote. This
                    name, however, is certainly improper, as the same spaces may represent the
                    logarithms of any system whatever.</p>
                <p>In 1619, Robert Napier, son of the inventor of logarithms, published a second
                    edition of his father’s <hi rend="italic">Logarithmorum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Canonis Descriptio</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, along with this, the
                    promised <hi rend="italic">Logarithmorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonis
                    Constructio,</hi> and other pieces written by his father and Mr Briggs. An exact
                    copy of the same two works in one volume was also printed in 1620 at Lyons in
                    France. In 1618 or 1619, Benjamin Ursinus, mathematician to the elector of
                    Brandenburg, published Napier’s tables of logarithms in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cursus Mathematicus,</hi> to which he added some tables of proportional parts;
                    and in 1624 he printed his <hi rend="italic">Trigonometric</hi> with a table of
                    natural sines, and their logarithms of the Napierian kind and form, to every ten
                    seconds of the quadrant.</p>
                <p>In the same year, 1624. the celebrated John Kepler published, at Marpurg,
                    logarithms of nearly the same kind, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Chilias
                    Logarithmorum ad</hi><hi rend="italic">totidem Numeros Rotundos,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">praemissa</hi><hi rend="italic">Demonstratione legitima Ortus
                    Logarithmorum eorumque Usus,</hi> &amp;c.; and in the following year he
                    published a supplement to this work. In the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206870"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6870-0419"/>preface to this last he says, that several of the
                    professors of mathematics in Upper Germany, and more especially those who were
                    advanced in years, and grown averse to new methods of reasoning which carried
                    them out of their old principles and habits, doubted whether Napier’s
                    demonstration of the property of logarithms was perfectly true, and whether the
                    application of them to trigonometrical calculations might not be unsafe, and
                    lead the calculator who should trust in them to erroneous results; and in either
                    case, whether the doctrine were true or not, they scarcely considered Napier’s
                    demonstration of it as legitimate and satisfactory. This opinion induced Kepler
                    to compose the above-mentioned work, in which the whole doctrine is treated in a
                    manner strictly geometrical, and free from the considerations of motion to which
                    those elderly Germans had objected.</p>
                <p>On the publication of Napier’s Logarithms, Mr FIenry Briggs, some time professor
                    of geometry in Gresham College, London, and afterwards Savilian professor of
                    geometry at Oxford, applied himself with great earnestness to the study and
                    improvement of them. From the particular view which Napier took of the subject,
                    and the manner in which he conceived logarithms to be generated, it happened
                    that in his system the logarithms of a series of numbers which increased in a
                    decuple ratio (as 1, 10, 100, 1000, &amp;c.) formed a decreasing arithmetical
                    series, whose common difference was 2∙320585l. But it occurred to Briggs that it
                    would be better and more conformable to the received decimal notation, to adopt
                    a system in which the logarithms of the terms of such a geometrical series
                    should differ from each other by unity or 1. This idea Briggs communicated to
                    the public in his lectures, and also to Napier himself. He even went twice to
                    Edinburgh to converse with him on the subject; and, on his first visit, Napier
                    said that be had also formerly thought of the same improvement, but that he
                    chose to publish the logarithms he had previously calculated, till such time as
                    his health and convenience would allow him to make others more commodious. And
                    whereas, in the change which Briggs proposed, it was intended to make the
                    logarithms of the sines to increase from 0 (the logarithm of radius) to
                    infinity, whilst the sines themselves should decrease, it was suggested to him
                    by Napier that it would be better to make them increase, so that 0, instead of
                    being the logarithm of radius, should be the logarithm of 1, and that 100,000,
                    &amp;c. should be the logarithm of radius. This Briggs admitted would be an
                    improvement; and having changed the numbers he had already calculated so as to
                    make them suit Napier’s modification of his plan, he returned with them next
                    year to Edinburgh, and submitted them to his perusal.</p>
                <p>It appears, therefore, that whether Napier or Briggs was the inventor of this
                    improved system of logarithms which has since been universally adopted, Napier
                    had suggested to begin with the low number 1, and to make the logarithms, or the
                    artificial numbers, as he had always called them, to increase with the natural
                    numbers, instead of decreasing; which, however, made no alteration in the
                    figures, but only in their affections or signs, changing them from negative to
                    positive.</p>
                <p>On Briggs’s return from Edinburgh, in 1617, he printed the first thousand
                    logarithms to eight places of figures, besides the index, with the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Logarithmorum Chilias</hi><hi rend="italic">prima;</hi> but these
                    seem not to have been published till after the death of Napier, for in his
                    preface he expresses a hope that the circumstances which led to a change in the
                    system would be explained in Napier’s posthumous work, about to appear. But
                    although Napier had intimated in a note he had given in Wright’s translation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Mirificus,</hi> as well as in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Rabdologia,</hi> printed in 1617, that he intended to
                    alter the scale, yet he does not state that Briggs was the first to think of
                    this improvement, or to publish it. And as nothing was said on this point in
                    Napier’s posthumous work published in 1619 by his son, Briggs took occasion, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmixa,</hi> to
                    assert his claims to the improvement which he had carried into execution. But he
                    has by no means proved that he himself, and not Napier, was the first who had
                    thought of such improvements.</p>
                <p>In 1620, Mr Edmund Gunter published his <hi rend="italic">Canon of
                    Triangles,</hi> which contains the artificial or logarithmic sines and tangents
                    to every minute to seven places of figures besides the index, the logarithm of
                    radius being 10. These logarithms are of the kind which had been agreed upon
                    between Napier and Briggs, and they were the first tables of logarithmic sines
                    and tangents that were published of this sort. Gunter also, in 1623, reprinted
                    the same in his book <hi rend="italic">De Sectore</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Radio,</hi> together with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chilias</hi><hi rend="italic">prima</hi> of Briggs; and in the same year he
                    applied the logarithms of numbers, sines, and tangents, to straight lines drawn
                    upon a ruler. This instrument is now in common, use for navigation and other
                    purposes, and is commonly called <hi rend="italic">Gunter s Scale.</hi></p>
                <p>The discoveries in logarithms were carried to France by Mr Edmund Wingate, but
                    not first of all, as he says in the preface to his book. He published at Paris
                    in 1624 two small tracts in French upon logarithms, which were reprinted with
                    improvements at London in 1626.</p>
                <p>In the year 1624, Briggs published his <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Logarithmica,</hi> a stupendous work, considering the short time
                    he had been in preparing it. He there gives the logarithms of 30,000 natural
                    numbers to fourteen places of figures, besides the index; namely, from 1 to
                    20,000, and from 90,000 to 100,000, together with the differences of the
                    logarithms. He also gives an ample treatise on their construction and use, and
                    he earnestly solicits others to undertake the computation of the intermediate
                    numbers, offering to give instructions, and paper ready ruled for that purpose,
                    to any person inclined to contribute to the completion of so valuable a work. By
                    this invitation, he had hopes of collecting materials for the logarithms of the
                    intermediate 70,000 numbers, whilst he should employ his time upon the Canon of
                    Logarithmic Sines and Tangents, and so carry on both works at once.</p>
                <p>Soon after this, Adrian Vlacq or Flack of Gouda, in Holland, completed the
                    intermediate 70 chiliads, and republished the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmica</hi> in 1627 and 1628, with
                    these intermediate numbers, making in all the logarithms of all numbers to
                    100,000, but only to 10 places of figures. To these was added a table of
                    artificial sines, tangents, and secants, to every minute of the quadrant.</p>
                <p>Briggs himself lived also to complete a table of logarithmic sines and tangents,
                    to the 100th part of every degree to fourteen places of figures, besides the
                    index, together with a table of natural sines to the same parts to fifteen
                    places, and the tangents and secants of the same to ten places, with the
                    construction of the whole. But death prevented him from completing the
                    application and uses of them. However, when dying, he committed this to his
                    friend Henry Gellibrand, who accordingly added a preface, and the application of
                    the logarithms to plane and spherical trigonometry. The work was called <hi
                    rend="italic">Trigonometria Britannica,</hi> and was printed at Gouda in 1633,
                    under the care of Adrian Vlacq, who in the same year printed bis own <hi

                    to 10 places of figures, with their differences for every ten seconds in the
                    quadrant. It also contains Briggs’s table of the first 20,000 logarithms to ten
                    places, besides the index, with their differences; and to the whole is prefixed
                    a description of the tables and their applications, <pb break="no"

                    Briggs’s <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria Eñtannica</hi> just mentioned.</p>
                <p>Gellibrand also published, in 1635, <hi rend="italic">An Institution
                    Trigonometrical,</hi> containing the logarithms of the first 10,000 numbers,
                    with the natural sines, tangents, and secants, and the logarithmic sines and
                    tangents, for degrees and minutes; all to seven decimal places.</p>
                <p>The writers whose works we have hitherto noticed were for the most part computers
                    of logarithms. But the system best adapted to practice being now well
                    ascertained, and the labour of constructing the table accomplished, succeeding
                    writers on the subject have had little more to do than to give the tables in the
                    most convenient form. It is true, that in consequence of the numerous
                    discoveries which were afterwards made in mathematics, particularly in the
                    doctrine of series, great improvements were made in the method of computing
                    logarithms; but these, for the most part, came too late to be of use in the
                    actual construction of the tables, although they might be applied with advantage
                    to verify calculations ^previously performed by methods much more laborious, and
                    to detect various errors which had crept into the numbers.</p>
                <p>As it is of importance that such as have occasion to employ logarithms should
                    know what works are esteemed for their extent and accuracy, we shall mention the
                    following;</p>
                <p>Sherwin’s <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Tables,</hi> in 8vo. These contain the
                    logarithms of all numbers to 101,000; and the sines, tangents, secants, and
                    versed sines, both natural and logarithmic, to every minute of the quadrant. The
                    third edition, printed in 1742, which was revised by Gardiner, is esteemed the
                    most correct; but, in the fifth edition, the errors are so numerous, that no
                    dependence can be placed on it.</p>
                <p>Gardiner’s Tables of Logarithms for all numbers to 101.000, and for the sines and

                    72 minutes to every single second, &amp;c. This work, which is in quarto, was
                    printed in 1742, and is held in high estimation for its accuracy. An edition of
                    the same work, with some additions, was printed in 1770, at Avignon, in France;
                    and another by Callet at Paris in 1783, with farther improvements. The tables in
                    both are to seven places of figures.</p>

                <p>There are various smaller sets of tables; but probably the most accurate of all
                    are those which Professor Babbage has produced with his very ingenious
                    calculating machine, which has enabled him to detect a variety of errors in
                    former tables. But, what is rather amusing, on examining a set of tables printed
                    in the Chinese character, and which, like every Chinese invention, were older
                    than the deluge, Mr Babbage found they contained precisely the same errors as
                    those of Vlacq did; thus proving, as had long been suspected, from what source
                    those original inventors had derived their logarithms.</p>
                <p>In addition to these, it is proper that we should notice a stupendous work
                    relating to logarithms, originally suggested by the celebrated Carnot, in
                    conjunction with Prieur de la Côte d’Or, and Brunet de Montpellier, about the
                    beginning of the French revolution. This enterprise was committed in 1794 to the
                    care of Baron de Prony, a mathematician of great eminence, who was <hi

                <p>II.—NATURE OF LOGARITHMS, AND THEIR CONSTRUCTION.</p>
                <p>We have already shown that the properties of logarithms are deducible from those
                    of two series, the terms of one of which form a geometrical progression, and
                    those of the other an arithmetical progression; and as this manner of treating
                    the subject is simple, it is perhaps the best adapted of any to such of our
                    readers as have not pursued the study of mathematics to any great extent. We
                    shall now show how, from the same principles, the logarithm of any proposed
                    number may be found, as was done by the earlier computers, though it is far from
                    affording the easiest mode of forming a table.</p>
                <p>The first step to be taken in constructing a system of logarithms is to assume
                    the logarithm of some determinate number, besides that of unity or 1, which must
                    necessarily be 0. From the particular view which Napier first took of the
                    subject, he was led to assume unity for the logarithm of the number 2∙718282, by
                    which it happened that the logarithm of 10 was 2·302585; and this assumption
                    being made, the form of the system became determinate, and the logarithm of
                    every number fixed to one particular value.</p>
                <p>It was, however, soon observed, that it would be better to assume unity for the
                    logarithm of 10, instead of making it the logarithm of 2∙718282, as in Napier’s
                    first system; and hence the logarithms of the terms of the geometrical
                    progression</p>
                <p>1, 10, 100, 1000, 10,000, &amp;c. were necessarily fixed to the corresponding
                    terms of this arithmetical progression,</p>
                <p>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206896" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6896-0421"/>
                <p>That is, the logarithm of 1 being 0, and that of 10 being 1, the logarithm of 100
                    is 2, that of 1000 is 3, and so on.</p>
                <p>The logarithms of the terms of the progression 1, 10, 100, 1000, &amp;c. being
                    thus determined; in order to form the logarithms of the numbers between 1 and
                    10, and between 10 and 100, and so on, we must conceive a very great number of
                    geometrical means to be interposed between each two adjoining terms of the
                    preceding geometrical series, and as many arithmetical means between the
                    corresponding terms of the arithmetical series; then, like as the terms of the
                    arithmetical series 0, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. are the logarithms of the corresponding
                    terms of the geometrical series 1, 10, 100, 1000, &amp;c. the interpolated terms
                    of the former will also be the logarithms of the corresponding interpolated
                    terms of the latter. Now, by supposing the number of means interposed between
                    each two terms of the geometrical series to be sufficiently great, some one or
                    other of them may be found which will be very nearly equal to any proposed
                    number. Hence, to find the logarithm of such a number, we have only to seek for
                    one of the interpolated means which is very nearly equal to it, and to take the
                    logarithm of that mean as a near value of the logarithm required.</p>
                <p>As a particular example, let it be required to find the logarithm of 5, according
                    to Briggs’s system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First step of the process.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    number 5 is between 1 and 10, the logarithms of which we already know to be 0
                    and 1: Let a geometrical mean be found between the two former, and an
                    arithmetical mean between the two latter. The geometrical mean will be the
                    square root of the product of the numbers 1 and 10, which is 3∙162277; and the
                    arithmetical mean will be half the sum of the logarithms 0 and 1, which is 0∙5;
                    therefore the logarithm of 3∙162277 is 0∙5. But as the mean thus found is not
                    sufficiently near the proposed number, we must proceed with the operation as
                    follows:</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Second step.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The number 5, whose
                    logarithm is sought, is between 3 ’ 162277, the mean last found, and 10, the
                    logarithms of which we know to be 0∙5 and 1; we must now find a geometrical mean
                    between the two former, and an arithmetical mean between the two latter. The one
                    of these is √(3∙162277 X 10) = 5∙623413, and the other is <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Third step.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> We have now obtained
                    two numbers, namely, 3∙162277 and 5∙623413, one on each side of 5, together with
                    their logarithms 0∙5 and 0∙75; we therefore, proceeding as before, find the
                    geometrical mean, or √(3∙ 162277 X 5∙623413), to be 4∙216964, and the
                    arithmetical mean <hi rend="strikethrough">θ</hi><hi rend="strikethrough"
                    >-ð</hi> = 0∙625, the logarithm of 4∙216964.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fourth step.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> We proceed in the
                    same manner with the numbers 4∙216964, and 5∙623413 (one of which is less and
                    the other greater than 5), and their logarithms 0∙625 and 0∙75, and find a new
                    geometrical mean, viz. 4∙869674, and the corresponding arithmetical mean or
                    logarithm 0∙6875.</p>
                <p>We must go on in this way till we have found twenty-two geometrical means, and as
                    many corresponding arithmetical means or logarithms. And that we may indicate
                    how these are found from each other, let the numbers 1 and 10 be denoted by A
                    and B, and their geometrical means taken in their order by C, D, E, &amp;c. then
                    the results of the successive operations will be as in the following table:</p>

                </table>
                <p>As the last of these means, viz. Z, agrees with 5, the proposed number, as far at
                    least as the sixth place of decimals, we may safely consider them as very nearly
                    equal, and therefore their logarithms very nearly equal; that is, the logarithm
                    of 5 will be 0∙6989700 nearly.</p>
                <p>In performing the operations indicated in the preceding table, it is necessary to
                    find the geometrical means at the beginning to many more figures than are here
                    put down, in order to insure at last a result true to 7 decimal places. Thus it
                    appears that the labour of computing logarithms by this method is indeed very
                    great. It is, however, that which was employed by Briggs and Vlacq in the
                    original construction of logarithms; but since their time more easy methods have
                    been found, some of which we shall presently have occasion to explain; and a
                    still easier method by Sir John Leslie will be found at the end of this
                    article.</p>
                <p>The logarithm of any number whatever may be found by a series of calculations
                    similar to that just explained. But in constructing the table it would only be
                    necessary to have recourse to this method in calculating the logarithms of prime
                    numbers; for as often as the logarithm of a number which was the product of
                    other numbers, whose logarithms were known, was required, it would be
                    immediately obtained by adding together the logarithms of its factors. On the
                    contrary, if the logarithm of the product of two numbers were known, and also
                    that of one of its factors, the logarithm of the other factor would be obtained
                    from these, by simply taking their difference.</p>
                <p>From this last remark it is obvious, that having now found the logarithm of 5, we
                    can immediately find that of 2; for since 2 is the quotient of 10 divided by 5,
                    its logarithm will be the difference of the logarithms of 10 and 5; now the
                    logarithm of 10 is 1, and that of 5 is 0∙6989700, therefore the logarithm of 2
                    is 0∙3010300.</p>
                <p>FIaving thus obtained the logarithms of 2 and 5, in addition to those of 10,
                    100,1000, &amp;c. we may thence find the logarithms of innumerable other
                    numbers. Thus, because 4 = 2×2, the logarithm of 4 will be the logarithm of 2
                    added to itself, or will be twice the logarithm of 2. Again, because 5 X 10 =
                    50, the logarithm of 50 will be the sum of the logarithms of 5 and 10. In this
                    manner it is evident we may find the logarithms of 8 =2 × 4, of 16 = 2 X 8, of
                    2o = 5 X 5, and of as many more such numbers as we please.</p>
                <p>Besides the view we have hitherto taken of the theory of logarithms, there are
                    others under which it has been presented by different authors. Some of these we
                    proceed to explain, beginning with that in which they are defined to be the <hi
                    rend="italic">measures of ratios</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but to see the
                    propriety of this definition, it must be understood what is meant by the measure
                    of a ratio.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206909" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6909-0422"/>
                <p>According to the usual definition of a compound ratio, if there be any number of
                    magnitudes A, B, C, D, in continued proportion, the ratio of the first, A, to
                    the third, C, is considered as made up of two ratios, each equal the ratio of
                    the first, A, to the second, B. And in like manner the ratio of the first, A, to
                    the fourth, D, is considered as made of three ratios, each equal the same ratio
                    of the first to the second, and so on. Thus, to take a particular example in
                    numbers, because the ratio of 81 to 3 may be considered as made up of the ratio
                    of 81 to 27, and of 27 to 9, and of 9 to 3, which three ratios are equal among
                    themselves, the ratio of 81 to 3 will be triple that of 9 to 3; and in like
                    manner the ratio of 27 to 3 will be double that of 9 to 3. Also, because the
                    ratios of 1000 to 100, 100 to 10, 10 to 1, are all equal, the ratio of 1000 to 1
                    will be three times as great as that of 10 to 1; and the ratio of 100 to 1 will
                    be twice as great; and so on.</p>
                <p>Taking this view of ratios, and considering them as a particular species of
                    quantities, made up of others of the same kind, they may evidently be compared
                    with each other in the same manner as we compare lines or quantities of any kind
                    whatever. And as, when estimating the relative magnitude of two quantities, two
                    lines, for example, if the one contains five such equal parts as the other
                    contains seven, we say the one line has to the other the proportion of 5 to 7;
                    so, in like manner, if two ratios be such, that the* one can be resolved into
                    five equal ratios, and the other into seven of the same ratios, we may conclude
                    that the magnitude of the one ratio is to that of the other as the number 5 to
                    the number 7; and a similar conclusion may be drawn, when the ratios to be
                    compared are any multiples whatever of some other ratio.</p>
                <p>Since lines and other quantities, which admit of no common measure, are said to
                    be incommensurable to each other, the same will obviously happen to ratios; that
                    is, there may be two ratios such, that into whatever number of equal ratios the
                    one is divided, the other cannot possibly be exactly equal to a ratio composed
                    of any integral number of these. We may, however, conceive the number of equal
                    ratios into which the one is divided to be so great, that a certain number of
                    them shall compose a ratio more nearly equal to the other ratio than by any
                    assignable difference. Therefore, like as we can always find numbers which shall
                    have among themselves, either accurately, or as nearly as we please, the same
                    ratios as lines or other magnitudes have to each other, and which therefore may
                    be taken as the measures or representatives of the lines; so also, corresponding
                    to any system of ratios, there may be always found a series of numbers which
                    will have the same proportions among themselves as the ratios have to each
                    other, and which may in like manner be called the <hi rend="italic">measures of
                    the ratios.</hi></p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that unity, or 1, is assumed as the common consequent or
                    second term of all ratios whatever; and that the ratio of 10 (or some particular
                    number) to 1 is compounded of a very great number of equal ratios, as, for
                    example, 1,000,000: then, as each of these will be very near the ratio of
                    equality (for it will be the ratio of the first term to the second of a series
                    consisting of one million and one continued proportionals, the first of which is
                    10 and last 1), it will follow, and is easy to conceive, that the ratios of all
                    other numbers to unity will each be very nearly equal to some multiple of that
                    small ratio. And by supposing the number of small equal ratios of which the
                    ratio of 10 to 1 is composed, to be sufficiently great, the ratios of all other
                    numbers to unity may be as nearly equal to ratios which are multiples of that
                    small ratio, as we please. Let us still suppose, however, for the sake of
                    illustration, that the number of small ratios contained in that of 10 to 1 is
                    1,000,000; then, as it may be proved that the ratio of 2 to 1 will be very
                    nearly the same as a ratio composed of 301,030 of these, and that the ratio of 3
                    to 1 will be nearly equal to a ratio composed of 477,121 of them, and that the
                    ratio of 4 to 1 will be nearly equal to a ratio composed of 602,060 of them, and
                    so on; these numbers, viz. 1,000,000, 301,030, 477,121, and 602,060, or any
                    other numbers proportional to them, will be the <hi rend="italic">measures</hi>
                    of the ratios of 10 to 1, 2 to 1, 3 to 1, and 4 to 1, respectively; and the same
                    quantities will also be what have been called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >logarithms</hi> of the ratios; for the word <hi rend="italic">logarithm,</hi>
                    if regard be had to its etymology, is <hi rend="italic">∖οyο&gt;ν αp0μοι,</hi>
                    or the numbers of small and equal ratios (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >rati-unculae,</hi> as they have been called) contained in the several ratios of
                    quantities one to another.</p>
                <p>We have, for the sake of illustration, assumed 1,000,000 as the measure of the
                    ratio of 10 to 1, by which it Happens, as already observed, that the measures of
                    the ratios of 2 to 1, 3 to 1, &amp;c. are 301,030 and 477,121 respectively; as,
                    however, these measures are not absolute, but relative quantities, we may assume
                    any other numbers whatever instead of these, provided they are proportional to
                    them. Accordingly, we may assume 1 as the measure or logarithm of the ratio of
                    10 to I; and then the logarithms of the ratios of 2 to 1, 3 to 1, &amp;c.
                    instead of being 301,030, 477,121, &amp;c. will be ∙301030 and ∙477121, &amp;c.
                    respectively, that is, each will be one millionth of what it was be fore.</p>
                <p>In Briggs’s system, the logarithm of the ratio of 10 to 1, or, to speak briefly,
                    the logarithm of 10, is unity; but we are at liberty to assume any number
                    whatever, as that whose logarithm shall be unity. Napier, in consequence of his
                    particular views, chose 2,718,282; and hence it happens that the logarithms of
                    the ratios are expressed by different numbers in the two systems.</p>
                <p>But, to show the identity of the properties of logarithms, as explained in the
                    two different views now given of the subject, let A and B denote any two
                    numbers. The ratio of their product to unity, that is, the ratio of A × B to 1,
                    is compounded of the ratio of A to 1 and of B to 1; and consequently the
                    logarithm of the ratio of A × B to 1 will equal the sum of the logarithms of the
                    ratios of A to 1, and of B to 1; or, in other words, the logarithm of A × B will
                    be the sum of the logarithms of A and B. Now, log. (A X B) = log. A + log. B,
                    therefore, log. B = log. (A X B)</p>
                <p>C</p>
                <p>— log. A. Let — be substituted for B, and D for A, then</p>
                <p>C <hi rend="italic">C</hi></p>
                <p>(because A × B ∑∑ D X - - C}we have log. — = log. C — log. D.</p>
                <p>Such is a short sketch of the theory of logarithms as deducible from the doctrine
                    of ratios. It was in this way that the celebrated Kepler treated the subject;
                    and he has been followed by Mercator, Halley, and Cotes, as well as by
                    mathematicians of later times, as by Baron Maseres in his Trigonometry. The same
                    mode was likewise adopted in the posthumous works of Dr Robert Simson. As,
                    however, the doctrine of ratios is very abstract, and the mode of reasoning upon
                    which it has been established is of a peculiar and subtile kind, we presume that
                    the greater number of readers will think this view of the subject less simple
                    and natural than the following, in which we mean to deduce the theory of
                    logarithms, as well as the manner of computing them, from the properties of the
                    exponents of powers.</p>
                <p>The common scale of notation in arithmetic is so contrived as to express all
                    numbers whatever by the powers of 10, which is the root of the scale, and the
                    nine digits serving as co-efficients to these powers. Thus, if R denote 10, the
                    root of the scale, so that R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> will denote 100, and
                    R <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> 1000, and so on, the number 471,509 is

                <p>But instead of expressing all numbers by the sums of certain multiples of the
                    successive powers of some particular number, we may also express them, if not
                    accurately, at least as near as we please, by a single power, whole or
                    fractional, of any positive number whatever, which may be either whole or

                <p>Hence we may conclude, that if <hi rend="italic">r</hi> be put for some
                    determinate number, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> for any indefinite positive
                    number, whole or fractional, it is always possible to find another number N,
                    such that <hi rend="italic">r</hi> being raised to the power N, shall either be
                    exactly equal to <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> or as near it as we please; thati4,
                    we shall have r^= <hi rend="italic">n.</hi></p>
                <p>When numbers are expressed in this way by the powers of some given number <hi
                    rend="italic">r, the exponent of that power of r which is equal to any assigned
                    number is called the loga∙ rìthm of that number.</hi> Thus, if <hi rend="italic"
                    >r = n (η</hi> being put for any number), N is the logarithm of <hi
                    rend="italic">n.</hi></p>
                <p>The logarithms which are produced by giving to <hi rend="italic">r</hi> some
                    determinate value, constitute a <hi rend="italic">system</hi> of logarithms; and
                    the constant number <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> from which the system is formed,
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">base, radix,</hi> or radical number of the
                    system.</p>
                <p>The properties of logarithms may readily be deduced from the above definition as
                    follows: Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be any two
                    numbers, and A and B their logarithms; then <hi rend="italic">r</hi> being
                    supposed to denote the base or radical number of the system, we have <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> = r <hi rend="superscript"> A</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b
                    = r</hi><hi rend="superscript"> β</hi>: now if we take the product of <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> we have α ⅛ = <hi
                    rend="superscript"> rA</hi> × r <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> = r <hi
                    rend="superscript"> A + β</hi>; but, according to the definition, A + B is the
                    logarithm of <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> (for it is the index of that power of
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> which is equal to <hi rend="italic">a b),</hi>
                    therefore <hi rend="italic">the sum of the logarithms of any two numbers a and ♭
                    is the logarithm of their product a b.</hi> Again, we</p>
                <p>A</p>
                <p>have = ~β = <hi rend="superscript"> r A</hi> but here A — B, being the index of
                    that power of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> which is equal to &lt;~, is the logarithm
                    <hi rend="italic">οf^</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> hence, <hi rend="italic">f
                    one number a be divided by another ♭, the difference between thdir logarithms is

                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">n</hi> express any number whatever, then raising both sides
                    of the equation <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = r <hi rend="superscript"> A</hi> to
                    the nth power, we have'α <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> = (r <hi

                    η</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> therefore, <hi rend="italic">the logarithm of

                    number, is the product of the logarithm of the number by n, the index of the
                    power. This must evidently be true, whether n be a whole number or a fraction,
                    positive or negative.</hi></p>
                <p>From these properties, it is ea⅛y to see in what manner a table exhibiting the
                    logarithms of all numbers within certain limits may be applied to simplify
                    calculations; for since the sum of the logarithms of any two numbers is the
                    logarithm of their product, it follows, that as often as we have occasion to
                    find the product of two or more numbers, we have only to add their logarithms
                    taken from the table into one sum, and to look for the number whose logarithm is
                    equal to that sum, and this number will be the product required. Also, because
                    the difference between the logarithm of the dividend and that of the divisor is
                    the loga rithm of the quotient, whenever we have occasion to divide one number
                    by another, we have only to subtract the logarithm of the divisor from that of
                    the dividend, and opposite to that logarithm in the table, which is the
                    remainder, we find the quotient.</p>
                <p>As the logarithm of any power of a number is the product of the logarithm of the
                    number by the index of the power; and, on the contrary, the logarithm of any
                    root of a number is the quotient found by dividing the logarithm of the number
                    by the index of the root; it follows that we may find any power or root of a
                    number by multiplying the logarithm of the number by the index of the power, or
                    dividing it by the index of the root, and taking that number in the table whose
                    logarithm is the product or quotient for the power or root required.</p>
                <p>If in the equation <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = r <hi rend="superscript"> A</hi>
                    (where <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is any number, A its logarithm, and <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> the base of the system) we suppose <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    = 1, then r <hi rend="superscript"> A</hi> = 1; but this equation can only be
                    satisfied by A = 0. Hence it appears, <hi rend="italic">that in every system of
                    logarithms, the logarithm of unity must be</hi> 0. If, on the other hand, we
                    assume <hi rend="italic">a = r,</hi> then we have the equation r=r <hi
                    rend="superscript"> A</hi>, which is immediately satisfied by putting A = 1;
                    therefore, <hi rend="italic">the logarithm of the base, or radical number of
                    every system, is necessarily unity.</hi></p>
                <p>If we suppose <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to be each a
                    positive number greater than unity, then A will be a positive number <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>; for if it be a negative we would have tz^= r~ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> A</hi> =—a proper fraction, and at same time a number
                    greater by hypothesis than unity, which is absurd. If, on the contrary, we
                    suppose <hi rend="italic">a</hi> a proper, fraction, then A must necessarily be
                    negative, otherwise r <hi rend="superscript"> A</hi> would be greater than
                    unity, and <hi rend="italic">a (</hi> = r <hi rend="superscript"> A</hi>) also
                    greater than unity, while by hypothesis it is a fraction less than unity, which
                    is absurd. <hi rend="italic">Therefore, in every system, the base of which
                    exceeds unity, the logarithm of a whole or mixed number is always positive, but
                    the logarithm of a proper fraction is always negative.</hi></p>
                <p>Because the logarithm of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is unity, that of <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> η</hi> will be <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> therefore, <hi rend="italic">the
                    logarithm of any integral power of the radical number r will always be an

                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and r ’ denote bases of two different systems; and

                <p>Hence it appears, <hi rend="italic">that the logarithm of a number, taken

                    of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> when A = 1. By adding together a sufficient number
                    of terms of the last series, we find it nearly equal to</p>

                    hence if the number <hi rend="italic">e</hi> be considered as the base of a

                    keeping in mind that <hi rend="italic">y</hi> denotes any number whatever, and
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> its logarithm; thus we have <hi rend="italic">x</hi>

                <p>supposing that the base of the system is the number we have expressed above by

                <p>We have now found a general formula for the logarithm of any number <hi

                    has the number e for its base. But it is easy from hence to find a formula,
                    which shall apply to any system whatever. For it has been shown that the
                    logarithms of the same number, taken according to two different systems, are to
                    each other as the reciprocals of the logarithms of the bases of the systems,

                <p>Let the value already found for the logarithm of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> to base
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> be substituted in this equation, and it becomes</p>

                <p>If in the above formula we suppose <hi rend="italic">r = e,</hi> the multiplier

                <p>as we have already remarked. Now this is the system which was adopted by Lord
                    Napier; and although the logarithms which were computed according to this
                    system, or upon the supposition that the radical number is 2∙7182818, <hi
                    rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> have been called <hi rend="italic">hyperbolic

                    spaces, yet, as the logarithms of every system have the same property, it is
                    more proper to call them <hi rend="italic">Napierian logarithms.</hi> lθ2Γ∙

                <p>As the constant multiplier :——, which occurs in the <hi rend="superscript">

                    number, is the only part of the formula which depends for its value upon the
                    base of the system, it has been called by writers on logarithms the <hi
                    rend="italic">modulus</hi> of the system. If we suppose the logarithms taken to
                    the base <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> then the numerator, viz. log. <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> will be unity, and the denominator will be the Napierian
                    logarithm of <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> If however we suppose the logarithms
                    taken to the base <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> then the numerator will be log. <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> to base <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and the denominator will be unity, so that the <hi rend="italic">modulus</hi> of
                    any system whose base is <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> is <hi rend="italic">the
                    reciprocal of the Napierian logarithm of that base</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    or it is <hi rend="italic">the logarithm of the number e</hi> (the base of the
                    Napierian system) <hi rend="italic">to the base r.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Napierian system, the <hi rend="italic">modulus</hi> is unity, and hence
                    the logarithms of this system are more easily computed than those of any other.
                    It was, however, soon found that a system whose base should be the same as the
                    root of the scale of the arithmetical notation, viz. the number 10, would be the
                    most convenient of any in practice; and accordingly such a system was actually
                    constructed by Mr Briggs. This is the only one now in common use, and is called
                    <hi rend="italic">Briggs s system,</hi> also <hi rend="italic">the common
                    system</hi> of logarithms. The <hi rend="italic">modulus</hi> of this system
                    therefore is the reciprocal of the Napierian logarithm of 10, viz. ∙43429448,
                    which is the common logarithm of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> = 2∙7182818, &amp;c.
                    the base of the Napierian system. We shall in future denote this <hi
                    rend="italic">modulus</hi> by Μ; so that the formula expressing the common
                    logarithm of any number <hi rend="italic">y</hi> will be log. <hi rend="italic"

                    term) constitute a negative quantity; and as the same is also true of the fourth
                    and fifth, and so on, the amount of all the terms after the first is a negative
                    quantity, or one which is to be subtracted from the first, to obtain the value

                <p>And since, on the contrary, the terms of the second series are all positive, the

                <p>Thus we have two limits to the value of the logarithm of y, which, by taking the
                    number <hi rend="italic">n</hi> sufficiently great, may come as near to each
                    other as we please.</p>
                <p>In like manner we find two limits to the value of the reciprocal to the modulus,

                <p>⅛Zn("√10-D,½ <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> n(l-ApJ</p>
                <p>It is evident that the difference between the two limits of log. y, is</p>
                <p>*M{c∙√y-υ-(ι-.-⅛)}. therefore, if we take either the one or the other of the two
                    preceding expressions for log y, the error in excess or defect is necessarily
                    less than this quantity.</p>
                <p>By these formulae we may depend upon having the logarithm of any number true to
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> figures, if we give to <hi rend="italic">n</hi> such a
                    value that the root <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ffy</hi> shall have <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ciphers between the decimal point
                    and the first significant figure on the right. So that in general, as the error
                    is the smaller as <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the exponent of the root is greater,
                    it may be neglected when <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is taken indefinitely great;
                    and this being the case, we may conclude that either of these expressions, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> &gt;M(Vy-D&gt; »M(i-A-)</p>
                <p>V <hi rend="italic">yt</hi> is the accurate value of log. y.</p>
                <p>The best manner of applying the preceding formula is to take some power of the
                    number 2 for <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for by doing so,
                    the root <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">ffy</hi> may be
                    found by a repetition of extractions of the square root only. It was in this way
                    that Briggs calculated the first logarithms; and he remarked, that if in
                    performing the successive extractions of the square root, he at last obtained
                    twice as many decimal places as there were ciphers after the decimal point, the
                    integer before it being unity, then the decimal part of this root was exactly
                    the half of that which went before; so that the decimal parts of the two roots
                    were to each other in the same proportion as their logarithms: now this is an
                    evident consequence of the preceding formula.</p>
                <p>To give an example of the application of the formula, let it be required to find
                    the numerical value of Μ, the modulus of the common system of logarithms, which,
                    as it is the reciprocal of the Napierian logarithm of 10, is</p>

                    when <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is some very great number. Let us suppose <hi

                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> °; then, dividing unity by 8, and this result again
                    by 8, and so on, we shall, after”20 divisions, have</p>
                <p>1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>-, or —, equal to</p>

                <p>Also, by extracting the square root of 10, and the square root of this result,
                    and so on, after performing 60 extractions we shall find <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>Therefore, - × — <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> —, or Μ is equal to</p>

                <p>As a second example, let it be required to find by the same formula the logarithm
                    of 3, which is nearly <hi rend="italic">η</hi> Μ (V3 — 1) = <hi rend="underline"

                    number. Let us suppose also in this case that <hi rend="italic">n</hi> = 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 6</hi> θ; then after 60 extractions of the square root we
                    have <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> √3 equal to</p>

                <p>This method of computing logarithms is evidently attended with great labour, on
                    account of the number of extractions of roots which it requires to obtain a
                    result true to a moderate number of places of figures. But the two series which
                    we have given serve to simplify and complete it. For, whatever be the number <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> it is only necessary to proceed with the extractions of
                    the square root, till we have obtained for <hi rend="italic superscript">
                    n</hi><hi rend="italic">ιfy a</hi> value which is unity followed by a decimal
                    fraction; and then <hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >*fy</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1 being a fraction, its powers will also be
                    fractions so much the smaller as their exponents are greater; thus a certain
                    number of terms of the series will express the logarithm to as many decimal
                    places as may be required.</p>
                <p>There are yet other artifices by which the series <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>

                    others which shall always converge, and in particular the following. Let 1 + <hi

                    then it becomes <hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">∕</hi><hi

                <p>Thus, by a very easy calculation, we have obtained the Napierian logarithm of 2
                    true to the first ten places of figures; the accurate value, as far as the 12th
                    place, being 0-693147180560.</p>
                <p>If this very simple process, by which we have found the logarithm of 2 (the whole
                    of which is here actually put down), be compared with the laborious calculations
                    which must have been performed to have found the same logarithm by the method
                    explained in the beginning of this section, the great superiority of this method
                    to the other, and even to the second method, by which we found the value of Μ,
                    and the logarithm of 3, must be very apparent.</p>
                <p>In the same manner as we have found the logarithm of 2, we may find those of 3,
                    5, &amp;c. In computing the logarithm of 3, the series would converge by the
                    powers of the g I</p>
                <p>fraction -3— = ⅛, and in computing the logarithm of 5 it 3 + 1</p>
                <p>5 I</p>
                <p>would converge by the powers of rqy∣ = ⅝ “but in each of these cases the series
                    would converge slower, and of course the labour would be greater than in
                    computing the logarithm of 2. And if the number whose logarithm was required was
                    still more considerable; as, for example, 199, the series would converge so slow
                    as to be useless.</p>

                    logarithm of 11 may be expressed by the logarithms of smaller numbers, and a
                    series which converges still more rapidly, by the following artifice, which will
                    apply also to some other numbers. Because the numbers 98, 99, and 100 are the
                    products of numbers, the greatest of which is 11, for 98 = 2 × 7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, 99 = 9× 11, and 100 = 10 × 10, it follows that if we

                    numbers, it may be resolved into another, the terms of which shall be the
                    logarithms of the number 11 and other smaller numbers. Now by the preceding
                    formula, if we put 99 for <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> we have</p>
                <p>2 log. 99 — log. 98 — log. 100 = N, that is, substituting log. 9 + log. 11 for
                    log. 99, log. 2 + 2 log. 7 for log. 98, and 2 log. 10 for log. 100,</p>
                <p>2 log. 9 + 2 log. 11 — log. 2 — 2 log. 7 — 2 log. 10 = N, ʹ and hence by

                <p>log. 11 = ½ N + ½ log. 2 + log. 7 — log. 9 + log. 10; and in this equation</p>

                <p>It may be proper here briefly to notice some new views on the doctrine of
                    logarithms, which havς <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> been advanced at
                    considerable length by Mr Graves in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> for 1829. The discovery made by Poisson and Poinsot, in their
                    researches on angular sections, of errors in trigonometrical formulae usually
                    deemed complete, drew Mr Graves’s attention to what he considered analogous
                    defects in logarithmic series. He accordingly professes, in the paper cited, to
                    exhibit in an amended form two fundamental developments, especially that of the
                    one we have given above of the equation <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">= r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but the new formulae are unfortunately exhibited in such an abstruse and
                    indefinite form, as to be quite unintelligible to most readers, and our limits
                    will not admit of introducing them here with a sufficient explanation. The chief
                    objection made to the ordinary series is, that it only gives one value to <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> for each value of <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> whereas, when
                    a? is a rational fraction in its lowest terms, <hi rend="italic">y</hi> should
                    have as many values of some sort as there are units in the denominator of <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> Thus, when <hi rend="italic">χ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> ½ and <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 10, the value of
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi> being et= √10, maybe— 3∙162277 as well as + 3∙162277;
                    but it is surely never meant that <hi rend="italic">y</hi> should ever have more
                    than two possible values, or indeed more than one such value, when the
                    denominator of <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> is odd.</p>
                <p>Mr Graves considers the principles employed in this inquiry as presenting a
                    solution of many difficulties, and illustrating peculiarities in the theory of
                    logarithms of negative quantities; and, when applied to geometry, as furnishing
                    the means of tracing the form and developing the properties of curves whose
                    equations involve exponential quantities. He also states that, by their means,
                    various differential and other formulae usually exhibited in treatises on
                    logarithms may be rendered complete. He combats the opinion that equations which
                    are numerically false may yet be analytically true; and explains the difficulty
                    by reverting to the limitations inherent in the hypothesis on which the
                    developments are founded. In opposition to John Bernoulli and D’Alembert, he
                    maintains that the logarithms of negative numbers are not in general the same as
                    those of positive ones; and hence infers that negative numbers have occasionally
                    even real logarithms. But several objectionable things in Mr Graves’s paper have
                    been pointed out by Mr Peacock, in an able article on analysis in the Third
                    Report of the British Association, page 266; and, indeed, until Mr Graves
                    chooses to put his new views in a more definite and intelligible shape, and to
                    express himself in ordinary mathematical language, we suspect his speculations
                    are not likely to meet with a favourable reception.</p>

                <p>The following short article may be fitly introduced here as an addition to the
                    foregoing treatise. It was written <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> by the late
                    Sir John Leslie for the <hi rend="italic">Supplement</hi> to the former editions
                    of this work, in which it was inserted under the word <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>Few disquisitions in modern mathematics have greater practical utility than those
                    concerning the extension and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193207026"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-7026-0431"/>interpolation of the terms of numerical
                    progressions. But the modes of solution generally proposed, however ingenious
                    and refined, are often too complex for ordinary purposes. We shall therefore
                    point out a procedure of extreme simplicity and most ready application. It will
                    embrace any system of numbers, but seems peculiarly fitted for the computation
                    of logarithms.</p>
                <p>Napier first published in 1614 his canon <hi rend="italic">Mirificus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Logarithmorum,</hi> comprised in a very thin and small quarto
                    volume, exhibiting, as far as seven places, the logarithms only of the sines and
                    tangents to every minute of the quadrant; those of the ordinary numbers being
                    left to be deduced from the nearest sines or tangents. In the summer following,
                    Briggs, then professor of geometry in Gresham College at London, who was
                    enchanted by that noble discovery, paid a visit to its illustrious author at
                    Merchiston, in the vicinity of Edinburgh. During an agreeable stay of a month,
                    it was concerted between them to change the natural system of logarithms into
                    another of a more artificial form, but adapted to our denary scale of notation,
                    the labour of the calculation, however, being devolved upon Briggs, as younger,
                    and enjoying robust health. Next season, Briggs performed a second journey to
                    Edinburgh, and showed to Napier a table which he had computed of the new
                    logarithms for the first chiliad or thousand of the series of natural numbers.
                    But the great inventor was now fast declining in years, and expired on the 3d of
                    April 1618. Briggs, employing most skilfully all the abbreviations which
                    ingenuity could devise, prosecuted his most arduous task with such vigour and
                    active perseverance, as to compute, in the space of seven years, to fourteen
                    places of figures, not only the logarithms of the sines and tangents of every
                    degree and centesimal minute of the quadrant, but also the logarithms of thirty
                    chiliads of numbers. These tables were printed in 1624, in a folio volume,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmica.</hi>
                    In his anxiety, however, to bring out this stupendous work, Briggs contented
                    himself with calculating the logarithms from unit to 20,000, and from 90,000 to
                    100,000, leaving the computation of the seventy intervening chiliads to be
                    afterwards supplied. The very ingenious author annexed a full explanation of his
                    mode of framingthe tables, grounded chiefly on the consideration of differences,
                    and he thus traced the first steps of that important theory. But he likewise
                    gave instructions for the readier filling up of the intermediate logarithms,
                    abridging the toil of calculation no doubt, yet detailing a procedure
                    sufficiently irksome and complicated. “To encourage some skilful persons to
                    perform this task, he offered to furnish them with paper he had by him, ready
                    prepared, and divided into columns proper for that purpose, as likewise to
                    inform them at what part to begin, that they might not interfere one with
                    another; and promised, when the whole was finished, to endeavour to procure a
                    new edition of the work so completed.” This slender boon seems not to have
                    tempted the mathematicians in England. In Holland, however, Adrian Vlacq,
                    chancing to meet two years afterwards with a copy of the work, and, prompted
                    only by his patriotic zeal, had the resolution to revise and compute the whole
                    canon, reducing it from fourteen to ten places of figures, which he printed in
                    folio at Gouda, as early as 1628. The same able calculator, only five years
                    afterwards, published, likewise in folio, at Gouda, a very extensive system of
                    logarithmic sines and tangents, to every ten seconds of the quadrant, having
                    restored the sexagesimal subdivision, which Briggs had partly changed into a
                    centesimal one. These two volumes may be deemed a precious <hi rend="italic"
                    >thesaurus</hi> of logarithms, from which succeeding compilers have drawn very
                    liberally. They form the basis of the <hi rend="italic">Tables</hi> published by
                    Vega at Leipsic in 1794, which, till lately, were the best and completest
                    extant.</p>
                <p>But though the <hi rend="italic">1 aoles</hi> of Vlacq, carried only to ten
                    places of figures, are sufficiently accurate for every ordinary purpose, and
                    even for the most delicate calculations in astronomy, yet many persons have
                    often regretted that the original system of Briggs was never completed. The
                    celebrated Legendre has employed that table, imperfect as it is, in some of his
                    most refined numerical investigations. It is well known that Mr Baron Maseres
                    devoted a considerable portion of his time and of his fortune to the.
                    republication of the works of the early writers on logarithms. In the course of
                    this extensive undertaking, he entertained some thoughts of giving a new edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmica,</hi>
                    and expressed an earnest wish that the vacant chiliads were filled up. To
                    promote the liberal designs of the baron, the author of this article was induced
                    to bestow some reflection on the subject, and a very simple mode occurred to
                    him, which would have reduced the labour of computing those logarithms to little
                    more than the trouble of mere transcription. But the object of completing the
                    canon was deferred for a time, and afterwards gradually forgotten. The method of
                    interpolation then proposed seems, however, to deserve notice on account of its
                    great simplicity, and its ready application, not only to the immediate object,
                    but to other questions of a similar nature. We shall, therefore, now state the
                    principle, and illustrate its application by a few examples.</p>

                    + 1, must give the logarithm of 26 + 3. By this simple process, then, any table
                    of logarithms is carried to double its actual extent through all the odd
                    numbers, those of the even ones being found by the mere addition of the
                    logarithm of 2.</p>

                    tables of seven places, for those under 2055 in tables of ten places, and for
                    the logarithms of numbers under 44286 in tables extending to fourteen

                <p>The corrections required in Briggs’s <hi rend="italic">Tables</hi> of fourteen
                    places will therefore correspond to these limits:</p>

                <p>30706 — 3 ( 22143 — 8</p>

                <p>24372 — 6, 19913 —11</p>
                <p>Suppose it were required to find the logarithms of the odd numbers above 300, to
                    seven places of decimals. Assuming the logarithms of the series of the halves of
                    the intermediate even numbers, let the differences between their alternate terms
                    be taken, and then bisected.</p>

                <p>Hence the logarithms of the doubles are formed by the mere addition of these

                <p>In this manner the operation may be continued; but, to prevent any accumulation

                    determined by adding •3010300 to the logarithms of 151, 152, 153, 154, and
                    155.</p>

                    so commodious for their computation, might likewise be deduced from general
                    considerations. Let A, B, C, D, E, &amp;c. represent any series of numbers. If

                    logarithmic sine of 50° 4'.</p>
                <p>But a nearer approximation may be obtained, by supposing the second différences
                    of any series to form the arithmetical progression. The sum of the extreme terms
                    C—2B + A and F — 2E + D would, therefore, be equal to the sum of the mean terms
                    D — 2C + B and E — 2D + C; whence F — A = 3 B + 3E — 2C — 2D, or F = A + 3 (B +
                    E) — 2 (C + D). Thus, the natural sines of the successive arcs 30, 31, 32, 34,

                <p>The sines of 31° and of 34° are here added together, and the sum tripled, and
                    from this amount is taken twice the sum of the sines of 31° and of 33°; the sine
                    of 30° being subtracted from that remainder, leaves finally the sine of 35°.</p>
                <p>Employing the same number of terras of the series, a still closer approximation
                    may be discovered, by considering the third differences only as uniformly
                    progressive. Wherefore the extreme differences D — 3 C +3B — A and F — 3E ⅛ 3D —
                    C will be together equal to double the middle one, E — 3D + 3C— B, and
                    consequently F—A = 5E-10D+ 10C—5B, orF = A÷5(E-B) — J0(DC).</p>
                <p>Hence the logarithms even of low numbers may be computed exact to eight decimal
                    places. Thus, the logarithms of 150, 151, 152, 153, and 154, being given, that
                    of 155 is found by this process:</p>

                <p>The difference between the logarithms of 151 and 154 is here multiplied by 5, and
                    the difference of the logarithms of 152 and 153 is multiplied by 10; and the
                    excess of the former product above the latter being added to the logarithm of
                    150, gives the logarithm of 155.</p>
                <p>It would obviously be preferable, however, to employ the formula in a modified
                    form for interpolation merely. Hence D = C + ½ (E —B) + A —F.</p>
                <p>If six terms of the series were given, the seventh could be found to a high
                    degree of accuracy. The sum of the extremes of the progressive third differences
                    being now assumed equal to that of the means, we have D — 3C + 3B — A + G — 3F +
                    3E — D = E — 3D + 3C — B + F — 3E + 3D — C, and by reduction G — A = 4 F — 5 E—
                    5 C — 4B, whence G = A + 4(F — B) — 5 (E — C). It seems unnecessary to subjoin
                    any further illustrations; but the very simple methods of interpolation now
                    proposed might be applied with great facility and advantage in various physical
                    researches. In this way much light may be thrown upon the resistance of fluids,
                    and upon the force, the density, and the component heat of steam, at different
                    temperatures.</p>
