                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    the celebrated discoverer of the new chemical theory, was born at Paris in the
                    month of August 1745. His father being a man of opulence acquired in commerce,
                    spared no cost on the education of his son. The latter studied at Mazarin
                    College, and obtained a great number of prizes in his classes; but he soon
                    evinced a decided taste for the sciences, which his father had the good sense to
                    encourage. On leaving college, he applied himself to the study of mathematics
                    and astronomy in the observatory of Lacaiile, to that of chemistry in the
                    laboratory of Rouelle, and to that of botany under Bernard de Jussieu, whom he
                    attended in his herborisations. His passion for study was such, that he put
                    himself on a milk diet, and denied himself the pleasures of general society,
                    living only with his masters and fellowstudents, all of whom remained his
                    friends throughout life. An extraordinary premium having been offered by the
                    French government in the year 1764, for the best and most economical method of
                    lighting the streets of an extensive city, Lavoisier, although at that time only
                    twenty-one years of age, gained the gold medal; and his excellent memoir was
                    published by the academy, of which he became a member on the 13th of May 1768.
                    His attention was successively occupied with the pretended conversion of water
                    into earth, the analysis of the gypsum found in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203069" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3069-0128"/>the vicinity of Paris, the
                    congelation of water, the phenomena of thunder, and the aurora borealis.</p>
                <p>By undertaking journeys with Guettard into every province of France, he was
                    enabled to procure an immense variety of materials for a description of the
                    mineral kingdom, and serving also as the foundation of a great work on the
                    revolutions of the globe, two admirable sketches of which are to be seen in the
                    Memoirs of the French Academy for 1772 and 1787. His whole time and fortune were
                    dedicated to the cultivation of the sciences, nor did he seem more attached to
                    one than to another, till an interesting event decided his choice in favour of
                    chemistry. The discovery of gases, just made known to the learned world by
                    Black, Priestley, Scheele, Cavendish, and Macbride, appeared to him like a new
                    creation.</p>
                <p>Lavoisier was so struck with the grandeur and importance of the discovery, that
                    he turned all his attention to this fountain of truths, perceiving the powerful
                    influence which this new science would exert over all physical researches. He
                    was inspired with the true spirit of inductive philosophy, and all his
                    experiments had a direct reference to general views. In the year 1773, he
                    presented to’the academy, and published, his <hi rend="italic">Opuscules
                    Physiques</hi><hi rend="italic">et Chimiques,</hi> containing a history of
                    whatever had been done before respecting the gases, and concluding with his own
                    grand and interesting experiments. He demonstrated that metals, in calcination,
                    derive their increased weight from the absorption of highly-respirable air, of
                    which he afterwards proved that nitrous acid is composed. His chemical ingenuity
                    was now so well known, that Turgot employed him in 1776 to inspect the
                    manufacture of gunpowder, which he greatly improved in strength, or explosive
                    force. In the year 1778 he discovered that all acids contain the respirable
                    portion of the atmosphere as a constituent principle, and to this he gave the
                    name of oxygen. This was the first grand step towards the new chemistry, which
                    was fully completed by his confirming the discovery of the composition of water,
                    ascertained in 1783.</p>
                <p>His Elements of Chemistry, in two vote. 8vo, were published in 1789, and form a
                    beautiful model of scientific composition, being at once clear, logical, and
                    elegant. In a very few years his system was alm'ost universally adopted, so
                    complete was the conviction it carried along with it to every candid and
                    reflecting mind. The last of Lavoisier’s philosophical works was on the
                    respiration and transpiration of animals, first read to the academy on the 4th
                    of May 1791. By a number of the nicest experiments, he found that a man in one
                    day perspires forty-five ounces; that he consumes thirty-three ounces of vital
                    air or oxygen; that eight oubic feet of carbonic acid gas are discharged from
                    his lungs; that the weight of water discharged from the lungs is twenty-three
                    ounces, composed of three of hydrogen and twenty of oxygen; which interesting
                    discoveries he directed to the improvement of medicine.</p>
                <p>There are no fewer than forty memoirs of Lavoisier in the volumes of the Academy
                    of Sciences from 1772 to 1793, all relating to the grand phenomena of the
                    science; such as the analysis of atmospherical air, the formation of elastic
                    fluids, the properties of the matter of heat, the composition of acids, the
                    decomposition of water, &amp;c. To the sciences, arts, and manufactures, he
                    rendered the most essential services, both in a public and in a private
                    capacity. He succeeded Buffon and Tillet as treasurer to the academy, into the
                    accounts of which he introduced both economy and order. He was consulted by the
                    National Convention as to the most eligible means of improving the manufacture
                    of assignats, and of augmenting the difficulties of forging them. He turned his
                    attention also to political economy, and, between the years 1778 and 1785, he
                    allotted 240 <hi rend="italic">arpents</hi> in the Vendomois for experimental
                    agriculture, and increased the ordinary produce by one half. In 1791, the
                    Constituent Assembly invited him to draw up a plan for rendering more simple the
                    collection of the taxes; which produced an excellent report, printed under the
                    title of Territorial Riches of France.</p>
                <p>Whilst the horrors of Robespierre’s usurpation continued, he used to observe to
                    Lalande that he foresaw he would be deprived of all his property, but that he
                    was extremely willing to work for his subsistence; and it is supposed that he
                    meant to pursue the profession of apothecary, as most congenial to his studies.
                    But the unrelenting tyrant had already fixed his doom. He was thrown into
                    prison, whence he was soon dragged to the scaffold, where he perished, with
                    twenty-eight farmersτ general, on the 8th of May 1794, for no other crime but
                    because he was opulent, and belonged to that body. A report, drawn up by Μ.
                    Hallé, a courageous citizen, containing a description of the works, and a
                    recapitulation of the discoveries, of Lavoisier, sufficient to make an
                    impression upon the most obdurate heart, was presented to the revolutionary
                    tribunal. Even Lavoisier himself deigned to ask of the miscreants who had
                    condemned him, a delay for a few days, that he might have time to complete some
                    experiments interesting to humanity; alluding probably to his researches on
                    transpiration, which had been suspended by his imprisonment. But all was in
                    vain. The president of that horrible tribunal told him, in a ferocious tone,
                    that they had no longer any need of learned men; and his head fell under the axe
                    of the guillotine, in the fifty-first year of his age.</p>
                <p>Lavoisier was tall, and possessed a countenance full of benignant expression.
                    FIis character was mild, humane, social, obliging; and he discovered an
                    incredible degree of activity. He had great influence, on account of his credit,
                    fortune, reputation, and his office in the treasury; but all the use he made of
                    it was to do good; yet this did not prevent jealousy on the part of others. In
                    1771 he married Marie-Anne-Pierette-Paulze, the daughter of a farmer-general,
                    whose excellent accomplishments formed the delight of his life, who assisted him
                    in his labours, and even drew the figures for his last work. This lady had the
                    misfortune to behold her father, her husband, and her most intimate friends,
                    assassinated in one day; and she was herself imprisoned, nay, even menaced with
                    a similar fate; but the unshaken fortitude of her mind enabled her to rise
                    superior to the horrors of her condition. Lavoisier died childless.</p>
