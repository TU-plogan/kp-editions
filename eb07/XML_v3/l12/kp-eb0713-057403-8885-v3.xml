                <p><label type="entry">LOUTH</label>, a maritime county in the province of Leinster,
                    in Ireland, is bounded on the north by the county of Down and the bay of
                    Carlingford, on the east by the Irish Sea, on the south by the county of Meath,
                    and on the west by the counties of Meath and Monaghan. It is the smallest county
                    of Ireland, comprising only 200,484 acres, of which 185,568 are capable of
                    cultivation, and 14,916 are bog or unprofitable mountain.</p>
                <p>In the time of Ptolemy it formed part of the maritime district inhabited by the
                    Voluntii. Afterwards it was known by the name of Argiall, Orgiall, or Uriell,
                    which also comprehended the greater part of the counties of Meath, Monaghan, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> and Armagh. Its leading families of Irish extraction
                    were the O’Carrols and the M‘Scanlans∙ It was conquered by the English under De
                    Courcy in his progress northwards to Ulster, and formed one of the twelve
                    counties into which King John divided that part of Ireland which acknowledged
                    his authority. It is now divided into the five baronies of Ardee, Upper and
                    Lower Dundalk, Ferrard, and Louth, which are subdivided into sixty-one parishes,
                    all in the archdiocese of Armagh, and two parts of parishes in the diocese of
                    Clogher.</p>
                <p>The southern part of the county is flat, diversified by gentle undulations of the
                    surface. Proceeding northwards it becomes more hilly, until, at its most
                    northern extremity, it rises into the mountains of Ravensdale and Carlingford,
                    of considerable elevation. The rivers are the Dee, the Clyde, the Fane, and the
                    Castletown. None of them are navigable, being useful solely for irrigation, and
                    other purposes of rural economy. The Boyne forms part of the southern boundary
                    of the county. It is navigable for large vessels as far as Drogheda. The county
                    has a considerable line of sea-coast, consisting chiefly of a sandy strand,
                    except where it is broken by the projection of Clogher Head, a bold promontory,
                    on which is a fishing town of the same name. The bay of Dundalk extends beyond
                    this point for seven miles at its mouth, indenting the coast for an equal
                    distance inland. It*is considered as peculiarly dangerous for shipping. The
                    Carlingford Mountains, which bound the northern extremity of the county,
                    separate it from the bay that takes its name from them. This latter bay, which
                    forms the line of demarcation both between the counties of Louth and Down and
                    the provinces of Leinster and Ulster, is deep and narrow, extending in length
                    upwards of nine miles, with an average breadth of a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208898" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8898-0575"/>mile and a half. It is
                    navigable nearly to the town of Newry, and its shores on both sides are much
                    admired for their bold and picturesque scenery. An oyster, in high estimation
                    amongst gastronomes Jbr the peculiar delicacy of its flavour, is found in this
                    bay.</p>
                <p>The soil in the southern lowlands is well adapted for tillage, being composed of
                    a rich vegetable mould resting on marl or on limestone, sometimes with a
                    substratum of <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> slate. The quality of the soil
                    diminishes in agricultural value as the land rises towards the north, and the
                    summits of the mountainous district produce only heath and scanty herbage.</p>
                <p>The mountains are composed chiefly of granite. On their borders hornblende and
                    primitive greenstone are bund in abundance, after which are exterior ranges of
                    transition rock. The lower lands are of the clay-slate for-nation. The line of
                    separation between the granite and the ⅛y-slate extends from Carlingford Bay,
                    over the summit .&gt;f the Ravensdale Mountains, into the county of Armagh.
                    ?loetz limestone appears in the neighbourhood of Drog-ιeda and Ardee. A lead
                    mine was worked for a short Period at Salterstown, near the sea-coast. There is
                    a mineral spring at Ballymascanlan.</p>

                <p>Of the number stated in the latter of these returns, Í81 were of the Established
                    Church, 5664 were Roman tholics, and ninety-five Dissenters; the religious
                    per-ιsion of thirty-six was not ascertained. The total num- ∣r of schools was
                    169, of which twenty-one, affording &lt;iucation to 1358 children, were
                    supported by grants of public money; twenty, affording education to 1106, were
                    supported by the voluntary contributions of societies or individuals; and the
                    remaining 128, in which 4512 children received instruction, were supported
                    wholly by the fees of the pupils. There is an endowed classical school at
                    Dundalk, on the endowment of Erasmus Smith.</p>
                <p>The lands capable of cultivation are mostly kept in tillage. Potatoes, wheat,
                    oats, and barley, raised according to the succession here stated, form the
                    principal crops. In the northern districts, oats are chiefly raised. The systems
                    generally adopted are those of the most approved kind, as are also the
                    implements employed. From the attention paid to introduce the best breeds of
                    cattle of every denomination, the different species cannot now be easily
                    distinguished. Sheep are most abundant in the hilly districts. Many parts of the
                    county are well planted; the neighbourhood of Collon particularly exhibits a
                    fine specimen of the attention paid by its proprietor to this mode of improving
                    and embellishing the country. The ash-tree grows in the lower grounds to a great
                    size. The coasts furnish a constant supply of fish; and the flat shores abound
                    with sea-fowl, especially barnacle, which, however, is not so highly esteemed
                    for flavour as that of Wexford or Derry. The manufacture of coarse linens is
                    carried on to a considerable extent, and latterly the cotton manufacture has
                    gained ground.</p>
                <p>The appearance of the dwellings of the peasantry in the smaller towns and
                    villages indicates a considerable degree of comfort. In the hilly and more
                    remote districts it deteriorates considerably. In their manners, food, and
                    clothing, they differ in no respect from those of the neighbouring portions of
                    Leinster and Ulster. Fuel is scarce, except in the vicinity of the sea-ports,
                    into which English and Scotch coal is imported.</p>
                <p>Few counties can boast of so many remains of antiquity. There are two round
                    towers, one at Monasterboice, 110 feet in height, and in a state of excellent
                    preservation; the other at Dromiskin, much decayed. At the former of these
                    places there are also the remains of two chapels, and of two finely-sculptured
                    crosses, one of them eighteen feet high. Near the banks of a stream called the
                    river of Bal-richan, is a large artificial cave, accidentally discovered by the
                    sinking in of a horse whilst ploughing. It consists of several narrow passages,
                    the sides and top of which are formed of flag-stones. Some bones of large and
                    small animals were found in it. About two miles from Dundalk are the ruins of a
                    very ancient structure, which has some resemblance to the hull of an ancient
                    galley. There are no traces of doors, windows, or loop-holes. The building has
                    given rise to much antiquarian discussion. At Ballymascanlan is a cromleach
                    called the Giant’s Load. It consists of a rock twelve feet long and six broad,
                    elevated on three upright stones. Near it is Castle Rath, surrounded by moats
                    and lesser raths, and with a remarkable tumulus in its vicinity. The great mound
                    of Castleguard, near Ardee, is ninety feet in height, and 600 feet in
                    circumference at its base. Its summit terminates in an area 140 feet round. It
                    is well planted, and surrounded by a deep trench. At Faughart are the remains of
                    an ancient intrenchment. The decisive battle which terminated in the defeat and
                    death of Edward Bruce, by Sir John Bermingham, afterwards Lord <hi
                    rend="subscript"> a</hi> Louth, was fought near this place. The remains of
                    castles are numerous. That of Carlingford, built by King John, occupies a
                    commanding position on a rock projecting into the bay. Castletown stands within
                    sight of the town of Dundalk. Terfeckan Castle, once the residence of the
                    learned Archbishop Usher, is now utterly in ruins. The county is equally
                    remarkable for the number of its ancient monastic edifices. Mellifont, a
                    Cistertian abbey, five miles west of Drogheda, presents some remains equally
                    remarkable for their beauty and singularity of architecture<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208911" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8911-0576"/>. Others are to be traced at
                    Carlingford, Faughart, and Monasterboice.</p>
                <p>The principal modern seats are, Collon, the residence of Lord Oriell; Barmeath,
                    belonging to the Bellew family; Rokeby Hall, the mansion of the Count de Salis;
                    Louth Hall, that of Lord Louth; Ravensdale Park; and Clermont.</p>
                <p>Dundalk, the county-town, a place of great antiquity, is situated at the mouth of
                    the Castletown River. It consists of one long street, intersected by some cross
                    passages. Its most remarkable building is the court-house, the front of which,
                    modelled from the temple of Theseus at Athens, is considered as the finest
                    specimen of pure Grecian architecture in Ireland. The other public buildings
                    are, the parish church, two Roman Catholic chapels, a large barrack, a gaol,
                    assembly and news rooms, a linen-hall, a charter school, and an infirmary.
                    Dundalk is a great mart for the export of grain. The harbour is commodious but
                    shallow. The cambric manufacture is carried on to some extent. Its population,
                    in 1831, amounted to 10,078 souls. The other towns containing a population of
                    upwards of one thousand souls are, Ardee 3975, Carlingford 1319, Collon
                    1153.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Louth,</hi> a market-town of the county of Lincoln, in the
                    hundred of Louth Eske, in Lindsay division. It is T44 miles from London, being
                    situated on the river Lud, from which a canal has been constructed,
                    communicating with the sea, about seven miles distant. It has a considerable
                    coasting trade, and good markets on Wednesdays and Saturdays. It is governed by
                    a corporate body, composed of a warden and six assistants. The population
                    amounted in 1801 to 4236, in 1811 to 4728, in 1821 to 6012, and in 1831 to
                    6927.</p>
