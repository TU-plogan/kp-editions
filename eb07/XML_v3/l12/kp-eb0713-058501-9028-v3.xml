                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LUCANUS</label>, Μ. <hi rend="smallcaps">Annaeus,</hi> a
                    celebrated Latin poet, who vas born at Corduba, now Cordova, a city of Baetica,
                    the southern province of Spain, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 38, the year
                    after the accession of the Emperor Caligula. He was the son of Annaeus delà, a
                    Roman knight of considerable reputation, and the &gt;rother of the philosopher
                    Seneca. The young Lucan, edu- ’ ated at Rome in the doctrines of the Stoic
                    philosophy by knnaeus Cornutus, displayed at an early age great poetical <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> alents. His uncle Seneca, the preceptor of Nero, made
                    im acquainted with that prince, who, admiring his nume-ous acquirements, raised
                    him to the quaestorship before he usual age, loaded him with favours, and even
                    honoured im so far as to enter the lists of literary competition gainst him.
                    Lucan sung the descent of Orpheus to the ιfernal regions, Nero jhe metamorphosis
                    of Niobe; and it <hi rend="italic">i</hi> said that Lucan, forgetful of his
                    duties as a courtier, cared off the palm of victory, and thereby lost the favour
                    of lie emperor (Stat. <hi rend="italic">Silv.</hi> ii. 7, 58). It is impossible
                    to fix ∣ae period when he composed those adulatory verses which isgrace the
                    beginning of the Pharsalia; but, from their tsgusting servility, we might be
                    inclined to suppose that ιey were addressed to a tyrant who was well known and
                    <hi rend="subscript">;</hi> ared. According to an ancient tradition, one of
                    these ftrses had already prepared the emperor to take umbrage I any thing that
                    had the appearance of an insult. Nero i)uinted, and was deeply offended at the
                    verse,</p>
                <p>Unde tuam videas obliquo sidere Romam.</p>
                <p>All these various circumstances excited the wrath of the rant; and when Lucan,
                    having composed a poem on the lrning of Troy and on that of Rome, requested
                    permission it read it at the public theatre, according to the custom of tbse
                    times, this favour was denied him. Such persecution i∣itated the poet, and
                    induced him to join a conspiracy ífâinst the emperor, which was composed of all
                    the best ¢izens of Rome. It was, however, discovered before it add be carried
                    into execution; and many of the conspirais were arrested and put to the torture.
                    It is said that Ucan, on promise of his life, denounced his associates, and vrs
                    base enough even to name his own mother.</p>
                <p>Such conduct, however, does not appear to have pro-cred for him forgiveness, as
                    the only favour granted was tie choice of his mode of death. In his last moments
                    Luca recovered his firmness of mind, and, opening his veins iia warm bath,
                    allowed himself to bleed to death, whilst h is said to have repeated his own
                    description <hi rend="italic">(Pharsali,</hi> iii. 637) of the death-scene of a
                    young warrior who U been wounded by a serpent.</p>
                <p>Scinditur avulsus; ruptis cadit undique venis, Discursusque animae diversa in
                    membra meantis Interceptus aquis. Nullius vita pereunti Est tanta dimissa via.
                    Pars ultima trunci Tradidit in letum vacuos vitalibus artus.</p>
                <p>*4 e died at the age of twenty-seven, in the year 65 of ο» era, leaving a wife,
                    Polla Argentaria, one of the most raarkable women of her time (Tacit. <hi
                    rend="italic">Ann.</hi> xv. 49, 56, 71'; Sidon. Apollinar. ii. Ep. 10).</p>
                <p>I, ucan was the author of many works which have not cijtic down to us,
                    particularly the Burning of Troy, the Brning of Rome, the Descent of Aeneas to
                    the Infernal Rgions, Ten books of Sylvae, Medeia an imperfect trage- d⅛ and
                    Epistles, one of which, in praise of Calpurnius ⅛, has been preserved; but the
                    work for which he is ∞*t celebrated is his poem entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pharsalia,</hi> in ten books, wich he did not live to finish. The subject of
                    the poem is thnwar between Caesar and Pompey, from its commencement to the siege
                    of Alexandria. Lucan adheres closely to chronological order in his narrative,
                    and scarcely deviates from historical truth in his account of the various
                    transactions. From the little scope he allows to his imaginative powers, some
                    critics have thought that Lucan should not be considered as an epic poet, but
                    ranked amongst historians. His poetical merits have in all ages been fiercely
                    contested; some considering him equal to Virgil and Ovid, whilst others have
                    placed him in the lowest rank of poets. The judgment of posterity, however, is
                    without appeal, and it has long stamped the character of the poem as cold and
                    declamatory, notwithstanding that there are many passages full of genuine
                    poetry. The style is by no means uniform, and even the political sentiments of
                    the author vary in different parts of the work. In the first three books his
                    love of freedom is scarcely to be discovered, and every opinion is suppressed
                    which was likely to have offended Nero. In the remainder of the poem, as his
                    hatred increased against Nero, we can trace his aspirations after freedom
                    gradually growing stronger. There seems no good reason for believing that the
                    poet had any great moral end in view, except perhaps that he wished to excite in
                    the breasts of his countrymen a love of freedom, by exhibiting before their eyes
                    the last contest which their ancestors had maintained in its defence. He wished
                    also, perhaps, like the historian Livy, to forget the fearful images of the
                    present, by occupying his mind with, and dwelling on, the past. His want of a
                    glowing imagination and of inventive genius is somewhat counterbalanced by
                    powerful and energetic language, by a disdain of every thing that is mean or
                    grovelling, and by noble thoughts, which are uttered with all the dignified
                    seriousness of a Stoic. There are many editions of this work, but one of the
                    best is that of Burmann (Leyden, 1740), and the last is that by C. F. Weber, in
                    3 vols., the last of which contains some valuable scholia (Leipzig, 1828).</p>
