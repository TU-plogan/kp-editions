                <p><label type="entry">LOUISIANA</label>, one of the United States of North America,
                    is bounded on the east by the state of Mississippi, on the west by the Sabine
                    River, on the north by the Arkansas territory, and on the south by the Gulf of
                    Mexico It extends from longitude 89. to 94. 5., and its extreme southern point
                    is in latitude 28. 56. whilst its northern limit is in latitude 33. The average
                    length is about 240 miles, and the mean breadth rather more than 200 miles, the
                    area being estimated at 48,220 square miles. The surface of Louisiana presents
                    great diversity of appearance, and no state in the union possesses a greater
                    quantity of the very finest land. It includes all the varieties, from the most
                    recent and still periodically inundated alluvial flats, to elevations which
                    approach the magnitude of mountains; every quality of soil, from the most
                    productive to the most sterile, from unwooded plains to dense and almost
                    impenetrable forests. The southern part of this state, from Lake Borgne to
                    Sabine River and from the Gulf of Mexicoto Baton Rouge and Red River, is an
                    alluvial tract of country, extending about two hundred and forty miles in length
                    by from seventy to one hundred and forty in breadth. It is intersected by
                    numerous rivers, bays, creeks, and lakes, which divide the country into a great
                    number of islands. Three fourths of the state are destitute of any elevation
                    which deserves the name of a hill. The pine woods generally have a surface of a
                    very particular character, rising into fine swells, with table surfaces on the
                    summit, and valleys from thirty to forty feet deep. But they in no part present
                    the aspect of a range, and are scattered over the country like the waves of an
                    agitated sea. The alluvial soil is level, and the swamps are dead flats. The
                    vast prairies, which constitute a large portion of the state, present a surface
                    as level as a frozen lake. With the exception of the shaking prairies, they are
                    higher and drier than the savannahs of Florida. A range of hills commences by
                    gentle undulations in Opelosas, rises gradually, and diverges towards the river
                    Sabine. In the vicinity of Natchitoches it preserves a distance intermediate
                    between the Sabine and Red Rivers, and increases in elevation to the western
                    part of the state. A second line of hills, not far from Alexandria, commences on
                    the north side of Red River, and separating between the waters of that river and
                    Dudgemony, unites with another chain of elevations which bound the alluvial
                    plains of the Washita as bluffs, gradually diverging from that river as they
                    pass beyond the western limits of the state. There are likewise some
                    considerable hills beyond the Mississippi, and in some other parts the country
                    is high; but, generally speaking, Louisiana is one immense plain, divided into
                    pine woods, prairies, swamps, and hickory and oak lands. The pine woods have
                    almost invariably a poor soil. The greater proportion of the prairies is
                    second-rate land, and some of them are even sterile. A few, however, in
                    Opelosas, and those of Attakapas, possess great fertility. They are in general
                    more level than those of the upper country. A very considerable extent of them
                    has a cold clayey soil, with a hard crust near the surface. In other places the
                    soil is of inky blackness, and in the hot and dry season it cracks into fissures
                    of some inches in width. A considerable belt of these prairies, near the gulf,
                    is low, marshy, and in rainy weather inundated. The bottoms are generally rich,
                    but in very different degrees. Those of the Mississippi and Red Rivers are
                    particularly so, and the vegetation there is remarkable for its size and
                    luxuriance. The cotton on fresh lands of the richest quality reaches the size of
                    a considerable shrub. The bottoms of Red River possess extraordinary fertility,
                    and the lower courses of this stream constitute the paradise of cotton planters.
                    The soil is said to derive its fertility from a portion of salt which is
                    intimately mixed with it, and from its peculiar friability; and the darkish red
                    colour which it bears is to be traced to the presence of the red oxide of iron.
                    All the branches of Red River, and they are very numerous, partake of the
                    character of the main stream. The other parts of Louisiana which have the
                    richest soils are, the island of New Orleans, a narrow neck of land, insulated
                    by various lakes and rivers. About one third of this neck is under cultivation,
                    the other two thirds being swamp. This tract is the finest part of the rich
                    country called the <hi rend="italic">Coast,</hi> which is that part of the
                    bottom of the Mississippi commencing with the first cultivation above the
                    Balize, about forty miles below New Orleans, and extending one hundred and fifty
                    miles above it. It is from one to two miles in breadth; and a richer tract of
                    land of the same extent cannot be found on the globe. It is secured by an
                    embankment, called a levee, from six to eight feet in height, and for the most
                    part sufficiently broad to afford room for a fine road. Above the levee, on the
                    east bank of the river, are situated the parishes of Baton Rouge and East and
                    WestFeliciana. The latter parish is pleasantly diversified with hills and
                    valleys, and belonging to it are the richest planters and the best plantations
                    in the state, in some of which there are from five to eight hundred acres under
                    cultivation. West of the Mississippi there are some <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208846" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8846-0571"/>tracts of soil very fertile,
                    and here the sugar-cane thrives well. A considerable portion of Attakapas is of
                    great fertility, as are smaller portions of Opelosas, which is, however, best
                    adapted for a grazing country. Near the Red River there occur several tracts of
                    very fertile soil, on parts of which the richest cotton is produced. The lands
                    on the Washita River are black, like, those on the Mississippi; and the
                    alluvions on the lower courses of this stream furnish an admirable soil for
                    cotton, and other productions that require the same climate.</p>
                <p>A very great proportion of the surface of this state is covered with prairies,
                    almost all of which are so associated with one another as to form a family, the
                    natural connection of all the branches being easily traced. The first that occur
                    west of the Mississippi are those which are included under the general name of
                    Attakapas; a term implying “man-eater” in the language of the savages who
                    formerly inhabited it, and who are said to have been cannibals. It is an immense
                    plain of grass, stretching from the Atchafa-laya on the north to the gulf on the
                    south. It is extremely fertile, innumerable herds of cattle and horses graze
                    upon it, and at intervals are scattered over its immense surface the houses of
                    the agriculturists. To the west of this prairie occurs that of Opelosas, still
                    larger than the former, and computed to contain nearly 8000 square miles. It is
                    divided, by various natural boundaries or obstructions, into a number of
                    prairies, which have separate names and marks of distinction. The soil, though
                    occasionally very fertile, is less so than that of Attakapas; but this
                    deficiency is compensated by the greater salubrity of the climate, which is
                    reckoned the healthiest in the state. There are here very considerable cotton
                    plantations, and some of indigo; and the parish, which bears the same name, is
                    one of the most populous in the state. Bellevue prairie is situated partly in
                    Opelosas, partly in Attakapas, and, as its name imports, affords a delightful
                    prospect. Calcasiu and Sabine prairies are names descriptive of the different
                    forms, shapes, and openings of this continuous line of prairies, as it stretches
                    along the settlements from the Plaquemine to the Sabine. Some of them are of
                    great extent, and they all possess nearly the same characteristics. They are ge-
                    <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> nerally so level as to appear to the eye a perfect
                    plain; but there occasionally occur swells and declivities, such as are
                    sufficient to carry the water from them. The margin which borders on the gulf is
                    commonly a wet marsh, covered with a luxuriant growth of tall reedy grass called
                    cane-grass. In various parts of these prairies there are islands of timber
                    lands. Wherever a bayou or stream I crosses the prairie, it is marked with a
                    fringe of timber; and here the soil is invariably rich, as well as at the points
                    of the prairie; but towards the Sabine it is less so. Attakapas is the first and
                    most fertile, and that of the Sabine the last and most sterile. Beyond Opelosas
                    prairie most of the people subsist by rearing cattle, sheep, horses, and mules.
                    Many of the horses are of the Andalusian and Numidian breed; and the cattle are
                    excellent, though slenderly formed. Numbers of the inhabitants are French, and
                    though often opulent, from habit and inclination they adhere to the simplicity
                    of pastoral life and primitive nature. Thousands of cattle range the plains,
                    there is a rustic abundance of every thing, and the land abounds in milk and
                    honey. There are various other prairies, but as they are of less importance than
                    those above enume- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> rated, and moreover possess
                    similar general features, they do not require any particular description.</p>
                <p>Wheat and rye do not flourish here in general, but oats and barley succeed well;
                    and maize grows luxuriantly on the alluvions and rich lands. The sweet potato,
                    <hi rend="italic">convolvulus batatas,</hi> in the sandy soil attains its utmost
                    perfection. They are of different species, and occasionally of a very large
                    size, but all are extremely nutritive, and raised with ease in great abundance.
                    ∙ The Irish potato is not so easily raised, and is only cultivated for eating
                    during thìe early part of summer. Garden vegetables generally appear to have no
                    assignable limit upon aì soil so varied, and in a climate so near the tropics.
                    It may seem almost incredible that horticulture should be neglected in
                    Louisiana, yet such is the case; and the fact seems the more unaccountable, when
                    it is considered that some individual gardens present what would appear an
                    irresistible temptation. The pumpkin and melon tribe flourish in this climate.
                    All the northern fruits come to perfection, with the exception of apples. The
                    apple-tree covers itself with blossoms and fruit, which, before it ripens, shows
                    a black speck, decays, and falls. Different kinds of figs grow in the greatest
                    abundance, and the tree would appear to attain its largest size in this quarter;
                    but, although growing spontaneously, it is only to be found on a few farms.
                    Along the whole shore of the gulf, and in some other places, the orange-tree,
                    sweet and bitter, flourishes, and the fruit is of the finest quality. The
                    cultivated vine flourishes abundantly; and wild grapes, such as the summer,
                    winter, fox, muscadine, and pine-wood grape, are abundant. Berries are neither
                    so common nor so good as in the north, but various kinds of wild fruit are
                    common in the woods. There are an immense number of wild and cultivated
                    flowering shrubs, which flourish in this region; and the abundance of mulberry
                    trees holds out a prospect that the culture of silk will ere long form one of
                    the branches of trade in this state. The timber-trees on the bottoms are willow,
                    cotton-wood, honey-eye locust, pawpaw, and buck-eye; on the rich uplands, elm,
                    cucumber, ash, hickory, mulberry, black walnut, with abundance of grape vines;
                    and on the second rate, or sandy uplands, white, pitch, and yellow pines, and
                    various kinds of oak. As yet agriculture is only in its infancy, the principal
                    object being not to produce a great variety of crops, but to obtain the greatest
                    amount of the staple productions. Sugar and rice are the staples of the state in
                    general south of 30°, and cotton north of that parallel; the latter, however, is
                    extensively cultivated in every part of the state. Sugar-cane is a very rich and
                    abundant article of growth in Louisiana. It requires the richest soil, the mould
                    of which should at least be a foot deep. There are three or four varieties or
                    species, as the African, the Otaheitan, the West Indian, and the riband cane.
                    The Otaheitan grows luxuriantly, and ripens considerably earlier than the West
                    Indian; but it is said to contain saccharine matter, in comparison with the
                    other, only as two to three. The riband cane is a new and beautiful species,
                    which possesses the advantage of not requiring so long a season for ripening.
                    Throughout the state the planters are turning their attention to the cultivation
                    of the sugar-cane, and nothing yields so rich a harvest. The rice is remarkably
                    fair, and yields abundantly. There is a great extent of land favourable for the
                    production of the upland rice; and no limit can be assigned to the amount which
                    might be raised. The cotton cultivated here is an annual plant, growing in the
                    rich lands more than six feet in height, and the larger stalks of the size of a
                    man’s arm, throwing out a number of branches, on which form large and beautiful
                    whitish-yellow blossoms. It is planted from March till the middle of May, in
                    drill rows, six feet apart. The kinds of cotton cultivated are, Louisiana, green
                    seed or Tennessee, and recently Mexican cotton. The green seed is not so fine a
                    staple, but it is less subject to the destructive malady called the rot. The
                    Mexican is of a finer staple, yields more abundantly, and has not hitherto
                    suffered from rot. It is being commonly adopted, and the importation of seed
                    from Tampicoand Vera Cruz is becoming a considerable business. Sea Island cotton
                    grows well upon grounds that have been exhausted by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193208859" xml:id="kp-eb0713-8859-0572"/>continued cultivation of the
                    other kinds. All the species exhaust the soil; but the seeds, which accumulate
                    in prodigious quantities around the gins, furnish an admirable manure, which
                    supplies the deficiency of nutriment. Attempts have been made to cultivate the
                    tea plant; and benne, which yields an oil similar to that of olives, succeeds
                    well. Indigo was formerly a prime object of attention amongst the planters, but
                    the cultivation of it has been in a great measure abandoned. The finest tobacco
                    is raised, but it is not so profitable as sugar and cotton, although that which
                    is cultivated in the vicinity of Natchitoches is said to equal the tobacco of
                    Cuba. Louisiana produces annually an average crop of more than 100,000 hogsheads
                    of sugar, and five millions of gallons of molasses. It is to this individual
                    branch of agriculture that the prosperity of the</p>
                <p>Union in general, and the west in particular, has in a great measure been
                    attributed. Such is a sketch of the agriculture of Louisiana. We shall now

                <p>New Orleans, the commercial capital of the state, and the emporium of western
                    commerce, is situated on the east bank of the Mississippi, in a bend so deep and
                    sinuous, that the sun rises to the inhabitants of the city from the opposite
                    shore, in north latitude 29. 57. and in longitude 98. 8. west from Greenwich. It
                    is nearly intermediate between Boston and Mexico although the passage from New
                    Orleans to Vcra Cruz is much shorter by sea than to Boston. It consists of the
                    old city properly so called, which is built in the form of a parallelogram, of
                    which the longer sides are 1320 yards in length, and the shorter, or the depth
                    of the city towards the swamp, 700 yards. No city on the globe possesses so
                    great natural advantages for a commercial capital as New Orleans. It has an easy
                    communication with the ocean; and above the city there are 20,000 miles of
                    navigation by means of the Mississippi and its numerous tributaries, whilst
                    various bayous connect it with different parts of the state. By a basin and
                    canal it communicates with Lake Ponchartrain, the lakes thence to the Gulf of
                    Mexico the opposite Florida shore, with Mobile, Pensacola, and the whole
                    gulf-shore east and west. There is also a railroad four and a half miles long
                    between the city and Lake Ponchartrain. Seen from the harbour, New Orleans
                    presents a striking panoramic view. The old city is divided into six squares,
                    each square having a front of 319 feet in length, and being divided into twelve
                    lots. Few of the streets are more than forty feet wide. Buildings of brick have
                    now replaced the wooden structures of which the city was formerly composed. The
                    French and Spanish styles of building predominate, and the houses are stuccoed
                    externally. The public buildings are, the town-house, the hospital, the
                    cathedral church of St Louis, the convent of Ursaline nuns, the barracks, the
                    custom-house, the market-house, five banks with a capital of 4,000,000 of
                    dollars, a government-house, district court of the United States, water-works,
                    two theatres, and a Presbyterian and other churches. Several of these buildings,
                    as the cathedral, are large, commodious, and handsome. The Fauxbourg of St Mary,
                    and other new parts of the city, are built principally of brick, after the
                    American style; and in general the city is gradually becoming American in all
                    its characteristics. Between the city and the bayou St John, are the villages St
                    Johnsburg and St Claud. The commerce of this city is immense, and constantly
                    increasing. There are sometimes in the harbour 1500 flat boats at a time; and
                    steam-boats arrive and take their departure every hour. No place in the United
                    States has so .much activity and bustle of commerce, crowded into so small a
                    space, in the months of February and March. During the season of bringing in the
                    cotton crop, whole streets are barricaded with cotton bales. The amount of
                    domestic exports from this city exceeds twelve millions of dollars a year, being
                    greater than that of any other city of the Union excepting New York, and nearly
                    equalling that place. The greatest items which enter into this amount are sugar
                    and cotton. From being placed in the midst of immense swamps, New Orleans is
                    generally considered as unhealthy, but few towns in the United States have
                    increased with greater rapidity. The market in general is cheap and abundant,
                    and the productions of every climate find their way thither. This city
                    necessarily exercises a very great moral influence over all the western country;
                    and there is not a distinguished merchant, planter, or farmer, in the
                    Mississippi valley, who has not made at least one trip to this place. The police
                    of the city is at once mild and efficient, and the municipal and criminal courts
                    are prompt in administering justice. A great portion of the inhabitants of New
                    Orleans arc of French and Spanish descent, and the French language is more used
                    than the English. During the busy season, the manners, dresses, customs, and
                    languages of every quarter of the globe are here exhibited. The means of
                    education in this city are very limited compared with those of the other large
                    cities of the United States, but there have been great improvements within the
                    last few years; and, considering that one half of the people are slaves, the
                    state of morals is better than might be expected. The following are some of the
                    principal imports into New Orleans for the year 1829 :—Bagging, 13,472 pieces;
                    buffalo robes, 15,210 lbs.; cotton, 269,571 bales; corn in ears, 91,882 barrels;
                    flour, 157,323 barrels; lard, 110,206 kegs; pig lead, 146,203 pigs; deer-skins,
                    6215 packs; tobacco, 29,432 hhds. The amount of cotton exported in the year
                    ending the 30th of September 1830 was 354,024 bales. Nothing seems adverse to
                    the growth of New Orleans except the unhealthiness of its climate; but, by
                    draining and otherwise improving it, it will probably be rendered more healthy,
                    and become one of the largest cities in the Union.</p>

                    ninety miles above New Orleans, has a number of houses, and has been selected by
                    the legislature as the place for the future political capital of the state.
                    Baton Rouge is on the east side of the Mississippi, 140 miles above New Orleans.
                    It is pleasantly situated on the last bluff that is seen on descending the
                    river. The site is thirty or forty feet above the highest overflow of the river.
                    The United States barracks here are built in a fine style, and are supposed to
                    be amongst the handsomest and most commodious of the kind. There is a delightful
                    prospect from the esplanade, including a great extent of the coast, with
                    handsome houses and rich cultivation below, and commanding an extensive view
                    over the back country to the east. The town consists of a number of French and
                    Spanish houses, with several green squares, and contains 1200 inhabitants. St
                    Francisville is a considerable village, of nearly the same size as Baton Rouge.
                    A good way to the westward of this town is Jackson, which is the seat of an
                    incipient college. On <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> the opposite shore is Point
                    Coupee, a wealthy French settlement. Galvez-town is situated on Bayou Manshac,
                    or Iberville, not far from where it enters Lake Ponchartrain. Alexandria, on Red
                    River, seventy miles from the Mississippi, and 150 from the mouth of the river
                    by its course, is situated on the south bank of the river, half a mile below the
                    fall. It is central to the rich planting country of Bayous Rapide, Robert, and
                    Boeuf. It is the seat of justice for the parish, has a bank, a number of stores,
                    and respectable attomies and physicians, and issues a weekly paper. Vast
                    quantities of cotton are exported from this place. The last town of any size
                    towards the south-western frontier of the United States is Natchitoches, about
                    sixty miles above Alexandria. The Spanish trade for a considerable distance into
                    the interior of the Mexican state centres here, and it is the great thoroughfare
                    for people going to and returning from these states. The trade from them
                    consists chiefly in bars of silver, and in horses and mules. Manufactured goods,
                    groceries, spirits, and tobacco, are sent in return. This is a very considerable
                    and growing place, and is likely to become the largest town in the country,
                    except New Orleans. It is beautifully situated on the bank of the river, and is
                    at the head of the steam-boat navigation. A few leagues to the west of this town
                    is the ancient Spanish town of Adayes, the inhabitants of which are all Spanish.
                    There are some other places, but none of such importance as to demand particular
                    mention.</p>
                <p>The canal which connects the city of New Orleans with Lake Ponchartrain has
                    already been mentioned. Where it terminates, at the north of the city, there is
                    a convenient basin, excavated entirely by art, and large enough to contain a
                    great number of vessels. Immense labour and expense were necessary to render the
                    river navigable, especially at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208885"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8885-0574"/>the mouth of the lake, where a large and
                    impassable bar was removed, and large piles of wood driven into the sand to
                    prevent it from forming again. A provision in the charter of this canal
                    corporation allows them to extend it to the Mississippi.</p>
                <p>The roads are for the most part good, but when they diverge to any distance from
                    the rivers they are subject to inundation. Numerous railroads and canals have
                    been projected; and there is no country in the world where nature has done more
                    towards forming natural canals, which a little labour would complete by
                    artificial extensions.</p>
                <p>The country was first peopled by the French, but the Spaniards obtained
                    possession of some parts, and established colonies in it. It was again conquered
                    by the English, and many of the original settlers remained in the country. It
                    was not admitted into the federal union until 1812. From the frequency of these
                    conquests, and the number of settlers from different nations, the character of
                    the inhabitants is different from that of those in most of the other states. The
                    descendants of the French possess many characteristics of that people, and
                    formerly lived in a state of pastoral simplicity. They are mild, vivacious, and
                    polite. The American planters are high minded, social, irascible, and generous;
                    much addicted to hunting, gambling, and dissipation. The people generally are
                    volatile, gay, benevolent, and easily excited to joy or sorrow. Education was
                    formerly at a very low ebb, but latterly ample and munificent appropriations
                    have been made, each parish in the state granting eight hundred dollars annually
                    for that purpose. The language generally spoken is French, but in a very corrupt
                    state. The prevailing religion is Roman Catholic, there being only a few
                    Baptists and Methodist societies, and one Presbyterian church, in the state.</p>
                <p>The constitution differs in some minor points from those of the other western
                    states. The senators are elected for a period of four years, one fourth vacating
                    their seats annually; and they must possess a property worth 1000 dollars before
                    they can be chosen. The representatives are elected for two years, and, to be
                    eligible, must have property in the parish worth 500 dollars. The governor is
                    elected for four years, with a salary of 7000 dollars annually, and cannot be
                    chosen for the next term. A supreme and circuit court exercise the judiciary
                    power, together with a municipal or parish court. Every free white man above
                    twenty-one years is entitled to vote in the elections, provided he has been six
                    months in the parish, and has paid taxes. In civil jurisprudence, this state
                    has, with some modifications, adhered to that derived from France and Spain; but
                    in criminal matters they have followed the English jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>This state has an extensive, and, from its great natural advantages, rapidly
                    increasing commerce. The quantity of sugar manufactured yearly averages about
                    60,629 hhds.; the quantity of molasses 3,018,041 gallons, and it is expected
                    that this state will furnish abundance of this article for the whole consumption
                    of the United States. The tobacco exported averages 29,543 hhds. annually, and
                    the cotton in the same period 308,243 bales. The yearly quantity, however,
                    depends entirely upon the season. The total amount of exports and imports in
                    1833 was, imports 9,590,505 dollars, and exports 18,941,373 dollars. The amount
                    received in the state for postage for die year ending the 31st of March 1832,
                    was 4,812,898 dollars. The number of banks in 1834 was ten, having a capital of
                    23,664,755 dollars, and they issued notes to the amount of 4,793,730 dollars.
                    The number of ships belonging to the state in 1830 was 399, and the number of
                    seamen employed 4789. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r. r.)</hi></p>
