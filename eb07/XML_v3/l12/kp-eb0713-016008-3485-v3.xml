                <p><label type="entry">LEEDS</label>, in the west riding of Yorkshire, the
                    metropolis of the woollen manufacture, is the fifth town in England in point of
                    population and commercial activity, being only exceeded in these respects by
                    London, Manchester, Liverpool, and Birmingham. The population of the parish and
                    borough, which are co-extensive, amounted, by the census of 1831, to 123,393.
                    The progressive rapidity with which this flourishing place has increased within
                    the present century, is shewn by the decennial enumerations of the inhabitants,
                    which are as follows:—In 1801, the population of the borough was 53,162; in
                    1811, it was 62,534; in 1821, it was 83,796; and in 1831, it was 123,393. The
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203498" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3498-0161"/>borough and
                    parish of Leeds are, however, very extensive, measuring, in their longest
                    diameter, not less than seven miles, and in circumference thirty; covering
                    21,450 acres; and comprising, besides the town and township, ten out-townships,
                    several of which are populous villages, nearly all engaged in the manufacture of
                    woollen cloth. The population of the township of Leeds, that is, of the town, in
                    1831, was 71,602; and of the out-townships as follows :—Hunslet, 12,074;
                    Holbeck, 11,210; Bramley, 7039; Wortley, 5944; Armley, 5159;
                    Headingley-with-Burley, 3849; Beeston, 2128; Chapel Allerton, 1934; Farnley,
                    1591; Potternewton, 863. The first two of these out-townships, Hunslet and
                    Holbeck, may strictly be called suburbs of the town, and therefore the
                    population of the town may be considered as 94,886.</p>
                <p>Leeds is situated nearly in the centre of the West Riding, in the wapentake of
                    Skyrack, and in the pleasant and well-cultivated valley of the Aire. The
                    surrounding country possesses much cheerful beauty, of which one indication is
                    furnished by the fact, that the Abbey of Kirkstall, one of the grandest monastic
                    structures in the kingdom, and of which the remains are highly picturesque, was
                    built in the same valley, within three miles of the town. The soil is moderately
                    fertile, and the country is not deficient in wood. For manufacturing and
                    commercial purposes, the situation of Leeds is highly advantageous. Placed
                    within a short distance of the great line of road from the metropolis to
                    Scotland, betwixt the two ports of Liverpool and Hull, both exceedingly
                    favourable for foreign trade, and on a navigable river emptying itself into the
                    Humber, its facilities for internal and foreign traffic can scarcely be
                    surpassed. But in its vicinity to large and productive coal-fields and
                    iron-mines, it possesses still higher requisites for manufacturing prosperity.
                    Coal, water, and iron, arc the three grand sources of success in manufactures,
                    because they afford all that is needed for the making and working of machinery.
                    This combination of advantages exists in an eminent degree in Leeds, and in the
                    woollen district of Yorkshire. The productive coal-pits of Middleton are within
                    three miles of the town, and the coals are brought to Leeds by a private railway
                    belonging to the proprietor of the pits, Mr Brandling.</p>
                <p>Though regarded as the capital town of this great manufacturing district, Leeds
                    is not in its centre, but on its border. Eastward an&lt;l northward of Leeds,
                    the country is wholly agri cultural; westward and to the south-west, in all the
                    valleys and on all the hills betwixt that town and the long and high range that
                    separates Yorkshire from Lancashire, the populous towns and villages resound
                    with the steam-engine and the shuttle, and are daily, save on the Sabbath,
                    canopied by their self-created clouds of smoke. In this district are carried on,
                    a woollen manufacture of great extent and of some antiquity; a worsted stuff
                    manufacture, a modern and vigorous graft on the former; fancy manufactures, of
                    which the raw materials are wool, cotton, and silk; the spinning of flax; and
                    the weaving of linen. The manufactures of Leeds itself are principally that of
                    woollen cloth, the spinning of flax to a great extent, and of worsted to a
                    smaller extent, and one branch of the worsted stuff manufacture; but its
                    merchants also buy extensively the woollen and stuff goods made in the
                    neighbouring towns and villages, and get them finished and dyed; so that Leeds
                    is a general mart for all these fabrics. The operatives in all the branches of
                    manufacture and trade, except the stuff " <hi rend="superscript"> caver</hi> s,
                    earn good wages, and thus have the means of great comfort.</p>
                <p>The cloth markets of Leeds, held every Tuesday and Saturday, are attended by
                    several hundreds of clothiers from t e surrounding villages to a distance of
                    about ten miles. ( ost of these clothiers arc small freeholders, possessing
                    apital enough to keep a few looms at work in their own houses or an adjoining
                    workshop, and often labouring themselves, and employing their families, in
                    weaving. They purchase their own wool, get it dyed at Leeds or elsewhere, and
                    scribbled and slubbed at the mills which perform those processes for hire; they
                    then spin it by means of the jenny, and weave the cloth, which they bring in an
                    undressed state to the Leeds cloth-halls, where it is bought by the merchants,
                    and is afterwards dressed and finished in the mills of that town. From twelve to
                    twenty years since, this system of domestic manufacture seemed in danger of
                    extinction, from the successful rivalry of the factory system. The large
                    manufacturers having, a few years before that time, succeeded, by gig-mills and
                    dressing machinery, in taking the finishing department out of the hands of the
                    croppers, thought they could, with equal advantage, carry on the spinning and
                    weaving in their large establishments, and thus perform every part of the
                    manufacture within the same building, from the sorting of the wool to the
                    turning out of the superfine cloth ready for the draper or tailor. This change
                    was not occasioned by the application of steam-power to the moving of the looms,
                    for the power-loom was then only used in one or two woollen mills; but was
                    recommended chiefly by the advantage of having the cloth made under the eye of
                    the merchant-manufacturer, who expect ed thus to be able to adapt his fabrics
                    more exactly to the wants of his customers, to command a better cloth, and to
                    obtain for himself the profit of spinning the yarn and making the cloth, as well
                    as of the early and the finishing processes. With this view, extensive weaving
                    shops were attached to most of the mills; and mule-jennies driven by power were
                    substituted for the jennies of the domestic manufacturers. The calculations of
                    the mill-owners were, however, disappointed. The spinning department succeeded,
                    but not so the weaving. They found it necessary, even in the ordinary state of
                    things, to pay higher wages for weaving in the towns than were paid in the
                    country; and the trades’ unions formed amongst the weavers in these large
                    establishments, forced up wages still higher, so as to make it more expensive to
                    the great manufacturers to make the cloth than to buy it of the domestic
                    clothier. In consequence of this, and of the extreme annoyance given by the
                    trades’ unions to the masters, many of the leading houses either wholly or
                    partially abandoned the weaving; and the village clothiers, who had been
                    threatened with ruin, regained their trade, and are now enjoying much
                    prosperity. If, however, the power-loom should continue to gain ground as it has
                    done within the last two or three years, and it should appear that woollen cloth
                    can be manufactured better or cheaper by that machine than by the hand-loom,
                    another change must take place, and the town of Leeds will then probably take
                    away much of the weaving from the villages.</p>
                <p>The Leeds cloth-halls, of which there are two, one for the sale of coloured
                    cloths, and one for white cloths only, form an interesting spectacle on the
                    market days. They arc very large plain structures, not divided into rooms, but
                    forming covered galleries or streets of great length, simply fitted up with low
                    stands or benches along each side of the street, on which the clothiers place
                    their cloth; and leaving an aisle of about two yards in width down the centre,
                    along which the merchants walk, to examine the pieces exposed for sale, and make
                    their bargains. The cloth-halls are under the management of trustees chosen by
                    the clothiers, one or two from each considerable village, and each clothier
                    purchases one or more stands. The market opens, at a certain fixed hour, on the
                    mornings of Tuesday and Saturday, and is kept open only about an hour and a
                    half, during which period all the business of buying and selling is transacted.
                    Punctuality and despatch are of course requisite. At the appointed hour of
                    commencement, the clothiers are ranged behind their stands, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203511" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3511-0162"/>and the merchants enter the
                    hall. When the latter find such pieces of cloth as they require, the price is
                    inquired, and, if a bargain should be struck, a slight memorandum of price and
                    quantity is made on the spot; the cloth is left, and the clothier afterwards
                    takes it to the merchant’s warehouse, to be measured and more carefully
                    examined. In this way goods of the value of many thousand pounds are sold each
                    market-day within a very short time. The hour of closing the market is rigidly
                    enforced, by a fine of five shillings being levied on any merchant remaining in
                    the hall five minutes after the ringing of a bell. The remainder of the day is
                    generally spent by the clothier in delivering his goods, in attending their
                    measurement and examination, in receiving payment, in buying of the woolstapler
                    a fresh stock of the raw material, and in making his arrangements with the dyer
                    and the mill-owner for dyeing and scribbling the wool. The coloured cloth-hall
                    was built in the year 1758; it forms a great quadrangle, inclosing an area of
                    the same shape. The longer sides of the quadrangle are 128 yards in length, and
                    the shorter sixty-six yards, and it contains 1800 stands. The white cloth-hall
                    was built in 1775; it is nearly of the same extent as the other hall, and
                    contains 1210 stands. The market in the white cloth-hall commences after that in
                    the coloured-cloth-hall is over, so as to allow the merchants an opportunity of
                    attending both. Before the erection of these halls, the clothmarket was held in
                    the long street called Briggate, and on the bridge.</p>
                <p>The woollen-cloths of Leeds and Yorkshire are confessedly inferior to those of
                    the West of England. About twenty years since, a great improvement in the
                    manufacture and finishing of cloth was made by Mr William Hirst, of Leeds, whose
                    manufacture was at least equal to that of the West of England; and he was able
                    to command a high price for his goods. His success and that of others shew that
                    as good cloth may be made in Yorkshire as in Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. But
                    the Yorkshire manufacturers having been habituated to make an inferior article,
                    and to sell it at a lower price, they do not readily abandon their old habits.
                    In cloths of the lower qualities they are unrivalled, and these constitute the
                    great bulk of their production. The example of a few manufacturers of capital,
                    intelligence, and spirit, and adding to the qualities, which are already
                    possessed by many of the Yorkshire manufacturers, a determination to use the
                    best materials, and to turn out the best fabrics, would probably regain for that
                    county a reputation for superfine cloths. The largest woollen mills in Leeds are
                    those of the wealthy firm of Benjamin Gott and Sons.</p>
                <p>The spinning of flax by machinery was commenced in Leeds, or the neighbourhood,
                    nearly fifty years since, by Mr John Marshall, who, though not the first, was
                    one of the first to apply the principle of Sir Richard Arkwright’s water-frame,
                    invented in the cotton-manufacture, to the spinning of linen yarn. After a
                    doubtfifl struggle with the difficulties that presented themselves, Mr
                    Marshall’s talent, boldness, and perseverance at length triumphed, and he
                    established a trade which has raised him from very moderate circumstances to the
                    possession of immense wealth, and has made him a great benefactor to his native
                    town. That gentleman represented the county of York in Parliament from 1826 to
                    1830, and his second son has represented the borough of Leeds in one Parliament.
                    The flax-mills of Messrs Marshall and Sons, in the township of Holbeck, are very
                    extensive, employing 1300 work-people. Several other flax-mills have also been
                    established in Leeds, most of them by gentlemen who were originally in the
                    employment of Messrs Marshall. The business has succeeded to a great extent, and
                    now employs about six thousand hands, with excellent profit to the capitalists,
                    and good wages to the workmen.</p>
                <p>The spinning of worsted yarn, and the weaving of worsted stuffs by power-looms,
                    are successfully carried on by a few houses in Leeds, and these branches seem
                    likely to be extended, though they belong more peculiarly to Bradford. There is
                    also in Leeds a branch of the worsted-stuff manufacture, consisting of the
                    weaving of camlets and low stuffs, employing about a thousand looms, the weavers
                    being for the most part Irish. The mercantile department of the stuff-trade is
                    largely prosecuted; and the merchants buy their goods, in the grey or unfinished
                    state, at the Bradford market, and have them dyed and finished at Leeds. There
                    is an establishment in this town for the spinning of waste silk.</p>
                <p>Where several manufactures are carried on to a great extent, there must of course
                    be many machine-makers; and this, accordingly, is a flourishing business in
                    Leeds. Steam-engines, of excellent quality, are made by the firm of Fenton,
                    Murray, and Jackson. The woollen and stuff dyers also form a rather numerous
                    class in this industrious community; and the trades of the wool-stapler, the
                    dry-salter, and the oil-merchant, employ considerable capitals.</p>
                <p>The following statements are from the returns of Mr Baker, the superintendent of
                    factories, at the close of the year 1835 :—</p>

                    importance of the woollen and flax trades in Leeds. Flax being only spun, and no
                    linens woven, in Leeds, all the processes are performed in the mills, and all
                    the hands employed are shewn in the above returns. But not so in the woollen
                    manufacture. Most of the weavers work in their own houses, or small work-shops;
                    some branches of the finishing are not performed in the mills; and the
                    establishments of the dyers, woolstaplers, &amp;c. are also separate.</p>
                <p>By the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, Leeds has a water communication with the
                    Western Sea; and by the river Aire, and the canals formed in connection with it
                    by the Aire and Caldcr Navigation Company, vessels of considerable burden come
                    up from the Humber to Leeds. The water communication with the ports of Hull,
                    Goole, and London, and with other parts of the United Kingdom and the north of
                    Europe, is therefore good. Still further to facilitate the transport of goods
                    and passengers, a railway of twenty-one miles in length has been formed from
                    Leeds to Selby, a town on the river Ouse, to which steam-packets come daily from
                    Hull. This railway was opened in September 1834; it is well constructed, and is
                    paying a fair interest to the proprietors. It will, however, be more useful and
                    prosperous when the projected railway from Hull to Selby shall be made. A bill
                    for this undertaking is now (1836) before Parliament, and when the work shall be
                    completed, the journey from Leeds to Hull will be performed in less than three
                    hours, which will at once be advantageous to the commerce of Hull, and to the
                    manufactures of Yorkshire and Lancashire. A railway is also projected between
                    Manchester and Leeds; and when this shall be made, as well as that from Hull to
                    Selby, a railway communication will be completed across the island, from
                    Liverpool to Hull, through the heart of the greatest cotton and woollen
                    manufactures in the world. The prosperity of those districts must necessarily be
                    increased by the extraordinary facilities that will thus be given to foreign and
                    inland traffic. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193203524"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-3524-0163"/>capitalists of Leeds being alive to the importance
                    of this new mode of conveyance, a railway has been planned from Leeds to Derby,
                    called the North Midland Railway, and the bill is now (1836) before Parliament.
                    By this line, in connexion with the London and Birmingham Railway, now in course
                    of formation, and either the Midland Counties or the Derby and Birmingham
                    Railway, both projected, a direct communication will be opened from Leeds to the
                    metropolis, and to the centre and west of England, as well as to Wakefield,
                    Barnsley, Sheffield, Derby, Nottingham, and Leicester. It is also more than
                    probable that a railway will shortly be constructed from Leeds northwards to
                    Durham, Newcastle, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. This town will then enjoy every
                    advantage that can be given by the most rapid communication with all parts of
                    Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Leeds is an ancient town, but has been the scene of no historical events. It was
                    probably a Roman station. The ancient name, <hi rend="italic">Loidis,</hi> is
                    Saxon, being derived either from <hi rend="italic">Loid,</hi> a people, or from
                    the proper name of one of its Saxon possessors. In the time of William the
                    Conqueror it appears to have had a very small population. The following is the
                    record of Domesday Book: “In Ledes, ten carucates of land and six oxgangs to be
                    taxed. Land to six ploughs. Seven thanes held it in the time of King Edward for
                    seven manors. Twenty-seven villanes, and four sokemen, and four bordars, have
                    now there fourteen ploughs. There is a priest and a church, and a mill of four
                    shillings and ten acres of meadow. It has been valued at six pounds, now seven
                    pounds.” After the Conquest, Leeds belonged to Ilbert de Lacy, by whom it seems
                    to have been granted to the Paganels; and in the reign of John, by which time
                    the town had risen into some consequence, Maurice Paganel granted a charter to
                    the burgesses. A castle of considerable strength, called “famous” by the
                    historian Thoresby, existed here in the reign of Stephen, by whom it was
                    besieged in 1139 on his march to Scotland; and Richard II. was confined in it in
                    1399, before being committed to Pontefract Castle, the scene of his murder.
                    Every trace of the castle has long since disappeared, and the site of the park
                    attached to it is only known from the names of the streets which have been built
                    upon it. A survey taken in the reign of Edward III. shews that the woollen-trade
                    already existed here, as “fulling-mills” are mentioned; so that Leeds must have
                    been one of the oldest seats of the woollen manufacture in England. Its trade
                    seems, however, to have languished, for Leland thus speaks of it in the reign of
                    Henry VIII. “Ledes, two miles lower down than Christal Abbay, on Aire river, is
                    a praty market toune, subsisting chiefly by clothing, having one paroche chirch,
                    reasonably well builded, and as large as Bradeford, but not so quik as it.” At
                    that day, also, Wakefield was larger than Leeds; but the latter place
                    subsequently increased far beyond all the neighbouring towns. Charles I. gave a
                    charter to the borough, under which Sir John Savile, of Howley-hall, from whom
                    several noble families are descended, was the first honorary alderman. The arms
                    of the town bear testimony to this connexion with the Saviles, as two crowned
                    owls, or <hi rend="italic">hullarts,</hi> the arms of that family, were added to
                    the golden fleece, the appropriate ensign of this seat of the woollen
                    manufacture. Another charter was given to Leeds by Charles II. in 1661, under
                    which a corporation was formed, consisting of a mayor, twelve aldermen, and
                    twenty-four assistants. This charter, though taken away by James II., was
                    restored by William and Mary, and continued in existence till the general reform
                    of the municipal corporations of England by the act of 5th and 6th William IV,
                    c. 76, which has given to Leeds, instead of a close and self-elected body for
                    the government of the borough, a representative body consisting of sixteen
                    aldermen and forty-eight councillors. The charter of Charles II. had, for its
                    principal object, the making of municipal laws and regulations to protect the
                    staple manufacture from “abuses, defects, and deceits in the making, selling,
                    and dyeing of woollen cloths.” The trade, however, was allowed a happy degree of
                    liberty; no restrictions were placed on settling in the town, or carrying on any
                    business; the corporation, having no property, and little political influence,
                    (seeing that the borough did not return members to Parliament,) remained free
                    from the abuses which stained many other corporations, and simply presided over
                    the police, doing otherwise neither good nor harm. During the Commonwealth,
                    Leeds returned one representative, Captain Adam Baynes, of Knostrop; but on the
                    Restoration that privilege was taken away, and this borough was one of those
                    great and flourishing places, the non-representation of which formed so
                    irresistible an argument for the reform of the House of Commons. By the reform
                    act, Leeds received two representatives. One of its first members was the
                    eloquent Thomas Babington Macaulay, since appointed a member of the supreme
                    council in India; and the other Mr John Marshall jun. It is now represented by
                    Sir John Beckett, formerly Judge-Advocate under Tory administrations, and by Mr
                    Edward Baines, the proprietor, and for many years the editor, of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Leeds Mercury,</hi> the most extensively circulated, and perhaps
                    the most influential of the English provincial newspapers, now conducted by his
                    son, who is also the author of a History of the Cotton Manufacture.</p>
                <p>Leeds has a parish church of great antiquity, but not very remarkable either for
                    its architecture or its monuments. The town has, besides, seven churches (not
                    reckoning those in the out-town ships), and numerous chapels belonging to the
                    Methodists, Independents, Baptists, and Unitarians. The Dissenters are a very
                    large body in Leeds; intelligent, active, and influential. There are perhaps few
                    towns of equal size where the moral and religious feeling is stronger, or where
                    there is greater sobriety of temper amongst the inhabitants. The latter
                    characteristic is indicated by the absence of any undue degree of speculation in
                    trade, by popular riots or commotions being almost unknown, and by the temperate
                    and judicious, though decided and influential, part which this town has taken in
                    promoting the cause of civil and religious liberty, and of reform in the
                    national institutions.</p>
                <p>Leeds is irregularly built, having no police regulations to enforce any thing
                    like uniformity in building. It has few attractions for the stranger. Yet some
                    of its structures arc handsome, and there is a spirit of improvement, which is
                    likely ultimately to remove many of the present defects, and to ornament the
                    town. The Court-house, of the date of 1815, is a handsome stone edifice; and the
                    Commercial Buildings are still more elegant. The town has several commodious
                    markets, an excellent suite of public baths, a good music-hall, and a miserable
                    theatre. Its waterworks are shamefully defective, but new works are
                    contemplated. The town is well lighted by two gas companies. Cavalry barracks
                    were erected a few years since at one of the outskirts. The savings bank is well
                    supported. The charities of Leeds are considerable; several of them, including
                    the free grammar-school, the hospital or almshouses, &amp;c. were either founded
                    or endowed by a munificent public benefactor, Mr John Harrison, who lived in the
                    early part of the seventeenth century, and who also built and endowed St John’s
                    Church. Of modern date, are a spacious and well-managed infirmary, a house of
                    recovery for fever patients, a dispensary, a guardian asylum, a lying-in
                    charity, a benevolent or strangers’ friend society, Lancasterian and National
                    schools, an infant school, &amp;c. The literary and scientific institutions of
                    the town are very respectable. The Philosophical and Literary Society, founded
                    in 1820, has a good museum, and its building is elegant, though plain. A
                    literary institution, a mechanics’ institution, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193203537" xml:id="kp-eb0713-3537-0164"/>subscription libraries also
                    exist in the town. A medical school has lately been established, and is
                    supported with talent and success by the physicians and surgeons, so that it has
                    attained some reputation, and its lectures are admitted by the College of
                    Surgeons and the Apothecaries’ Company as qualifying the pupils for entering on
                    the profession. The present number of pupils is from forty to fifty. A very
                    elegant and beautiful cemetery, covering nine acres of ground, was constructed
                    in the year 1835, in an elevated situation near the town; and this burial-place,
                    so desirable an appendage to a large town, is likely to be generally used by the
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The history of Leeds has been written by two antiquarians,—Ralph Thoresby, F. R.
                    S., a learned and pious native of the town, who published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ωucatus Leodiensis</hi> in 1714, and the Rev. Thomas Dunham Whitaker, LL.D., F.
                    S. A., who re-published Thoresby’s work, and added another volume, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Loidis and Elmete,</hi> in 1816. The latter work
                    deserves high praise for its ability and antiquarian learning, but it is
                    miserably defective in its notice of the manufactures and trade of the place,
                    and treats them with the most prejudiced contempt. Leeds was the native place of
                    Dr David Hartley, the pupil of Sir Isaac Newton, and author of “Observations on
                    Man he was the son of a clergyman at Armley. General Guest, the commander of the
                    King’s troops at Edinburgh in 1745, was the son of a Leeds cloth-dresser. Mr
                    John Smeaton, the celebrated engineer, and the architect of Eddystone
                    light-house, was born at Austhorp, in this parish, where his family still
                    reside. Benjamin Wilson, the eminent painter, who flourished about the middle of
                    the last century, was a native of Leeds. The Rev. Joseph Priestley, LL. D., the
                    distinguished philosopher, was born at Bristol, within eight miles of Leeds, and
                    officiated for several years as the minister of the Unitarian Chapel in this
                    town; and during his residence here, a select literary society was formed, of
                    which the Doctor and the late William Hey, F. R. S., an eminent surgeon and a
                    Christian philanthropist, were the most active members: they met for the purpose
                    of philosophical enquiry and experiment. The Leeds Subscription Library
                    originated in the suggestion of Dr Priestley. Leeds gives a ducal title to the
                    family of Osborne, which sprung from this town. Edward Osborne, in the reign of
                    Henry VIII., went from Leeds to be apprenticed to Sir William Hewet, Lord Mayor
                    of London; and having plunged into the Thames to save the life of his master’s
                    only daughter, who had fallen into the river from their house on London Bridge,
                    he was appropriately rewarded for his gallantry with the lady’s hand. He himself
                    became Lord Mayor of London; and his descendant, Sir Thomas Osborne, Bart.,
                    became the celebrated Earl of Danby and Duke of Leeds, and was president of the
                    council in 1689. Leeds is distant 190 miles from London, and 24 from York.</p>
