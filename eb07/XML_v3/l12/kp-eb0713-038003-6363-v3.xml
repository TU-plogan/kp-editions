                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LITHOGRAPHY</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lithography</hi> is the art of taking impressions from
                    drawings or writings made on <hi rend="italic">stone.</hi></p>
                <p>The principles upon which this art is founded are, Hi, The quality which a
                    compact granular limestone has of imbibing grease or moisture; and, 2<hi
                    rend="italic">dly,</hi> The decided antipathy <hi rend="italic">of</hi> grease
                    and water for each other.</p>
                <p>A drawing being made upon the stone with an ink or crayon of a greasy
                    composition, is washed over with water, which sinks into all the parts of the
                    stone not defended by the drawing. A cylindrical roller, charged with
                    printing-ink, is then passed all over the stone, and the drawing receives the
                    ink, whilst the water defends the other parts of the stone from it on account of
                    its greasy nature.</p>
                <p>This process, therefore, depends entirely upon chemical principles, and is thus
                    distinct from letter-press or copperplate printing, which are altogether
                    mechanical. On this account it has in Germany been called <hi rend="italic"
                    >chemical printing</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, as metallic plates can be
                    prepared to be printed from in a similar manner, lithography is considered only
                    as a branch of chemical printing.</p>
                <p>I. HISTORY OF LITHOGRAPHY.</p>
                <p>The invention of lithography was the result of accident. Its inventor, Alois
                    Senefelder, the son of a performer at the theatre-royal of Munich, was placed
                    for education at the university of Ingolstadt, as a student of jurisprudence;
                    but after his father’s death he attempted a theatrical career. Not succeeding in
                    this, he became an author, though his poverty prevented him from publishing his
                    works. He now tried many plans with copperplates and compositions, as
                    substitutes for letter-press, in order to be his own printer. He found, in the
                    course of his experiments, that a composition of soap, wax, and lamp-black,
                    formed a good material for writing on his plates; that, when dry, it became firm
                    and solid, and that it resisted aquafortis. Wanting facility in writing
                    backwards on the plates, he got some pieces of Kilheim stone, as cheap
                    materials, upon which he could practise after polishing their surfaces. One day
                    being desired by his mother to take an account of some linen about to be sent to
                    be washed, and having no paper at hand, he wrote· the account on a polished
                    stone, with his composition ink, intending to copy it at his leisure. When he
                    was afterwards about to efface this writing, it occurred to him that he might
                    obtain impressions from it; and, having eaten away the stone with acid for about
                    the hundredth of an inch, he found that he could charge the lines with printing
                    ink, and take successive impressions. This new mode of printing appeared to him
                    very important, and he persevered through all difficulties in applying his
                    discovery to practical purposes, and in improving it.</p>
                <p>In the course of many experiments, he found that it <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193206376" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6376-0381"/>was not necessary to have the
                    letters raised above the surface of the stone, but that the chemical principles
                    by which grease and water are kept from uniting, were alone sufficient for his
                    purpose. This point obtained, lithography may be said to have been fully
                    discovered. All that was required was the improvement of the materials, and the
                    mode of working with them, and the construction of a proper press for taking the
                    impressions.</p>
                <p>The perseverance with which he followed up his experiments, in order to overcome
                    the difficulties which successively arose in his progress, is astonishing, and
                    the more so, considering the total want of method in his proceedings. Often did
                    he waste months in surmounting a difficulty which a little knowledge, or a very
                    little reasoning, would have enabled him to conquer immediately. His uniform
                    plan seems to have been, to try the first thing that came to hand, and so on in
                    succession, till chance rewarded his assiduity by presenting to him the material
                    suited to his purpose.</p>
                <p>The first essays he made to print for publication were some pieces of music,
                    executed in 1796; but afterwards he attempted drawings and writings. The
                    difficulty he had in writing backwards led him to the process of <hi
                    rend="italic">transfer</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the use of dry soap,
                    which was found to leave permanent traces that would give impressions, naturally
                    led to the mode of chalk drawings.</p>
                <p>Having made considerable improvements, Mr Senefelder obtained, in 1799, a patent
                    privilege for Bavaria, when he made known his process, and afterwards entered
                    into partnership with Mr André of Offenbach, who proposed to establish presses,
                    and take out patents at London, Paris, and Vienna. For this purpose Senefelder
                    came to London with a brother of André’s, and the invention having been much
                    spoken of, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Poly autography,</hi> most of the
                    principal English artists made trials of it. Unfortunately, however, the art of
                    printing from the stones was not then fully understood, and the difference
                    between the materials of Germany and those of England, used both for the
                    purposes of drawing and printing, caused constant failures, and the artists in
                    succession abandoned the practice of it. To this cause is to be attributed the
                    slow progress which lithography made for many years in England, as it was left
                    entirely in the hands of <hi rend="italic">amateurs,</hi> whose productions,
                    generally speaking, did no credit to the art, and whose faults .were in some
                    degree supposed to be those of the art itself.</p>
                <p>In August 1800, Senefelder, who had now separated from André, went to Vienna,
                    where, after much difficulty, a patent was obtained, and extensive preparations
                    were made, for applying his process to print cottons; but bad management, and
                    some unfortunate circumstances, prevented his success, and he returned to Munich
                    in 1806, leaving the establishment in other hands.</p>
                <p>In 1806, Mr Mitterer, professor of drawing at the public school at Munich,
                    practised lithography to multiply copies for the pupils, and is said to have
                    invented the chalk composition in its present form, or at least to have improved
                    it greatly.</p>
                <p>From this period, the practice of the art has extended and improved rapidly, and
                    more particularly at Munich, where several establishments were formed for the
                    purpose of applying it to the fine arts, as well as for printing writings and
                    official forms for the different departments of the government.</p>
                <p>In October 1809, Senefelder was appointed inspector of the royal lithographic
                    establishment at Munich, for printing from stone a complete map and survey of
                    Bavaria; after which period he devoted his time to experiments, and to writing
                    the history of his invention. Among other points of improvement to which his
                    attention was directed, was a substitute for the stones, which are inconvenient
                    to use on account of their weight; and they are also liable to break in the
                    press, when used without due caution, or when they contain flaws. For this
                    purpose he made a composition of drying oil, finely ground earth, and other
                    substances, which was thinly spread over pieces of parchment; but nothing of
                    this sort has hitherto been found to answer. The surface cracks after repeated
                    wetting and exposure to the power of the press, and the printing ink then enters
                    the cracks, and spoils the impressions. Thus a very small number only of good
                    impressions can be obtained. A public exhibition of printing from this stone
                    paper was made in London, on the 23d July 1821, by a partner of Mr Senefelder;
                    but the result was not such as to induce much confidence in the ultimate success
                    of the trials to form this desirable substitute of a light material for a heavy
                    one.</p>
                <p>In England lithography was never entirely given up from its first introduction in
                    1800, although it was but little practised after 1806, till its revival at the
                    latter end of 1817. Since then it has been most sedulously cultivated, and with
                    such success, that its importance as a branch of trade is now almost equal to
                    the art of engraving.</p>
                <p>In France but little was done in lithography till 1815, when it was established
                    at Paris by Lasteyrie, and being taken up by good artists, it soon attained
                    great excellence.</p>
                <p>Since this period it has extended most rapidly, and there is not now a town of
                    any importance, either in Europe, North America, or in the East or West Indies,
                    where lithography is not practised.</p>
                <p>II. DESCRIPTION OF THE MATERIALS, AND THE MODE OF PREPARING THEM.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Of the Stones, and the manner in which they are prepared to
                    receive the Drawings.</hi></p>
                <p>As calcareous stones will all imbibe grease and moisture, and effervesce with an
                    acid (the use of which will appear when we speak of the process of printing),
                    they are all capable of being used for lithography. Those are best adapted to
                    the purpose which are very compact, of a fine and equal grain, and free from
                    veins, or imbedded fossils or crystals.</p>
                <p>The quarries of Solenhofen, near Pappenheim, in Bavaria, furnished the first
                    plates, and none have as yet been found to equal them, in quality. They are of a
                    very uniform pale yellowish-white colour. The fracture is perfectly conchoidal.
                    The beds divide into thin portions of considerable size, with perfectly flat
                    surfaces, and were on this account carried to Munich, and other places, for
                    paving kitchens and halls, and thus came in the way of Senefelder, when he
                    discovered the chemical process of printing.</p>
                <p>The stones of this quarry vary in their quality, but the best may be had in great
                    abundance. Generally speaking, the hardest are the best, provided they are quite
                    uniform in texture. Such are necessary for fine chalk drawings; softer ones may
                    do for ink, or for coarser drawings in chalk.</p>
                <p>In France, stones have been found near Chateauroux <hi rend="italic">[Departement
                    de I Indre),</hi> of a similar colour to those of Solenhofen, and even harder
                    and of a finer grain; but they are so full of large spots of a softer nature,
                    that it is scarcely possible to get one perfect of a greater size than twelve
                    inches square.</p>
                <p>In England, a stone has been used for lithography which is found at Corston, near
                    Bath. It is one of the white has beds, but not so fine in grain, or so close in
                    texture, as the German stone, and therefore far inferior. But it is good for
                    transfers, and does tolerably well for ink drawings or writings. Another stone,
                    found near Stony Stratford, is also used; but it is of a brownish-gray tint, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193206389" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6389-0382"/> and too dark in
                    colour to show the effect of the drawing with sufficient clearness.</p>
                <p>To bear the pressure used in taking the impressions, a stone twelve inches square
                    should be at least an inch and a quarter thick. The thickness must increase with
                    the size of the stone, but two inches and a half are a thickness sufficient for
                    stones of three feet by three feet and a half.</p>
                <p>The stones, when sawn to a proper size and thickness, are ground level by rubbing
                    two of them face to face with water and sand, and very carefully examined with a
                    straight-edge, to ascertain that they are perfectly level in all directions.
                    This applies only to the side which is afterwards to receive the drawing, as the
                    natural division of the stone is sufficiently true for the back.</p>
                <p>To prepare them for chalk-drawings, two stones, which have been perfectly
                    levelled, are well washed, in order to free them from any of the coarser grains
                    of sand which have been previously used upon them. They are now to be placed on
                    a board over a trough, and a small quantity of water and fine sand being strewed
                    over the surfaces, they are to be rubbed face to face, adding occasionally a
                    little fresh sand and water. The best sort of sand in England is that called
                    silver sand for preparing the stone, and the common brown sand for giving a fine
                    grain. The sands must be passed through a sieve of the fineness required, which
                    will vary with the nature of the drawing; and the greatest care must be taken to
                    have the sieves perfect, and to prevent any coarser particles of sand from being
                    mixed with the rest. A single grain would fill the stone with innumerable
                    scratches, which would all appear in the drawing. The upper stone is in this
                    operation moved in small circles carefully and equally all over the under one,
                    taking care not to move the one beyond the edge of the other, or the faces would
                    become rounded. When the grain is equal, and sufficiently fine, the stones are
                    carefully washed, and wiped with a clean cloth. The stone, thus prepared, should
                    have, when dry, a perfectly uniform appearance in the colour and grain, and
                    resemble a sheet of vellum. It should be free from scratches, and have no
                    shining parts. The upper stone is always the finer grained of the two.</p>
                <p>To prepare the stones for ink drawings or writings, the process just described is
                    first followed; they are then well washed to get rid of the sand, and the same
                    operation of rubbing two together is continued with powdered pumice-stone and
                    water. When perfectly smooth, they are again washed, and afterwards separately
                    polished with a large piece of fine pumice-stone, or Water of Ayr stone. The
                    polish now given to the stone should be such as to show the reflection of
                    objects to the eye placed close to the stone, and looking along it towards the
                    light.</p>
                <p>When a writing or drawing has been fully used, and the stone is to be again
                    prepared, sand is strewed over the surface, and it is sprinkled with water, and
                    rubbed with another stone, as before described, till all traces of the drawing
                    has disappeared. After this, the stone is again prepared for a new drawing with
                    fine sand, by being grained or polished, as before.</p>
                <p>Ink drawings sink deeper into the stone than the chalk, and require the stone to
                    be more ground away to efface them. The longer drawings remain upon the stone,
                    the deeper the ink or the chalk penetrates.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Lithographic Ink and Chalk.</hi></p>
                <p>For these materials, the union of several qualities is required; and as no single
                    substance possesses them all, it is necessary to combine several substances
                    together.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lithographic Ink.</hi></p>
                <p>The qualities required in lithographic ink, by which is meant the ink for drawing
                    on stone, are, first, that it shall have in its composition such a quantity of
                    greasy or fatty matter as will secure its imparting to the stone, even when it
                    is laid on in the most delicate lines, a trace strong enough to attract readily
                    the ink afterwards to be applied by the roller; and, secondly, that this ġrease
                    be so prepared, by being mixed with alkali and other substances, as to be easily
                    soluble in water, and to flow readily from the pen or brush when used for
                    drawing. Many receipts have been given for this purpose, but the following is
                    one of the most approved; and, ordinary care being taken in its preparation, it
                    will be found to answer.</p>

                <p>Lamp black, about one twentieth of the whole.</p>
                <p>These materials are prepared in an iron saucepan, with a cover. The wax and
                    tallow are first put in and heated till they ignite; whilst they are burning,
                    the soap must be thrown in in small pieces, one at a time, taking care that the
                    first is melted before a second is put in. When all the soap is melted, the
                    ingredients are allowed to continue burning till they are reduced one third in
                    volume. The shell lac is now added, and as soon as it is melted, the flame must
                    be extinguished. It is often necessary, in the course of the operation, to
                    extinguish the flame, and take the saucepan from the fire, to prevent the
                    contents from boiling over; but if, after the process above described, any parts
                    are not completely melted, they must be dissolved over the fire without being
                    again ignited.</p>
                <p>Sometimes a larger proportion of wax is used, when only half of the soap is put
                    in, and the burning goes on until the quantity is reduced one half. The
                    remainder of the soap is then added over a fire which keeps the mass melted
                    without igniting it.</p>
                <p>The black, being previously mixed with thick varnish, such as will be described
                    when we come to treat of printing inks, should now be added; and when it is
                    completely dissolved, the whole mass should be cast on a marble slab, and a
                    heavy weight laid over it, to render its texture fine. When cold, though not so
                    hard, it should in its fracture have an appearance resembling Indian ink.</p>
                <p>So much here depends upon the manipulation, that even the most experienced person
                    can never be sure that the desired result is altogether attained, until the
                    product is subjected to experiments; the mass may have been burned a little more
                    or a little less than enough; too much or too little time may have been allowed
                    to elapse betwixt the putting in of one ingredient and another: such
                    circumstances, trifling as they appear, are quite sufficient to render the ink
                    altogether unfit for use. It not unfrequently happens, therefore, that such
                    faults as the following are to be found: If it has been too little burned, it
                    may appear soft, and, if soluble, it may, when mixed with water, speedily become
                    thick and slimy, in which case it must be re-melted and burned a little more;
                    but if, on the other hand, it has been burned too much, it may appear to be
                    composed of sand, and, when used, although it will flow pleasantly enough, may
                    not have enough of grease left in it to attract the printing ink when applied.
                    This fault may be corrected by remelting it, and adding a small quantity of soap
                    and wax.</p>
                <p>Keeping in view the principles here pointed out, any one can, alter a few trials,
                    make good lithographic ink.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ink for Transfers.</hi></p>
                <p>This ink may be composed of the same materials as the ink for drawing on stone,
                    with the addition of a little more <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206402"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6402-0383"/>wax. If it is too little burned, the lines of the
                    writing or drawing will spread on being transferred to the stone; if too much, a
                    sufficient quantity of grease will not be imparted to the stone to attract the
                    ink from the roller when it is applied: but either of these defects may be
                    corrected as before directed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lithographie</hi><hi rend="italic">Chalk.</hi></p>
                <p>This should have the qualities of a good drawing crayon; it should be even in
                    texture, and carry a good point. It is, however, difficult to avoid making it
                    too soft and greasy On the one hand, and too brittle on the other. For the
                    chalk, as for the ink, more or less of the soap, wax, and tallow may be used, as
                    the extent of the burning may render necessary; and the remedies pointed out for
                    defects of the ink will enable the operator to judge of what is wanting.</p>
                <p>The following proportions are the best:</p>
                <p>Common soap 11 oz.</p>
                <p>Tallow 2 oz.</p>
                <p>Virgin wax <hi rend="italic">2į</hi> oz.</p>
                <p>Shell lac 1 oz.</p>
                <p>The manipulation is similar to that for the ink. It is well, however, to throw in
                    a little of the wax just before the flame is extinguished. Less black must be
                    mixed with the chalk than with the ink, its only use being to colour the
                    drawing, so that the artist may see the lines he traces.</p>
                <p>When the whole is well mixed, it should be poured into a mould, and very strongly
                    pressed to prevent any bubbles, which would make the texture irregular.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Mode of Drawing.</hi></p>
                <p>Wſth these materials the artist proceeds to work on the prepared stone, taking
                    care first to wipe the stone with a clean dry cloth. The ink being rubbed with
                    warm water like Indian ink, is used on the <hi rend="italic">polished</hi>
                    stone; and it is to be observed, that a gradation of tints can be obtained only
                    by varying the thickness of the lines, and the distance at which they are placed
                    apart, as the line traced by the ink, being sound and unbroken throughout,
                    receives the printing ink all over. Hence it follows, that the artist cannot
                    gain any advantage by diluting the ink for the lighter tints of the drawing, as
                    the printing ink will take effect equally upon all the lines, and at once render
                    all of them equally black. The object of the artist is to mix the ink to that
                    consistency which, whilst it works freely, shall yet be strong enough to stand
                    perfect through the process of printing. A consistency a little stronger than
                    writing ink is sufficient for this purpose.</p>
                <p>The chalk cannot be used upon the polished stone.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">grained</hi> stone, prepared for chalk, being carefully
                    wiped to free it from dust, must be drawn upon with the crayon as common drawing
                    chalk is used on paper. The subject may be traced on the stone with lead pencil
                    or red chalk, but care should be taken to do this very lightly, so as not to
                    fill up any of the grain of the stone. In drawing, the degree of pressure of the
                    hand will vary the strength-of the tint, and it is desirable to give the
                    requisite strength at once, as the surface of the stone is a little altered by
                    receiving the chalk, and hence it does not take any additional lines with the
                    same equality. Practice is necessary to give a command of the material, as it
                    does not work quite like the common crayon, there being great difficulty in
                    keeping a good point. There is also much difficulty in obtaining the finer tints
                    found in the impression; and for the light tints it is necessary to put the
                    chalk in a reed, as the metal port-crayon is too heavy to draw them, even
                    without any pressure from the hand; and therefore the artist cannot draw them
                    with freedom, as his touch will be unsteady, by being obliged to support the
                    pencil from the stone.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to observe the grain with which the stone is prepared, which
                    should vary with the fineness of the drawing. Several pieces of chalk should be
                    prepared to use in succession, as the warmth of the hand softens it.</p>
                <p>It is useful to cut the chalk in the form of a wedge rather than a point, as it
                    is less likely to bend in that form.</p>
                <p>Small portions of the point will break off during the drawing; and these must be
                    carefully removed with a small brush.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Printing Press and Poller.</hi></p>
                <p>' The printing press for lithography does not differ materially from the ordinary
                    copperplate press. A detailed description of one of the most approved
                    construction will be given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Printing.</hi><hi rend="italic">The Poller.</hi></p>
                <p>The following is a representation of the roller:</p>
                <p>The length may vary, but it ought to be full <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> four
                    inches in diameter. It is covered with flannel, rolled tightly three or four
                    times round, and nailed at the ends. It is then covered with a stretched
                    calf-skin, fitting quite tight. The scam must be made neatly with the
                    boot-maker’s closing stitch. The ends of the leather are gathered with a string,
                    and tied round the projecting ends of the roller. Loose handles, A, A, made of
                    thick leather, are put on these ends when it is used. The leather must be put on
                    the roller with the smooth side outwards.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Printing Ink.</hi></p>
                <p>The printing ink is composed, as other printing inks are, of oil, varnish, and
                    very fine lamp-black, well mixed together. To prepare the varnish, a saucepan is
                    about half filled with pure linseed oil, and heated over a fire till it ignites
                    from the flame of a piece of burning paper. It should then be allowed to burn
                    till it be reduced to the degree required; and if, during the operation, there
                    appear danger of its boiling over, it should be immediately taken off the fire,
                    and the cover, which ought to fit quite close on the saucepan, must be put on to
                    extinguish the flame. This is to prevent accidents; and the operator cannot be
                    sufficiently cautioned against the danger attending the burning of the varnish,
                    which ought never to be performed in a room with a boarded floor, or indeed in
                    any part of a house. Wet sacks are the best things to put out the flame in case
                    of accident.</p>
                <p>Several inks must be prepared, differing in the degree of viscidity, or thickness
                    of the varnish from which they are made, and the quantity of black mixed with
                    them. The longer the oil is burned, the thicker the varnish becomes. The
                    thinnest varnish is burned till it has lost nearly one fourth of its volume; the
                    next till it is reduced one third; the thickest till it is reduced one half.</p>
                <p>These directions are to be considered as very general ones; and the state of the
                    varnish is best judged of during the burning, by taking out some with a spoon,
                    and letting a drop fall on a cold earthenware plate, and trying its degree of
                    viscidity with the finger. The thinnest sort should be like common honey, and
                    the other should draw out in strings, which will be longer as the varnish is
                    thicker. The thickest will draw out in strings two or three feet in length.</p>
                <p>It is quite essential to have the oil pure, and the saucepan perfectly clean, and
                    to keep the varnish in clean close <pb break="no" facs="nls:193206415"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-6415-0384"/>jars in a cool place. It is best not to make the
                    varnish long before it is wanted; for if any decomposition takes place in it,
                    the drawing will be spoiled by the printing ink. The black is mixed with the
                    varnish on a grinding stone with a muller, in small successive quantities; care
                    being taken that the first portion of black is equally mixed with the varnish
                    before a second is added. In the thickest inks this requires considerable
                    labour. By mixing the varnishes together, any degree of stiffness of the ink may
                    be obtained; and by putting more or less black, its thickness is regulated. The
                    printer must always have by him several small pots, each containing a different
                    printing ink, to be used as occasion requires. A small quantity, not more than
                    the size of a hazel-nut, should be used at a time; for it is desirable to charge
                    the roller with as small a quantity as possible. It must be worked well on the
                    colour table with the roller in all directions, that it may be equally
                    distributed all over the roller. Ink drawings are generally printed with a
                    stiffer inkjhan chalk drawings.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Preparation of the Stone for Printing.</hi></p>
                <p>The drawing being finished on the stone as before described, is sent to the
                    lithographic printer, on whose knowledge of his art the success of the
                    impressions in a great measure depends. The first process is to etch the
                    drawing, as it is called. This is done by placing the stone obliquely on one
                    edge over a trough, and pouring over it nitric acid very much diluted. It is
                    poured on the upper part of the stone, and runs down all over the surface. The
                    stone is then turned, and placed on the opposite edge, and the etching water,
                    being collected from the trough, is again poured over it in the same manner. The
                    degree of strength, which is little more than one per cent, of acid, should be
                    such as to produce a very slight effervescence; after the etching water has lain
                    on the stone for a second or two, its strength must vary according to the heat
                    of the atmosphere and the degree of fineness of the drawing. It is desirable to
                    pass the etching water two or three times over the darkest parts of the drawing,
                    as they require more etching than the lighter tints; and when the drawing is
                    fine, a little green should be mixed with it. Some stones also, and different
                    chalks, require different degrees of strength of the acid; and experience alone
                    can guide the lithographer in his practice on this point. Chalk drawings require
                    weaker acid than the ink.</p>
                <p>The stone is now carefully washed, by pouring clean rain-water over it, and
                    afterwards with gum-water; and when not too wet, the roller, charged with
                    printing ink, is rolled over it in both directions, viz. sideways, and from top
                    to bottom, till the drawing takes the ink. It is then well covered over with a
                    solution of gum-arabic in water, of about the consistency of oil. This is
                    allowed to dry, and preserves the drawing from any alteration, as the lines
                    cannot spread, in consequence of the pores of the stone being filled with the
                    gum. After the etching, it is desirable to leave the stone for a day, and best
                    not to leave it more than a week, before it is printed from. In some
                    establishments a few proofs are taken immediately after the drawing is etched,
                    but it is better not to do so.</p>
                <p>The operation of the etching requires great nicety, and must be done quickly. If
                    the drawing is etched too strongly, the fine tints disappear; if too weak, the
                    printing ink mixes with the darker parts, and the drawing runs into blots. A
                    soft stone requires weaker acid than a hard one, if they are equally pure in
                    quality. The differences in the composition of the stones also require
                    differences in the strength of the etching water, so that no strict or certain
                    rules can be given.</p>
                <p>The effect of the etching is, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> to take away the
                    alkali mixed with the drawing chalk or ink, which would make the drawing liable
                    to be affected by the water; and, <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> to make the
                    stone refuse more decidedly to take any grease. The gum assists in this latter
                    purpose, and is quite essential to the perfect preparation of the surface of the
                    stone.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Printing.</hi></p>
                <p>When the stone is to be printed from, it is placed on] the bed or platten of the
                    press; at this time a proper sized scraper for the printing is very carefully
                    adjusted to the surface of the stone. The gum on the stone is now sprinkled with
                    rain-water, and being gradually dissolved, and a wet sponge passed lightly all
                    over it, the printer works the ink which is on the colour table placed beside
                    him, with the roller, in all directions, till it is equally and thinly spread
                    all over the roller. He then, the stone being wet, passes the roller all over
                    the stone in both directions, observing, as his experience enables him to do,
                    that all parts of the drawing take the ink in due proportion. The roller should
                    be applied with an equal motion and pressure, which must be regulated according
                    to the mode in which the drawing takes the ink; if it does not take it readily,
                    the pressure must be increased, [and the roller moved more slowly. The roller
                    should turn freely as it passes over the stone; if it slips, the cause is either
                    that the stone is too wet, or that too much of the gum remains upon the stone;
                    in the first case, a drier sponge will correct the evil; in the second, the
                    stone must be again washed with a little water; but this must be done with
                    caution, as the gum· should not be entirely washed off the stone.</p>
                <p>At first the drawing receives the ink with some difficulty, and it is frequently
                    necessary to wet the stone and roll it in several times, before it will take the
                    ink readily. Care must now be taken not to wet the stone too much; the less
                    dampness the better, provided it is sufficient to keep the stone from taking the
                    ink in the parts where there is no drawing; at all events, no drops of water
                    should be seen upon the stone, as they spoil the printing ink, and also are
                    imbibed by the roller, which therefore becomes unfit for use. After the drawing
                    is thus rolled in, the sheet of paper is placed on the stone, and the impression
                    taken in the manner described in the account of the press. When, after the
                    impression, the paper is taken up, the stone appears dry, the moisture having
                    been imbibed by the paper. It must be again wetted with a damp sponge, and
                    rolled in with ink as before, taking care to work the roller well on the colour
                    table each time before applying it to the stone.</p>
                <p>Generally the first few impressions are imperfect, from the drawing not taking
                    the ink fully; but this is gradually corrected in the succeeding
                    impressions.</p>
                <p>During the printing some gum must always remain on the stone, though it will not
                    be visible, otherwise the ink will take on the stone, and also spoil the
                    drawing. If, by too much wetting, or by rubbing too hard with the sponge, the
                    gum is entirely removed, some fresh gumwater must be laid on. If the stone has,
                    in the first instance, been laid by with too small a quantity of gum, and the
                    ink stains the stone on being first applied to it, gum-water must then be used
                    to damp the stone instead of pure water. Sometimes, however, this may arise from
                    the printing ink being too thin, as will appear below. If some spots on the
                    stone take the printing ink, notwithstanding the above precautions, some strong
                    acid must be applied to them with a brush; and after this is washed off, a
                    little gum-water is dropped on the place. A steel point is here frequently
                    necessary to take off the spots of ink. The edges of the stone are very apt to
                    soil, and generally require to be wiped with an old sponge or rag <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193206428" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6428-0385"/>after the rolling in. They
                    must also frequently have an application of acid and gum, and sometimes be
                    rubbed with pumice-stone. Chalk drawings are much the most difficult to print.
                    After this general description of the printing, the following development of the
                    principles on which it is regulated, and notice of the difficulties which arise
                    in its progress, will be found useful. <hi rend="italic">An ink which is too
                    thin,</hi> and formed of a varnish not sufficiently burned, will soil the stone,
                    notwithstanding that the proper precautions are taken of wetting the stone, and
                    preparing it properly with acid and gum. <hi rend="italic">Ink which is too
                    stiff</hi> will tear up the lighter tints of the chalk from the stone, and thus
                    destroy the drawing.</p>
                <p>The consideration of these circumstances leads us at once to the principles of
                    the printing. These accidents arise at the extreme points of the scale at which
                    the printing inks can be used; for it is evident, that the only inks which can
                    be employed are those which are between these points, that is, thicker than that
                    which soils the stone, and at the same time thinner than that which takes up the
                    drawing. Any increase of temperature will diminish the consistency of the
                    printing ink; the stone will therefore soil with an ink which could be safely
                    used at a lower temperature; hence a stiffer ink must be used. Now, if the
                    temperature should increase so much that the stone will soil with any ink at all
                    less thick than that which will take up the drawing, it is evident that the
                    printing must cease till, by standing, the lines of the drawing shall have
                    acquired additional strength. This, though it sometimes occurs, is a rare case;
                    but it shows that it is desirable to draw with a chalk or ink of less fatness in
                    summer than in winter; and also, that if the printing-room is in winter
                    artificially heated, pains should be taken to regulate the heat as equally as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>We will now enumerate some other difficulties which are not referrible to the
                    above general principle.</p>
                <p>If the pressure of the scraper is too weak, the ink will not be given off to the
                    paper in the impression, although the drawing has been properly charged with it.
                    Defects will also appear from the scraper being notched, or not correctly
                    adjusted, or from any unevenness in the leather or paper.</p>
                <p>Inequalities in the roller will cause the drawing to receive the ink unequally,
                    and if the roller or its leather is too hard, it will not ink the drawing
                    clearly.</p>
                <p>After printing a considerable number of impressions, it sometimes happens that
                    the drawing takes the ink in dark spots in different parts. This arises from the
                    printing ink becoming too strongly united with the chalk or ink of the drawing,
                    and if the printing is continued the drawing will be spoiled. A little
                    consideration will show us the reason of this accident. The printing ink readily
                    unites with the drawing, and being of a thinner consistency, it will by repeated
                    applications accumulate on the lines of the drawing, soften them, and make them
                    spread. In this case it is necessary to stop the printing, and let the stone
                    rest for a day or two, for the drawing to recover its proper degree of hardness.
                    If the drawing should run smutty from any of the causes before enumerated, the
                    following mixture will clean it.</p>
                <p>Take equal parts of water, spirits of turpentine, and oil of olives, and shake
                    them well together in a glass phial, until the mixture froths; wet the stone,
                    and throw this froth upon it, and rub it gently with a sponge. The printing ink
                    will be dissolved, and the whole drawing also will disappear, though, on a close
                    examination, it can be distinguished in faint white lines. On rolling in again
                    with printing ink, the drawing will gradually re-appear as clear as at
                    first.</p>
                <p>Accidents sometimes occur in the printing, from the t qualities of the paper. If
                    the paper has been made from rags which have been bleached with oxymuriatic
                    acid, the drawing will be incurably spoiled after thirty impressions.</p>
                <p>Chinese paper has sometimes a strong taste of alum; this is so fatal as sometimes
                    to spoil the drawing after the first impression.</p>
                <p>When the stone is to be laid by after printing, in order that it may be used
                    again at a future period, the drawing must be rolled in with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >preserving ink,</hi> called by Senefelder, <hi rend="italic">actzfarbe,</hi> as
                    the printing inks would, when dry, become so hard, that the drawing would not
                    take fresh printing ink freely. The following is the composition of the
                    preserving ink.</p>
                <p>Thick varnish of linseed oil 2 parts.</p>
                <p>Tallow 4 do.</p>
                <p>Venetian turpentine. 1 do.</p>
                <p>Wax 1 do.</p>
                <p>These must be melted together, and then four parts of lamp-black very carefully
                    and gradually mixed with it, and it must be preserved for use in a close tin
                    box.</p>
                <p>Very fine effects are produced in lithographic prints, by printing from two or
                    more stones with different coloured inks. This is managed by preparing a
                    composition of</p>
                <p>Wax 2 parts.</p>
                <p>Soap 1 do.</p>
                <p>A little vermilion.</p>
                <p>Melt them in a saucepan, and cast them into sticks. This must be rubbed up with a
                    little water to the thickness of cream, and then applied to the surface of a
                    polished stone. An impression is taken in the common way from a drawing, and
                    applied to a stone prepared in this manner, and passed through the press, care
                    being taken to mark, by means of this impression, two points in the margin
                    corresponding on each of the stones. The artist having thus on the second stone
                    an impression from the first drawing to guide him, scrapes away the parts which
                    he wishes to remain white in the finished impression. The stone must now be
                    etched with acid stronger than the common etching water, having one part of acid
                    to twenty of water. The whole is then washed off with turpentine.</p>
                <p>This plan has been very much followed at Munich, and in this country some
                    splendid specimens have lately been produced. It is generally used to print a
                    middle tint from the second stone. The black impression being given from the
                    first stone, a flat transparent brownish tint is given from the second, and the
                    white lights are where the paper is left untouched. The dots are necessary to
                    regulate the placing of the paper on the corresponding parts of the two
                    stones.</p>
                <p>The coloured inks for the tints are differently made, according to the tint
                    required, but the varnishes alone make very good light browns.</p>
                <p>The paper for lithographic printing should not be so damp as for copperplate
                    printing.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Different manners of Lithography.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the manners already described of drawing with ink and chalk, lithography
                    is practised in various other ways.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Transfers.</hi></p>
                <p>The most useful of these is the transfer before alluded to in speaking of the
                    inks, as it saves the labour and inconvenience of writing backwards. This is
                    performed by writing with the composition ink on a prepared paper, and then
                    transferring the writing to a stone, by passing it through the press.</p>
                <p>Dissolve in some water half an ounce of gum-tragacanth, to which, after it is
                    well mixed and strained, add one ounce of glue and half an ounce of gamboge.</p>
                <p>Then take of French chalk 4 ounces.</p>
                <p>old plaster of Paris.. ⅜ ditto, starch 1 ditto.</p>
                <p>Powder these, and sift them through a fine sieve; grind <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193206441" xml:id="kp-eb0713-6441-0386"/>them with a portion of the
                    gum-tragacanth, glue, and gamboge; then add sufficient water to give it the
                    consistency of oil, and apply it with a brush to thin sized paper. The writing
                    must be made with the ink on the prepared side.</p>
                <p>When the transfer is to be made, a polished stone is warmed to about 130°
                    Fahrenheit, and placed in the press. The paper is then carefully damped at the
                    back with a sponge, and placed between some sheets of soft paper. It is next
                    placed on the stone with the writing towards it, and passed through the press as
                    in printing an impression. This must be repeated four or five times without
                    raising the leather cover of the bed of the press, beginning with a slight
                    pressure at first, and increasing it every time. The press is now to be opened,
                    and the paper, being damped, taken off, when the writing will appear to have
                    come off the paper on the stone.</p>
                <p>When the stone is quite cold, it is etched and prepared for printing in the usual
                    manner.</p>
                <p>This mode is peculiarly valuable for maps, plans, writings, &amp;c. when
                    expedition and economy are objects of importance; and the impressions produced
                    by skilful lithographers retain all the purity and sharpness of the original
                    drawing or writing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Imitation of Wood Cuts.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a very easy mode, though not much practised. A polished stone is covered
                    all over with lithographic ink, and the parts which are to be left white are
                    scraped away with a steel point. Very fine lines are most easily obtained by
                    putting them in with a hair pencil. The stone is etched as before described.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Etchings on Stone.</hi></p>
                <p>A polished stone is prepared for this mode by washing it with diluted acid as
                    weak as the water used for etching a drawing; and after that is washed off, and
                    the stone is dry, it is to be covered with weak gum-water and a little
                    lamp-black. This forms a coating to the stone, and the artist works on it with
                    an etching needle, as in etching upon copper. The lines which he traces appear
                    white, but look stronger than they will appear afterwards. The stone should be a
                    little warmed, for the needle to work freely through the coating, and care must
                    be taken not to breathe upon it. When the etching is finished, the surface is to
                    be rubbed all over with linseed oil, which penetrates into the lines drawn by
                    the needle. After this the coating is to be all washed off with water.</p>
                <p>In this mode lines can be drawn as fine as on copperplate; it is, however, but
                    little practised in England, though it is often employed in Germany.</p>
                <p>The great distinction between lithography and engraving, when employed for works
                    of art, is, that the former gives a fac-similé of an original drawing, which
                    retains all the freedom and touch of the artist’s own hand; whilst, on the
                    contrary, an engraving must be a copy. This character in a lithographic print
                    arises from the facility with which the drawing is produced, as the process is
                    exactly that which the artist would follow in making a common drawing: and the
                    farther advantage of a great saving of expense is derived from the same cause;
                    for the drawing being made at once on the stone, the whole expense of the
                    engraving is saved. This is particularly the case with drawings in chalk, or
                    with outlines or slight works in ink; and thus the door is opened to the
                    production of many works which could not otherwise be published on account of
                    the expense of engraving.</p>
                <p>The more finished drawings in ink, however, have not the same advantages, for the
                    gradations in tint can be obtained only by the variations in the breadth and
                    distance of the lines, which is the same principle as that on which the engraver
                    works; and hence the labour is more nearly equal in the two methods.</p>
                <p>There is, however, much less difficulty in drawing lines on the stone than in
                    cutting them on copper, and of course the operation is less expensive; and the
                    cost of printing from stone is also considerably under that of printing from
                    plates, which renders the employment oſlithography doubly advantageous when a
                    large number of copies are required. The number of impressions that may be taken
                    from a chalk drawing varies according to the fineness of the tints and the
                    manner in which the drawing has been executed. Some drawings will be exhausted
                    by 1500 or 2000 copies, others have stood 20,000, and some even 30,000
                    impressions.</p>
                <p>Ink drawings and writings give considerably more; the finest, if properly
                    managed, will give from 6000 to 10,000; others it seems to be impossible to
                    exhaust, hundreds of thousands having been printed from some without any
                    material injury.</p>
                <p>The advances which lithography has made within these few years have been really
                    immense. Specimens in the chalk manner have been produced which vie in beauty
                    with the stippled engravings in the line manner. Efforts equally wonderful have
                    been made, and there seems no reason to doubt that further improvements will yet
                    be effected in this infant art. The external delicacy of tint of the finest
                    engravings there is reason to believe, as has already been shown, it never can
                    equal; and it is more than probable that the station which it has already
                    attained, is that which it is destined to fill; that is, betwixt the first class
                    of engravings and the middling productions of copper and steel, its greatest
                    advantages being economy and expedition in the execution. The innumerable
                    instances in which the public have already been presented with valuable works by
                    means of lithography, which could not have been produced by the more expensive
                    and tedious mode of engraving, are sufficient evidences of its vast importance,
                    and afford ground for the anticipation of still greater benefits.</p>
