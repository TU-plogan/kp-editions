                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    a commercial city of the duchy of Tuscany, in Italy. It stands on the sea-shore,
                    near the island of Melora, which, by its castle, defends the entrance of the
                    harbour. It is surrounded by strong walls on every side; but towards the land
                    these are thought to be untenable, from being commanded by neighbouring heights.
                    The outer harbour has not depth of ater for ships of more than 400 tons burden.
                    It is surrounded by a long mole, the efficiency of which is lessened by the
                    great quantity of sand brought in by the west and the north winds. The inner
                    harbour, called Darsena, is only used for repairing ships, and for the reception
                    of fishing boats and small craft. The river Arno connects Florence with the
                    harbour of Leghorn. It is a well-built city, with many massive houses, which, if
                    not elegant, are well calculated for a mercantile place. There is a ducal and an
                    episcopal palace, many churches and hospitals, and more than 6000 houses, with
                    72,924 inhabitants. One third of the population consists of Jews, who are
                    enclosed in a separate quarter, but otherwise enjoy greater privileges than in
                    almost any other part of Italy. The trade is very extensive, and much ingenuity
                    is applied to several branches of manufactures of a minute kind, such as works
                    in coral, ivory, and marble, in distilling liqueurs, in preparing snuff,
                    cream-of-tartar, soaps, starch, powder, leather, shot, and other articles. It
                    is, next to Marseilles, the most extensive sea-port in the Mediterranean, and it
                    is visited by ships from England, France, America, and the northern countries of
                    Europe, and has considerable shipping belonging to its merchants, who trade
                    chiefly with the towns in Northern Africa. The following table will show the
                    several nations whose commerce with this port is carried on by their own
                    vessels.</p>
