                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">LEICESTERSHIRE</label>, an English inland county. It is
                    bounded on the north by Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, on the west by the
                    latter county and Warwickshire, on the south by Northamptonshire, and on the
                    east by Rutlandshire and Lincolnshire. It is of a triangular form, and few of
                    its limits are marked by nature, as the rivers Soar and Trent form only a part
                    of its northern boundary, and the river Anker a smaller portion of its western
                    frontier. Its greatest length from north to south is forty-five miles, and its
                    greatest breadth from east to west thirty-five miles. Its area contains 816
                    square miles. It is divided into six hundreds, in which are ten towns and 196
                    parishes. The population at the four decennial enumerations has been estimated
                    as follows:—In 1801 it amounted to 130,081, in 1811 to 150,419, in 1821 to
                    174,571, and in 1831 to 197,000. The annual value of the real property, as
                    assessed in the year 1815, was L.902,217. The burials, including both the
                    registered and unregistered, in the period from 1821 to 1831, appear to have
                    been only one in fifty-two of the whole number of inhabitants then living. The
                    proportion of illegitimate to legitimate births was only one to twenty-eight,
                    whereas, in the whole of England, it was one to twenty. The occupations of the
                    inhabitants are thus shown by Mr Rickman.</p>

                <p>The chief towns of the county, and their population in 1831, were,</p>

                <p>Loughborough 10,800</p>

                <p>Ashby-de-la-Zouch 4,400</p>
                <p>Melton-Mowbray 3,356</p>
                <p>Donnington Castle 3,182</p>
                <p>Market-Harborough 2,272</p>

                <p>The county of Leicester may be described generally as a level district, the
                    undulations <hi rend="italic">of</hi> which are very gentle, and exhibit but few
                    interesting prospects. The exceptions to this remark are the Charnwood Hills, on
                    the northern part of the county, which rise in an insulated mass, and from the
                    summit <hi rend="italic">of</hi> which the rest of the county appears extended
                    in a well-wooded but even surface under the feet. The most lofty eminence of
                    this range of bills (commonly denominated the <hi rend="italic">Forest</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> though it is destitute of trees) is Bardon Hill,
                    the summit of which is 850 feet above the level of the sea. The Vale of Belvoir,
                    in which the castle of the Duke of Rutland stands, displays much beauty, of a
                    soft rather than a romantic or picturesque character.</p>
                <p>None of the rivers of this county are considerable streams, nor are any of them
                    calculated for the conveyance of commodities, except the Soar, for a short
                    distance; but they are abundant, and contribute to increase the beauty and
                    fertility of the district. Their names are, the Anker, Avon, Blackbrook, Deane,
                    Eye, Scalford, Sence, Snite, Soar, Swift, Trent, Willand, and Wreke. The
                    intercourse of the county, both in its own different districts, and with the
                    surrounding parts of the kingdom, is amply provided for by several navigable
                    canals. One of these connects the town of Leicester with the Grand Junction
                    Canal, in Northamptonshire; another communicates by Loughborough with the river
                    Trent; another from the coal-mines near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, passes by Hinckley,
                    and proceeds into Warwickshire; and one is designed to connect Melton-Mowbray
                    with the centre of Rutlandshire.</p>
                <p>Though the soil is various, yet, in general, it may be classed under the
                    denominations either of clay or of loam; for there are very feŵ portions of it
                    that are calcareous, sandy, or gravelly. The best soil is on the hills, and
                    generally the valleys consist of a cold clay, very wet in the winter, and with
                    the turf so tender as scarcely to bear the treading of sheep in that season. The
                    soil is naturally productive of the best and most abundant crops of grass, and
                    is better fitted for feeding cattle than for arable culture. In consequence of
                    this quality, a very small portion is under the plough; but that portion
                    produces most excellent wheat, oats, and beans, which have acquired great
                    celebrity. There are few open fields now remaining, and the quantity of waste
                    land is very small. The principal productions of the county are sheep and cows.
                    Mr Bakewell, whose fame in improving the breeds of all cattle is generally
                    known, has been the means of stocking this county first, and afterwards many
                    other parts of England, with a race of sheep produced by various crosses, which
                    by many farmers is now preferred to every other, and universally known by the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">new</hi><hi rend="italic">Leicesters.</hi> They
                    unite perfect symmetry of shape with the smallest possible quantity of bone and
                    offal, and their wool is both fine and abundant. The horned cattle were, in like
                    manner, improved by the lessons of this skilful breeder; and no part of England
                    exceeds Leicestershire either in its beef or in the produce of the dairy. The
                    cheese commonly made is in great request throughout all the north of England;
                    and the kind called Stilton, from having been first sold in that town, though
                    made near Melton-Mowbray, is perhaps the richest in the world. The process of
                    making it was long kept a secret in a few villages, but is now universally
                    known. Its richness arises from one half the milk being skimmed, and the cream
                    taken from that added to the other milk, so that the cheeses have double the
                    usual quantity of cream in their composition. Bakewell improved also the breed
                    of horses to a great extent. In this line there was less room for any
                    extraordinary progress; but his black horses, of the cart kind, originating
                    principally from mares which he brought from Flanders, enabled him to introduce
                    the method of ploughing with two horses abreast, by which much labour in
                    agriculture has been saved.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of most consequence in this county is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204135" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4135-0210"/>that of hosiery, which gives
                    employment, more or less constant, to two thirds of its inhabitants. The
                    quantity of stockings made here is prodigious, and supplies the greater part of
                    the British dominions, as well as many other parts of the world, with those of
                    an inferior and middling quality. Stocking-frames were invented about 1590; but
                    the first introduced in Leicestershire was used at Hinckley in 1640. Since that
                    period many improvements in the machinery of them have been made. The chief seat
                    of this manufacture is in the town of Leicester, in which there are 3400
                    manufacturers, of whom 3000 are stocking-makers. Loughborough has 900, Hinckley
                    700, Sheepshead 500, Wigston and Shilton 280 each; and in many of the smaller
                    places there are to be found to the number of from 100 to 200 weavers of hosiery
                    and gloves. About 700 men are employed in making lace, chiefly at Melton-Mowbray
                    and Quornden. The makers of machinery are numerous, and in the county some linen
                    is manufactured, and also some carpets. The making of stuffs at Harborough has
                    nearly disappeared.</p>
                <p>In the north-west part of the county there are extensive mines of valuable coal,
                    which supply the inhabitants of the surrounding districts. With them terminate
                    the mines in the direction of the German Ocean to the southward. At Bredon, on
                    the confines, the singular rock called Bredon Hill is composed of a most
                    valuable kind of limestone, which forms an excellent cement in water, and which
                    was used for building the pier of Ramsgate.</p>
                <p>The Roman roads are still visible in many parts of the county, though in many
                    instances they have been covered by the more recent highways. The Watling-Street
                    road, the Fossway, and the Via Davana, traversed the county, and have been
                    traced with great accuracy by antiquaries. At Radcliffe, on the Wreke, is an
                    ancient tumulus, generally attributed to the Celts, 350 feet in length, and 120
                    in breadth. At Leicester, which was a Roman station, are still visible the
                    remains of the architecture of that people, in what is called the Jewny Wall,
                    consisting of a mass of stones, brick-work, and dilapidated arches, built in
                    alternate courses of brick in three layers, and of stone. Near the town is the
                    vestige of a British Cursus, according to some antiquaries, or of a Roman camp,
                    according to others. At different and distant periods a great number of coins
                    have been discovered, with the names of Titus, Trajan, Diocletian, Constantine,
                    Constantius, Hadrian, and other Roman emperors. Other Roman antiquities have
                    been found at Rothley, at Wanlip, at Market-Harborough, at Burrow, and at
                    Cathorpe. The Gothic remains are considerable; those of the Abbey of Leicester,
                    of the Nunnery of Grace Dieu, Ulvestoft Priory, Laund Priory, the Castle of
                    Ashby-de-la-Zouch, the churches of Hinckley and Melton-Mowbray, and the chapel
                    of Market-Harborough, all reward the inspection of the antiquary.</p>
                <p>In the church of Lutherworth, the pulpit and part of the vestments of the gneat
                    reformer Wickliffe are still preserved. He was buried there in the year 1387;
                    but in 1428, his bones were taken up and burnt, and the ashes thrown into the
                    river, by order of the council of Sienna. Leicestershire has been the scene of
                    two great military events, which have been the means of transferring the
                    government of England; the first, the battle of Bosworth, which terminated the
                    reign and life of Richard III. in 1485; and the other, the battle of Naseby in
                    1645, which led to the death of Charles I., and the subsequent elevation of
                    Oliver Cromwell.</p>
                <p>One of the chief distinctions of this county is its adaptation for fox-hunting,
                    which has given rise to establishments for that purpose at the town of
                    Melton-Mowbray, where, at the appropriate season, are collected the best horses,
                    dogs, and riders that England produces, and where, also, may be seen some of the
                    most wealthy and distinguished of the nobility and gentry.</p>
                <p>By the reform bill this county received an addition of two members to the House
                    of Commons; for which purpose it is divided into two parts, the northern and
                    southern divisions. The polling-places for the former are Loughborough,
                    Melton-Mowbray, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch; and for the latter, Leicester,
                    Market-Harborough, and Hinckley. The town of Leicester, as before, returns two
                    members.</p>
