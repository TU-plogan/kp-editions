                    two forms being probably derived from <hi rend="italic">ακος,</hi><hi rend="italic">medela,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">δημος, populus,</hi> and the

                    garden, villa, or grove, situated in the Ceramicus, one of the suburbs of
                    Athens, about six stadia, or nearly a Roman mile to the north-west of the city.
                    The common tradition is, that it took its name from one <hi rend="italic">Academus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ecademus,</hi> the original owner, who was
                    contemporary with Theseus, and made it a kind of gymnasium; and that after his
                    death it retained his name, and was consecrated to his memory. When Castor and
                    Pollux came to Athens to reclaim by force of arms the person of their sister
                    Helena, who, according to the legend, had been carried off by Theseus, and
                    concealed in some obscure retreat by the ravisher, the Athenians declared that
                    they knew not where the lady was to be found; but as this answer was not deemed
                    satisfactory by the warlike brothers, <hi rend="italic">Academus,</hi> cognisant
                    with the secret, and anxious to avert a contest about so frivolous a subject of
                    dispute, apprized them that she was concealed in the town of Aphidna; which was
                    immediately attacked, taken by assualt, and razed to the ground. Grateful for
                    this traditionary service, the Lacedemonians, who worshipped the Dioscuri
                    (Castor and Pollux), spared the house and gardens known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Academy,</hi> when they ravaged the suburbs of Athens; and, in
                    consideration of the disclosure just mentioned, they honoured the memory of the
                    original owner, from whom the place took its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030667" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0667-0066"/>name.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From certain expressions of

                    would appear that this person was accounted not merely a hero, but a sort of
                    divinity. Hence the Academy was consecrated to Bacchus Academus, or to the
                    beneficent sun of the ascending signs; as the Lyceum with its <hi rend="italic">temenos</hi> or <hi rend="italic">∕ιιeus</hi> was dedicated to Apollo Lycaeus
                    (so called from <hi rend="italic">λυχ&lt;&gt;ι,</hi> a wolf), or to the
                    destroying sun of the descending signs of the zodiac: and hence also these
                    schools were the astronomical symbols or representatives of the celestial houses
                    of the two solstices; the Academy, of the higher, and the Lyceum, of the lower
                    solstice.</p></note> Such is the legend which the Greek writers have transmitted
                    to us. With regard to the spot itself, which afterwards became so famous, in
                    connection with the name of Plato and his philosophical disciples, it appears to
                    have remained almost in a state of nature, covered with stagnant water, and
                    exceedingly insalubrious, until the time of Cimon, when it was drained, planted
                    with alleys of trees, and embellished with groves and with fountains: after
                    which it became the promenade of the most distinguished Athenians, and
                    particularly of the Platonic philosophers, thence called the <hi rend="italic">Academics</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> just as the <hi rend="italic">Lyceum,</hi> another gymnasium, situated to the south-east of Athens, became
                    the promenade. of the Aristotelian sect of philosophers, called also
                    Peripatetics (« <hi rend="italic">πεζιτrατεω,</hi><hi rend="italic">obambulo),</hi> from the locomotive fashion in which they communicated or
                    discoursed concerning their peculiar doctrines. The Academy formed part of the
                    Ceramicus (a word derived from <hi rend="italic">×εζαμος,</hi> signifying <hi rend="italic">potters earth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">earthen vase,</hi> from
                    its being filled with cinerary urns), and was therefore devoted to purposes of
                    sepulture; it being then the practice to inter in a public garden or grove, as
                    in a sort of clysian field, those who had signalized themselves by rendering
                    important services to their country. Cicero, desirous to revive or preserve the
                    name of the Academy, bestowed it on his villa or country-seat near Puzzuoli,
                    where he loved to converse with his friends on philosophical subjects, and
                    where, also, he composed his <hi rend="italic">Academical Questions,</hi> his
                    treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Nature of the Gods,</hi> and his celebrated
                    work on the <hi rend="italic">Commomvealth,</hi> a considerable portion of which
                    was, several years ago, recovered from rescribed or palimpsest manuscripts, by
                    Signor Angelo Maio, librarian of the Vatican.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Academy,</hi> in its generalized acceptation, is employed to
                    signify a society of learned men, established for the improvement of science,
                    literature, or the arts. This term, as we have seen, is one of very high
                    antiquity. It was amidst the umbrageous recesses of the gardens of Academus, so
                    favourable to philosophical meditation, that the divine Plato, surnamed the swan
                    of the Academy, established his school, collected his disciples, and taught his
                    sublime morality; wherefore the sect of this illustrious philosopher was called
                    the Academic, and the philosophers who adopted his doctrines Academics. For a
                    long period, accordingly, this title marked out the disciples of Plato alone;
                    but it came afterwards to be applied to all those who belonged to the different
                    learned or literary societies instituted, under the name of Academies, in
                    imitation of the school of Athens, and in order to extend the boundaries of
                    human knowledge. Of these institutions several were established in Athens
                    itself, but none ever equalled the renown of that founded by Plato; and, in
                    point of fact, they were merely schools where Arcesilaus, Carneades, Philo,
                    Antiochus, and other philosophers of less note, explained the different systems
                    with which each in his turn sought to supersede those of his predecessors, but
                    which have since fallen into the most profound neglect and oblivion. </p><p>Ptolemy Soter, having by his victories secured undisturbed possession of the
                    throne of Egypt, and wishing to unite to the title of conqueror the more
                    glorious appellation of patron of learning, founded, under the name of Musaeon,
                    the celebrated Academy of Alexandria, and provided it with a collection of
                    books, which formed the nucleus of the Alexandrian library. Here he assembled
                    the most distinguished philosophers and scholars of his time, charging them with
                    the investigation of philosophical truth and the improvement of art; and it was
                    to the care and researches of these eminent men and their successors that the
                    famous library, commenced by Ptolemy, and afterwards so barbarously given up to
                    the flames by the Caliph Omar, was enlarged and improved, until it became the
                    pride of Egypt and the glory of the world. This academy, distinguished alike for
                    its useful labours and its improvements in science, has served as a model to
                    modern academies, both as regards the principles on which it was founded, and
                    the object and end of its institution. It admitted into the number of its
                    associates the poets and philosophers of all countries: persons came from every
                    part of the earth to seek instruction, or to deposit new information in its
                    bosom: and all parties were enriched by the continual interchange of ideas and
                    discoveries. For a long period it was the great centre of knowledge. All· the
                    literary treasures, scattered throughout the different countries which the tide
                    of barbarism had overflowed, were there collected together: towards the period
                    when Greece began to decline, the spirit and the genius which once presided in
                    her schools of philosophy were in some degree revived in that of Alexandria; and
                    it shone forth like a resplendent beacon-light in the midst of the surrounding
                    darkness, shooting forth rays which have traversed the long course of ages, and
                    guided the academies of modern times in their researches and investigations.</p><p>Rome had no academies. In the eyes of the conquerors and masters of the world,
                    the sciences appeared only a secondary object, and of comparatively little
                    importance. This Virgil has admitted in his Aeneid, where he says, that in art
                    and in science the Romans must yield the palm to other nations, and content
                    themselves with the glory of conquest, and a knowledge of the means by which it
                    might be secured and maintained.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><lg part="N"><l part="N"> Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera, </l><l part="N"> Credo equidem; vivos ducent de marmore voltus; </l><l part="N"> Orabunt caussas melius, ccelique meatus </l><l part="N"> Describent radio, et surgentia sidera dicent: </l><l part="N"> Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento; </l><l part="N"> Hae tibi erunt artes; pacisque imponere morem, </l><l part="N"> Parcere subjectis, et debellare superbos. </l></lg><bibl default="false" status="draft"><title><hi rend="italic">Aeneid.</hi></title> lib. vi. 1. 848.
                    </bibl></note> The Latin poets and writers, indeed, were formed by the study of
                    Greek models. But no national establishment fostered their genius and favoured
                    their progress, either under the republic, which despised letters, or under the
                    imperial tyrants, who dreaded them. Augustus himself only patronised and
                    rewarded the poets who flattered him; while Maecenas, in surrounding himself
                    with assemblages of celebrated writers, thought less of extending the boundaries
                    of learning, than of tasting the pleasures of learned society, and wearing off
                    the fatigues of business amidst the sweets of an intercourse<pb break="no" facs="nls:193030680" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0680-0067"/> entirely
                    Epicurean, or of enjoyments such as literature alone can afford to men of
                    refined and cultivated minds.</p><p>When the darkness which had settled down upon Europe after the fall of the
                    Western Empire began at length to disperse, and when a faint glimmering of
                    light, symptomatic of slowly approaching day, began to flicker and tremble on
                    the dusky brow of the long night of ignorance and barbarism, a passion for
                    instruction became in some measure the mode, and gave birth simultaneously to a
                    multitude of learned associations; and these proceeded at once to the study and
                    improvement of the sciences and arts, long neglected, and almost lost in those
                    very countries where they had formerly been cultivated with the greatest
                    success. The Gauls, however, although partially civilized by the Romans and by
                    Julian the philosopher (vulgarly called the Apostate), had relapsed, under the
                    indolent and imbecile monarchs of the first race, into the most profound
                    ignorance; while the monks, who passed for learned men when they could read,
                    were from policy opposed to the instruction of the people. The spirit of
                    monopoly and exclusion was then, as afterwards, a prominent characteristic of
                    the ecclesiastical system; and the danger of educating the people was as
                    vehemently exaggerated as by certain alarmists of our own day. “The clergy,”
                    said Charlemagne, “wish to monopolize all learning, and to continue the sole
                    expounders of the sciences and the laws.” Nevertheless this prince, who would
                    have done honour to an age far less barbarous, attempted to resuscitate letters,
                    with which he had some acquaintance; and with this view he, encouraged by the
                    celebrated Alcuin, founded in his palace an academy for promoting the study of
                    grammar, orthography, rhetoric, poetry, history, and the mathematics. This
                    academy was composed of the principal wits of the court, Charlemagne himself
                    being a member. In their academical conferences, every member was to give an
                    account of the ancient authors which he had read; and in order to efface all
                    distinctions of rank among the academicians, he required each of them to choose
                    a name purely literary (as, for example, that of some ancient author or
                    celebrated person of antiquity), which should in no degree serve to recall the
                    birth, station, or dignity of the person assuming it. Accordingly, Egilbert, a
                    young lord, and one of the grandees about the court, modestly took the name of
                    Homer; the archbishop of Mayence called himself Damoetas; Alcuin became Flaccus
                    Albinus; Eginhard, Calliopus; Adelard, abbot of Corbie, Augustin; Theodulph,
                    Pindar; and Charlemagne himself, somewhat forgetful of his own rule, David.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some modern writers have
                    supposed that this assumption of ancient or classical names originated in an
                    ardent admiration of antiquity, blended with the genius of an age essentially
                    pedantic; and thus they have endeavoured to account for Alcuin taking the
                    surname of Horace as a praenomen, and calling himself Flaccus Albinus. But from
                    what is stated in the text, this appears to be a mistake. With regard to the
                    circumstance of Charlemagne taking the name of David, which, as a royal one,
                    appears to have been a contravention of his own rule, it is evident that his
                    choice was determined by his passion for the composition of canticles or psalms,
                    in which he believed himself to be eminently skilful, and also by his decided
                    preference of sacred to profane literature. The emperor, in fact, had great
                    pretensions as a theologian; and on one occasion, when reproaching Reibode,
                    archbishop of Treves, with his admiration of Virgil’s poetry, he remarked of
                    himself, that he would much rather possess the spirit of the four evangelists
                    than that of the twelve books of the Aeneid.</p></note> Fantastical as all this
                    may appear to us, it was nevertheless productive of good. The nobles, who had
                    been accustomed to value themselves solely on their birth and ancestry, began to
                    acquire a relish for more substantial distinctions, and to feel the force of
                    Charlemagne’s remark, that the state was likely to be better served by men who
                    had improved their minds and cultivated their talents, than by those who had no
                    other recommendation than overweening pride and a long pedigree. Hence the
                    academy of Charlemagne soon obtained great celebrity; and although few monuments
                    of its labours remain, yet it unquestionably gave an impulse to learning,
                    diffused a taste for knowledge, and probably laid the first foundations of the
                    French language, which was then a rude idiom, composed of a barbarous mixture of
                    the language of the Goths, of Latin, and of the dialect of Celtic spoken by the
                    ancient Gauls. This idiom the academy subjected to principles, forming it into a
                    regular language, which afterwards became the provençal, or language of romance:
                    and when it had thus, as it were, been licked into shape, Charlemagne proposed
                    to have the hymns, the prayers, and the laws translated into it, for the benefit
                    of the people; a proposal which reflects the greatest honour on his memory. But
                    the clergy resolutely set their faces against an innovation which would have
                    deprived them of part of their influence as the sole expounders both of the
                    civil and the divine laws, and thus in a great measure frustrated the principal
                    object which Charlemagne had in view in founding his academy. Still its labours,
                    though in some respects neutralized by the personal interest of the monks, were
                    not altogether useless, but, on the contrary, were instrumental in diffusing the
                    first gleams of light throughout France, and in preparing it to emerge from a
                    state of barbarism.</p><p>In the following century, Alfred, a man worthy of being classed with the first
                    French legislator, founded an <hi rend="italic">academy</hi> at Oxford, which
                    formed the basis of the University afterwards established there; but this being
                    a school for instruction rather than an institution for exciting emulation among
                    the instructed, it does not, for that reason, fall within the scope of the
                    present article. About the same period the Moors of Spain, celebrated for their
                    gallantry, their chivalrous manners, and their taste for poetry, music, and
                    letters, had also their academies at Granada and Cordoba; but of the precise
                    nature and object of these institutions little or nothing is known. In the year
                    1325, the <hi rend="italic">Academy of the Floral Games</hi> was established at
                    Toulouse. This academy is still in existence, and is of course the most ancient
                    establishment of the kind in Europe. The members assumed the somewhat
                    fantastical name of <hi rend="italic">Maintainers of the Gay Science</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the prizes which it awarded, consisting of flowers of
                    gold and silver, excited a strong spirit of emulation among the Troubadours of
                    Languedoc and Provence. This society, to which Clemens Isaurus bequeathed the
                    whole of his property, still enjoys a considerable reputation; and many of the
                    young poets of France, who aspire to be one day crowned with the genuine laurels
                    of Parnassus, repair to it, at the commencement of their career, to dispute for
                    the <hi rend="italic">violet,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">marigold,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">amaranth,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">eglantine.</hi></p><p>A whole host of academies sprung up in different countries immediately after the
                    revival of letters in the fifteenth century; but it was in Italy that they were
                    most numerous, every city in fact having its own; and they were frequently
                    distinguished by appellations remarkable either for their oddity or
                    extravagance. Thus, Rome had its <hi rend="italic">Lincei;</hi> Naples, its <hi rend="italic">Ardenti;</hi> Parma, its <hi rend="italic">Insensati;</hi> and
                    Genoa, its <hi rend="italic">Addormentati</hi><hi rend="italic">;—</hi> names
                    which some modern academicians might adopt without the slightest impropriety.
                    Many flourishing academies existed in France <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030693" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0693-0068"/>before the
                    Revolution, most of them having been established and endowed by the munificence
                    of Louis XIV. In Britain we have but few, and those of the greatest note fall to
                    be classed under a different appellation, namely, <hi rend="smallcaps">Society,</hi> to which the reader is referred.</p><p> In giving an account of the principal academies, which is all that this article
                    professes to do, we shall, for the sake of clearness, arrange them under
                    different heads, according to the subjects for the cultivation and improvement
                    of which they were instituted. And we shall commence with</p><p>I. <hi rend="italic smallcaps">Medical Academies.</hi> Of this description are,
                    the Academy of the <hi rend="italic">Naturae</hi><hi rend="italic">Curiosi</hi>
                    of Germany; that founded at Palermo in 1645; that established at Venice in 1701,
                    which used to meet weekly in a hall near the grand hospital; and an institution
                    which took its rise at Geneva in 1715. The Royal Colleges of Physicians at
                    London and Edinburgh have also been ranked by some in the number of academies,
                    but, in our opinion, erroneously; for they are rather of the nature of
                    corporations, organized with a view to guard the privileges and promote the
                    interests of a particular profession, than academies instituted for facilitating
                    the advancement of medical science. This is the exclusive object of the Royal
                    Medical Society, and other institutions of the same sort; which, however, fall
                    to be treated of under a different head, viz. that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Society.</hi></p><p>The Academy of <hi rend="italic">Naturae</hi><hi rend="italic">Curiosi,</hi>
                    called also the <hi rend="italic">Leopoldine Academy,</hi> was founded in 1662,
                    by J. L. Bauschius, a physician, who, imitating the example of the English,
                    published a general invitation to medical men to communicate all extraordinary
                    cases that occurred in the course of their practice: and, the scheme meeting
                    with success, the institution was regularly organized, and Bauschius elected
                    president. The works of the <hi rend="italic">Naturae</hi><hi rend="italic">Curiosi</hi> were at first published separately; but this being attended with
                    considerable inconvenience, a new arrangement was formed, in 1770, for
                    publishing a volume of observations annually. From some cause, however, the
                    first volume did not make its appearance until 1784, when it came forth under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the
                    work was afterwards continued, at irregular intervals, and with some variations
                    in the title. In 1687, the Emperor Leopold took the society under his
                    protection, and granted its members several privileges, the most remarkable of
                    which was, that its presidents should be entitled to enjoy the style and rank of
                    counts palatine of the holy Roman empire; and hence the title of <hi rend="italic">Leopoldine</hi> which it in consequence assumed. But though it
                    thus acquired a name, it had no local habitation or fixed place of meeting, and
                    no regular assemblies; instead of which there was a kind of bureau or office,
                    first established at Breslau, and afterwards removed to Nuremberg, where
                    letters, observations, and communications from correspondents, were received,
                    and persons properly qualified admitted as members. By its constitution, the
                    Leopoldine Academy consists of a president, two adjuncts or secretaries, and
                    colleagues or members, without any limitation as to numbers. At their admission,
                    the last come under a twofold obligation; first, to choose some subject for
                    discussion out of the animal, vegetable, or mineral kingdom, provided it has not
                    been previously treated of by any colleague of the academy; and, secondly, to
                    apply themselves to furnish materials for the annual <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides.</hi> Each member also bears about with him the symbol of the
                    academy, consisting of a gold ring, whereon is represented a book open, with an
                    eye on one side, and on the other the academical motto of <hi rend="italic">Nunquam otiosus.</hi></p><p>II. <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Chirurgical Academies.</hi> An association of
                    this sort was, not many years ago, instituted, by public authority, at Paris;
                    the members of which were not only to publish their own observations and
                    improvements, and' those of their correspondents, but also to give an account of
                    the various publications on surgery, and to compose a complete history of the
                    art from the works of all the authors, ancient and modern, who have treated of
                    it. Besides, a question in surgery was to be annually proposed, as the subject
                    of a prize essay, and a gold medal of the value of 200 livres given to the
                    successful competitor.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Surgery</hi> at Vienna was instituted by the
                    present emperor, under the direction of the celebrated Brambella. In it there
                    were at first only two professors; and to their charge the instruction of a
                    hundred and thirty young men was committed, thirty of whom had formerly been
                    surgeons in the army. But latterly the number both of teachers and pupils was
                    considerably increased. Gabrielli was appointed to teach pathology and practice;
                    Boecking, anatomy, physiology, and physics; Streit, medical and pharmaceutical
                    surgery; Hunczowsky, surgical operations, midwifery, and the chirurgia forensis;
                    and Plenk, chemistry and botany. To these was also added Beindel, as prosector
                    and extraordinary professor of surgery and anatomy. Besides this, the emperor
                    provided a large and splendid edifice in Vienna, which affords accommodation
                    both for the teachers, the students, pregnant women, patients for clinical
                    lectures, and servants. For the use of this academy the emperor also purchased a
                    medical library, which is open every day; a complete set of chirurgical
                    instruments; an apparatus for experiments in natural philosophy; a collection of
                    natural history; a number of anatomical and pathological preparations; a
                    collection of preparations in wax, brought from Florence; and a variety of other
                    useful articles. Adjoining to the building, also, there is a good botanical
                    garden. With a view to encourage emulation among the students of this
                    institution, three prize medals, each of the value of 40 florins, are annually
                    bestowed on those who return the best answers to questions proposed the year
                    before. These prizes, however, are not entirely founded by the emperor, but are
                    in part owing to the liberality of Brendellius, formerly protochirurgus at
                    Vienna.</p><p>III. <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Ecclesiastical Academies.</hi> Under this head
                    may be mentioned the academy at Bologna in Italy, instituted in 1687, for the
                    purpose of investigating the doctrine, discipline, and history, of each age of
                    the church.</p><p>IV. <hi rend="italic smallcaps">Cosmographical Academies</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as that at Venice, called the <hi rend="italic">Argonauts.</hi> This was
                    instituted at the solicitation of F. Coronelli, for the improvement of
                    geographical knowledge. Its design was to publish exact maps, particular as well
                    as general, both of the celestial and terrestrial sphere, together with
                    geographical, historical, and astronomical descriptions. Each member, in order
                    to defray the expense of such a publication, was to subscribe a proportional
                    sum, for which he was to receive one or more copies of each piece published. To
                    this end three societies were established; one under F. Moro, provincial of the
                    Minorites in Hungary; another under the Abbot Laurence au Ruy Payenne au Marais;
                    and the third under F. Baldigiani, Jesuit, professor of mathematics in the Roman
                    College. The device of this academy is the terraqueous globe, with the motto <hi rend="italic">Plus ultra</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and at its expense all
                    the globes, maps, and geographical writings of F. Coronelli have been
                    published.</p><p>In the year 1799, a <hi rend="italic">Geographical Academy</hi> was established
                    at Lisbon, principally for the purpose of elucidating the geography of Portugal.
                    By the labours of the members of this academy, an accurate map of the country,
                    which was much wanted, has been completed.</p><p>V. <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Academies of Science.</hi> These comprehend such
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030706" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0706-0069"/>as have been erected for improving natural and mathematical knowledge, and are
                    otherwise called <hi rend="italic">Philosophical</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Physical Academies.</hi></p><p>The first of these was instituted at Naples, about the year 1560, in the house of
                    Baptista Porta. It was called the Academy <hi rend="italic">Secretorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae;</hi> and was succeeded by the Academy of <hi rend="italic">Lincei,</hi> founded at Rome by Prince Frederic Ceði, towards the
                    end of the same century. This academy was afterwards rendered famous in
                    consequence of the discoveries made by some of its members, among whom, the
                    first place is due to the celebrated Galileo, one of the most illustrious names
                    of which the history of science can boast. Several other academies, instituted
                    about this time, also contributed to the advancement of the sciences; but none
                    of them was in any respect comparable to that of the <hi rend="italic">Lincei.</hi></p><p>Some years after the death of Torricelli, the <hi rend="italic">Accademia del
                    Cimento</hi> made its appearance, under the protection of Prince Leopold,
                    afterwards Cardinal de’ Medici. Redi was one of its chief members. In so far as
                    regards the studies pursued by the other academicians, a very correct idea of
                    them may be formed from the curious experiments published in 1667, by their
                    secretary Count Laurence Magu-lotti, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Saggi
                    di</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturali</hi><hi rend="italic">Esperienze</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a copy of which was presented to the Royal Society,
                    translated into English by Mr Waller, and published at London in 4to.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Accademia degh'</hi><hi rend="italic">Inquieti,</hi>
                    afterwards incorporated into that of <hi rend="italic">Della Tracia,</hi> in the
                    same city, followed the example of that of Del Cimento. Some excellent
                    discourses on physical and mathematical subjects, by Gemi-niano Montenari, one
                    of the chief members, were published in 1667, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Pensieri FisicoMatematici</hi></p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Rossano,</hi> in the kingdom of Naples, was
                    originally an academy of belles lettres, founded in 1540, and transformed into
                    an academy of sciences in 1695, at the solicitation of the learned abbot Don
                    Giacinto Gimma; who being made president, under the title of Promoter General of
                    the institution, gave it a new set of regulations. He divided the academicians
                    into the following classes: grammarians, rhetoricians, poets, historians,
                    philosophers, physicians, mathematicians, lawyers, and divines; with a class
                    apart for cardinals and persons af quality. To be admitted a member, it was
                    requisite to have taken a degree in one or other of the faculties. The members
                    were not allowed to take the title of <hi rend="italic">Academicians</hi> in the
                    title-pages of their works, without a written permission from their president,
                    which was not granted till their works had been examined by the censors of the
                    academy; and this permission was the greatest honour the academy could confer,
                    as they thereby adopted the works thus examined, and became answerable for them
                    against all criticisms that might be made upon them. To this law the president
                    or promoter himself was subject; and no academician was allowed to publish
                    anything against the writings of another without leave obtained from the
                    society.</p><p>But Italy boasts of a number of scientific academies besides those above
                    mentioned. The Royal Neapolitan Academy was established in 1779; and the
                    published memoirs contain some valuable researches on mathematical subjects. The
                    Royal Academy of Turin was established by the late king when duke of Savoy. Its
                    memoirs were originally published in Latin, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea Philosophica Mathematica Societatis Privatae Taurinensis;</hi> and
                    the first volume appeared in 1759. Among ' the original members of this
                    institution the most celebrated was Lagrange, who burst on the scientific world
                    quite unexpectedly, by the novelty and depth of his papers in the first volume
                    of the transactions. An Academy of Sciences, Belles Lettres, and Arts, was
                    established at Padua by the senate, near the close of the eighteenth' century.
                    It is composed of twenty-four pensionaries, twelve free associates, twenty-four
                    pupils, twelve associates belonging to the <hi rend="italic">ci-devant</hi>
                    Venetian States, and twenty-four foreigners, besides honorary members. It has
                    published several volumes of memoirs in the Italian language. The Academy of
                    Sciences and Belles Lettres of Genoa was established in 1783. It consists of
                    thirty-two members; but their labours have been chiefly directed to poetry, nor
                    are we aware that they have published any memoirs. The Academy of Milan was
                    preceded, and perhaps introduced, by a literary assembly, consisting of ten
                    persons, who published a sheet weekly, containing short remarks on subjects of
                    science, belles lettres, and criticism. This society terminated in 1767. But
                    soon afterwards another was established, the transactions of which, published
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Seelta d' Opuscoli Scientifici,</hi>
                    contain several very interesting papers. The Academy of Sciences at Siena,
                    instituted in 1691, published the first volume of its transactions in 1761, and
                    has since continued them, at long intervals, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Atti dellAccademia di Siena.</hi> Between the years 1770 and 1780,
                    Μ. Lorgna established at Verona an academy of sciences of a novel description.
                    The object of it was to form an association among the principal scientific men
                    in all parts of Italy, for the purpose of publishing their memoirs. The first
                    volume appeared in the year 1782, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Memorie
                    di Matematica e Fisica della Societa Italiana.</hi> The most celebrated names
                    that appear in this volume are those of Boscovich, the two Fontanas, and
                    Spallanzani. There are also scientific academies at Mantua, Pisa, Pavia, and
                    Modena; but several of these do not publish their transactions.</p><p>Towards the beginning of the seventeenth century, F. Mersenne is said to have
                    given the first idea of a philosophical academy in France, by the conferences of
                    naturalists and mathematicians occasionally held at his lodgings. At these
                    Gassendi, Descartes, Hobbes, Roberval, Pascal, Blondel, and other celebrated
                    persons, assisted. F. Mer-senne proposed to each certain problems to be
                    examined, or certain experiments to be made, and acted, to use a Gallic idiom,
                    as the centre of re-union. By and by these private assemblies were succeeded by
                    more public ones, formed by Μ. Montmort, and by Thevenot the celebrated
                    traveller. Nor was this spirit confined to France. Animated by the example which
                    had been set in that country, several Englishmen of learning and distinction
                    instituted a kind of philosophical academy at Oxford towards the close of
                    Cromwell’s government; and this, after the Restoration, was erected into a Royal
                    Society. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Society.)</hi> And the English example, in
                    its turn, re-acted upon France; for, in 1666, Louis XIV., assisted by the
                    counsels of Colbert, founded at Paris</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy of Sciences.</hi> Being desirous of
                    establishing the sciences, arts, and literature upon a solid foundation, Louis,
                    immediately after the peace of the Pyrenees, directed Μ. Colbert to form a
                    society of men of known abilities and experience in the different branches of
                    knowledge, who should meet together under the king’s protection, in order to
                    communicate freely their respective discoveries; and with the view of carrying
                    his design the more effectually into execution, he appropriated a sufficient
                    revenue, not only to defray the charge of experiments, but likewise to afford
                    moderate salaries to the members. The commands of the Grand Monarque were
                    executed with equal zeal and ability by his minister. For having conferred with
                    those who were at that time most celebrated for their learning, Μ. Colbert
                    resolved to form a society <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030719" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0719-0070"/>of such persons as were conversant in natural
                    philosophy and mathematics; to join to them persons skilled in history and other
                    branches of erudition; and, lastly, to draw together those who were engaged in
                    the cultivation of what was then called the belles lettres, as well as of
                    grammar, eloquence, and poetry. The geometricians and natural philosophers were
                    ordered to meet on Tuesdays and Saturdays, in a great hall of the king’s
                    library, where the books of mathematics and natural philosophy were contained;
                    the learned in history to assemble, on Mondays and Thursdays, in the hall where
                    the books of history were arranged; and the class of belles lettres to meet on
                    Wednesdays and Fridays; while all the different classes were directed to
                    assemble together upon the first Thursday of every month, and by their
                    respective secretaries to make a report of the proceedings of the previous
                    month. In a short time, however, the classes of history and belles lettres were
                    united to the <hi rend="italic">French Academy,</hi> which was originally
                    instituted for the improvement of the French language; in consequence of which
                    the Royal Academy contained only two classes, viz. that of natural philosophy
                    and that of mathematics.</p><p>In the year 1696, the king, by an ordonnance datecf the 26th of January, gave
                    this academy a new form, and put it upon a footing still more respectable. By
                    this decree it was provided, that henceforth it should consist of four
                    descriptions of members, viz. honorary, pensionary, associates, and élèves;
                    which last were a kind of pupils or scholars, one of whom was attached to each
                    of the pensionaries. The first class was to contain ten persons, and each of the
                    rest twenty. The honorary academicians were to be all inhabitants of France, the
                    pensionaries were all to reside in Paris, and the élèves were also to live in
                    the capital; but eight of the associates might be chosen from among foreigners.
                    The officers were, a president, named by the king out of the class of honorary
                    academicians, and a secretary and treasurer, who held their offices for life. Of
                    the pensionaries, three were to be geometricians, three astronomers, three
                    mechanicians, three anatomists, three botanists, and the remaining two perpetual
                    secretary and treasurer. Of the twelve associates, two were to apply themselves
                    to geometry, two to botany, and two to chemistry; while the élèves were to
                    devote themselves to the particular branches of science cultivated by the
                    pensionaries to whom they were respectively attached, and not to speak except
                    when called to do so by the president. Clerical persons, whether regular or
                    otherwise, were declared inadmissible, except into the class of honorary
                    academicians; nor could any one be admitted an associate or pensionary unless
                    known by some considerable printed work, some machine, or other discovery. The
                    assemblies were held on Wednesdays and Saturdays, except when either chanced to
                    be a holyday; in which case the meeting was held on the day immediately
                    preceding. To encourage members to pursue their inquiries and researches, the
                    king engaged to pay not only the ordinary pensions, but even to confer
                    extraordinary gratifications according to the degree of merit displayed in their
                    respective performances; and, furthermore, his Majesty became bound, as we have
                    already stated, to defray the whole expense of experiments and other
                    investigations which it might be judged necessary from time to time to
                    institute. Hence, if any member gave in a bill of charges for experiments he had
                    made, or desired the printing of any book, and tendered an account of the
                    disbursements required to effect that object, the money was immediately paid by
                    the king, upon the president’s allowing and signing the bill. In like manner, if
                    an anatomist required, we shall say, live tortoises in order to make experiments
                    on the action and functions of the heart, he had only to signify his intention
                    through the president, and as many as he pleased were' brought him at the king’s
                    charge. The motto of the academy was <hi rend="italic">Invenit et
                    perfecit.</hi></p><p>In the year 1716, the Duke of Orleans, then regent, made an alteration in the
                    constitution of this body, augmenting the number of honorary members and of
                    associates eligible from among foreigners, admitting regular clergy among such
                    associates, and suppressing the class of élèves, the existence of which had been
                    attended with some inconveniences, particularly that of producing too great an
                    inequality among the academicians, and of giving rise to misunderstandings and
                    animosities among the members. At the same time he created two other classes;
                    the one consisting of twelve adjuncts, who, like the associates, were allowed a
                    deliberative voice in matters relative to science; and the other of six free
                    associates, who were not attached to any particular science, nor obliged to
                    pursue any particular work.</p><p>From the period of its re-establishment in 1699, this academy was very exact in
                    publishing annually a volume containing either the works of its own members, or
                    such memoirs as had been composed and read to the academy during that year. To
                    each volume was prefixed a history of the academy, or an extract of the memoirs
                    and of the <hi rend="italic">res gestae</hi> of the different sittings; and
                    appended to the history were éloges pronounced on such academicians as had died
                    in the course of the year. Μ. Rouille de Mes-lay, counsellor to the parliament
                    of Paris, founded two prizes, one of 2500 and the other of 2000 livres; the
                    former for the best work, essay, or treatise, on physical astronomy, and the
                    latter for any treatise or improvement relating to navigation and commerce. But
                    notwithstanding all the advantages which the members of this academy enjoyed,
                    and the great facilities afforded them for the prosecution of their researches,
                    the institution latterly degenerated; in consequence, doubtless, of the
                    perpetual interference of the court in behalf of its favourites, or to effect
                    the exclusion of men of unquestionable merit who had incurred its displeasure.
                    The effect of all this was, that persons of inferior acquirements were
                    frequently admitted, while those of the most distinguished talents and
                    reputation were excluded; and hence it gradually sunk in public estimation,
                    until admission not only ceased to be an honour but even became a subject of
                    contempt and derision Hence the well-known lines—</p><lg part="N"><l part="N"> Ci gît Pirot, qui ne fut rien, </l><l part="N"> Pas meme Académicien. </l></lg><p>The Revolution swept away the academy amidst the wrecks of the monarchy. It was
                    suppressed by the Convention in the year 1793; and being new-modelled and
                    re-organized upon a better and more efficient plan, it received the name of
                    Institute, an appellation which it still bears, notwithstanding the great
                    political changes which have since taken place. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Institute.</hi></p><p>The French had also considerable academies in most of their great cities.
                    Montpellier, for example, had a royal academy of sciences on nearly the same
                    footing as that at Paris, of which, indeed, it was in some measure the
                    counterpart; Toulouse also had an academy under the; denomination of
                    Lanternists; and there were analogous institutions at Nismes, Arles, Lyons,
                    Dijon, Bordeaux and other places. Of these several, we believe, are still in
                    existence, if not in activity.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin</hi> was founded in
                    1700, by Frederic II. king of Prussia, on the model οf the Royal Society of
                    England; excepting that, besides natural knowledge, it likewise comprehended the
                    belles lettres. In 1710, it was ordained that the president should <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030732" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0732-0071"/>be
                    one of the counsellors of state, and nominated by the king. The members were
                    divided into four classes: the first for prosecuting physics, medicine, and
                    chemistry; the second for mathematics, astronomy, and mechanics; the third for
                    the German language and the history of the country; and the fourth for oriental
                    learning, particularly in so far as it concerns the propagation of the gospel
                    among heathen nations. Each class was empowered to elect a director for itself,
                    who should hold his post for life. The members of any of the classes were
                    entitled to free admission into the assemblies of the other classes.</p><p>The great promoter of this institution was the celebrated Leibnitz, equally
                    distinguished as a jurist, philologist, linguist, antiquary, mathematician, and
                    philosopher, and who accordingly was chosen the first director. The first volume
                    of their transactions was published in 1710, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea Berolinensia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    although the institution received but few marks of the royal favour for some
                    time, they continued to publish new volumes in 1723, 1727, 1734, and 1740. But
                    Frederic HL, the late king of Prussia, at length imparted new vigour to this
                    academy, by inviting to Berlin such foreigners as were most distinguished for
                    their merit and literature, at the same time that he encouraged his own subjects
                    to prosecute the study and cultivation of the sciences; and thinking that the
                    academy, over which some minister or opulent nobleman had till that time
                    presided, would derive advantage from having a man of letters at its head, he
                    conferred that honour on Μ. Maupertuis. At the same time he gave a new set of
                    regulations to the academy, and took upon himself the title of its
                    protector.</p><p>The effect of these changes, however, it is not necessary to enlarge upon, as
                    innovations still more recent have been introduced, with a view to direct the
                    attention of the members to researches of real utility, to improve the arts, to
                    stimulate national industry, and to purify the different systems of moral and
                    literary education. To attain these ends a directory was chosen, consisting of a
                    president and the four directors of the classes, and two men of business, not
                    members of the academy, though at the same time persons of acknowledged
                    learning; and to the body thus constituted was intrusted the management of the
                    funds, and the conduct of the economical affairs of the institution. The power
                    of choosing members was granted to the academy; but the king reserved to himself
                    the privilege of confirming or annulling their choice, as he might think fit.
                    The public library at Berlin, and the collection of natural curiosities, were
                    united to the academy, and intrusted to its superintendence.</p><p>The academicians hold two public assemblies annually; at the latter of which is
                    given, as a prize, a gold medal of fifty ducats value. The subject prescribed
                    for this prize is successively taken from natural philosophy, mathematics,
                    metaphysics, and general erudition.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Imperial Academy of Sciences at St Petersburg</hi> was
                    projected by the Czar Peter the Great. That despotic reformer, having in the
                    course of his travels observed the advantage of public societies for the
                    encouragement and promotion of literature, formed the design of founding an
                    academy of sciences at St Petersburg. By the advice of Wolf and Leibnitz, whom
                    he consulted on this occasion, the society was accordingly regulated, and
                    several learned foreigners were invited to become members. Peter himself drew
                    the plan, and signed it on the 10th of February 1724; but he was prevented, by
                    the suddenness of his death, from carrying it into execution. His decease,
                    however, did not prevent its completion; for on the 21st of December 1725,
                    Catharine I. established it according to Peter’s plan, and on the 27th of the
                    same month the society assembled for the first time. On the 1st of August 1726,
                    Catharine honoured the meeting with her presence, when Professor Bulfinger, a
                    German naturalist of great eminence, pronounced an oration upon the advances
                    made in the theory of magnetic variations, and also on the progress of research
                    in so far as regarded the discovery of the longitude. A short time afterwards
                    the empress settled a fund of L.4982 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi> for the
                    support of the academy; and fifteen members, all eminent for their learning and
                    talents, were admitted and pensioned, under the title of Professors in the
                    various branches of science and literature. The most distinguished of these
                    professors were Nicholas and Daniel Bernoulli, the two De Lisles, Bulfinger, and
                    Wolf.</p><p>During the short reign of Peter II. the salaries of the members were
                    discontinued, and the academy utterly neglected by the court; but it was again
                    patronised by the Empress Anne, who even added a seminary for the education of
                    youth, under the superintendence of the professors. Both institutions flourished
                    for some time under the direction of Baron Korf; but upon his death, towards the
                    latter end of Anne’s reign, an ignorant person being appointed president, many
                    of the most able members quitted Russia. At the accession of Elizabeth, however,
                    new life and vigour were infused into the academy. The original plan was
                    enlarged and improved; some of the most learned foreigners were again drawn to
                    Petersburg; and, what was considered as a good omen for the literature of
                    Russia, two natives, Lomonosof and Rumovsky, men of genius and abilities, who
                    had prosecuted their studies in foreign universities, were enrolled among its
                    members. Lastly, the annual income was increased to L.10,659, and sundry other
                    advantages were conferred upon the institutioh.</p><p>The late Empress Catharine II., with her usual zeal for promoting the diffusion
                    of knowledge, took this useful society under her immediate protection. She
                    altered the court of directors greatly to the advantage of the whole body,
                    corrected many of its abuses, and infused a new vigour and spirit into their
                    researches. By her Majesty’s particular recommendation the most ingenious
                    professors visited the various provinces of her vast dominions; and as the funds
                    of the academy were not sufficient to defray the whole expense of these
                    expeditions, the empress supplied the deficiency by a grant of L.2000, which was
                    renewed as occasion required.</p><p>The purpose and object of these travels will appear from the instructions given
                    by the academy to the several persons who engaged in them. They were ordered to
                    institute inquiries respecting the different sorts of earths and waters; the
                    best methods of cultivating barren and desert spots; the local disorders
                    incident to men and animals, together with the most efficacious means of
                    relieving them; the breeding of cattle, particularly of sheep; the rearing of
                    bees and silk-worms; the different places and objects for fishing and hunting;
                    minerals of all kinds; the arts and trades; and the formation of a <hi rend="italic">Flora Russica,</hi> or collection of indigenous plants. They were
                    particularly instructed to rectify the longitude and latitude of the principal
                    towns; to make astronomical, geographical, and meteorological observations; to
                    trace the courses of the rivers; to construct the most exact charts; and to be
                    very distinct and accurate in remarking and describing the manners and customs
                    of the different races of people, their dresses, languages, antiquities,
                    traditions, history, religion; in a word, to gain every information which might
                    tend to illustrate the real state of the whole Russian empire. More ample
                    instructions cannot well be conceived; and they appear to have been <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030745" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0745-0072"/>
                    very zealously and faithfully executed. The consequence has been, that perhaps
                    no country can boast, within the space of so few years, such a number of
                    excellent publications on its internal state, its natural productions, its
                    topography, geography, and history, and on the manners, customs, and languages
                    of the different tribes who inhabit it, as have issued from the press of this
                    academy.</p><p>The first transactions of this society were published in 1728, and entitled <hi rend="italic">Commentarii</hi><hi rend="italic">Academiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Scientiarum Imperialis</hi><hi rend="italic">Petropolitanae ad
                    annum</hi> 1726, with a dedication to Peter II. The publication was continued
                    under this form until the year 1747, when the transactions were called <hi rend="italic">Novi</hi><hi rend="italic">Commentarii</hi><hi rend="italic">Academiae,</hi> &amp;c.; and in 1777, the academy again changed the title into
                    <hi rend="italic">Acta Academiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Scientiarum
                    Imperialis</hi><hi rend="italic">Petropolitanae,</hi> and likewise made some
                    alteration in the arrangement and plan of the work. The papers, which had been
                    hitherto published in the Latin language only, are now written indifferently
                    either in that language or in French; and a preface is added, entitled <hi rend="italic">Partie Historique,</hi> which contains an account of its
                    proceedings, meetings, the admission of new members, and other remarkable
                    occurrences. Of the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> fourteen volumes were
                    published: the first of the <hi rend="italic">New Commentaries</hi> made its
                    appearance in 1750, and the twentieth in 1776. Under the new title of <hi rend="italic">Acta Academiae,</hi> a number of volumes have been given to the
                    public; and two are printed every year. These transactions abound with ingenious
                    and elaborate disquisitions upon various parts of science and natural history;
                    and it may not be an exaggeration to assert, that no society in Europe has more
                    distinguished itself for the excellence of its publications, particularly in the
                    more abstruse parts of the pure and mixed mathematics.</p><p>The academy is still composed, as at first, of fifteen professors, besides the
                    president and director. Each of these professors has a house and an annual
                    stipend from L.200 to L.600. Besides the professors, there are four adjuncts,
                    with pensions, who are present at the sittings of the society, and succeed to
                    the first vacancies. The direction of the academy is generally intrusted to a
                    person of distinction.</p><p>The buildings and apparatus of this academy are extraordinary. There is a fine
                    library, consisting of 36,000 curious books and manuscripts; together with an
                    extensive museum, in which the various branches of natural history, &amp;c. are
                    distributed in different apartments. The latter is extremely rich in native
                    productions, having been considerably augmented by the collections made by
                    Pallas, Gmelin, Guldenstaedt, and other professors, during their expeditions
                    through the various parts of the Russian empire. The stuffed animals and birds
                    occupy one apartment. The chamber of rarities, the cabinet of coins, &amp;c.
                    contain innumerable articles of the highest curiosity and value. The motto of
                    the society is exceedingly modest: it consists of only one word, <hi rend="italic">Paulatim.</hi></p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Sciences at Bologna,</hi> called the <hi rend="italic">Institute of Bologna,</hi> was founded by Count Marsigli in 1712,
                    for the cultivation of physics, mathematics, medicine, chemistry, and natural
                    history. Its history is written by M. de Limiers, from memoirs furnished by the
                    founder himself.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Sciences at Stockholm,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Royal Swedish Academy,</hi> owes its institution to six persons of
                    distinguished learning, amongst whom was the celebrated Linnaeus. They
                    originally met on the 2d of June 1739, when they formed a private society, in
                    which some dissertations were read; and in the latter end of the same year their
                    first publication made its appearance. As the meetings continued and the members
                    increased, the society attracted the notice of the king; and, accordingly, on
                    the 31st of March 1741, it was incorporated under the name of the Royal Swedish
                    Academy. Not receiving any pension from the crown, it is merely under the
                    protection of the king, being directed, like our Royal Society, by its own
                    members. It has now, however, a large fund, which has chiefly arisen from
                    legacies and other donations; but a professor of experimental philosophy, and
                    two secretaries, are still the only persons who receive any salaries. Each of
                    the members resident at Stockholm becomes president by rotation, and continues
                    in office during three months. There are two kinds of members, native and
                    foreign; the election of the former description takes place in April, that of
                    the latter in July; and no money is paid at the time of admission. The
                    dissertations read at each meeting are collected and published four times in the
                    year: they are written in the Swedish language, and printed in octavo; and the
                    annual publications make a volume. The first forty volumes, which were completed
                    in 1779, are called the <hi rend="italic">Old Transactions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for in the following year the title was changed into that
                    of <hi rend="italic">New Transactions.</hi> The king is often present at the
                    ordinary meetings, and regularly attends the annual assembly in April for the
                    election of members. Any person who sends a treatise which is thought worthy of
                    being printed, receives the Transactions for that quarter <hi rend="italic">gratis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> together with a silver medal, which is not
                    esteemed for its value, being worth only three shillings, but for its rarity and
                    the honour conveyed by it. All the papers relating to agriculture are published
                    separately under the title of <hi rend="italic">Oeconomica Acta.</hi> Annual
                    premiums, in money and gold medals, principally for the encouragement of
                    agriculture and inland trade, are also distributed by the academy. The fund for
                    these prizes is supplied by private donations.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy of Sciences at Copenhagen</hi> owes its
                    institution to the zeal of six individuals, whom Christian VI., in 1742, ordered
                    to arrange his cabinet of medals. These persons were, John Gram, Joachim
                    Frederic Ramus, Christian Louis Scheid, Mark Woldickey, Eric Ponto-pidan, and
                    Bernard Moelman, who, occasionally meeting for this purpose, extended their
                    designs; associated with them others who were eminent in several branches of
                    science; and forming a kind of literary society, employed themselves in
                    searching into, and explaining the history and antiquities of their country. The
                    Count of Holstein, the first president, warmly patronised this society, and
                    recommended it so strongly to Christian VI. that, in 1743, his Danish majesty
                    took it under his protection, called it the Royal Academy of Sciences, endowed
                    it with a fund, and ordered the members to join to their former pursuits,
                    natural history, physics, and mathematics. In consequence of the royal favour,
                    the members engaged with fresh zeal in their pursuits; and the academy has
                    published fifteen volumes in the Danish language, some of which have been
                    translated into Latin.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">American Academy of Sciences</hi> was established in 1780,
                    by the council and house of representatives in the province of Massachusetts
                    Bay, for promoting a knowledge of the antiquities of America, and of the natural
                    history of the country; for determining the uses to which its various natural
                    productions might be applied; for encouraging medicinal discoveries,
                    mathematical disquisitions, philosophical inquiries and experiments,
                    astronomical, meteorological, and geographical observations, and improvements in
                    agriculture, manufactures, and commerce; and, in short, for cultivating every
                    art and science which may tend to advance the interest and increase the
                    happiness of the people. The members of this academy can never exceed 200, nor
                    fall below forty.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193030758" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0758-0073"/><p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Irish Academy</hi> arose out of a society established
                    at Dublin about the year 1782, and consisting of a number of gentlemen, most of
                    whom belonged to the University. They held weekly meetings, and read essays in
                    turn on various subjects. The members of this society afterwards formed a more
                    extensive plan, and, admitting only such names as might add dignity to their new
                    institution, became the founders of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Irish
                    Academy;</hi> which professed to unite the advancement of science with the
                    history of mankind and polite literature. The first volume of their transactions
                    for 1787 appeared in 1788, and seven volumes were afterwards published. A
                    society was formed in Dublin, similar to the Royal Society in London, as early
                    as the year 1683; but the distracted state of the country proved unpropitious to
                    the cultivation of philosophy and literature.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Sciences at Manheim</hi> was established by
                    Charles Theodore, Elector Palatine, in the year 1755. The plan of this
                    institution was furnished by Schaepflin, according to which it was divided into
                    two classes, the historical and physical. In 1780, a sub-division of the latter
                    took place, into the physical properly so called, and the meteorological. The
                    meteorological observations are published separately, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides</hi><hi rend="italic">Societatis</hi><hi rend="italic">Meteorologicae Palatinae.</hi> The historical and physical memoirs
                    are published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Acta Academiae

                    established in 1759, and publishes its memoirs under the title of <hi rend="italic">Abhandlungen der</hi><hi rend="italic">Baierischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Akademie.</hi> Soon after the Elector of Bavaria was raised to the
                    rank of King, the Bavarian government, by his orders, directed its attention to
                    a new organization of the Academy of Sciences of Munich. The design of the king
                    was, to render its labours more extensive than those of any similar institution
                    in Europe, by giving to it, under the direction of the ministry, the immediate
                    superintendence over all the establishments for public instruction in the
                    kingdom of Bavaria. The Privy-Councillor Jacobi, a man of most excellent
                    character, and of considerable scientific attainments, was appointed
                    president.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Electoral Academy at Erfurt</hi> was established by the
                    Elector of Mcntz, in the year 1754. It consists of a protector, president,
                    director, assessors, adjuncts, and associates. Its object is to promote the
                    useful sciences. Their memoirs were originally published in the Latin language,
                    but afterwards in German. The Hessian Academy of Sciences at Giessen publish
                    their transactions under the title of <hi rend="italic">Acta Philosophieo-Medica

                    Hessiacae.</hi> In the Netherlands there are scientific academies at Flushing
                    and Brussels, both of which have published their transactions.</p><p>A branch of the royal family of Portugal established at Lisbon, a number of years
                    ago, a Royal Academy of the sciences, agriculture, arts, commerce, and economy
                    in general. It is divided into three classes; natural science, mathematics, and
                    national literature. It is composed of honorary members, as ministers of state
                    and persons of high rank in Lisbon; foreign members, called <hi rend="italic">socios veteranos</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and acting members. The total
                    number is sixty, of which twenty-four belong to the last class. They enjoy an
                    allowance from government, which has enabled them to establish an observatory, a
                    museum, a library, and a printing office. Their published transactions consist
                    of <hi rend="italic">Memorias</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Litteratura</hi><hi rend="italic">Portugueza</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                    Petersburg, established by the Empress Elizabeth, at the suggestion of Count
                    Shuvalof, and annexed to the Academy of Sciences. The fund for its support was
                    L.4000 <hi rend="italic">per annum,</hi> and the foundation admitted forty
                    scholars. The late empress formed it into a separate institution, augmented the
                    annual revenue to L.12,000, and increased the number of scholars to three
                    hundred: she also constructed, for the use and accommodation of the members, a
                    large circular building, which fronts the Neva. The scholars are admitted at the
                    age of six, and continue until they have attained that of eighteen. They are
                    clothed, fed, and lodged, at the expense of the crown; and are all instructed in
                    reading and writing, arithmetic, the French and German languages, and drawing.
                    At the age of fourteen they are at liberty to choose any of the following arts,
                    divided into four classes, viz. first, painting in all its branches, of history,
                    portraits, battles, and landscapes, architecture, mosaic, enamelling, &amp;c.;
                    secondly, engraving on copperplates, seal-cutting, &amp;c.; thirdly, carving on
                    wood, ivory, and amber; fourthly, watch making, turning, instrument making,
                    casting statues in bronze and other metals, imitating gems and medals in paste
                    and other compositions, gilding, and varnishing. Prizes are annually distributed
                    to those who excel in any particular art; and from those who have obtained four
                    prizes, twelve are selected, who are sent abroad at the charge of the crown. A
                    certain sum is paid to defray their travelling expenses; and when they are
                    settled in any town, they receive an annual salary of L.60, which is continued
                    during four years. There is a small assortment of paintings for the use of the
                    scholars; and those who have made great progress are permitted to copy the
                    pictures in the imperial collection. For the purpose of design, there are models
                    in plaster, all done at Rome, of the best antique statues in Italy, and of the
                    same size with the originals, which the artists of the academy were employed to
                    cast in bronze.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy of Arts in London</hi> was instituted for the
                    encouragement of designing, painting, sculpture, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the year
                    1768. This academy is under the immediate patronage of the king, and under the
                    direction of forty artists of the first rank in their several professions. It
                    furnishes, in winter, living models of different characters to draw after; and
                    in summer, models of the same kind to paint after. Nine of the ablest
                    academicians are annually elected out of the forty, whose business it is to
                    attend by rotation, to set the figures, to examine the performance of the
                    students, and to give them necessary instructions. There are likewise professors
                    of painting, architecture, anatomy, and perspective, who annually read public
                    lectures on the subjects of their several departments; besides a president, a
                    council, and other officers. The admission to this academy is free to all
                    students properly qualified to reap advantage from the studies cultivated in it;
                    and there is an annual exhibition of paintings, sculptures, and designs, open to
                    all artists of distinguished merit.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Painting and Sculpture at Paris.</hi> This took
                    its rise from the disputes that happened between the master painters and
                    sculptors in the French capital; in consequence of which, MM. le Brun, Sarrazin,
                    Corneille, and others of the king’s painters, formed a design of instituting a
                    particular academy; and having presented a petition to the king, obtained an
                    arrêt dated January 20. 1648. In the beginning of 1655, they obtained from
                    Cardinal Mazarin, a brevet, and letters patent, which were registered in
                    parliament; in gratitude for which favour, they chose the cardinal their
                    protector, and made the chancellor their vice-protector. In 1663, they obtained,
                    through Μ. Colbert, a pension of 4000 <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030771" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0771-0074"/>livres. The
                    academy consisted of a protector, a vice-protector, a director, a chancellor,
                    four rectors, adjuncts to the rectors, a treasurer, four professors (one of whom
                    was professor of anatomy, and another of geometry), several adjuncts and
                    counsellors, an historiographer, a secretary, and two ushers.</p><p>Every day for two hours in the afternoon, the Academy of Painting held a public
                    assembly, to which the painters resorted either to design or to paint, while the
                    sculptors modelled after the naked figure. There were twelve professors, each of
                    whom kept the school for a month; and there was an equal number of adjuncts to
                    supply their places in case of need. The professor upon duty placed the naked
                    figure as he thought proper, and set it in two different attitudes every week.
                    This was what they called <hi rend="italic">setting the model.</hi> In one week
                    of the month he set two models together, which was called <hi rend="italic">setting the group.</hi> The paintings and models made after this model, were
                    called <hi rend="italic">academics,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">academical
                    figures.</hi> They had likewise a woman who stood as a model in the public
                    school. Three prizes for design were distributed among the élèves or disciples
                    every quarter; and four others, two for painting, and two for sculpture, every
                    year.</p><p>There was also an Academy of Painting, Sculpture, &amp;c. at Rome, established by
                    Louis XIV., wherein those who had gained the annual prize at Paris were entitled
                    to be three years entertained at the king’s expense, for their further
                    improvement.</p><p>In 1778, an Academy of Painting and Sculpture was established at Turin. Their
                    meetings were held in the palace of the king, who distributed prizes among the
                    most successful members. In Milan, an Academy of Architecture was established so
                    early as the year 1380, by Galeas Visconti. About the middle of the last
                    century, an Academy of the Arts was established there, after the example of
                    those at Paris and Rome. The pupils were furnished with originals and models,
                    and prizes were distributed annually. The prize for painting was a gold medal,
                    and no prize was bestowed till all the competing pieces had been subjected to
                    the examination and criticism of competent judges. Before the effects of the
                    French revolution reached Italy, this was one of the best establishments of the
                    kind in that kingdom. In the hall of the academy were some admirable pieces of
                    Correggio, as well as several ancient paintings and statues of great merit;
                    particularly a small bust of Vitellius, and a statue of Agrippina, of most
                    exquisite beauty, though it wants the head and arms. The Academy of the Arts,
                    which had been long established at Florence, but which had fallen into decay,
                    was restored by the late Grand Duke. In it there are halls for naked and plaster
                    figures, for the use of the sculptor and the painter. The hall for plaster
                    figures had models of all the finest statues in Italy, arranged in two lines;
                    but the treasures of this, as well as all the other institutions for the fine
                    arts, were greatly diminished by the rapacity of the French. In the saloon of
                    the Academy of the Arts at Modena, there are many casts of antique statues; but
                    since it was plundered by the French it has dwindled into a petty school for
                    drawings from living models: it contains the skull of Correggio. There is also
                    an Academy of the Fine Arts in Mantua, and another at Venice.</p><p>In Madrid, an Academy for Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, was founded by
                    Philip V. The minister for foreign affairs is president. Prizes are distributed
                    every three years. In Cadiz, a few students are supplied by government with the
                    means of drawing and modelling from figures; and such as are not able to
                    purchase the requisite instruments-are provided with them.</p><p>An Academy of the Fine Arts was founded at Stockholm in the year 1733 by Count
                    Tessin. In its hall are' the ancient figures of plaster presented by Louis XIV.
                    to Charles XL The works of the students are publicly exhibited, and prizes are
                    distributed annually. Such of them as display distinguished talents obtain
                    pensions from government, to enable them to reside in Italy for some years, for
                    the purposes of investigation and improvement. In this academy there are nine
                    professors, and generally about four hundred students. In the year 1705, an
                    Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture was established at Vienna, with
                    the view of encouraging and promoting the fine arts.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy of Music</hi> is a name given in France to
                    the grand opera, which is considered as in some sort a combination of all the
                    liberal arts; painting, music, and the dance forming the principal part of that
                    enchanting spectacle. The opera is of Venetian origin; and the Abbé Perrin, who
                    officiated as master of the ceremonies to Gaston, Duke of Orleans, was the first
                    who introduced it at Paris. He obtained letters patent from the king, dated the
                    28th June 1669, conferring upon him the privilege of establishing <hi rend="italic">Operatic Academies in Music and in French Verse</hi> throughout
                    the kingdom. Latterly, the theatre where operas are represented has been
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">Theatre des Arts</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    a name which has probably been suggested by the following verses of Voltaire,
                    which convey, a just definition of this delightful entertainment :—</p><lg part="N"><l part="N"> Il faut se rendre à ce palais magique, </l><l part="N"> Où les beaux vers, la danse, la musique, </l><l part="N"> L’art de tromper les yeux par les couleurs, </l><l part="N"> L’art plus heureux de séduire les coeurs, </l><l part="N"> De cent plaisirs font un plaisir unique. </l></lg><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Ancient Music</hi> was established in London in
                    1710, by several persons of distinction, and other amateurs, in conjunction with
                    the most eminent masters of the time, in the view of promoting the study and
                    practice of vocal and instrumental harmony. This institution, which had the
                    advantage of a library, consisting of the most celebrated compositions, both
                    foreign and domestic, in manuscript and in print, and which was aided by the
                    performances of the gentlemen of the chapel royal, and the choir of St Paul’s,
                    with the boys belonging to each, continued to flourish for many years. In 1731,
                    a charge of plagiarism brought against Bononcini, a member of the academy, for
                    claiming a madrigal of Lotti of Venice as his own, threatened the existence of
                    the institution. Dr Greene, who had introduced the madrigal into the academy,
                    took part with Bononcini, and withdrew from the society, taking with him the
                    boys of St Paul’s. In 1734, Mr Gates, another member of the society, and master
                    of the children of the royal chapel, also retired in disgust; so that the
                    institution was thus deprived of the assistance which the boys afforded it in
                    singing the soprano parts. From this time the academy became a seminary for the
                    instruction of youth in the principles of music and the laws of harmony.. Dr
                    Pepusch, who was one of its founders, was active in accomplishing this measure;
                    and by the expedients of educating boys for their purpose, and admitting auditor
                    members, the subsistence of the academy was continued. The <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy of Music</hi> was formed by the principal nobility and gentry of
                    the kingdom, for the performance of operas, composed by Mr Handel, and conducted
                    by him at the theatre in the Haymarket. The subscription amounted to L.50,000,
                    and the king, besides subscribing L.1000, allowed the society to assume the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy.</hi> It consisted of a governor,
                    deputy-governor, and twenty directors. A contest between Handel and Senesino,
                    one of the performers, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030784" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0784-0075"/>in which the directors took the part of the
                    latter, occasioned the dissolution of the academy, after it had subsisted with
                    reputation for more than nine years.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Architecture</hi> was founded, under Louis XIV.,
                    by his celebrated minister Colbert in 1671, and was composed of the most
                    distinguished architects of the time. It was provided, however, that the
                    professor of architecture, and the secretary to the academy, should always be
                    chosen from those Architects intrusted with the superintendence of royal
                    edifices; and the title of academician was conferred by brevet. The Academy of
                    Architecture held its sittings every Monday at the Louvre, where it occupied the
                    apartment called the <hi rend="italic">Queens Saloon</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but at the commencement of the Revolution it was remodelled, like the
                    Academy of Sciences, and transformed into a school for the cultivation and
                    improvement of the fine arts. This school was divided into two sections, the
                    first of which was devoted to painting and sculpture, and the second to
                    architecture; and these two sections received, by a royal ordonnance of the 11th
                    August 1819, the title of <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy of the Fine Arts.</hi>
                    The instruction in architecture at this institution consists of lessons given in
                    special courses of lectures by four different professors; first, on the theory
                    of the art; secondly, on its history; thirdly, on the mathematical principles of
                    construction; and, fourthly, on perspective; which last branch is common to both
                    sections. By the munificence of the government, this institution is amply
                    provided with means for supporting the pupils admitted within its walls, as also
                    for affording them every facility in the prosecution of their studies; and with
                    the view of exciting emulation as well as rewarding excellence, a grand prize is
                    annually given.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Dancing</hi> was erected by Louis XIV., and had
                    particular privileges conferred upon it.</p><p>VII. <hi rend="italic smallcaps">Academies of Law.</hi> Under this head we may
                    mention the famous academy at Berytus, and that of the <hi rend="italic">Sitientes</hi> at Bologna. We are not aware of any other.</p><p>VIII. <hi rend="italic smallcaps">Academies of History.</hi> The first of these
                    to which we shall advert, is the <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy of Portuguese
                    History at Lisbon.</hi> This academy was instituted by King John V. in 1720. It
                    consists of a director, four censors, a secretary, and fifty members, to each of
                    whom is assigned some part of the ecclesiastical or civil history of the nation,
                    which he is required to treat either in Latin or Portuguese. In the church
                    history of each diocese, the prelates, synods, councils, churches, monasteries,
                    academies, persons illustrious for sanctity or learning, and places famous for
                    miracles or relics, must be distinctly related in twelve chapters. The civil
                    history comprises the transactions of the kingdom, from the government of the
                    Romans down to the present time. The members who reside in the country are
                    obliged to make collections and extracts out of all the registers, &amp;c. where
                    they live. Their meetings take place once every fifteen days. A medal was struck
                    by this academy in honour of their prince, on die obverse of which was his
                    effigy, with the inscription <hi rend="italic">Johannes V.</hi><hi rend="italic">Lusitanorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Rex,</hi> and on the reverse,
                    the same prince represented standing, and raising History, almost prostrate
                    before him, with the legend, <hi rend="italic">Historia, Resurges.</hi>
                    Underneath are the following words in abbreviature: REGia ACADemia HISToriae
                    LUSITanae, INSTITuta VI. Idus Decembris MDCCXX.</p><p>An <hi rend="italic">Academy of History</hi> was some time ago established by
                    some learned men at Tubingen, for publishing the best historica! writings, the
                    lives of the chief historians, and compiling new memoirs on any matter of
                    importance connected with either.</p><p>About the year 1730, a few individuals in Madrid agreed to assemble at stated
                    periods, for the purpose of preserving and illustrating the historical monuments
                    of Spain. In the year 1738, the rules which they had drawn up were confirmed by
                    a royal cedula of Philip V. This academy consists of twenty-four members. The
                    device is a river at its source; the motto, <hi rend="italic">In pαtriam
                    populumque fluit.</hi> It has published editions of Mariana, Sepulveda, Solis,
                    and the ancient Chronicles relative to the affairs of Castile, several of which
                    were never before printed. All the diplomas, charters, &amp;c. belonging to the
                    principal cities in Spain, since the earliest period, are in its possession. It
                    has long been employed in preparing a geographical dictionary of that
                    country.</p><p>IX. <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Academies of Antiquities</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as that at Cortona in Italy, and that at Uſpsal in Sweden. The first is
                    designed for the study of Hetrurian antiquities; the other for illustrating the
                    northern languages, and the antiquities of Sweden, in which valuable discoveries
                    have been made by it. The head of the Hetrurian academy is called <hi rend="italic">Lucomon,</hi> a name by which the ancient governors of the country
                    were distinguished. One of their laws is, to give audience to poets only one day
                    in the year; and another is, to fix their sessions, and impose a tax of a
                    dissertation on each member in his turn.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Medals and Inscriptions at Paris</hi> was set on
                    foot by Μ. Colbert, under the patronage of Louis XIV. in 1663, for the study and
                    explanation of ancient monuments, and for perpetuating great and memorable
                    events, especially those of the French monarchy, by coins, relievos,
                    inscriptions, &amp;c. The number of members was at first confined to four or
                    five, chosen out of those of the French academy; and they met in the library of
                    Μ. Colbert, from whom they received his Majesty’s orders. Though the days of
                    their meetings were not determined, they generally assembled on Wednesdays,
                    especially in the winter season; but, in 1691, the king having given the
                    inspection of this academy to Μ. de Pontchartrain, comptroller-general of the
                    finances, he fixed their meetings on Tuesdays and Saturdays. By a new
                    regulation, dated the 16th of July 1701, the academy was composed of ten
                    honorary members; ten associates, each of whom had two declarative voices; ten
                    pensioners; and ten élèves, or pupils. They then met every Tuesday and
                    Wednesday, in one of the halls of the Louvre; and had two public meetings
                    yearly, one the day after Martinmas, and the other the 16th after Easter. The
                    class of élèves was suppressed, and united to the associates. The king nominated
                    their president and vice-president yearly; but their secretary and treasurer
                    were perpetual. The rest were chosen by the members themselves, agreeably to the
                    constitutions on that head given to them. One of the first undertakings of this
                    academy was to compose, by means of medals, a connected history of the principal
                    events of Louis XIV.’s reign. In this design, however, they met with very great
                    difficulties, and consequently it was interrupted for a number of years; but at
                    length it was completed down to the advancement of the Duke of Anjou to the
                    crown of Spain. In this celebrated work, the establishment of the academy itself
                    was not forgotten. The medal on this subject represents Mercury sitting, and
                    writing with an antique stylus on a table of brass; he leans with his left hand
                    upon an urn full of medals, and at his feet are several others placed upon a
                    card. The legend is, <hi rend="italic">Rerum gestarum</hi><hi rend="italic">fides,</hi> and on the exergue, <hi rend="italic">Academia Regia</hi><hi rend="italic">Inscriptionum et Numismatum, instituta</hi> MDCLXIII.; signifying,
                    that the Royal Academy of Medals and Inscriptions, founded in 1663, ought to
                    give to future ages a faithful testimony of all great actions. Besides this
                    work, we have several volumes of their me<pb break="no" facs="nls:193030797" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0797-0076"/>moirs; and
                    their history, written and continued by their secretaries.</p><p>Under this class the <hi rend="italic">Academy of Herculaneum</hi> properly
                    ranks. It was established at Naples about 1755, at which period a museum was
                    formed of the antiquities found at Herculaneum, Pompeii, and other places, by
                    the Marquis Tanucci, who was then minister of state. Its object was to explain
                    the paintings, &amp;c. which were discovered at those places; and for this
                    purpose the members met every fortnight, and at each meeting three paintings
                    were submitted to three academicians, who made their report on them at their
                    next sitting. The first volume of their labours appeared in 1775, and they have
                    been continued under the title of <hi rend="italic">Anticliità di Ercolano.</hi>
                    They contain engravings of the principal paintings, statues, bronzes, marble
                    figures, medals, utensils, &amp;c. with explanations. In the year 1807, an
                    Academy of History and Antiquities, on a new plan, was established at Naples, by
                    Joseph Buonaparte. The number of members was limited to forty; twenty of whom
                    were to be appointed by the king, and these twenty were to present to him, for
                    his choice, three names for each of those wanted to complete the full number.
                    Eight thousand ducats were to be annually allotted for the current expenses, and
                    two thousand for prizes to the authors of four works, which should be deemed by
                    the academy most deserving of such a reward. A grand meeting was to be held
                    every year, when the prizes were to be distributed, and analyses of the works
                    read. The first meeting took place on the 25th of April 1807; but the subsequent
                    changes in the political state of Naples have prevented the full and permanent
                    establishment of this institution. In the same year an academy was established
                    at Florence, for the illustration of Tuscan antiquities, which has published
                    some volumes of memoirs.</p><p>In consequence of the attention of several literary men in Paris having been
                    directed to Celtic antiquities, a <hi rend="italic">Celtic Academy</hi> was
                    established in that city in the year 1807. Its objects were, first, the
                    elucidation of the history, customs, antiquities, manners, and monuments of the
                    Celts, particularly in France; secondly, the etymology of all the European
                    languages, by the aid of the Celto-British, Welsh, and Erse; and, thirdly,
                    researches relating to Druidism. The attention of the members was also
                    particularly called to the history and settlements of the Galatae in Asia.
                    Lenoir, the keeper of the museum of French monuments, was appointed president. A
                    fasciculus, consisting of 150 or 160 pages, was to be published monthly; and the
                    engravings illustrative of Celtic antiquities were to be under the inspection of
                    Lenoir. The devices are, <hi rend="italic">Gloriae</hi><hi rend="italic">Majorum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sermonem patriam</hi><hi rend="italic">moresque</hi><hi rend="italic">requiret.</hi></p><p>X. <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Academies of Belles Lettres</hi> are those
                    wherein eloquence and poetry are chiefly cultivated. These are very numerous in
                    Italy, and were not uncommon in France.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of</hi><hi rend="italic">Umidi</hi><hi rend="italic">at Florence</hi> has contributed greatly to the progress of the
                    sciences by the excellent Italian translations executed by some of its members,
                    of the ancient Greek and Latin historians. But their chief attention was
                    directed to Italian poetry, at the same time that they applied themselves to the
                    polishing of their language, which produced the <hi rend="italic">Academy della
                    Crusea.</hi></p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of Humourists, Umoristi,</hi> had its origin at
                    Rome in the marriage of Lorenzo Marcini, a Roman gentleman, at which several
                    persons of rank were guests; for it being carnival time, to give the ladies some
                    diversion, they betook themselves to the reciting of verses, sonnets, speeches,
                    first <hi rend="italic">extempore,</hi> and afterwards premeditately; which gave
                    them the denomination of <hi rend="italic">Belli</hi><hi rend="italic">Hu</hi><hi rend="italic">mori.</hi> After sortie experience, and coming more and more
                    into the taste of thèse exercises, they resolved to form an academy of belles
                    lettres, and changed the title of <hi rend="italic">Belli Humori</hi> for that
                    of <hi rend="italic">Humoristi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> choosing for their
                    device a cloud, which, after being formed of exhalations from the salt waters of
                    the ocean, returns in a gentle sweet shower; with this motto from Lucretius, <hi rend="italic">Redit</hi><hi rend="italic">agmine</hi><hi rend="italic">duld.</hi></p><p>In 1690, the <hi rend="italic">Academy of</hi><hi rend="italic">Arcadi</hi> was
                    established at Rome, for reviving the study of poetry and of the belles lettres.
                    Besides most of the politer wits of both sexes in Italy, this academy
                    comprehended many princes, cardinals, and other ecclesiastics; and, to avoid
                    disputes about pre-eminence, all appeared masked after the manner of Arcadian
                    shepherds. Within ten years from its first establishment, the number of <hi rend="italic">Academicians</hi> amounted to six hundred. They held assemblies
                    seven times a year in a meadow or grove, or in the gardens of some nobleman of
                    distinction. Six of these meetings were employed in the recitation of poems and
                    verses of the Arcadi residing at Rome, who read their own compositions; except
                    ladies and cardinals, who were allowed to employ others. The seventh meeting was
                    set apart for the compositions of foreign or absent members. This academy is
                    governed by a custos, who represents the whole society^ and is chosen every four
                    years, with a power of electing twelve others yearly for his assistance. Under
                    these are two sub-custodes, one vicar or pro-custos, and four deputies or
                    superintendents, annually chosen. The laws of the society are immutable, and
                    bear a near resemblance to the ancient model. There are five modes of electing
                    members^ The first is by <hi rend="italic">acclamation.</hi> This is used when
                    sovereign princes, cardinals, and ambassadors of kings desire to be admitted;
                    and the votes are then given <hi rend="italic">viva voce.</hi> The second is
                    called <hi rend="italic">annumeratum.</hi> This was introduced in favour of
                    ladies and academical colonies, where the votes are taken privately. The third,
                    <hi rend="italic">representation,</hi> was established in favour of colonies and
                    universities, where the young gentry are bred, who have each a privilege of
                    recommending one or two members privately to be balloted for. The fourth, <hi rend="italic">surrogation,</hi> whereby new members are substituted in the room
                    of those dead or expelled. The last, <hi rend="italic">destination,</hi>
                    whereby, when there is no vacancy of members, persons of poetical merit have the
                    title of Arcadi conferred upon them till such time as a vacancy shall happen.
                    All the members of this body, at their admission, assume new pastoral names, in
                    imitation of the shepherds of Arcadia. The academy has several colonies of
                    Arcadi in different cities of Italy, who are all regulated after the same
                    manner.</p><p>XI. <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Academies of Languages,</hi> called by some, <hi rend="italic">Grammatical Academies</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> as,</p><p>Th e <hi rend="italic">Academy della Crusea at Florence,</hi> famous for i ts
                    vocabulary of the Italian tongue, which was formed in 1582, but scarce heard of
                    before the year 1584, when it became noted for a dispute between Tasso and
                    several of its members. Many authors confound this with the Florentine academy.
                    The discourses which Torricelli, the celebrated disciple of Galileo, delivered
                    in the assemblies, concerning levity, the wind, the power of percussion,
                    mathematics, and military architecture, are a proof that these academies applied
                    themselves to things as well as words.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Academy of</hi><hi rend="italic">Fructiferi</hi> had its
                    rise in 1617, at an assembly of several princes and nobility of the country, who
                    met with a design to refine and perfect the German tongue. It flourished long
                    under the direction of princes of the empire, who were always chosen presidents.
                    In 1668, the number of members arose to upwards of nine hundred. It was prior in
                    time to the French academy, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030810" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0810-0077"/>which only appeared in 1629, and was not
                    established into an academy before the year 1635. Its history is written in the
                    German tongue, by George Neumarck.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Frerich</hi><hi rend="italic">Academy</hi> had its rise
                    from a meeting of men of letters in the house of Μ. Conrart, in 1629. In 1635,
                    it was erected into an academy by Cardinal Richelieu, for refining and
                    ascertaining the French language and style. The number of its members was
                    limited to forty, out of whom a director, chancellor, and secretary were to be
                    chosen; the two former of whom were to hold their posts for two months; the
                    latter was perpetual. The members of this academy enjoyed several privileges and
                    immunities, among which was that of not being obliged to answer before any court
                    but that of the king’s household. They met three times a week in the Louvre. At
                    the breaking up of each meeting forty silver medals were distributed among the
                    members, having on one side the king of France’s head, and on the reverse, <hi rend="italic">Protecteur</hi><hi rend="italic">de l'</hi><hi rend="italic">Académie,</hi> with laurel, and this motto, <hi rend="italic">A l'</hi><hi rend="italic">Immortalité.</hi> By this distribution, the attendance of the
                    academicians was secured; for those who were present received the surplus
                    intended for the absent. To elect or expel a member, the concurrence of at least
                    eighteen was required; nor could any one be chosen unless he petitioned for it;
                    by which expedient the affront of refusals on the part of persons elected was
                    avoided. Religious persons were not admitted; nor could any nobleman or person
                    of distinction be elected on any other footing than as a man of letters. None
                    could be expelled, except for base and dishonest practices; and there were but
                    two instances of such expulsions, the first of M. Grainer for refusing to return
                    a deposit, the other of the Abbé Fure-tière for plagiarism. The design of this
                    academy was to give not only rules, but examples, of good writing. They began
                    with making speeches on subjects taken at pleasure, about twenty of which were
                    printed. At their first institution they met with great opposition from the
                    parliament; it being two years before the patents granted by the king could be
                    registered. This institution has been severely satirized, and the style of its
                    compositions has been ridiculed as enervating instead of refining the French
                    language. They were also charged with having surfeited the world by flattery,
                    and exhausted all the topics of panegyric in praise of their founder; it being a
                    duty incumbent on every member, at his admission, to make a speech in praise of
                    the king, the cardinal, the chancellor Seguier, and the person in whose room he
                    is elected. The most remarkable work of this academy is a dictionary of the
                    French tongue; which, after fifty years spent in settling the words and phrases
                    to be used in writing, was at last published in 1694.</p><p>An academy similar to the above was founded at Petersburg under the auspices of
                    the Princess Dashkof; and the plan having been approved by the crown, a fund was
                    established for its support. It is attached to the Imperial Academy of Sciences
                    at St Petersburg.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Spanish Academy at Madrid</hi> held its first meeting
                    in July 1713, in the palace of its founder, the Duke d’Escalona. It consisted at
                    first of eight academicians, including the duke; to which number fourteen others
                    were afterwards added, the founder being chosen president or director. In 1714,
                    the king granted them the royal confirmation and protection. Their device is a
                    crucible in the middle of the fire, with this motto, <hi rend="italic">Limpia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Fixa, y</hi><hi rend="italic">da Esplendor</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> “It purifies, fixes, and gives brightness.” The number
                    of members was limited to twenty-four; the Duke d’Escalona was chosen director
                    for life, but his successors were elected yearly, and the secretary for life.
                    Their object, as marked out by the royal declaration, was to cultivate and
                    improve the national language. They were to begin with choosing carefully such
                    words and phrases as have been used by the best Spanish writers noting the low,
                    barbarous, or obsolete ones; and composing a dictionary wherein these might be
                    distinguished from the former.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Royal Swedish Academy</hi> was founded in the year 1786,
                    for the purpose of purifying and perfecting the Swedish language. A medal is
                    struck by its direction every year in honour of some illustrious Swedc. This
                    academy does not publish its transactions.</p><p>XII. <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Academies of Politics.</hi> Of this description
                    was that at Paris, consisting of six persons, who met at the Louvre, in the
                    chamber where the papers relating to foreign affairs were lodged. But this
                    academy proved of little service, as the kings of France were unwilling to trust
                    any but their ministers with the inspection of foreign affairs.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Academy</hi> is a term also applied to those royal
                    collegiate seminaries in which young men are educated for the navy and army. In
                    our country there are three seminaries of this description; the Naval Academy at
                    Portsmouth, the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, and the Royal Military
                    College at Farnham and Sandhurst. Of these we shall give some account in their
                    order.</p><p>I. The <hi rend="italic">Naval Academy at Portsmouth</hi> was founded by George
                    I. in 1722; but the official warrant for its establishment does not appear to
                    have been issued till the 21st of February 1729. This warrant bears, that the
                    academy was instituted for the education of forty young gentlemen, fifteen of
                    whom were to be sons of commissioned officers in the navy. The commissioner of
                    the navy at Portsmouth was, <hi rend="italic">ex officio,</hi> to be governor;
                    and there were to be two masters for the instruction of the students in
                    navigation and the sciences introductory or auxiliary to it; besides a master
                    for writing and drawing. The annual expense was about L.1169.</p><p>In the year 1773, George HL, during a visit he paid to Portsmouth, suggested the
                    extension and improvement of the Naval Academy; but no steps were taken towards
                    this object till the year 1806, when an order in council was issued for a new
                    and enlarged establishment. By this order it was henceforward to be called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Royal Naval College, at Dock-yard, Portsmouth,</hi> and the
                    following officers were appointed: first, a Governor, who was to be the First
                    Lord of the Admiralty for the time being; and, second, a Lieutenant-Governor and
                    inspector, who was to be a post-captain in the navy. As the course of education
                    which the students were to follow necessarily embraced the mathematical
                    sciences, the order directed that the University of Cambridge should recommend
                    three of its graduates, who were able mathematicians; one of whom, the First
                    Lord of the Admiralty, as governor, was to nominate professor. In order to
                    incite him to the regular and faithful discharge of his duty, he was to receive
                    no fixed salary, but to be paid L.8 annually by each student attending the
                    academy. The next in rank and authority under the professor is the preceptor, or
                    head master, who must be a graduate of one of the universities. He has the
                    control of the students at all hours, and is to instruct them in the classics,
                    moral philosophy, geography, history, and general literature.</p><p>The order in council also appointed a writing-master, who, besides giving
                    instructions in his own immediate line, was to prepare the students for the
                    lectures of the professor, by teaching them arithmetic, fractions, algebra, and
                    geometry. There are, besides, masters for drawing, French, dancing, and fencing.
                    The surgeon of the dockyard gives his professional advice and assistance. The
                    domestic economy of the establishment is intrusted, by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030823" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0823-0078"/>the order in
                    council, to a disabled and meritorious halfpay lieutenant.</p><p>The peculiar advantages of this academy, however, consist in the practical
                    knowledge which it is intended and calculated to bestow on those who are
                    admitted. For this purpose, the master attendant of the dock-yard gives weekly
                    lessons on the management of ships afloat, in one of the cruising sloops; and
                    likewise lessons in rigging and preparing ships for sea, on board such vessels
                    as are preparing to sail from Portsmouth harbour. Forty-seven lessons are given
                    in each of these branches annually, five weeks being allowed for holydays.</p><p>The master shipwright of the dock-yard instructs the students in the principles
                    on which ships of war are built, and in the mode of putting the several parts to
                    ether; making masts, and all other branches of naval architecture, by attending
                    them one day in the week, during the six summer months, through the dock-yards.
                    The gunner of marine artillery also instructs them in the practical knowledge of
                    gunnery, and in the use of the firelock.</p><p>The number of scholars, by the order in council of February 1806, was increased
                    from forty to seventy: of these, thirty might be indiscriminately sons of
                    officers, noblemen, or gentlemen; but forty were invariably to be sons of
                    commissioned officers in the naval service. None are admitted under thirteen,
                    nor above sixteen years of age; and those are preferred to fill vacancies who
                    have been previously at sea, provided they are of the proper age. No student can
                    remain at the academy longer than three years; and the whole period of his
                    residence is to be reckoned as two of the six years which it is necessary for a
                    midshipman to serve before he can obtain a lieutenant’s commission. Each
                    student, while actually at the academy, that is, during three hundred and thirty
                    days in the year, receives four shillings daily; out of which he pays L.8
                    annually to the professor. The annual expense of the establishment, as fixed by
                    the order in council of 1806, is about L.6363.</p><p>In order to secure to the country the services of the students in that line for
                    which they have been educated, the parents of all of them, except such as have
                    been previously at sea, grant a bond of L.200, which is forfeited in case they
                    do not enter into the naval service. The first year they are at sea, they are
                    rated as volunteers, on <hi rend="italic">able seamans</hi> pay; the second
                    year, they have the rank and pay of midshipmen. They arc directed to keep
                    journals, to draw head-lands, &amp;c.; and when the ship comes into port, they
                    are to attend the professor, who is to inspect their journals, and examine them
                    regarding their advancement in the theoretical and practical knowledge of this
                    profession.</p><p>This academy, as established by the order in council already mentioned, was
                    confined entirely to the education of young <hi rend="italic">cadets</hi> for
                    the navy: but in the third report of the commissioners, appointed to inquire
                    into the civil affairs of the navy, laid before Parliament in June 1806, a
                    regular system of education for <hi rend="italic">shipwrights</hi> was also
                    proposed; and the suggestion was accordingly carried into effect, though not
                    till some years afterwards. The professor of the naval academy is also the
                    instructor of the shipwright apprentices, but his instructions extend only to
                    that class who are to serve on board his Majesty’s ships of war. No apprentice
                    can be admitted to the academy under sixteen years of age; and he must be
                    previously examined by the professor, before a committee of the navy board, in
                    arithmetic, the first six books of Euclid, and in French. If the candidate is
                    approved, he must be bound to the resident commissioner of the dockyard for
                    seven years, six of which he spends at the academy, and one at sea. The salary
                    of the apprentices increases yearly, from L.60 to L.140; out of which they' pay
                    L.8 to the professor. The number of these apprentices was originally limited to
                    twenty-five; but latterly, six more have been added. They spend half the day un-
                    . der the professor; and the other half under the master shipwright, in the
                    mould lofts, learning the management of timber, and manual labour in
                    ship-building. Lectures are delivered three times a week, after working hours,
                    on the branches of science connected with naval architecture; and annual
                    examinations take place before the resident commissioner, the master shipwright,
                    and the professor.</p><p>Out of the class of shipwright apprentices thus educated, are selected the master
                    measurers, foremen of shipwrights, master boat-builders, master mast-makers,
                    assistants to master ship-builders, mechanists in office of inspector-general of
                    naval works, assistants to surveyors of the navy, master shipwrights, second
                    surveyor of navy, inspector-general of navy works, and first surveyor of
                    navy.</p><p>II. The <hi rend="italic">Royal Military Academy at Woolwich</hi> was established
                    by George II. by warrants dated 30th of April and 18th November 1741, for the
                    purpose of instructing “raw and inexperienced people belonging to the military
                    branch of the ordnance, in the several parts of the mathematics necessary for
                    the service of the artillery, and the business of engineers.” We find no further
                    notice respecting this institution till the year 1776, when the number of
                    scholars, then called <hi rend="italic">cadets,</hi> amounted to forty-eight. In
                    the year 1786, they were increased to sixty; in 1796, to ninety; and in 1798, to
                    one hundred, forty of whom were educated for the service of the East India
                    Company. This number continued till the year 1806, when the establishment was
                    improved and further extended, the number of masters being increased, and the
                    cadets being divided into two bodies. This latter regulation took place in
                    consequence principally of the unhealthy and confined situation of the old
                    buildings in the royal arsenal; new buildings having been erected on Woolwich
                    Common, on the side of Shooter’s Hill, in a more open and dry situation. As soon
                    as these were finished, one hundred and twenty-eight cadets were lodged in them;
                    sixty still continuing in the royal arsenal. At this period, there were nine
                    masters of mathematics. In 1810, the cadets for the service of the East India
                    Company were withdrawn from Woolwich; and the extra cadets, who, for want of
                    room, had been sent to Marlow, or to private schools, were taken into the
                    college, under the name of supernumeraries. The establishment at present
                    consists of two hundred cadets, one hundred and twenty-eight of whom are in the
                    new buildings, and seventy-two, including twelve supernumeraries, reside in the
                    arsenal. The number of cadets is not fixed by warrant, but is at the discretion
                    of the master-general of ordnance, who, with the board of ordnance, have the
                    entire superintendence of the institution. The immediate direction, however, is
                    vested in the lieutenant-governor and inspector, who are chosen generally from
                    the artillery or engineers by the master-general of the ordnance. It is the duty
                    of these officers, aided by the assistant inspector, to control the masters and
                    professors, and to see that the cadets are taught the necessary branches of
                    instruction. The professors and masters are appointed on the recommendation of
                    the lieutenant-governor, who, assisted by men of science, previously examines
                    them. One master is appointed for every sixteen cadets. At present there are a
                    professor of fortification, with two assistants; a professor of mathematics,
                    with six masters and assistants; two French masters; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030836" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0836-0079"/>a
                    drawing-master for ground, and an assistant; a drawing-master for figures, and
                    another for landscape; a dancing-master; a fencing-master; two modellers; and a
                    lecturer on. chemistry. Lectures are also given on the different branches of
                    natural philosophy. The inferior branches of education are taught at the lower
                    institution in the arsenal, and the higher branches at the buildings on the
                    common.</p><p>The young men educated at the Royal Military Academy of Woolwich are the sons of
                    noblemen, gentlemen, or military officers. They are called gentlemen cadets, and
                    cannot be admitted under fourteen, nor above sixteen years of age. They are
                    nominated by the master-general of the ordnance, as governor of the academy; but
                    they must be well grounded in English grammar, .arithmetic, and French; and they
                    undergo a previous public examination before the masters of the academy. The
                    cadets educated at Woolwich are considered as the first company of the royal
                    regiment of artillery, of which the master-general of the ordnance is the
                    captain. They are also divided into companies, each company having a captain and
                    two subalterns, as military directors. Each cadet receives 2ş. 6d. a day, or
                    L.45. 12s. 6d. a year, which covers all his regular expenses, except keeping up
                    his linen. The annual vacations consist of twelve weeks.</p><p>Monthly returns of the studies of the cadets, showing the relative progress of
                    each in every branch, with his particular character subjoined, are sent to the
                    master-general of the ordnance: there are also public examinations before the
                    general officers of the ordnance corps. Commissions. are given to the cadets
                    according to the report of their merits and acquirements; they have their choice
                    of entering either into the artillery or engineers. The whole expense to
                    government, of the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, is at the rate of about
                    L.100 for each cadet.</p><p>III. The <hi rend="italic">Royal Military College,</hi> which is at present
                    established at Farnham, in Surrey, and at Sandhurst, near Bagshot, was
                    originally settled at High Wycombe and Great Marlow. .The establishment at High
                    Wycombe commenced in January 1799, at which time there was a superintendent,
                    commandant, two or three professors, and thirty-four students. Next year four
                    more professors were added; and in 1801 it took the name of the <hi rend="italic">Royal Military College</hi> by warrant of George III. A supreme
                    board of commissioners, to superintend and regulate its concerns, was appointed,
                    consisting of the commander-in-chief, secretary of war, and the heads of the
                    great military departments, with others of high rank in the army; three of whom,
                    including the secretary of war, and the adjutant or quartermaster-general, were
                    to form a board of management. By his Majesty’s warrant, dated the 4th of June
                    1802, another department, called the <hi rend="italic">Junior Department of</hi>
                    the Royal Military College, was formed; and the objects of this, as well as of
                    the original, or <hi rend="italic">Senior Department,</hi> were specifically
                    pointed out. A collegiate board was also established, for the internal
                    government of the college, consisting of the governor, lieutenant-governor, and
                    the commandants of the two departments. The last warrant relating to this
                    establishment is dated 27th May 1808. It places both the departments, forming
                    one college, under the command of the governor and lieutenant-governor; it
                    continues the collegiate board; and it vests the appointment of professors and
                    masters, after public notice of vacancies, and the examination of the candidates
                    in the presence of the collegiate board, in the supreme board.</p><p>By these warrants it was declared, that the Junior Department of the Institution,
                    which was then at Marlow, was principally intended for those who were destined
                    for the military profession, in order to ground them in the necessary sciences
                    by the time they could hold commissions; and also to afford provision for the
                    orphan sons of meritorious officers, who had fallen or been disabled in the
                    service of their country, or whose pecuniary circumstances rendered them unable
                    to educate their sons properly for a military life. The warrant of 1808 fixed
                    the number of students in the Junior Department at four hundred and twelve,
                    divided into four companies of a hundred and three cadets each. They are
                    admitted upon three different establishments :—1. Orphan sons of officers of the
                    army or navy, who have fallen, died, or been disabled in the service: these are
                    admitted free of expense, except that they are to bring the first suit of
                    uniform on their admission, and to keep up their stock of linen, during their
                    residence at the college. 2. The sons of officers actually serving in the army
                    or navy, who pay a certain sum annually, from L.10 to L.60, according to the
                    rank of their fathers. 3. The sons of noblemen and gentlemen, who pay L.100 <hi rend="italic">per annum</hi> each.</p><p>The military branch of the establishment attached to the Junior Department,
                    consists of a commandant, a major, three captains, an adjutant, and inferior
                    officers.</p><p>The studies pursued in this department are, mathematics, natural philosophy,
                    history, geography, fortification, military drawing, landscape drawing,
                    arithmetic, classics, French, German, fencing, and writing. There are seven
                    masters of mathematics, four of fortification, five of military drawing, three
                    of landscape drawing, four of history, geography, and classics, six of French,
                    one of German, and three of fencing. The course for this department lasts from
                    three and a half to four years.</p><p>Applications for admission must be made to the commander-in-chief, through the
                    governor of the college, and his Majesty’s approbation obtained. Every
                    candidate, previously to admission into the Junior Department, must pass an
                    examination in Latin and English grammar, and in the first four rules of
                    arithmetic; and no candidate can be admitted under thirteen or above fifteen
                    years of age.</p><p>Examinations are held monthly, which are conducted by the professors of the
                    Senior Department, for the purpose of ascertaining the progress of each cadet,
                    previously to his removal from one class to another. There are also half-yearly
                    examinations, in presence of the collegiate board, on which occasion one or more
                    members of the supreme board, not being members of the collegiate board, attend.
                    These examinations are held previously to the cadets’ receiving commissions from
                    the college; and if they acquit themselves well, they are furnished by the board
                    of commissioners, in whose presence the examination takes place, with
                    certificates of qualification to serve in the army as officers. The third class,
                    or gentlemen cadets, are allowed to purchase commissions at any time during
                    their continuance at the college; but no gentleman cadet can be recommended for
                    a commission by private interest, until he has made a certain progress in his
                    studies.</p><p>The Senior Department of the Royal Military College, which was originally
                    established at High Wycombe, is intended for the purpose of instructing officers
                    in the scientific parts of their profession, with a view of enabling them better
                    to discharge their duty when acting in the command of regiments; and, at the
                    same time, of qualifying them for being employed in the quartermaster’s and
                    adjutant-general’s department. The military branch of the establishment of the
                    Senior Department consists of a commandant and adjutant. The studies pursued
                    are, mathematics in all their various branches, fortification, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193030849" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0849-0080"/>gunnery,
                    castrametation, military drawing and surveying, the reconnoitring of ground, the
                    disposition and movement of troops under all the various circumstances of
                    defensive and offensive war, rules for estimating the military resources of a
                    country, and the German and French languages. There are six professors in this
                    department; one for mathematics, one for fortification, two for military
                    drawing, one for French, and one for German.</p><p>The full complement of the Senior Department consists of thirty students.'*
                    Nd‘officer can be admitted till he has completed the twenty-first year of his
                    age, and actually served with his regiment, áš a commissioned officer, three
                    years abroad, or four years at home. Applications for admission must be made to
                    the governor, through the commanding officer of the regiment to which the
                    candidate belongs; and the governòr transmits the application to the
                    commander-in-chief, for his Majesty’s approbation. Such examination as may be
                    deemed requisite, is required previously to admission. Each student of this
                    department pays into the funds of the college thirty guineas annually; and after
                    a certain périod he is obliged to keep a horse, for the purpose of receiving
                    such instruction as is given in the field. There are public examinations
                    half-yearly, conducted on the same principle as the half-yearly examinations of
                    the Junior Department. Such officers as have gone through the regular course of
                    studies, and have passed this examination with credit, receive certificates that
                    they are duly qualified for staff-appointments, signed, by the. board who
                    examined them, and sealed with the seal of the college.</p><p>Officers or students of the first department, non-commissioned officers, and
                    other military persons belonging to the college, as well as the gentlemen cadets
                    of the junior department, are subject to the articles of war; for which reason
                    the latter are placed on the establishment of the army, and receive 2s. 6d. per
                    day. This money contributes towards the expense of their education. The
                    gentlemen cadets wear military uniforms.</p><p>The general staff of the college consists of the governor, the
                    lieutenant-governor, the inspector-general of instruction, and the chaplain,
                    who, besides performing divine service, teaches the evidences and principles of
                    Christianity. The rest of the staff are exclusively occupied with the finances
                    of the college.</p><p>In 1801, five hundred acres of land were purchased at Sandhurst, near Bagshot;
                    and on this space large and commodious buildings were erected, into which the
                    Junior Department was removed from Great Marlow; but the Senior Department
                    remained at Farnham, which is at no great distance from Sandhurst.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Academy</hi><hi rend="italic">Figure,</hi> a drawing
