                    Russian discoverers to a chain of small islands situated in the Northern Pacific
                    Ocean, and extending in an easterly direction from the peninsula of Kamtschatka,
                    in Asiatic Russia, to the promontory of Alaska, in North America. According to
                    the practice of the most recent Russian geographers, we have comprehended the
                    whole of this archipelago under one general name, although it has been sometimes
                    divided into three several groups; those nearest to the eastern coast of
                    Kamtschatcha being properly called Aleutian, the central group the Andreanofskie
                    or Andrenovian, and those nearest to the American promontory the Fox Islands.
                    The Russian geographers usually separate Behring’s and Copper Island, which are
                    at the western extremity of this chain, from the other parts of it, included by
                    them under the general name of Aleutian Islands;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Pinkerton appears to be mistaken when he
                    says, that “the nearest Aleutian Isles of the Russians are those which we term
                    Behring’s and Copper.” {Geog. 3d edit. vol. ii. p. 423.) We do not find that the
                    term Aleutian has ever been applied to the two islands, above mentioned. That
                    name was first given by the early Russian discoverers to the small group of
                    islands situated to the southeast of Behring’s Island; and the islands composing
                    this group were sometimes called the nearest Aleutian Isles, to distinguish them
                    from the more easterly and remote parts of the chain. (See Coxe’s Russian
                    Discoveries, chap, ii.)</p></note> but as there seems no good reason for this
                    exception, it certainly would be better to comprehend the whole under one
                    general denomination.</p>
                <p>The first voyage of discovery in this remote and dangerous archipelago was
                    projected by Peter the Great, whose enterprising mind appears to have been

                    />excited by the question, then much agitated, relative to the distance between
                    the Asiatic and American continents; the solution of which seemed to be
                    facilitated by the recent conquest of Kamtschatka. A short time previous to the
                    death of that monarch, which took place in 1725, he drew up instructions, with
                    his own hand, for the conduct of an expedition, which was to be intrusted to the
                    command of an officer named Behring, who had already made several voyages in the
                    sea of Kamtschatka by order of the crown. In 1728 Behring set sail from the
                    mouth of the Kamtschatka River, and coasted the eastern shores of Siberia, as
                    far to the northward as lat. 67. 18., but made no discovery of the opposite
                    continent. In 1729 he again set sail, for the purpose of prosecuting the same
                    enterprise, but with no better success. A third voyage was undertaken by order
                    of the empress Anna in 1741, and Behring was again selected as chief of the
                    expedition, another vessel being intrusted to the command of Tschirikoff. This
                    enterprise proved more fortunate, and led the way to all the subsequent
                    important discoveries of the Russians in those seas; although the immediate
                    results of the voyage, upon the whole, were not deemed commensurate with the
                    time and expense employed in fitting out the expedition. The principal object of
                    the undertaking, however, appears to have been accomplished. Tschirikoff
                    discovered the coast of America in the 56th degree of latitude; and Behring, who
                    was separated from his companion in a storm, saw it in lat. 58. 28. On his
                    voyage back to Kamtschatka, Behring’s ship was driven on the island which now
                    bears his name, where he soon afterwards died.</p>
                <p>The two uninhabited islands, Behring’s and Copper Island, now became known to the
                    natives of Kamtschatka, who frequently resorted thither for the purpose of
                    hunting sea-otters, and other animals affording valuable furs, with which they
                    carried on a lucrative traffic. Some of the vessels which sailed upon these
                    expeditions were driven by stormy weather to the south-east, by which means the
                    group of Aleutian Islands came to be discovered. These islands seem to have been
                    first visited in the year 1745, and continued to be resorted to for some time by
                    private individuals, without attracting the attention of the Russian government.
                    In the above-mentioned year a vessel called the Eudokia was fitted out at the
                    expense of some private adventurers, and the command given to Michael
                    Nevodtsikof, a native of Tobolsk. Having discovered three unknown islands, they
                    ventured upon one of them, in order to kill sea-otters, of which they found a
                    large quantity. These islands were undoubtedly the nearest Aleutian Islands, and
                    were found well inhabited. The Russians continued upon this island until the
                    14th September 1746, when, having incurred the enmity of the natives by their
                    arbitrary and hostile proceedings, they put to sea with the view of looking out
                    for some uninhabited islands. Being overtaken, however, by a violent storm, they
                    were driven about until the 30th October, when their vessel was wrecked upon the
                    rocky shore of the island of Karaga, the inhabitants of which were of the Koriac
                    tribe, and tributary to the Russian empire.</p>
                <p>From this period the zeal or avarice of individual adventurers prompted them to
                    undertake repeatedvoyages to the new-discovered islands, in some of which they
                    penetrated as far eastward as the Fox Islands, where they collected a quantity
                    of valuable skins; but, in consequence of their own rapacity and misconduct,
                    they were frequently embroiled in fatal quarrels with the natives. One of the
                    most remarkable of these voyages was that of the St An- <hi rend="subscript">
                    (</hi> drean and Natalia, fitted out by the merchant Andrean Tolstyk, which
                    sailed from the mouth of the Kamtschstka River on the 27th September 1760, and
                    on the 29th reached Behring’s Island. Having been driven on shore by a violent
                    autumnal storm, they were here obliged to pass the winter; and after refitting,
                    they put to sea again on the 24th June 1761. They passed by Copper Island, which
                    lies about 150 versts from the former, and steered south-east towards the
                    Aleutian Isles, which they did not reach before the 6th August. From thence they
                    proceeded on the 19th in quest of some more distant islands, for the purpose of
                    exacting tribute, steering their course north-east and north-east by east, and
                    were driven by a gale of wind towards an island, where, on the 30th August, they
                    anchored in a safe bay. This island they called Ayagh or Kayaka, and another,
                    which lay at the distance of about 20 versts, Kanaga. The Russians persuaded the
                    inhabitants of these islands to become tributary to the empress, to which they
                    made no great objection. Four other islands were discovered in the
                    neighbourhood, and the crew remained here in great tranquillity until the year
                    1764, but met with no great success in their hunting excursions. This group of
                    islands, which lies somewhat to the north-west of the Fox Islands, was
                    denominated, in honour of the vessel which made the discovery, the Andreanofskie
                    or Andrenovian Isles.</p>
                <p>From the year 1758 to 1760 several vessels visited the Fox Islands, and obtained
                    considerable cargoes of seaotter and fox skins. But the crews appear to have
                    behaved with the most shameful inhumanity towards the natives; and little
                    information was derived from these voyages, except a few particulars which
                    transpired during the course of a judicial investigation into their conduct. In
                    1762 four vessels sailed for the Fox Islands, of which only one returned safe to
                    Kamtschatka. The first was the Zacharias and Elizabeth, fitted out by Kulkof and
                    Company of Vologda, under the command of Drusinin, with a crew of thirty-four
                    Russians and three Kamtschadals. This vessel touched at the Aleutian Islands,
                    and in the beginning of September 1763 arrived at Umnak, one of the most
                    considerable of the Fox Islands. On the 22d September they proceeded to
                    Unalashka, where the vessel was brought into a safe harbour. Here the crew
                    formed themselves into hunting parties, but were soon afterwards attacked
                    separately by the natives, and cut off, with the exception of four individuals,
                    who, after defending themselves with astonishing courage and intrepidity, and
                    suffering incredible hardships, succeeded in making their escape from the island
                    in a <hi rend="italic">baidar,</hi> their own vessel having been destroyed by
                    the savages. One of these four died during the home voyage; but the other three
                    returned safe to Kamtschatka, and gave an account of their adventures.</p>
                <p>The second vessel which sailed from Kamtschatka in 1762 was the Trinity, fitted
                    out by the trading company of Nikiphor Trapesnikof, a merchant of Irkutsk, under
                    the command of Ivan Korovin, and manned with thirty-eight Russians and six
                    Kamtschadals. In the month of October they cast anchor before the south side of
                    Behring’s Island, where they resolved to winter, on account of the late season
                    of the year. On the first of August 1763 Korovin sailed from Behring’s Island,
                    in company with Dennis Medvedef, who commanded a vessel<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This was the fourth vessel which sailed in

                    Tiumen. On the 15th the former vessel made Unalashka, and Medvedef reached
                    Umnak. After having reconnoitred the coast, and received hostages from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Toigons</hi> or Chiefs, Korovin sent out several hunting parties;
                    but the natives soon began to exhibit hostile intentions, and three Kamtschadals
                    belonging to Kulkofs ship arrived with accounts of the destruction of that
                    vessel, and the massacre of the crew. On the 10th December the savages assembled
                    in large bodies, and invested the hut which the Russians had constructed, and
                    continually annoyed them with their darts. Korovin finding himself thus harassed
                    by the natives, ordered the hut to be destroyed, and retired to his vessel,
                    which was removed to the distance of a hundred yards from the beach, where they
                    lay at anchor from the 5th March to the 26th April 1764. Here the natives
                    attempted to surprise the vessel; but Korovin, having been warned of their
                    approach, compelled them to retreat. On the 26th April Korovin sailed from
                    Unalashka, and, after being driven about by contrary winds, the vessel was at
                    length stranded on the 28th, m a bay of the island of Umnak. Having got on
                    shore, the crew attempted to secure themselves between their <hi rend="italic"
                    >baidar</hi> and some empty barrels, with the sails spread over them in the form
                    of a tent. Next morning before the break of day they were surprised by a large
                    body of the natives, who attacked them with their darts, and wounded every one
                    of the crew. Korovin, however, sallied out, in company with four Russians, and
                    put the savages to flight, although he and his party were so severely wounded,
                    that they had scarcely sufficient strength to return to the tent. During the
                    night the vessel was dashed to pieces by the storm. On the 30th of April they
                    were again attacked by the natives, who, however, were soon put to flight by the
                    fire of the Russians. On the 21st of July, Korovin, with the remainder of his
                    crew, which was now reduced to the number of twelve persons, including six
                    Kamtschadals, put to sea in a <hi rend="italic">baidar</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and, having landed upon another part of the same island, they discovered
                    the remains of a vessel which had been burnt, and at a small distance, a
                    deserted Russian dwelling, containing twenty dead bodies in their clothes; among
                    which they recognised several of those individuals who had sailed in Protassofs
                    vessel, and distinguished, among the rest, the commander Medvedef. Korovin
                    afterwards joined Glottofs vessel (of whose proceedings we shall immediately
                    give some account), which he quitted in the month of April 1765, and went over,
                    with five other Russians, to Soloviof, with whom he returned the following year
                    to Kamtschatka.</p>
                <p>The third voyage from Kamtschatka in 1762, and the most fortunate and most
                    remarkable of the whole, was that of the Andrean and Natalia, which was fitted
                    out by Terenty Tsebaeffskoi and Company, under the command of Stephen Glottof,
                    an experienced and skilful seaman of Yarensk. This vessel sailed on the 1st
                    October, with a crew of thirty-eight Russians and eight Kamtschadals. Having
                    wintered at Copper Island, they set sail from thence on the 26th July 1763, and
                    steered for the Fox Islands. In consequence of storms and contrary winds, they
                    were thirty days on the voyage to Umnak, where they arrived on the 24th August,
                    and without dropping anchor, sailed farther in quest of new islands, of which
                    they passed eight contiguous to each other, and separated by straits from 20 to
                    100 versts broad. Glottof, however, did not land until he reached the most
                    eastward of these islands, called by the inhabitants Kadyak. Here and in the
                    neighbouring islands they passed the winter, and collected a considerable
                    quantity of furs; but as the conduct of the natives, at first decidedly hostile,
                    was al ways suspicious, Glottof did not think it prudent to prolong his stay;
                    and accordingly, having taken on board all the peltry and stores, he left Kadyak
                    on the 24th May 1764, and sailed for Umnak, where he arrived on the 3d July. He
                    remained here two years, sending out hunting parties through the islands of
                    Umnak and Unalashka, and commenced his voyage homewards in the month of July
                    1766, In the month of August he arrived safe in Kamtschatka River with a rich
                    cargo.</p>
                <p>Soloviof, to whose voyage we have already alluded, sailed from Kamtschatka on the
                    25th of August 1764, in a ship called the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, fitted
                    out by Jacob Ulednikof and Company, merchants of Irkutsk. This vessel reached
                    Unalashka on the 17th September, where Soloviof passed two winters; and having
                    succeeded, notwithstanding the continual hostility of the natives, in collecting
                    a considerable cargo of peltry, he returned to Kamtschatka in the month of July
                    1766.</p>
                <p>Having thus traced an outline of the gradual progress of early discovery in this
                    archipelago, it seems unnecessary to proceed with an enumeration of the
                    subsequent voyages performed by private individuals. These were undertaken
                    merely for commercial purposes: the accounts brought home by the adventurers
                    were generally imperfect and incorrect, and rather tended to excite than to
                    gratify the curiosity of those who might be desirous of obtaining more accurate
                    and more ample information. We shall therefore now turn to the conduct of those
                    expeditions which were fitted out by the state for the express purpose of
                    discovery.</p>
                <p>In the year 1768 Captain Krenitzin and Lieutenant Levashef sailed from the mouth
                    of the Kamtschatka River by order of the empress Catharine, to examine the chain
                    of Aleutian Islands. This commission theyaccordinglyexe-cuted very carefully,
                    having surveyed the whole of this archipelago, from Behring’s Island to the
                    promontory of Alaska; and, after spending thewinter among the FoxIslands, they
                    returned to Kamtschatka in the autumn of 1769.</p>
                <p>But our great navigator Captain Cook communicated more accurate scientific
                    information respecting these islands, as well as the coasts of the two
                    continents, than all the previous voyages of the Russian discoverers had
                    afforded. During his third and last voyage, in the year 1778, he surveyed the
                    eastern portion of this archipelago, accurately determined the positions of some
                    of the most, remarkable islands, and corrected many errors of former
                    navigators.</p>
                <p>In the year 1785 a fresh expedition was set on foot by the Russian government,
                    the command of which was intrusted to Captain Billings, an English naval officer
                    in the Russian service, who had accompanied Captain Cook in his last celebrated
                    voyage to the Pacific Ocean. This expedition appears to have been suggested by
                    Mr Coxe, who was at that time at St Petersburg, and whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Account of the Russian Discoveries between Asia and America</hi> had already
                    attracted the attention of the Russian government. During this voyage, which was
                    not completed until the year 1796, Captains Billings and Sarytschef explored the
                    whole chain of the Aleutian Islands, particularly that part of it which had been
                    visited by Captain Cook, and some parts of the adjacent western coast of
                    America. Ample details of the conduct of this expedition have been published in
                    the narratives of Martin Sauer, who officiated as secretary to Captain Billings,
                    and of Admiral Sarytschef.</p>
                <p>Some years after the termination of the expedition under Captain Billings, the
                    attention of the Russian American Company was turned towards the best means of
                    supplying their settlements on the north-west coast of Arne-rica<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193035061" xml:id="kp-eb0702-5061-0404"/> with provisions and stores
                    of all kinds; and it was resolved to try whether the conveyance by sea would not
                    answer the purpose better than the long and tedious journey by land to Ochotsk.
                    With the view of ascertaining the practicability of the project, Captain
                    Krusenstern, an experienced Russian naval officer, who had served for a long
                    period in the British navy, suggested the plan of an expedition from Cronstadt,
                    round Cape Horn, to the Aleutian Islands and the north-west coast of America.
                    This plan was approved of by Count Romanzof, the minister of commerce, and
                    Admiral Mordwinof, minister of the marine, and obtained the sanction of his
                    Imperial Majesty. Two vessels, called by the Russians the Nadeslida and the
                    Neva, were accordingly purchased in London for the voyage. The command of the
                    expedition was intrusted to Captain Krusenstern, the original author of the
                    plan, and Captain Lisiansky was appointed to the Neva. These two vessels
                    accordingly sailed in company from Cronstadt, in the month of August 1803, and,
                    after a short stay at Falmouth, proceeded to the Brazils, from whence they
                    sailed round Cape Horn to the Sandwich Islands. Here they separated, the
                    Nadeshda being ordered on a distinct mission to Japan and China, while Captain
                    Lisiansky, in the Neva, proceeded to Kadyak and the American settlements. Of
                    this voyage very full and interesting accounts have been lately published by
                    Captains Krusenstern and Lisiansky, and by Dr Langsdorff, who accompanied the
                    expedition in the quality of physician.</p>
                <p>From the ample sources of information to which we have alluded in the foregoing
                    narrative, we shall now proceed to exhibit an enumeration and general
                    description of the islands composing this singular chain, which appears to be a
                    prolongation of either continent. We shall begin with the more westerly part of
                    the chain, consisting of those islands which lie nearest to Kamtschatka, and
                    proceed eastwards to the American promontory. The first is Commodore or
                    Behring’s Island, situate, according to Cook’s reckoning, in 55° of latitude and
                    6° of longitude from the harbour of Petropaulowska in the bay of Awat-ska. It is
                    from 70 to 80 versts long, and stretches from north-west to south-east. Ten
                    leagues from the south-east point of this island, in the direction of east by
                    south, or east-south-east, lies Mednoi Ostroff, or Copper Island, so called from
                    large masses of native copper being found upon the beach. To the south-east of
                    Copper Island lie three small islands, Attak or Attoo, Semitshi, and Agattoo,
                    called by the Russians <hi rend="italic">Plishme Ostrova,</hi> or the nearest
                    Aleutian Islands. Of these Attak is the largest; it is nearly of the same shape
                    as Behring’s Island, but rather more extensive, stretching from west to east to
                    the length of 18 leagues. These islands are situated between 54° and 55° of
                    north latitude. Attak has two harbours, one of which lies on the southern coast.
                    From the eastern extremity of the Aleutian Islands properly so called, another
                    group runs south-eastward, continuing the chain as far as the western extremity
                    of the Fox Islands. These are called the Andreanofskie Islands; but we have less
                    accurate information respecting this central part of the chain than regarding
                    the eastern and western groups. They are said to lie within the 52d and 54th
                    degrees of north latitude, to be of inconsiderable extent or importance, and
                    therefore seldom visited by recent navigators. The most remarkable are,
                    Takavangha, which has in its centre, near the northern coast, a burning
                    mountain; Kanaghi or Kanaga, likewise with a high smoking mountain; Ayag, which
                    has a number of good bays and anchoring-places; and Tshetchina, on which a high
                    white mountain overtops the rest, which apparently is an extinct volcano, as
                    there are still hot springs on this island. At-shak or Atchka, and Amlac, are
                    also usually reckoned among the number of the Andrenovian Isles. The former
                    greatly resembles Copper Island, and is provided with a commodious harbour.</p>
                <p>By far the most important and best explored portion of this archipelago is the
                    most easterly group, called by die Russians <hi rend="italic">Lyssie
                    Ostrova,</hi> or the Fox Islands. Of these islands the most considerable are,
                    Umnak, Unalashka or Oonalashka, and Unimak, the last of which is separated by a
                    narrow strait from the promontory of Alaska. Beyond these, to the north-east,
                    lies the large island of Kadyak or Kodiak, which is generally included among the
                    group called Schumagin’s Islands.</p>
                <p>The whole of the islands composing this chain are bare and mountainous; their
                    coasts are rocky and surrounded by breakers, which renders the navigation of
                    those seas exceedingly dangerous. The land rises immediately from the coasts to
                    steep bald mountains, gradually ascending higher behind each other, and assuming
                    the appearance of chains of mountains, with a direction lengthwise of the
                    island. Springs take their rise at the bottom of the mountains, and either flow
                    in broad and rapid streams into the neighbouring sea, or, collecting in the
                    rocky vales and glens, form ample lakes, which send off their superfluous waters
                    by natural canals into the adjacent bays. These islands bear evident marks of
                    volcanic formation, and several of them have still active volcanoes, which
                    continually emit smoke, and sometimes flames. No traces of metals have been
                    discovered on these islands, but cameoles and sardonyxes are brought from
                    thence. Their soil is said to be similar to that of Kamtschatka, and affords the
                    same kinds of edible wild berries and roots, excepting some few vegetables which
                    seem to be of foreign origin. No wood of any considerable growth has been
                    perceived upon any of these islands, except a very small quantity on Unalash-ka.
                    The land animals are bears, wolves, river-otters, river-beavers, and ermines.
                    The sea-otter, so valuable on account of its skin, is frequently caught; but the
                    number of these animals, it is believed, is much diminished of late. On the Fox
                    Islands they have a great variety of foxes, black, grey, red, and brown. The sea
                    abounds with all sorts of seals, dolphins, and whales; sea-lions and porpoises
                    are rare, and sea-cows not at all to be seen. Salmon are caught in great
                    abundance and variety, and halibut of an immense size are frequently taken. The
                    winter upon these islands is tolerably mild, but the summer is equally short and
                    unpleasant. The inhabitants are pretty numerous, and tributary to Russia, from
                    whence vessels are sent out, and establishments formed upon these islands, on
                    account of the very profitable chace of sea-otters and foxes.</p>
                <p>Unalashka, one of the largest of the Fox Islands, was visited by Captain Cook
                    during his last voyage, and seems to merit particular notice. This island
                    stretches from north-east to south-west, and is from 70 to 80 versts in length,
                    but of very unequal breadth. On the north and north-east sides there are many
                    bays and creeks, in some of which are very secure harbours for vessels. A part
                    of the south-west shore consists of very high, steep, inaccessible cliffs, and
                    another part has remained hitherto wholly unexplored. The whole island consists
                    of a mass of rocks, covered only with a very thin coat of earth; the hills are
                    of very unequal height, and are intersected by irregular valleys, the soil of
                    which is commonly argillaceous, or an earth which appears washed down from the
                    hills. In the lower valleys there is great abundance of grass, which would
                    furnish very good food for cattle; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035074"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-5074-0405"/>indeed, Captain Cook was of opinion that cattle
                    might subsist at Unalashka all the year round, without being housed; and the
                    soil, in many places, appeared capable of producing grain, roots, and
                    vegetables. But the Russian traders and the natives seem satisfied with what
                    nature brings forth. No wood grows on this and the neighbouring islands; only
                    low bushes, and shrubs of dwarf birch, willow, and alder. For all the timber
                    used for the purposes of building, &amp;c. they are indebted to the sea, which
                    wafts it to their shores from the adjacent continent of America. The inhabitants
                    are rather low in stature, but plump and well-shaped, with short necks, swarthy
                    chubby faces, black eyes, small beards, and long, straight, black hair, which
                    the men wear loose behind and cut before,'but the women tie up in a bunch. With
                    regard to their character, Captain Cook describes them as, to all appearance,
                    the most inoffensive people he ever met with, and perfect patterns of honesty.
                    But according to the accounts of the first discoverers, this does not seem to
                    have been their original disposition; and recent travellers have observed, that
                    although generally kind-hearted and peaceable, yet, when roused to anger, they
                    become exceedingly malevolent, and indifferent to all danger, even to death
                    itself. The clothing of the men and women is nearly the same, and consists of a
                    sort of frock or shirt, called <hi rend="italic">parka,</hi> fastened round the
                    neck with a broad stiff collar, and descending below the knee. These garments
                    are made of the skins of seals, prepared in a manner peculiar to themselves, and
                    sewed together very ingeniously. Though simple in their form, they are
                    ornamented in a variety of ways,—with glass beads, beaks of sea-parrots, long
                    white goats’ hair brought from Siberia, or small red feathers. Over the frock
                    the men sometimes wear a <hi rend="italic">kandeika</hi> or rain-garment. This
                    is made of gut, which is water-proof, and has a hood to it, which draws over the
                    head, and is tied under the chin. When on shore, the men wear boots made of
                    seal-skin; and they all have a kind of oval-snouted cap, made of wood, with a
                    rim to admit the head. These caps are dyed with green and other colours, and are
                    very fancifully ornamented with ivory figures, carved from the teeth of the
                    sea-cow, with glass or amber beads, and with the bristles from the beard of the
                    sea-lion. They make use of no paint: tatooing was formerly very much in use
                    among them, particularly among the women; but their intercourse with the
                    Russians has rather brought this practice into disrepute. Both men and women,
                    particularly the latter, bore the under lip, and insert pieces of bone or other
                    ornaments; but this practice has also decreased of late. The women, for the most
                    part, go barefooted: they wear bracelets of glass beads just above the wrists
                    and ankle-joints, and are very fond of rings upon their fingers. The principal
                    food of these islanders consists of fish, sea-animals, birds, roots, and
                    berries. They dry large quantities of fish in summer, which they lay up in small
                    huts for winter use; and roots and berries are also preserved for the same time
                    of scarcity. Among the fish, the most common and most abundant are several sorts
                    of salmon, cod, herrings, and halibut. The last is the most esteemed, and is
                    sometimes caught of an enormous size. The fat of the whale is also a favourite
                    species of food; when it grows old and rancid, it serves to light and warm their
                    houses. They eat almost every thing raw; but of late they have learnt some
                    simple modes of cookery from the Russians. Vegetable food does not appear to be
                    held in much esteem by the Unalashkans. The sweet plant, the Siberian parsnip
                    <hi rend="italic">{Heracleum Sibericum),</hi> is but little eaten, any more than
                    the bulb of the <hi rend="italic">Sarannα,</hi> or Kamtschadale lily. Berries of
                    an eatable quality abound, such as bramble-berries, cran-berries,
                    hurtle-berries, heath∙,berries, and several others. Of late the Russians have
                    begun to plant potatoes, which succeed extremely well, and are much liked by the
                    people. The habitations of the Unalashkans are holes dug in the earth, covered
                    with a wooden roof, over which they throw grass and earth; so that a village has
                    the appearance of a European church-yard full of graves. The entrance into these
                    huts is from the roof; some of the largest, however, which are inhabited by the
                    Russians, have a low door in the side. The light is also admitted by the roof,
                    through an opening or window covered over with seals’ entrails, or dried
                    fish-skin. Several divisions are made within, by means of seal-skins or
                    straw-mats, which separate the apartments of the different families that occupy
                    the habitation. Their household furniture consists of bowls, spoons, buckets,
                    piggins or cans, matted baskets, and perhaps a Russian kettle or pot. The knife,
                    and the hatchet, or rather a small flat piece of iron, made like an adze by
                    fitting it into a crooked wooden handle, are the only iron tools found amongst
                    them. Yet all their instruments and utensils are made with the greatest neatness
                    and the most exact symmetry. The needles with which they sew their clothes and
                    embroider are made of the wing-bone of the gull, with a very nice cut round the
                    thicker end instead of an eye, to which they tie the thread so skilfully, that
                    it follows the needle without any obstruction. Their thread is made of the
                    sinews of the seal, the fibres of which they split to the thickness which each
                    sort of work requires. All sewing is performed by the women: they are the
                    tailors, shoemakers, and boat-builders or boat-coverers. At their leisure hours,
                    particularly in long winter evenings, they make fine mats, little baskets, and
                    pocket-books of straw, that are both beautiful and strong. Indeed, Captain Cook
                    observes, there is a neatness and perfection in most of their work, that shows
                    they neither want ingenuity nor perseverance. Their houses have no fire-place,
                    but are heated as well as lighted by lamps. These are made of a flat stone,
                    hollowed on one side like a plate: in the hollow part they put the oil, mixed
                    with a little dry grass, which serves the purpose of a wick. They produce fire
                    both by collision and by attrition; the former by striking two stones one
                    against another, one of them being previously rubbed with brimstone. The latter
                    method is with two pieces of wood; one of which is a pointed stick, and the
                    other a flat piece. The pointed end of the stick they press upon the other,
                    whirling it nimbly round as a drill; thus producing fire in a few minutes.</p>
                <p>The principal occupations of the Aleutians are fishing and hunting, and preparing
                    the implements necessary for both. Their <hi rend="italic">baidars,
                    baidarkas,</hi> or boats, resemble the canoes of other savages. They consist of
                    a skeleton of wood, over which is stretched a leather covering made of
                    seal-skins. The boats of the Unalashkans are much superior in point of beauty to
                    those of any of the other islands: some of them appear so transparent that one
                    might trace the formation of the inside, and the manner in which the rower sits.
                    In their form they are long and narrow, and commonly hold only one person;
                    sometimes they are made to hold two, and very rarely three; each person sitting
                    in a round hole just fitted to the size of the body. The whole canoe is so
                    extremely light, even when sodden with water, that it may be carried with ease
                    in one hand. They are impelled by means of double paddles, seven or eight feet
                    long, which are managed with great dexterity. Experienced navigators will
                    sometimes venture out a considerable way to sea in these boats, even in very
                    stormy weather. The darts, or javelins, with which they kill their game, are
                    formed with the same neatness as their other instruments, and adapted with the
                    greatest judgment <pb break="no" facs="nls:193035087"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-5087-0406"/>to the different objects of the chase. For land
                    animals, a single barbed point; for birds, three points of light bone, spread
                    and barbed; for seals, &amp;c. they use a false point, inserted in a socket at
                    the end of the dart, which parts on the least effort of the animal to dive,
                    remaining in its body. A string of considerable length is fastened to this
                    barbed point, and twisted round the wooden part of the javelin. This serves as a
                    float to direct them to the seal, which having the stick to drag after it, soon
                    tires, and becomes an easy prey. These darts are not shot from a bow, but slung
                    from a small plank, about 18 inches long and two inches broad. In order that the
                    weapon may be held the faster, they have a sort of handle at the lower end, and
                    an opening through which the fore-finger is thrust. At the other end is a small
                    channel, into which the javelin fits, with a little knob which serves to retain
                    it. When the javelin is to be thrown, the plank is held horizontally, and the
                    aim being taken, the weapon is directed by the middle finger and thumb. This is
                    done with so much dexterity, and the motion given to it is so powerful and so
                    rapid, that the object aimed at is rarely missed; even whales are killed without
                    any other weapon.</p>
                <p>Their favourite amusement appears to be dancing, in which, however, they do not
                    seem to exhibit any particular exertion of strength or expression of elegance,
                    the only motion being a sort of hop, the performer scarcely moving from the
                    place he first takes up. Their music is exceedingly rude, consisting of a small
                    drum or tambour, and a rattle made of the bladder of a sea-dog, filled with peas
                    or small pebbles. In their leisure hours they amuse themselves with making these
                    little drums and rattles, which are frequently ornamented with a good deal of
                    ingenuity and elegance; and with cutting out from the teeth of the sea-cow small
                    figures of men, fish, sea-otters, and other objects, in a manner that appears
                    very extraordinary, considering that the sea-cow’s teeth are much harder than
                    ivory, and that they have no proper tools to work with.</p>
                <p>The religion of these islanders, like that of most uncivilized nations, consists
                    in superstitious observances and a belief in charms. Many of them have been
                    baptized, and are nominally professors of the Greek faith; of which, however,
                    they understand nothing more than making the sign of the cross. They have no
                    marriage ceremony: every man may have as many wives as he can conveniently
                    maintain: if his means decrease, he sends first one, then another, back to their
                    parents; and these women become perfectly at liberty to look out for other
                    husbands. Sometimes the same woman lives with two husbands; and it is not
                    uncommon for men to sell or exchange wives. Boys, if they happen to be very
                    handsome, are often brought up entirely in the manner of girls, instructed in
                    the arts of female blandishment, and used as concubines. This shocking,
                    unnatural, and immoral practice has prevailed here even from the remotest times.
                    Such men are known under the name of <hi rend="italic">scliopans.</hi> The
                    bodies of the dead, especially of the men, were formerly interred in places set
                    apart for the purpose, and with particular ceremonies. Their best javelins and
                    clothes, with a portion of trainoil and other articles of food, were laid with
                    them in the grave; and sometimes even slaves of both sexes were slaughtered upon
                    the occasion. These customs are now, however, entirely laid aside.</p>
                <p>The population of Unalashka and the neighbouring islands appears to have been
                    considerable, amounting to several thousands. In 1790 Sarytcheff reckoned it at
                    1300. According to the most recent accounts, it does not appear to amount to
                    more than 300. This rapid depopulation is ascribed partly to the practice of
                    sending the best hunters from hence to a distance, to chace the large
                    sea-otters, few of whom ever return to their families; and partly to the state
                    of oppression under which the natives live, and the change which has taken place
                    in their modes of living. Captain Cook seems to consider the natives of these
                    islands as originally of the same extraction with the Greenlanders and
                    Esquimaux. When first discovered by the Russians they were under the government
                    of <hi rend="italic">Toigons,</hi> or chiefs, who, however, possessed little
                    superior distinction or dignity, and had no revenue. At present they are all
                    subject to the government of the Russian settlers.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole of the Aleutian Islands, on the island of Kadyak, and the
                    western coast of America, the Russians have formed settlements, for the purpose
                    of hunting and collecting furs, with which they carry on a lucrative commerce,
                    particularly with the Chinese. The most valuable fur is that of the sea-otter;
                    an animal which has now become rare on these islands, in consequence of the
                    extreme eagerness with which they have been hunted and killed. Besides the
                    sea-otter, there are numbers of foxes, especially on the Fox Islands. The black
                    foxes found on these islands are not so valuable as those of Siberia. The
                    Arctic, or ice fox, called also the rock fox, and the blue fox, from the natural
                    colour of the fur, which is of a bluish grey, is very common. From the first
                    discovery of these islands by Behring and Tscherikoff, in 1741, the fur-trade
                    was carried on for a long period entirely by private adventurers, and appears to
                    have been productive of great abuses. The natives were frequently treated in the
                    most cruel and barbarous manner; and the keenness displayed by these rapacious
                    hunters threatened to extirpate the race of animals upon which the trade
                    depended. Convinced of the extreme necessity of putting a stop to this
                    destructive plan of proceeding, Schelikoff, an intelligent Russian merchant,
                    took considerable pains to unite the different partakers of this trade into a
                    company, in order that it might be conducted with prudence and precaution, npon
                    some plan that might prove advantageous to all parties. In 1785 he succeeded in
                    joining company with the Golikoffs. They increased their capital, and fitted out
                    several ships, which the enterprising Sche-likoff commanded in person.
                    Factories, protected by forts, were established in almost all the Aleutian
                    Islands, as far eastward as Kadyak; and during several years they continued this
                    lucrative trade in conjunction, by which they acquired considerable wealth. The
                    success of this connection induced several merchants to unite like Schelikoff
                    and the Golikoffs; and in this manner was laid the foundation of the present <hi
                    rend="italic">Russian American Company.</hi> The irregular manner, however, in
                    which the trade was still carried on, and the cruelty which was frequently
                    exercised by the Russian merchants towards the natives of the islands, drew upon
                    them great and well-founded censure; insomuch that the emperor Paul determined
                    to put an end to the company and the trade at the same time. This determination
                    would have infallibly been carried into effect, but for the interference of Μ.
                    von Resanoff, who had married Schelikoff’s daughter, and was personally
                    interested in the successful continuance of the American Company. In consequence
                    of his active interposition, the new-established company was formally confirmed
                    in 1799, with considerable privileges.</p>
