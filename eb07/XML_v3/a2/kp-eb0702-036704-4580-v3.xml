                    the former representing the superior and finer part of the atmosphere, and the
                    latter the inferior and grosser part. The augurs also drew presages from the
                    clouds, thunder, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Air,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Painting,</hi> &amp;c.
                    denotes the manner and very life of action; or it is that which expresses the
                    disposition of die agent. It is sometimes also used in a synonymous sense with
                    gesture or attitude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Air,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Music,</hi> is taken in
                    different senses. It is sometimes contrasted with harmony, and in this sense it
                    is synonymous with melody in general.—Its proper meaning is, a tune, which is
                    set to words, or to short pieces of poetry, that are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >songs.</hi></p>
                <p>In operas we give the name of <hi rend="italic">air</hi> to such pieces of music
                    as are formed with measures and cadences to distinguish it from the recitative;
                    and, in general, every piece of music is called an <hi rend="italic">air</hi>
                    which is formed for the voice, or even for instruments, and adapted to stanzas,
                    whether it forms a whole in itself, or whether it can be detached from any whole
                    of which it forms a part, and be executed alone. *</p>
                <p>If the subject admits of harmony, and is set in parts, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >air</hi> is, according to their number, denominated a <hi rend="italic"
                    >duet,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">trio,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">quartetto,</hi>
                    &amp;c. We need not follow Rousseau and the other philologists in their
                    endeavours to investigate the etymon of the word <hi rend="italic">air.</hi> Its
                    derivation, though found and ascertained, would contribute little to illustrate
                    its meaning in that remote sense to which, through a long continuance of time,
                    and the various vicissitudes of language, it has now passed. The curious may
                    consult the same article in the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire de Musique</hi>
                    by Μ. Rousseau.</p>
                <p>In modern music, there are several different kinds of <hi rend="italic"
                    >airs,</hi> each of which agrees to a certain kind of dancing; and from these
                    dances the airs themselves take their specific names.</p>
                <p>The words to which <hi rend="italic">airs</hi> are adapted are not always
                    rehearsed in regular succession, nor spoken in the same manner with those of the
                    recitative; and though in general they are very short, yet they are interrupted,
                    repeated, transposed, at the pleasure of the artist. They do not constitute a
                    narrative, which once told is over; they either delineate a picture which it is
                    necessary to contemplate in different points of view, or inspire a sentiment in
                    which the heart acquiesces with pleasure, and from which it is neither able nor
                    willing to be disengaged; and the different phrases of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >air</hi> are nothing else than different manners of beholding the same image.
                    This is the reason why the subject of an <hi rend="italic">air</hi> should be
                    one. It is by these repetitions properly placed, it is by these redoubled
                    efforts, that an impression, which at first was not able to move you, at length
                    shakes your soul, agitates you, transports you out of yourself; and it is
                    likewise upon the same principle that the runnings, as they are called, or those
                    long, mazy, and inarticulated inflections of the voice, in pathetic <hi
                    rend="italic">airs,</hi> frequently seem, though they are not always so,
                    improperly placed; for whilst the heart is affected with a sentiment exquisitely
                    moving, it often expresses its emotions by inarticulate sounds, more strongly
                    and sensibly than it could do by words themselves.</p>
                <p>The form of <hi rend="italic">airs</hi> is of two kinds. The small airs are often
                    composed of two strains, which ought each of them to be sung twice; but the
                    important airs in operas are frequently in the form of rondeaus.</p>

                    several bags or bladders, composed of the same materials, communicating with
                    each other. These are filled with air through a leather tube having a brass
                    stop-cock accurately ground at the extremity, by which means the air blown in
                    through the tube is confined in the bladders. The jacket must be wet before the
                    air be blown into the bags, as otherwise it will immediately escape through the
                    pores of the leather. By the help of these bladders, which are placed near the
                    breast, the person is supported in the water, without making the efforts used in
                    swimming.</p>

                    which occur, when adits are wrought 30 or 40 fathoms long, make it necessary to
                    let down air-shafts, in order to give the air liberty to play through the whole
                    work, and thus discharge bad vapours, and furnish good air for respiration: the
                    expense of which shafts, in regard of their vast depths, hardness of the rock,
                    drawing of water, &amp;c. sometimes equals, nay exceeds, the ordinary charge of

                <p>These threads are the work of spiders, especially of that species called the

                    darts from its tail several of these threads, till one is produced capable of
                    supporting the creature in the air. On this it mounts in quest of prey, and
                    frequently rises to a very considerable height.</p>

                    and other places, where a great number of people are crowded together in a small
                    space. It consists only of a long square trunk open at both ends, one of which
                    is inserted into the ceiling of the room, the air of which is required to be
                    kept pure, and the other extends a good way beyond the roof. Through this trunk
                    a continued circulation is carried on; and the reason is, that the putrid
                    effluvia which do so much mischief when collected, being much lighter than the
                    pure atmosphere, arise to the top of the room, and, if they there find a vent,
                    will continually go out through it. These effluvia arise in very considerable
                    quantity, being calculated by Dr Keil at no less than 39 ounces from one man in
                    24 hours.</p>
