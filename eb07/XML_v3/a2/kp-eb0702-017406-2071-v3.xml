                    Theodore</hi></label>, eminent in the mathematics, and in natural philosophy,
                    was born at Rostock in Lower Saxony in 1724, and died at Dorpt in Livonia in
                    1802. We regret that our means of information do not enable us to communicate
                    any particulars in regard to his personal history; but we shall give some
                    account of his contributions to science; and these, after all, form the most
                    interesting memorials of a philosopher’s life.</p>
                <p>The work by which he is best known is entitled <hi rend="italic">Tentamen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Theoriae Electricitatis</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Magnetismi,</hi> published at Petersburg in 1759. It appeared
                    under the sanction of the Imperial Academy, to which the theory had been in part
                    communicated; and it is said on the title-page to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >Instar</hi><hi rend="italic">Supplementi</hi><hi rend="italic">Comment. Acad.
                    Petropolitanae.</hi> The work indeed merited this distinction, as being the
                    first systematic and successful attempt to apply mathematical reasoning to the
                    subjects of electricity and magnetism. Already the theory of Franklin with
                    regard to the former was very generally received, and was supposed to afford a
                    satisfactory explanation of the phenomena. But though it seemed sufficient for
                    this purpose in the common and somewhat loose manner in which the matter had
                    hitherto been treated, it was not certain that the same would hold when the
                    conclusions were accurately and mathematically deduced. To apply this test was
                    what Aepinus undertook, and what he has executed in a manner very satisfactory
                    and complete. He has treated very fully, and perhaps has nearly exhausted, what
                    may be called the <hi rend="italic">statics</hi> of electricity and magnetism,
                    or the equilibrium of their forces. A great field yet remains, where the motion
                    of the electric fluid is to be considered, and its distribution over the
                    surfaces of bodies of a given figure; where greater difficulties are to be
                    encountered, and where the latest improvements of the integral calculus in the
                    hands of Laplace and Poisson have begun to be applied. The investigations of
                    Aepinus in their own department led to very satisfactory results, and the exact
                    agreement between them and the phenomena actually exhibited was extensively
                    observed. Notwithstanding this agreement, we cannot consider the theory of
                    positive and negative electricity as being yet sufficiently established. Though
                    the assumption on which it is founded appear very simple at first, it is found
                    more complex on a nearer inspection. The assumption is, that a fluid resides in
                    the surfaces of all the bodies termed electrics, which is highly elastic, and
                    strongly attracted, at the same time, by the particles of the body; and that
                    while this fluid remains equally diffused over the surface of the body, no
                    phenomenon whatever gives any information of its existence. By certain
                    mechanical operations, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193032084"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-2084-0175"/>however, the equilibrium of this fluid maybe
                    destroyed; the fluid may be accumulated at one end, or on one side of a body,
                    and entirely withdrawn from the opposite. It is when an electric is brought into
                    this state that it exhibits the phenomena of electricity, between which and the
                    calculus instituted on the suppositions just laid down, Aepinus has everywhere
                    remarked the most exact agreement. One great difficulty, however, still remains:
                    the negative ends of two electrified bodies repel one another justas much as the
                    ends which are reckoned positive. But such an effect cannot result from the mere
                    absence of a substance: when the electric fluid is withdrawn, if repulsion still
                    continue, it must arise from the mutual action of the particles of the body
                    itself. Thus it would appear, that, in the absence of the electric fluid, the
                    tendency of the particles of matter is to repel one another. This is an
                    essential part of the theory; and it is not accurate to say, that the doctrine
                    of Franklin or Aepinus supposes no more than the existence of an elastic fluid
                    diffused over the surfaces, and strongly attracted by the particles, of bodies.
                    It supposes, besides, that those particles, in the absence of this fluid,
                    mutually repel one another. This not only takes away from the simplicity of the
                    hypothesis, but it is obviously a very unnatural, not to say a contradictory
                    supposition; because, when the electric matter is removed, how comes it to pass
                    that the particles of the body, notwithstanding their mutual repulsion, still
                    cohere together as firmly as before? This difficulty is acknowledged by Aepinus
                    himself; but it would seem that the theory had taken a strong hold of his mind
                    before he was aware of this consequence from it, so that he became by degrees
                    reconciled to a supposition which appeared to him at first not a little
                    incongruous. This must not surprise us: it is not always that, even among
                    philosophers, we meet with the candour, or perhaps we should say the courage,
                    with which Newton suspended his belief in his own great discovery, the principle
                    of universal gravity, as long as the erroneous opinion then existing about the
                    magnitude of the earth made the moon’s motion in her orbit appear inconsistent
                    with the descent of falling bodies.</p>
                <p>Another remark, made by Aepinus himself, involves in it a difficulty which should
                    have induced him to view his theory with considerable diffidence. Though he
                    considers the difference of the two electricities to be the same as between
                    excess and defect, or to consist in this, that the fluid which is deficient in
                    the one part is in excess in the other, he admits that no phenomenon points out
                    on which side the excess, or on which the defect lies. This is a strong
                    indication that the difference is not of the kind supposed. We are not left at a
                    loss to tell whether cold is the absence of a substance which we call heat, or
                    heat the absence of a substance which we call cold. If there were just as much
                    reason for asserting the one of these propositions as the other, one would
                    certainly be inclined to reject both. The same should be done with respect to
                    electricity and magnetism.</p>
                <p>The investigations of Aepinus, however, are by no means rendered useless, even if
                    the <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> theory of positive and negative electricity,
                    or of positive and negative magnetism, be exchanged for that of two elastic
                    fluids, each attracting the other, and both attracted by the particles of
                    bodies. Most of his investigations may be easily accommodated to this
                    supposition, and, therefore, they are, fortunately for themselves and for their
                    author, of a more permanent nature than the principles from which they were
                    deduced.</p>
                <p>It is to be added to this, that Aepinus was the first who saw the affinity
                    between electricity and magnetism in its full extent, and perceived the light
                    that these two mutually cast on one another. He instituted a regular series of
                    experiments on the nature of the tourmaline, on which he wrote a small treatise,
                    published in 1762. He is to be regarded also as the inventor of the condenser of
                    electricity, and of the electrophorus, of which he gave the complete theory.</p>
                <p>A very excellent view of the theory of Aepinus was published at Parts by Μ. Haiiy
                    in 1787, in 8vo. The same author has, however, adopted the theory of the two
                    fluids in his own treatise, <hi rend="italic">Leçons</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Physique.</hi> There is a remarkable coincidence between Aepinus’s work on
                    electricity and magnetism, and that of Mr Cavendish, given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1771, p. 584. The principles
                    from which they set out, and the conclusions at which they arrive, are in a
                    great measure the same. It appears, however, quite certain, that Mr Cavendish
                    knew nothing of the work of the Russian philosopher till his own was completed.
                    His mode of proceeding is more geometrical, and in some parts he has gone
                    farther.</p>
                <p>The researches of Aepinus were not confined to the subjects now mentioned, but
                    extended to most of the branches of natural philosophy. Beside the treatise on
                    the tourmaline, he published, in 1762, a work, in 4to, <hi rend="italic">On the
                    distribution of heat at the surface of the earth</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript">;</hi> a work which, though translated into French, has hardly, we
                    believe, made its way into this country, and of which we are therefore unable to
                    speak from our own knowledge. He is also the author of many valuable memoirs on
                    different subjects in pure mathematics, in astronomy, mechanics, optics,
                    meteorology, contained in the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 12th volumes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Novi</hi><hi rend="italic">Commentarii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Petro-politanae,</hi> and in the volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Berlin
                    Memoirs</hi> for 1755, 1756. In a memoir contained in the last of these, is the
                    first account of his experiments on the tourmaline, which were conducted with
                    great accuracy and judgment, and do honour to the author as a man of a sound and
                    philosophical understanding, well instructed in the true principles of inductive
                    investigation. Indeed, notwithstanding the objections we have made to his
                    theories of electricity and magnetism, we must acknowledge that this is the
                    general impression produced by the perusal of his works. He appears to have been
                    well acquainted with practical astronomy, and sometimes to have had the charge
                    of the imperial observatory. He made improvements on the micrometer and the
                    reticulum, and wrote a memoir on the effects of parallax in the transit of a
                    planet over the sun; a difficult subject, and one rendered at that time (1764)
                    peculiarly interesting, on account of the transit of Venus which was just past,
                    and that which was soon expected. <hi rend="italic">(Novi Com. Pet.</hi> tom. x.
                    p. 433.) In the same volume he has a memoir on the subject of <hi rend="italic"
                    >accidental colours,</hi> which at that time had hardly been treated of by any
                    author but Buffon; and another on the affinity between electricity and
                    magnetism. In the 12th volume he notices, we believe for the first time, the
                    electric property of the Brazilian emerald. He was not aware that this emerald
                    is in reality the green tourmaline <hi rend="italic">(Brogniart,</hi> tom. i. p.
                    418.); a variety of that mineral on which he had already exercised his ingenuity
                    with so much success.</p>
                <p>It is rare, in an advanced state of science, to have the satisfaction of making a
                    new discovery with regard to a subject quite elementary, and one that has been
                    long a subject of attention. This, however, happened to Aepinus with respect to
                    the <hi rend="italic">lever,</hi> and to the simplest kind of lever—that which
                    has equal arms; of which he has demonstrated a new property, in the 8th volume
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> above referred to. It is this :—If a
                    lever with equal arms be acted on at its opposite ends by forces in a given
                    ratio to one another, and having their directions parallel to straight lines
                    given in position; and if these <pb break="no" facs="nls:193032097"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-2097-0176"/>forces be resolved each into two, one at right
                    angles to the lever, and the other in the direction of it; in the ease of
                    equilibrium, the sum of the two forces, having the same direction with the
                    lever, will be the <hi rend="italic">greatest possible.</hi> This theorem,
                    remarkable for its simplicity, and for illustrating the connection between the
                    equilibrium of bodies, and certain problems concerning the maxima or minima of
                    variable quantities, occurred when he was pursuing some of his inquiries
                    concerning magnetism. He seems not to have been very fortunate, however, in his
                    investigation, which is more complex than is necessary, as the proposition
                    admits of a geometrical demonstration remarkable for its simplicity. <hi
