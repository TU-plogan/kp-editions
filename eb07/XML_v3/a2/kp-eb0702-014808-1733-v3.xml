                <p><label type="entry">ADELUNG, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Christopher</hi></label>,
                    a very eminent German grammarian, philologer, and general scholar, was born at
                    Spantekow in Pomerania, on the 30th of August 1734. He acquired his elementary
                    instruction at the public school of Ahclam, and that of Closterbergen, near
                    Magdeburg, and completed his academical education at the university of Halle. In
                    the year 1759 he was appointed professor at the gymnasium of Erfurt, but
                    relinquished this situation two years after, and went to reside in a private
                    capacity at Leipsic, where he continued to devote himself for a long period to
                    the cultivation of letters, and particularly to those extensive and laborious
                    philological researches which proved so useful to the language and literature of
                    his native country. In 1787 he received the appointment of principal librarian
                    to the elector of Saxony at Dresden, with the honorary title of Aulic
                    Counsellor. Here he continued to reside during the remainder of his useful life,
                    discharging with diligence and integrity the duties of his situation, and
                    prosecuting his laborious studies to the last with indefatigable industry and
                    unabated zeal. He died at Dresden on the 10th of September 1806, at the age of
                    72.</p>
                <p>The life of a mere scholar is generally destitute of interest; and that of
                    Adelung, which was spent entirely in literary seclusion, presents no variety of
                    incident to the pen of the biographer. Of his private character and habits few
                    memorials have been preserved; but in these few he is represented as a man of an
                    amiable disposition. He was never married. His constitution, which was
                    remarkably robust, rendered him capable of the most intense and unremitted
                    application to study, insomuch that, down to the period of his death, he is said
                    to have devoted fourteen hours of every day to literary labour. He was a lover
                    of good cheer, and spared neither pains nor expense in procuring a variety of
                    foreign wines, of which his cellar, which he facetiously denominated his <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliotheca Selectis-sima,</hi> is said to have contained no less
                    than forty different kinds. His manners were easy and affable, and the habitual
                    cheerfulness of his disposition rendered his society most acceptable to a
                    numerous circle of friends.</p>
                <p>The works of Adelung are very voluminous; and there is not one of these, perhaps,
                    which does not exhibit some proofs of the genius, industry, and erudition of the
                    author. But although his pen was usefully employed upon a variety of subjects in
                    different departments of literature and science, it is to his philological
                    labours that he is principally indebted for his great reputation; and no man
                    ever devoted himself with more zeal and assiduity, or with greater success, to
                    the improvement of his native language.</p>
                <p>In a country which is subdivided into so many distinct sovereign states,
                    possessing no common political centre, and no national institution whose
                    authority could command deference in matters of taste,—in a “country whose
                    indigenous literature was but of recent growth, and where the dialect of the
                    people was held in contempt at the several courts,—it was no easy task for a
                    single writer to undertake to fix the standard of a language which had branched
                    out into a variety of idioms, depending in a great measure upon principles
                    altogether arbitrary. Adelung effected as much in this respect as could well be
                    accomplished by the persevering labours of an individual. By means of his
                    excellent grammars, dictionary, and various works on German style, he
                    contributed greatly towards rectifying the orthography, refining the idiom, and
                    fixing the standard of his native tongue. Of all the different dialects, he gave
                    a decided preference to that of the margraviate of Misnia, in Upper Saxony, and
                    positively rejected every thing that was contrary to the phraseology in use
                    among the best society of that province, and in the writings of those authors
                    whom it had produced. In adopting this narrow principle, he is generally thought
                    to have been too fastidious. The dialect of Misnia was undoubtedly the richest,
                    as it was the earliest cultivated, of any in Germany; but Adelung probably went
                    too far in restraining the language within the limits of this single idiom, to
                    the exclusion of others, from which it might have, and really has, acquired
                    additional richness, flexibility, and force.</p>
                <p>His dictionary of the German language is generally allowed to be superior to our
                    English dictionary by Dr Johnson. It is eminently so in its etymologies; and is,
                    perhaps, upon the whole, the best work of the kind of which any nation can
                    boast. Indeed, the patient spirit of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193031746"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-1746-0149"/>investigation which Adelung possessed in so
                    remarkable a degree, together with his intimate knowledge of the ancient history
                    and progressive revolutions of the different dialects from which the modern
                    German is derived, rendered him peculiarly qualified for the successful
                    performance of the duties of a lexicorapher.</p>
                <p>It would greatly exceed our limits, and lead us into far too wide a field, were
                    we to attempt to present our readers with an analysis of the several productions
                    of this voluminous author; but we should do injustice to his memory, were we to
                    pass over in total silence his last very learned work, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Mithridates, or a General History of Languages, with the Lord’s
                    Prayer, as a specimen, in nearly five hundred languages and dialects.</hi> The
                    hint of this work appears to have been taken from a publication, with a similar
                    title, published by the celebrated Conrad Gesner in 1555; but the plan of
                    Adelung is much more extensive. Unfortunately, he did not live to finish what he
                    had undertaken; but the work has been continued with much ability by that
                    eminent philologer, Professor Vater, formerly of Halle, now of Königsberg. The
                    first volume, which contains the Asiatic languages, was published immediately
                    after the death of Adelung; the second, which comprehends the European dialects,
                    was published by Professor Vater in 1809; the first part of the third volume,
                    which is almost entirely the work of the last-mentioned scholar, appeared in
                    1812. This third and last volume is to contain the languages of Africa and
                    America, and will be enriched with some very valuable materials, communicated to
                    the editor by Baron de Humboldt.</p>
                <p>Many of the works of Adelung were published anonymously, but we believe the
                    following list will be found to be complete and correct.</p>

                    Berlin, vol. i. 1806; vol. ii. 1809; vol. iii. part i. 1812. This great work was
                    left by Adelung in an unfinished state; but, as already mentioned, it has been
                    continued by that able philologer Professor Vater of Königsberg, to whom the
                    public is indebted for an excellent Hebrew Grammar.</p>
                <p>It is observed by Madame de Stael, that the English are much better acquainted
                    than the French with the literature of Germany; but we have met with very few
                    possessed of any knowledge of the works of this learned and celebrated writer;
                    and, with the exception of one or two of his smaller essays, none of them, we
                    believe, has ever been translated into the language of this country. In the
                    above list there are more than one work which might probably be published with
                    advantage in the English tongue. (<hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi>.)</p>
