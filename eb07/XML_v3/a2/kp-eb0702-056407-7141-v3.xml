                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">ALSOP, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthony</hi></label>, an English
                    divine and poet, was educated at Westminster School, and from thence elected to
                    Christ Church, Oxford, where he took the degree of Μ. A. in March 1696, and of
                    B. D. in December 1706. On his coming to the university, he was very soon
                    distinguished by Dean Aldrich, and published <hi rend="italic">Fabularum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aesopicarum Delectus,</hi> Oxon. 1698, 8vo, with a poetical
                    dedication to Lord Viscount Scudamore, and a preface in which he took part
                    against Dr Bentley in the famous dispute with Mr Boyle. He passed through the
                    usual offices in his college to that of censor with considerable reputation, and
                    for some years had the principal noblemen and gentlemen belonging to the society
                    committed to his care. In this employment he continued till his merit
                    recommended him to Sir Jonathan Trelawney, bishop of Winchester, who appointed
                    him his chaplain, and soon after gave him a prebend in his own cathedral,
                    together with the rectory of Brightwell, in the county of Berks, which afforded
                    him ample provision for a learned retirement, from which he could not be drawn
                    by the repeated solicitations of those who thought him qualified for a more
                    public character and a higher station. In 1717 an action was brought against him
                    by Mrs Elizabeth Astrey of Oxford, for the breach of a marriage contract; and a
                    verdict was obtained against him for L.2000, which probably obliged him to leave
                    the kingdom for some time. His death, which happened on the 10th June 1726, was
                    occasioned by his falling into a ditch that led to his garden door. A quarto
                    volume was published in 1752, under the title of <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alsop,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vincent,</hi> an English
                    nonconformist divine, was born in Northamptonshire, and educated at St John’s
                    College, Cambridge, where he took the degree of master of arts. When he received
                    deacon’s orders, he went to Rutlandshire, and settled at Oakham, where he was an
                    assistant to the master of the free-school. As lie was a man of a sprightly
                    turn, he fell into indifferent company; but was reclaimed by the frequent
                    admonitions of the reverend Mr Benjamin King. He afterwards married that
                    gentleman’s daughter, and becoming a convert to his principles, received
                    ordination in the Presbyterian way, not being satisfied with that which he had
                    from the bishop. He was settled at Wilbee, in the county of Northampton, whence
                    he was ejected in 1662 for nonconformity. After this he ventured to preach
                    sometimes at Oakham, and at Wellingborough, where he lived, and was once six
                    months in prison for praying by a sick person. A book which he wrote against Dr
                    Sherlock, in a humorous style, made him well known to the world, and induced Mr
                    Cawton, an eminent nonconformist in Westminster, to recommend him to his
                    congregation for his successor. On receiving this call he quitted
                    Northamptonshire, and came to London, where he preached constantly, and wrote
                    several pieces which were extremely well received by the public. Living in the
                    neighbourhood of the court, he was exposed to many inconveniences; but these
                    ended with the reign of Charles ∏∙ or at least in the beginning of the next
                    reign, when Mr Alsop’s'son engaging in treasonable practices, was freely
                    pardoned by King James. After this our divine went frequently to court, and is
                    generally supposed to have been the person who drew up the Presbyterians’
                    address to that prince for his general indulgence. After the Revolution, Mr
                    Alsop gave public testimonies of his attachment to government; yet upon all
                    occasions he spoke very respectfully of King James, and retained a very high
                    sense of his <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037154" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7154-0565"
                    />clemency in sparing his only son. The remainder of his life he spent in the
                    exercise of his ministry, preaching once every Lord’s day; besides which he had
                    a Thursday lecture, and was one of the lecturers at Pinners Hall. He lived to a
                    great age, and, preserving his spirits to the last, died in May 1703. On grave
                    subjects he wrote with a becoming seriousness; but where wit might properly be
                    shown, he displayed it to great advantage. His funeral sermon was preached by Mr
                    Slater, and his memory will be always preserved by his own learned and elegant
                    writings. Of these the most remarkable, besides his sermons, are, 1. Antisozzo;
                    in vindication of some great truths opposed by Dr William Sherlock, 1675, 8vo;
                    2. Melius Inquirendum; in answer to Dr Goodman’s Compassionate Inquiry, 1679,
                    8vo; 3. The Mischief of Impositions; in answer to Dr Stillingfleet’s Mischief of
                    Separation, 1680; 4. A Faithful Reproof to a False Report, with reference to the
                    Differences among the United Ministers in London, 8vo.</p>
