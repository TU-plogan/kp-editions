                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">AMSTERDAM</label>, a city, formerly the capital of the seven
                    United Provinces, and though, since the formation of the kingdom of the
                    Netherlands, no longer the capital, is still <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038545"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8545-0672"/>by far the largest and most important place in
                    that kingdom. It is the chief of the arrondissement of the same name, the seat
                    of the commanders of the naval and military departments, and of the courts of
                    justice. It is built in the shape of a half-moon, the two horns of which
                    terminate in the river Y on the north side, while on the other sides it is
                    surrounded by meadows, gardens, and country houses. The river Amstett, which
                    supplies it with fresh water, in part runs through the city, and is distributed
                    into several branches which terminate in the Y. The ancient fortifications are
                    neglected, and some parts of them converted into public walks. .A great number
                    of canals, mostly navigable for small craft, form 90 islands, which are joined
                    by no less than 280 bridges, part of stone and part of wood. The borders of
                    these canals are commonly planted with trees, which, with the stagnant state of
                    much of the water, is thought to be prejudicial to health, and, among other
                    causes, produces a mortality greater in proportion to the number of inhabitants
                    than in any other city of Europe. The foundation of all the houses and public
                    buildings is formed by driving piles from 50 to 60 feet in length, through the
                    swampy ground, till they rest firmly on a solid bank of sand below the morass:
                    the upper ends of the piles are then sawed to a level height, and thick planks
                    are nailed to them, on which the masonry is constructed. This makes the
                    foundation the most expensive part of the edifice. The stadthouse, a most
                    ponderous mass of building, is said to have required for its foundation not less
                    than 11,000 of the piles above described. The buildings are, however, most
                    firmly connected together, insomuch that, though many of them have declined from
                    the perpendicular, they are still considered to be perfectly secured against
                    falling, though they are not secured against sinking, if the sand on which the
                    piles rest should give way, as was the case a few years ago, when a stack of
                    warehouses, heavily filled with corn, sunk and totally disappeared.</p>
                <p>The public buildings are neither numerous nor very much distinguished by their
                    beauty. The stadthouse, formerly the bank, under Buonaparte the imperial palace,
                    and now occasionally a royal residence, is a very large, lofty, heavy building,
                    but the interior was magnificently furnished with every thing new on the
                    occasion òſ a short visit made by Napoleon and his empress, when Holland was
                    united to France. The only other buildings worthy of notice are, the exchange,
                    the admiralty, the East India house and warehouses, the barracks, the new
                    Lutheran church, the old church, the new church, and the west church. The
                    private buildings are lofty, narrow, with large windows, and have cellars
                    beneath them, which are mostly occupied by the working classes as separate
                    tenements.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Amsterdam amount, by the latest accounts, to about 235,000; of
                    these about 48,000 are Catholics, 24,000 Jews, and the rest Protestants of
                    various sects, all of which are alike protected, but the greater part belong to
                    the Calvinistic communion. The commerce with all parts of the world is very
                    extensive, but said to be on the decline, owing to the more favourable
                    circumstances of the rival cities Antwerp, Rotterdam, and Hamburg. About 2500
                    vessels, great and small, enter and depart annually by the sea, and about 350 by
                    the rivers Rhine, Meuse, and the various canals. It is a great entrepôt for
                    corn, tobacco, wine, and the tropical productions both of the East and West
                    Indies. It is also a great theatre for money transactions in banking, in loans,
                    and in exchanges. The fisheries, especially that of whales, are still objects of
                    importance. No city in Europe, for its extent, possesses so large a portion of
                    disposable capital as</p>
                <p>Amsterdam, and hence, in spite of its unfavourable situation, it continues to be
                    a place of the first commercial importance. This has been manifested within the
                    last few years, by the great operation of constructing a canal,, which is
                    navigable for ships of the line from Amsterdam to the Helder.</p>
                <p>The manufactures here are very numerously produced. Cottons are made and printed
                    extensively. Woollen goods of various kinds, sugar, snuff, tobacco, silver wire,
                    gold and silver leaf, copperplate, iron-work, lead and pewter work, painters’
                    colours, hair pencils and painters’ brushes, sealing-wax, wafers, soap,
                    paper-hangings, porcelain, gin, and numerous other commodities. The cutting of
                    diamonds and other precious stones has long been extensively practised here.
                    Ship-building is an important branch of industry. The materials of iron, copper,
                    sailcloth, cordage, and the other requisites, are prepared in the city. The
                    theatres and other amusements are similar to those in other cities of the same
                    extent and opulence. The police is remarkably well regulated, and the· utmost
                    cleanliness is maintained both in the avenues, streets, and approaches. Owing to
                    the intense fogs in winter, ropes are fastened along the paths by the sides of
                    the canals, to prevent passengers from walking into them. There are some
                    literary societies, but they seem more adapted to encourage the fine arts than
                    either science or literature. Long. 4. 40. 6. E. Lat. 52. 22. 5. N. <hi

                    rend="italic">Tongataboo,</hi> is also the name of an island in the South Sea,
                    said to have been discovered by Tasman, a Dutch navigator. Its greatest extent
                    from east to west is about 21 miles, and from north to south about 13. It is
                    broad at the east end, and runs taper towards the west, where it turns, and runs
                    to a point due north. It is about six leagues to the west of Middleburg. The
                    shore is surrounded by a coral rock, and its most elevated parts are not above
                    six or eight yards above the level of the sea. It is wholly laid out in
                    plantations, in which are cultivated some of the richest productions of nature.
