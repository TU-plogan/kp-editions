                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">ALABASTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, an
                    English divine, was born at Hadley, in the county of Suffolk. He was one of the
                    doctors of Trinity College in Cambridge; and he attended the earl of Essex as
                    his chaplain in the expedition to Cadiz in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. It is
                    said that his first resolutions of changing his religion were occasioned by his
                    seeing the pomp of the churches of the Roman communion, and the respect with
                    which the priests seemed to be treated amongst them; and appearing thus to waver
                    in his mind, he soon found persons who took advantage of this disposition of
                    his, and of the complaints which he made of not being advanced according to his
                    deserts in England, in such a manner, that he did not scruple to go over to the
                    Popish religion, as soon as he found that there <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193034645" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4645-0372"/>was no ground to hope for
                    greater encouragement in his own country. However that matter be, he joined
                    himself to the Romish communion; but was disappointed in his expectations. He
                    was soon displeased at this; and he could not reconcile himself to the
                    discipline of that church, which made no consideration of the degrees which he
                    had taken before. It is probable, too, that he could not approve of the worship
                    of creatures, which Protestants are used to look upon with horror. Upon this he
                    returned to England in order to resume his former religion. He obtained a
                    prebend in the cathedral of St Paul, and after that the rectory of Therfield in
                    Hertfordshire. He was well skilled in the Hebrew tongue; but he gave a wrong
                    turn to his genius by studying the Cabala, with which he was strangely
                    infatuated. He gave a proof of this in a sermon which he preached upon taking
                    his degree of doctor of divinity at Cambridge. He took for his text the
                    beginning of the first book of Chronicles, “Adam, Seth, Enos and having touched
                    upon the literal sense, he turned immediately to the mystical, asserting, that
                    Adam signified misfortune and misery, and so of the rest. His verses were
                    greatly esteemed. He wrote a Latin tragedy, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Roxana,</hi> which, when it was acted in a college at Cambridge, was attended
                    with a very remarkable accident. There was a lady who was so terrified at the
                    last word of the tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Sequar, Sequar,</hi> which was
                    pronounced with a very shocking tone, that she lost her senses all her lifetime
                    after. He died in the year 1640. His <hi rend="italic">Apparatus in</hi><hi

                    these titles we may judge what were the taste and genius of the author.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alabaster,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> a
                    mineral substance whose base is calcareous earth. It differs from marble in
                    being combined, not with the carbonic, but with the sulphuric acid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Alabaster,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Antiquity,</hi> a term
                    used for a vase wherein odoriferous liquors were anciently put. The reason of
                    the denomination is, that vessels for this purpose were frequently made of the
                    alabaster stone, which Pliny and other ancients represent as peculiarly proper
                    for this purpose. Several critics will have the box mentioned in the Gospels as
                    made of alabaster to have been of glass; and though the texts say that the Woman
                    broke it, yet the pieces seem miraculously to have been united, since we are
                    told the entire box was purchased by the emperor Constantine, and preserved as a
                    relic of great price. Others will have it that the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >alabaster</hi> denotes the form rather than the matter of this box: in this
                    view they define alabaster by a box without a handle, deriving the word from the
                    privative <hi rend="italic">α,</hi> and λα∕¾, <hi rend="italic">ansa,
                    handle.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Alabaster</hi> is also said to have been used
                    for an ancient liquid measure, containing ten ounces of wine, or nine of oil. In
                    this sense the alabaster was equal to half the sextary.</p>
