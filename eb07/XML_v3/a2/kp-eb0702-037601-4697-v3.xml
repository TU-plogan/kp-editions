                <p><label type="entry">ALBANIA</label>, a country of considerable extent, which,
                    though frequently ruled by turbulent and nearly independent chiefs, ranks as one
                    of the provinces of the Turkish empire. It extends from the thirty-ninth to the
                    forty-third degree of north latitude, for the space of about 250 miles, along
                    the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Venice. The extent inland nowhere exceeds 100
                    miles, and is in the southern part not more than 30. The chain of Pindus, called
                    now the mountains of Sagori, of Met-zovo, and of Suli, separate it by an
                    ill-defined line from Macedonia and Thessaly. The Turks divided it into
                    pachalics, of which the principal are those of Scutari, Ochrida; Vallona, and
                    Butrinto; but these distinctions, amid late revolutions, have been in a great
                    measure obliterated. The divisions chiefly recognised are those formed by the
                    varieties of the native tribes. Major Leake, who is allowed to be the best
                    informed traveller on this head, divides them into the Ngege, or Ghegides, whose
                    principal towns are Dulcigno, Scutari, and Durazzo; the Toske or Toskides, who
                    occupy Berat and Elbasan; the Liape, a poor and predatory race, who inhabit the
                    mountains between the Toske and Delvino; and the Tsami, who inhabit the most
                    southerly district, and whose principal towns are Suli and Paramithia. There
                    are, besides, a great number of smaller divisions, too tedious to enumerate.

                <p>Albania nearly coincides with the country known to the ancients under the name of
                    Epirus. This country was then, as now, distinguished by the rude valour of its
                    inhabitants. Its remote situation, and the want of union among its tribes,
                    generally prevented it from acting any conspicuous part in Grecian politics. The
                    only remarkable exception occurs in the reign of Pyrrhus IL, who was justly
                    ranked with the greatest captains of antiquity. After his death the country was
                    again split into a number of petty states, which were unable to resist the
                    united strength of Macedon; and to that kingdom Epirus continued subject, till
                    both were alike subdued by the Roman arms.</p>
                <p>It was during the time of the Greek empire that the name of Albania was first
                    given to this district. During the decline of the empire the Albanians gradually
                    rose to distinction, and at last to independence. Their valour enabled them to
                    maintain their ground against the Bulgarians, who had occupied all the
                    neighbouring districts of Greece. Nor were they less successful against the
                    Turks, a more formidable enemy. Under the command of the celebrated George
                    Castriot, commonly called Scan-derbeg, they baffled all the efforts of Mahomet
                    II. the conqueror of Constantinople. That powerful monarch entered Albania only
                    to experience a succession of defeats, and was at length compelled to
                    acknowledge its independence by a formal treaty. On the death of Scander-bcg the
                    Turks redoubled their efforts against Albania, which was at length reduced to a
                    state of nominal subjection. The siege of Scutari, in 1478, formed the
                    termination of this memorable struggle. The subjection, however, was always
                    imperfect; revolts were frequent, and the inhabitants of the mountainous
                    districts still preserved their independence. It was by the motives of pay and
                    plunder, rather than by compulsion, that these hardy soldicrs<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193034710" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4710-0377"/> were allured into the
                    Turkish ranks. In proportion as the Ottoman empire declined in vigour, its hold
                    of Albania became less firm; and the vigorous and enterprising genius of Ali
                    Pacha again converted this dependency into what might almost be called a
                    separate kingdom.</p>
                <p>Ali was born at Tepellene, a small town in the interior of Albania. His father
                    held the rank of a pacha of two tails, but was not possessed of any extensive
                    power; and he died when Ali was only fifteen. In a district so turbulent, and
                    filled with warlike and hostile leaders, the young chief was necessarily placed
                    in a very critical situation. He was himself accustomed to boast, that he began
                    his fortune with sixty paras and a musket; and an Albanian who attended a late
                    traveller (Mr Hobhouse) declared, that he remembered to have seen Ali with his
                    jacket out at elbows. Ali was ere long driven from Te-pellene, his native place,
                    and was abandoned by almost every follower. A plan was next formed for his
                    destruction, by the inhabitants of Gardiki, a neighbouring town; and for this
                    purpose they surrounded, in the night-time, a village where he had taken refuge.
                    Ali escaped through a garden, but his mother and sister fell into the hands of
                    the Gardikiotes, and were treated with every species of indignity; Wrongs for
                    Which he afterwards took a dreadful vengeance. His address and activity enabled
                    him gradually to repair his fortunes. He insinuated himself into the favour of
                    Coul Pacha, then the principal chief of Albania, whose daughter he at length
                    married. Having thus been enabled to collect some followers, he succeeded in
                    surprising Yanina, the capital, and in prevailing upon the Porte to recognise
                    him as pacha of that important district. From this time he took the lead among
                    the Albanian chiefs; employing sometimes force, sometimes money, and sometimes
                    treachery, to increase his authority, and add to the extent of his
                    dominions.</p>
                <p>The most formidable adversaries with whom Ali had to contend were the Suliotes, a
                    people placed in the southern extremity of Albania. They inhabit an almost
                    inaccessible range of mountains, beneath whose gloomy shade winds a river, which
                    Dr Holland conjectures, on very plausible grounds, to be the Aeheron of the
                    ancients. <hi rend="italic">( Travels in the Ionian Isles and Albania.')</hi>
                    The strength of their native bulwarks, their passion for war, and contempt of
                    death, made them the terror of Albania, which they frequently invaded; while no
                    foreign power had ever ventured to scale the tremendous barriers by which they
                    were guarded. Ali at length succeeded, partly by force and partly by bribery,’
                    in gaining the passes which led into their country; and the whole nation, after
                    a furious resistance, was reduced to subjection, and partly extirpated.</p>
                <p>In 1811 and 1812 Ali attacked and defeated the pachas of Berat and Delvino; by
                    which means he gained possession of some of the finest parts of Albania, and a
                    population of between 200,000 and 300,000 souls. Tepellene, his native place,
                    now fell into his power; and now also it was that he obtained the means of
                    inflicting signal vengeance on Gardiki. With his accustomed duplicity he
                    pretended a complete oblivion of all grounds of resentment, until he had
                    surrounded and inclosed the city with his troops; when upwards of 700 of those
                    of the inhabitants who were supposed to have been most deeply involved in the
                    ancient guilt, were dragged into a large khan near the city, and bound together
                    with cords. On a signal given by Ali, the Albanian soldiery, who were stationed
                    on the walls of the khan, began a discharge of musketry, which continued until
                    the destruction of the whole 700 was completed.</p>
                <p>The dominions of Ali were not confined within the limits of Albania; he extended
                    his sway over the mountainous district of Macedonia, nearly the whole of
                    Thessaly, and great part of Livadia. He was kept in check by Ismael Bey,
                    possessing an authority nearly as independent over the plains of Macedonia. In
                    Albania, his power Was almost absolute; and while little regard was paid to the
                    imperial firman, a letter with the signature of Ali commanded implicit
                    obedience. The Albanians were enthusiastically attached to him; they viewed him
                    as a native sovereign; they admired the energy of his character, and, when they
                    heard of any other chief, commonly remarked, “he has not a head like Ali.”</p>
                <p>The natives estimated Ali’s' military force so high as 50,000, 60,000, or even
                    100,000 men. This could only apply to the ease of a general levy <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse,</hi> in the event of invasion. It
                    does not appear that Ali ever brought into the field a greater disposable force
                    than 15,000. His standing army was supposed to be about 10,000, of whom 4000 or
                    5000 were stationed round his capital Yanina. The amount of his revenues was
                    still more uncertain. They arose from the following sources :—1. A land-tax,
                    amounting generally to about 10 per cent. of the produce; 2. a tax on cities and
                    towns, levied in the form of requisition; 3. the customs, which he raised to six
                    per cent.; 4. the inheritance of all who died without male heirs.</p>
                <p>Ali s figure was corpulent and unwieldy, his neck short, his stature about five
                    feet nine inches. The expression of his countenance was striking and majestic;
                    and his features gave no indications of those terrible qualities by which he was
                    characterized. His abilities were certainly of no mean order. He displayed that
                    union of deep thought and contrivance with prompt and decisive action, which
                    indicate a mind equally formed for polities and for war. He was remarkable for
                    his address, both in gaining friends, and in lulling asleep the suspicions of
                    his bitterest enemies. But, if his abilitiés were of a superior order, his
                    dispositions were of a kind which rendered him an object of fear and
                    detestation. His cruelty rather resembled that of an Indian savage, than of even
                    the least civilized European. Impaling and roasting alive were among the common
                    punishments reserved for those who had unhappily offended him. The fierceness of
                    his cruelty was only exceeded by the depth of his dissimulation. It was
                    impossible for the most skilful observer to conjecture, from his outward
                    deportment, the real sentiments with which he regarded any individual. The only
                    observable difference consisted in a peculiar kindness of manner towards those
                    unfortunates whose cruel doom he had silently and unrelentingly sealed.</p>
                <p>Ali’s ordinary residence was near Yanina, in an immense building, which combines
                    the characters of a palace and a fortress. The outer courts were irregularly
                    crowded with Albanian soldiers, and with persons of all descriptions, who
                    attended upon him, or had petitions to present. Each petitioner, in approaching,
                    knelt and kissed his garment. He exercised in person the whole judicial
                    authority; and his decisions, though necessarily given too promptly, are,
                    however, said to have been guided by an apparent wish of arriving at the truth,
                    and of doing justice. He rose at six in the morning, and, with the exception of
                    an hour at dinner and an hour at supper, spent the whole day in business. His
                    habits at table were extremely temperate, though he was not so strict a
                    Mussulman as to decline the use of wine. His haram contained 390 females of
                    various descriptions. It formed an edifice entirely distinct from the rest of
                    the seraglio, and is said to have been furnished in a style of the most gorgeous
                    magnificence; but no European ever found admission into it.</p>
                <p>Although the government of Ali was completely des<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193034723" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4723-0378"/>potical, yet, viewed
                    comparatively, it appears to have been better for Albania than -the terrible
                    anarchy to which it was formerly exposed. He freed that country from a race of
                    petty tyrants, and from perpetual scenes of internal warfare. His vigorous
                    administration nearly extirpated those numerous predatory hordes who found
                    shelter in the mountainous districts, and spread terror and desolation over the
                    plains.</p>
                <p>In the relations between Ali and the court of Constantinople, mutual fear long
                    preserved an outward good understanding. The progress of this enterprising chief
                    was viewed with jealousy and alarm; but the Porte was never in a condition to
                    hazard driving him into open rebellion. It was found prudent, therefore, to
                    invest him, by its firman, with the government of those provinces which the
                    sword had already placed in his possession. Ali, on the other hand, paid an
                    outward deference to the Porte, and remitted to it some portion of the revenue
                    which he collected. He also uniformly supported that power with nearly his whole
                    force, against the foreign enemies with which it has had to contend. He even
                    marched against Paswun Oglou, and was present at the siege of Widdin; and his
                    son Mouktar Pacha distinguished himself greatly against the Russians. In all
                    other respects, whether as to the internal government of Albania, or its foreign
                    relations, he acted completely as an independent monarch. The Porte omitted no
                    means of inducing him to repair to Constantinople, and even proffered to him the
                    dignity of grand vizier; but Ali uniformly resisted every such invitation, well
                    knowing that his arrival at that capital would be the immediate signal for
                    striking off his head.</p>
                <p>The Porte, however, has various resources, by which it seldom fails to crush in
                    the end those refractory pachas who succeed in setting a temporary defiance to
                    its authority. Ali was now past 60 years of age; and the dissensions among his
                    sons afforded no prospect of a succession sufficiently vigorous and firm to
                    maintain itself amid so many rivals, and against the whole power of the empire.
                    Pacho Bey, who, from being one of the most favoured adherents of Ali, had
                    incurred his displeasure, and been driven out of Albania, insinuated himself
                    into favour at the. court of Constantinople. He fomented all the dissatisfaction
                    then prevalent against his former master, and even laid down plans for his
                    destruction, of which Ali was not long in being apprized. All the surrounding
                    pachalics were bestowed upon his known enemies, who soon hemmed him in on every
                    side. In these circumstances Ali determined to overawe his enemies by one of
                    those fierce and bloody deeds which were familiar to him. He found among his
                    devoted adherents two who undertook to assassinate Pacho Bey. They made the.
                    attempt, accordingly, in a public place at Constantinople; but Pacho was only
                    slightly wounded; and the assassins, being seized and led to execution,
                    acknowledged that they were hired by the tyrant of Albania. Incensed by this
                    daring outrage, Mahmood, the present energetic ruler of Turkey, determined no
                    longer to keep any measures. He issued a <hi rend="italic">firmanley</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> placing Ali under the ban of the empire, and
                    calling upon all the surrounding pachas to march their united forces against him
                    as a common enemy. This crisis showed the hollowness of that strength on which
                    Ali had so firmly relied, and by which he had inspired such terror. All the
                    tribes whom, in the zenith of his power, fear or interest had attached to his
                    standard, deserted him in this hour of his terrible need. „ Pacho Bey had
                    boasted that he would march upon Yanina without firing a gun; and this proud
                    boast <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> he actually fulfilled, Ali being unable to
                    collect any army which could make head against the mass of force now brought to
                    bear upon him. Even his sons made only faint efforts to rally round the falling
                    fortunes of their family. Veli, invested in Prevesa by the captain-pacha,
                    surrendered with all his troops and treasures, obtaining very favourable terms.
                    Mouktar, who defended Berat, was obliged to take refuge with a small forcé in
                    the citadel of that place.</p>
                <p>The Turkish army was now before Yanina, yet Ali was not yet vanquished. He now
                    adopted a measure in entire accordance with his ferocious and desperate
                    character. He gave up that fine capital to indiscriminate pillage by his bandit
                    adherents, after which it was set on fire and destroyed. Ali then retreated to a
                    strong castle in the lake, where he shut himself up with about ten thousand of
                    those who were still ready to follow him through life and death. His position
                    was almost impregnable. He had still an immense treasure, was master of die
                    navigation of the lake, and could communicate with the mountaineer tribes, among
                    whom there yet prevailed an extensive devotion to his cause. In this state of
                    affairs the operations of the besieging army were necessarily reduced to an
                    impotent blockade. In such circumstances an irregular army, without magazines or
                    resources, cannot be long kept together. They began to disperse and return to
                    their homes; and the Turkish ranks were soon so thinned, that the army was
                    obliged to retreat upon Arta, leaving all central Albania again in the
                    possession of AIL</p>
                <p>Mahmood felt of course highly dissatisfied with this result of the extensive
                    operations undertaken against his rebellious viceroy. Chourschid, pacha of the
                    Morea, an officer of high distinction, and who had once held the place of grand
                    vizier,· was invested with the supreme command. Having assembled the forces of
                    all the surrounding pachalics, he soon made himself master of the plain country
                    of Albania, and again hemmed in Ali within the precincts of his castle. He was
                    again, however, obliged to slacken the blockade, in consequence of the grand
                    insurrection of the Greeks; which Ali hoped, by declaring loudly in its favour,
                    to use as an instrument in retrieving his fortunes. But his hands had been too
                    deeply dyed in the best blood of Greece; and that people, governed rather by
                    passion than policy, repelled this strange alliance with their mortal enemy.
                    Chourschid, as soon as circumstances admitted, renewed the siege, and pressed it
                    closer and closer; yet there appeared little prospect of success, till treason
                    was resorted to. By immense bribes and promises he gained over Tahir Abbas, an
                    old and hitherto one of the most faithful adherents of Ali. Through this person
                    the castle gates were opened, and the Turks admitted. Yet Ali had still a
                    resource in this last extremity. With a hundred followers, who were personally
                    and entirely devoted to him, and with his wives and his treasure, he retired
                    into a solitary tower, entirely insulated from the rest of the edifice. There he
                    announced his determination, that the instant an enemy should set foot within
                    this last retreat, the whole should be instantly blown into the air. He
                    understood well, that so far as regarded himself, this threat was quite
                    nugatory; but his treasure had long been an eager object of Turkish cupidity,
                    and much would be sacrificed in order to preserve it. Chourschid now redoubled
                    his arts, and bound himself by every vow which the Moslem faith holds most
                    sacred, that Ah, on surrendering, should have not only life, buta secure and
                    splendid retreat. It may be wondered how the jealous old tyrant, so deeply
                    versant in Turkish treasons, should have given in to this snare. He was now
                    closely beset with destruction, and thought perhaps that compliance afforded
                    almost the only hope of life. He came down into the citadel, leaving orders,
                    however, with Selim, his most trusty officer, on a particular signal given, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193034736" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4736-0379"/> instantly to blow
                    up the tower. Chourschid immediately dispatched a messenger to the Porte,
                    announcing that its arch-enemy was in his hands. He then, by persuasion or
                    threats, obtained from Ali orders for the surrender of the tower and all its
                    contents. Scarcely had this transaction been closed, when Mehemed Pacha arrived
                    with a finnan from the Porte, decreeing the immediate death of Ali. The
                    particulars of the last scene shave been variously reported. According to some,
                    Mehemed entered, saluted Ali as an old friend, and, amid the exchange of
                    courtesies, stabbed him to the heart. Others report that Ali made a desperate
                    resistance, and that fifty of his followers fought and fell around him. He fell
                    justly, covered with crimes which cried for vengeance to heaven and earth; yet
                    it. may be doubted if any of the treasons which rendered him infamous equalled
                    in atrocity that of which he was the victim. His head was carried to
                    Constantinople, and shown to the exulting populace, with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >yafìa,</hi> or inscription, expressing the crimes which had. drawn upon him the
                    just vengeance of the sublime Porte. The treasure found in the tower, chiefly in
                    jewels, is said to have amounted to about L.800,000; a sum which fell short of
                    the sanguine anticipations which had been formed respecting it.</p>
                <p>The Albanians, accustomed to view with disdain the Ottoman yoke, showed a
                    considerable disposition to make common cause with the Greeks; and their
                    co-operation would have almost insured success. But the Greeks, imprudently and
                    unhappily, could not divest themselves of the feelings of enmity cherished
                    during the long series of wars which Ali had waged against them. At the siege of
                    Tripolizza overtures were made to them by a corps of 3000 Albanians, who formed
                    part of the garrison; but the Greeks, having succeeded in entering the place,
                    began a dreadful and indiscriminate massacre, in which the Albanians were
                    equally involved. At the siege of Arta, although, the capture was much
                    facilitated by the coming over of a corps of Albanians, the Greeks treated them
                    extremely ill. ∣ The Albanian nation was thus forcibly thrown into the arms of
                    the Porte, to which it has since continued attached.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Albania are estimated at 1,200,000, of which a considerable
                    prcportion are Turks and Greeks; but the basis of the population consists of the
                    original race, called Amauts. This remarkable people differ completely from
                    every other included within the limits of the Turkish empire. Their conversion
                    to Mahometan tenets has been very imperfect, and chiefly induced by political
                    motives. In every family the males usually go to the mosque, the females to
                    church; and some members of a family are seen in the most amicable manner eating
                    from the same table, and even from the same plate, meats forbidden to the
                    others. With the Turks, accordingly, infidel and Albanian arc terms nearly
                    synonymous. Ali did not appear to make religion .a ground of any the slightest
                    distinction between the different classes of his subjects.</p>
                <p>The native Albanian is of a middle stature; his face is oval, with high
                    cheek-bones; his neck long, his chest full and broad. His air is erect and
                    majestic to a degree which never fails to surprise the traveller. He holds in
                    utter contempt that dissimulation which is characteristic of the Greek, and
                    piques himself upon giving utterance to every sentiment without the smallest
                    reserve. Equally remote from the grave and sluggish deportment of the Turk, he
                    is gay, lively, and active. Averse, however, to regular industry, his whole
                    delight is in arms and plunder. He goes constantly armed; and there are few
                    Albanians who, in the prime of their life, have not belonged to some of the
                    numerous bands of robbers who infest the mountains of their native country, of
                    Thessaly, and of Macedonia. This profession carries with it no disgrace; it is
                    common for the Albanian to mention circumstances which occurred “when he was a
                    robber.” In proportion as the trade of robbing becomes overstocked, part of
                    those engaged in it seek employment in the service of the sultan, and of the
                    different pachas throughout the Turkish empire; by all of whom the Albanians are
                    regarded as the most valuable of their troops.</p>
                <p>An Albanian military force, according to the description of Dr Holland, cannot so
                    properly be called an army, as a tumultuous assemblage of armed men. There is no
                    regular distribution into corps; nor is ríiuch regard paid to the authority of
                    any officer, with the single exception of the pacha himself. Yet such is their
                    activity and intrepidity, that they have sometimés proved formidable to the best
                    disciplined European armies. The main strength of the Turkish infantry in the
                    late Russian campaigns has consisted of Albanians.</p>
                <p>This fierce and haughty race display a greater degree of contempt for the female
                    sex than is usual even among the most barbarous nations. The females are
                    literally regarded as inferior animals, and treated as such; but in the country
                    districts they are not confined or veiled, as is customary in Mahometan
                    countries.</p>
                <p>The dress of the Albanian consists of a cotton shirt, a jacket, a mantle,
                    sandals, and a red cap; to which is added a large <hi rend="italic">capote,</hi>
                    or great coat, as a shelter from the weather. Every part except the shirt
                    consists of woollen. As they have usually only one suit, which they wear day and
                    night, it soon exhibits a dreadful assemblage of dirt and vermin, and at length
                    literally falls to pieces. The dress of the females is more various, and often
                    fantastical. A singular custom prevails among the’ girls, of stringing together
                    the pieces of money which they have collected for their portion, and wearing
                    them upon their heads. Some of them have their hair hanging down in braids to a
                    great length, loaded with this species of ornament.</p>
                <p>Yanina, the present capital, is beautifully situated on the banks of a small
                    lake, inclosed within a circuit of lofty mountains. The houses in general are
                    not externally either splendid or elegant; and they are built in the most
                    irregular manner, with scarcely anÿ approach to the form of streets. The
                    intermixture, however, of gardens and trees gives to the city a fine appearance
                    from a distance; particularly when combined with the magnificent back-ground
                    which everywhere crowns the landscape.· There is a considerable number of Greeks
                    at Yanina, who display an active and intelligent character, arid cultivate with
                    ardour the different branches of science and literature. The total number of
                    inhabitants is estimated at upwards of 35,000.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Albania is chiefly carried on through Arta, a small city situated
                    on a gulf of the Same name, in the most southern district of the country. The
                    principal merchants, however, are Greeks residing at Yanina, among whom a very
                    active commercial spirit appears to prevail. The mercantile houses of this city
                    have often branches in other countries, particularly Germany and Russia; and
                    several of them suffered considerably by the conflagration of Moscow. Under the
                    continental system of the late French ruler, Malta became the great channel for
                    the trade of Albania, and, notwithstanding the subsequent political changes,
                    probably retains it to a certain extent. The exports consist almost entirely of
                    unmanufactured produce. Notwithstanding its mountainous character, the fertility
                    of its plains affords a surplus of grain, of which upwards of fifty cargoes are
                    sent to Italy, the Ionian Isles, Malta, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034749"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4749-0380"/>and other places. Wool is exported chiefly
                    unmanufactured, but partly also wrought into coarse cloth. Other important
                    articles of export are, oil, tobacco of good quality, cotton and cotton yarn,
                    chiefly from Thessaly. Some cargoes of wood for building and fire are annually
                    sent to Malta. The chief imports consist of woollen cloths, used for winter
                    coverings. For this purpose the preference is given to a coarser and cheaper
                    species than any that is usually manufactured in Greaf Britain. This is supplied
                    from Germany. Albania imports also guns, gunpowder, hardware, coffee, and sugar.
                    On the 8th of October an annual fair is opened in the neighbourhood of Yanina,
                    and continues for fourteen days, when the imported articles are exchanged for
                    native commodities, which then pour in from every quarter.</p>
                <p>The reader will find much interesting information in regard to this country, and
                    its present ruley, in the <hi rend="italic">Travels of</hi> Mr Hobhouse and of
                    Dr Holland. The latter resided for some time at Ali’s court, where, in quality
                    of physician, he enjoyed the privilege of a familiar intercourse with that
                    extraordinary personage; and the anecdotes which he relates give no small share
                    of interest to his otherwise valuable and instructive publication, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(e.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Albania,</hi> a country of Asia,
                    bounded on the west by Iberia; on the east by the, Caspian Sea; on the north by
                    Sarmatia; on the south by Armenia and the river Cyrus, now Kur, which, springing
                    from the Moschian Mountains, that separate Colchis from Armenia, falls into the
                    Caspian Sea within a small distance from the southern borders of this country.
                    The whole country, formerly called <hi rend="italic">Albania,</hi> now goes
                    under the names of <hi rend="italic">Daghistan, Schirwan,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">East Georgia,</hi> and is extremely fruitful and pleasant. The
                    ancient historians take notice of the Albanian men being tall, strong-bodied,
                    and, generally speaking, of a very graceful appearance; far excelling all other
                    nations in comeliness as well as stature. Modern travellers extol the beauty of
                    the women. The Albanians were anciently an independent and pretty powerful
                    people; but we find no mention made of their kings till the reign of Alexander
                    the Great, to whom the king of Albania is said to have presented a dog of an
                    extraordinary fierceness and size. It does not appear that the Albanians were
                    ever conquered by the Romans, even when their power was at the greatest height;
                    though, when they ventured to engage in war with that powerful empire, they were
                    always defeated, as might naturally be expected.</p>
