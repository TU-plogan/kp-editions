                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ALLEIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph</hi></label>, the son of
                    Tobias Allein, was born at Devizes, in Wiltshire, in 1633, and educated at
                    Oxford. In 1655 he became assistant to Mr Newton, in Taunton Magdalen, in
                    Somersetshire; but was deprived for nonconformity. He died in 1668, aged 35. He
                    was a man of great learning, and greater charity; preserving, though a
                    nonconformist, and a severe sufferer on that account, great respect for the
                    church, and loyalty to his sovereign. He wrote several books of piety, which are
                    highly esteemed; but his <hi rend="italic">Alarm to Unconverted Sinners</hi> is
                    more famous than the rest. There have been many editions of this little pious
                    work, the sale of which has been very great; of the edition 1672 there were
                    20,000 sold ∙' of that of 1675, with this title, <hi rend="italic">A Sure Guide
                    to Heaven</hi> 50,000. There was also a large impression of it with its first
                    title in 1720.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Allein,</hi><hi rend="italic">Richard,</hi> an English
                    nonconformist divine, a native of Ditchet, in Somersetshire, was born in the
                    year 1611. His father was rector of Ditchet, and conducted the education of his
                    son until he was prepared for the university. There he soon obtained the degree
                    of master of arts; and after he entered into holy orders, first as an assistant
                    to his father, and afterwards as rector of Batcomb, in Somersetshire, he
                    discharged the duties of a clergyman with great industry and singular fidelity.
                    From his education he conceived an early predilection for the sentiments of the
                    Puritans, and, consequently, in the contest between Charles I. and the
                    parliament he firmly adhered to the latter. Having adopted these sentiments, he
                    sometimes received a little disturbance from the king’s forces; but he never
                    carried his opposition to any undue length. He, along with several others,
                    signed a paper entitled, “The testimony of the Ministers of Somersetshire to the
                    truth of Christ,” in which their declared principles and becoming candour were
                    amply displayed. Along with his father, he was employed by the commissioners
                    appointed by parliament for ejecting scandalous ministers; a commission which
                    was executed with rigour, and originated in intolerance.</p>
                <p>Upon the Restoration he manifested a disposition to loyalty, but, unable with a
                    good conscience to unite in the act of conformity, he resigned his living after
                    enjoying it for 20 years, and ranked with the meritorious band of sufferers, to
                    the number of 2000, commonly denominated the <hi rend="italic">ejected
                    ministers.</hi> In the house of Mr More, who had been a member of the
                    parliament, he exercised the duties of his ministerial office under the penalty
                    of that act, and was consequently reprimanded by the magistrates and imprisoned;
                    but his piety and exemplary conduct procured him a mitigation of punishment. But
                    no dangers could deter him from duty; for although constrained to remove from
                    that place in consequence of the “five-mile act,” he continued in the discharge
                    of his ministerial office atFrome-Selwood. Here he remained until he terminated
                    his labours by death, in 1681.</p>
                <p>Piety, boldness, activity, and candour, shone in the character of Richard Allein.
                    He was admired as a pathetic and practical preacher, and justly respected for
                    the diligence with which he discharged the public and private duties of his
                    profession. Mr Jenkins, the vicar of the parish where he resided, preached his
                    funeral sermon, and bore an honourable testimony to his activity, moderation,
                    and piety. Richard Allein, similar to his nonconformist brethren, chiefly
                    confined his studies and publications to subjects of religion. His works are
                    strongly marked with the peculiar features of the religious character then
                    prevalent among the nonconformists. They have been frequently reprinted, and
                    very much perused. His most celebrated work is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vindiciae</hi><hi rend="italic">Pietatis,</hi> or a Vindication or Godliness in
                    its greatest Strictness and Spirituality; with Directions for a Godly Life. This
                    book was published in 1665 without a printer’s name; and being unlicensed, the
                    copies of it were seized and sent to the king’s kitchen for waste paper. The
                    other productions of his pen are, Heaven Opened, or a brief and plain discovery
                    of the riches of God’s Covenant of Grace, printed in 1665; the V orld Conquered,
                    published in 8vo, in 1668; Godly Fear, printed in 8vo, in 1674; a Rebuke to
                    Backsliders, and a Spur for Loiterers, printed in 8vo, in 1677; a Companion for
                    Prayer, in 12mo, 1680; a Brief Character of Mr Joseph <pb break="no"
