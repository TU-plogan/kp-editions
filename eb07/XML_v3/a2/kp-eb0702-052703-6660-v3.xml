                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">ALLITERATION</label>, an ornament of language chiefly used in
                    poetry, and consisting in the repetition of the same letter at certain
                    intervals. We do not remember to have ever seen any satisfactory account of
                    alliteration in the writings of the critics. They seem to have passed it over in
                    contemptuous silence, either as a false refinement or as a mere trifle. It
                    perhaps deserves a better fate.</p>
                <p>We apprehend the principal operation of this ornament to be quite mechanical. It
                    is easier for the organs of speech to resume, at short intervals, one certain
                    conformation, than to throw themselves into a number of different ones,
                    unconnected and discordant. For example, a succession of labials, interspersed
                    at regular distances with dentals and gutturals, will be more easily pronounced
                    than the succession of all the three at random. Sounds of which the articulation
                    is easiest are most completely in the power of the speaker. He can pronounce
                    them slowly or rapidly, softly or with force, at pleasure. In this, we imagine,
                    the power and advantage of alliteration are founded; for we would not lay any
                    stress on the pleasure which can result to the ear from the repetition of the
                    same letter. It has been compared to the frequent returns of the key-note in a
                    musical strain; but that analogy is extremely faint. The ear, we presume, can be
                    pleased with alliteration only in so far as it contributes to the superior
                    easiness of recitation; for what is recited with ease must be heard with
                    pleasure.</p>
                <p>These remarks might be confirmed and illustrated by numberless passages from the
                    best poets. Some few lines will suffice, taken from Gray, who seems to have paid
                    particular attention to this grace. He professed to have learned his
                    versification from Dryden, as Dryden did from Spenser; and these three abound in
                    alliteration above all the English poets. We choose Gray for another reason,
                    that alliteration contributes not only to the <hi rend="italic">sweetness,</hi>
                    but also to the <hi rend="italic">energy, of</hi> versification; for he uses it
                    chiefly when he aims at strength and boldness. In the <hi rend="italic">Sister
                    Odes,</hi> as Dr Johnson styles them, almost every strophe commences and
                    concludes with an alliterative line. The poet, we supposed, wished to begin with
                    force, and end with dignity.</p>

                <p>It must be observed here, that we hold a verse alliterative which has a letter
                    repeated on its accented parts, although those parts do not begin words; the
                    repeated letter bearing a strong analogy to the bars in a musical phrase. Gray
                    seems to have had a particular liking to those sorts of balanced verses which
                    divide equally, and of which the opposite sides have an alliterative
                    resemblance.</p>

                <p>All these lines appear to us to have a force and energy, arising from
                    alliteration, which renders them easy to be recited; or, if the reader pleases,
                    <hi rend="italic">mouthed.</hi> For the same reason the following passage
                    appears sad and solemn, by the repetition of the labial liquid.</p>

                <p>If alliteration thus contributes to enforce the expression of a poetical
                    sentiment, its advantages in poetry must be considerable. It is not, therefore,
                    unworthy of a poet’s regard in the act of composition. If two words offer of
                    equal propriety, the one alliterative, the other not, we think the first ought
                    to be chosen. We would compare this to the practice of fuguing in music. A
                    composer who aims at expression will not hunt after fugues; but if they offer,
                    if they seem to arise spontaneously from the subject, he will not reject them.
                    So a good poet ought not to select an epithet merely for beginning with a
                    certain letter, unless it suit his purpose well in every other respect; for the
                    beauty of alliteration, when happy, is not greater than its deformity when
                    affected. A couplet from Pope will exemplify both; the first line being bad, and
                    the second good:</p>
