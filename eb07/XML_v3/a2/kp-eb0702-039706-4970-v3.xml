                    rend="smallcaps">Rond d’,</hi> an eminent French philosopher, was born at Paris
                    in 1717. He derived the name of Jean le Rond from that of the church near which,
                    after his birth, he was exposed as a foundling. His father, informed of this
                    circumstance, listened to the voice of nature and duty, took measures for the
                    proper education of his child, and for his future subsistence in a state of ease
                    and independence.</p>
                <p>He received his first education in the College of the Four Nations, among the
                    Jansenists, where he gave early marks of capacity and genius. In the first year
                    of his philosophical studies he composed a Commentary on the Epistle of St Paul
                    to the Romans. The Jansenists considered this production as an omen that
                    portended to the party of Port-Royal a restoration to some part of their ancient
                    splendour, and hoped to find one day in Μ. d’Alembert a second Pascal. To render
                    this resemblance more complete, they engaged their rising pupil in the study of
                    the mathematics; but they soon perceived that his growing attachment to this
                    science was likely to disappoint the hopes they had formed with respect to his
                    future destination: they therefore endeavoured to divert him from this line; but
                    their endeavours were fruitless.</p>
                <p>On his leaving college, he found himself alone and unconnected with the world;
                    and sought an asylum in the house of his <hi rend="italic">nurse.</hi> He
                    comforted himself with the hope that his fortune, though not ample, would better
                    the condition and subsistence of that family, which was the only one that he
                    could consider as his own. Here, therefore, he took up his residence, resolving
                    to apply himself entirely to the study of geometry; and here he lived, during
                    the space of forty years, with the greatest simplicity, discovering the
                    augmentation of his means only by increasing displays of his beneficence,
                    concealing his growing reputation and celebrity from these honest people, and
                    making their plain and uncouth manners the subject of good-natured pleasantry
                    and philosophical observation. His good nurse perceived his ardent activity,
                    heard him mentioned as the writer of many books, but never took it into her head
                    that he was a great man, and rather beheld him with a kind of compassion. <hi

                    day, <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">beany thing but a

                    philosopher</hi><hi rend="italic">? —</hi><hi rend="italic">a fool, who toils

                    rend="smallcaps">he</hi> is NO MORE.”</p>
                <p>As Μ. d’Alembert’s fortune did not far exceed the demands of necessity, his
                    friends advised him to think of a profession that might enable him to augment
                    it. He aocordingly turned his views to the law, and took his degrees in thst
                    line; but soon abandoned this plan, and applied to the study of medicine.
                    Geometry, however, was always drawing him back to his former pursuits; and after
                    many ineffectual efforts to resist its attractions, he renounced all views of a
                    lucrative profession, and give himself over entirely to mathematics and
                    poverty.</p>
                <p>In the year 1741 he was admitted member of the Academy of Sciences; for which
                    distinguished literary promotion, at such an early age, he ħad prepared the way
                    by correcting the errors of a celebrated work,<note anchored="true"
                    place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"/> The Analyse
                    Démontrée of F. Beniau.</p></note> which was deemed <hi rend="italic"
                    >classical</hi> in France in the line of geometry. He afterwards set himself to
                    examine, with deep attention and assiduity, what must be the motion of a body
                    which passes from one fluid into another more dense, in a direction not
                    perpendicular to the surface separating the two fluids. Every one knows the
                    phenomenon which happens in this case, and which amuses children under the
                    denomination of <hi rend="italic">Ducks and Drakes</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    but Μ. d’Alembert was the first who explained it in a satisfactory and
                    philosophical manner.</p>
                <p>Two years after his election to a place in the academy he published his treatise
                    on <hi rend="italic">Dynamics.</hi> The new principle developed in this treatise
                    consisted in establishing equality, at each instant, between the changes that
                    the motion of a body has undergone, and the forces or powers which have been
                    employed to produce them; or, to express the thing otherwise, in separating into
                    <hi rend="italic">two parts</hi> the action of the moving powers, and
                    considering the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> as producing alone the motion of the
                    body in the second instant, and the <hi rend="italic">other</hi> as employed to
                    destroy that which it had in the first.</p>
                <p>So early as the year 1744, Μ. d’Alembert had applied this principle to the theory
                    of the equilibrium, and the motion of fluids; and all the problems before solved
                    by geometricians became in some measure its corollaries. The discovery of this
                    new principle was followed by that of a new calculus, the first trials of which
                    were published in a <hi rend="italic">Discourse on the General Theory of the
                    Winds,</hi> to which the prize-medal was adjudged by the academy of Berlin in
                    the year 1746, and which was a new and brilliant addition to the fame of Μ.
                    d’Alembert.</p>
                <p>He availed himself of the favourable circumstance of the king of Prussia having
                    just terminated a glorious campaign by an honourable peace, and in allusion to
                    this, dedicated his work to that prince in the three following Latin verses
                    :—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Hoec ego de ventis, dum ventorum ocyor

                </lg>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Swifter than wind, while of the winds I write, </l>
                    <l part="N"> The foes of conquering Frederick speed their flight; </l>

                    <l part="N"> To the tir’d world the olive branch he sends. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>This flattering dedication procured the philosopher a polite letter from
                    Frederick, and a place among his literary friends.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034983" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4983-0398"/>
                <p>In the year 1747 D’Alembert applied his new calculus of Partial Differences to
                    the problem of vibrating chords, the solution of which, as well as the theory of
                    the oscillation of the air and the propagation of sound, had been given but
                    incompletely by the geometricians who preceded him, and these were his masters
                    or his rivals.</p>
                <p>In the year 1749 he furnished a method of applying his principles to the motion
                    of any body of a given figure; and he solved the problem of the precession of
                    the equinoxes, determined its <hi rend="italic">quantity,</hi> and explained the
                    phenomenon of the nutation of the terrestrial axis, discovered by Dr
                    Bradley.</p>
                <p>In 1752 Μ. d’Alembert published a treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Resistance of
                    Fluids,</hi> to which he gave the modest title of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay,</hi> but which contains a multitude of original ideas and new
                    observations. About the same time he published, in the Memoirs of the Academy of
                    Berl in, <hi rend="italic">Researches concerning the Integral Calculus,</hi>
                    which is greatly indebted to him for the rapid progress it has made in the
                    present century.</p>
                <p>While the studies of Μ. d’Alembert were confined to geometry, he was little known
                    or celebrated in his native country. His connections were limited to a small
                    society of select friends: he had never seen any man in high office except
                    Messrs d’Argenson. Satisfied with an income which furnished him with the
                    necessaries of life, he did not aspire after opulence or honours, nor had they
                    been hitherto bestowed upon him, as it is easier to confer them on those who
                    solicit them, than to look out for men who deserve them. His cheerful
                    conversation, his smart and lively sallies, a happy knack at telling a story, a
                    singular mixture of malice of speech with goodness of heart, and of delicacy of
                    wit with simplicity of manners, rendered him a pleasing and interesting
                    companion; and his company, consequently, was much sought after in the
                    fashionable circles. His reputation at length made its way to the throne, and
                    rendered him the object of royal attention and beneficence. He received also a
                    pension from government, which he owed to the friendship of Count
                    d’Argenson.</p>
                <p>The tranquillity of Μ. d’Alembert was abated when his fame grew more extensive,
                    and when it was known beyond the circle of his friends, that a fine and
                    enlightened taste for literature and philosophy accompanied his mathematical
                    genius. Our author’s eulogist ascribes to envy, detraction, and to other motives
                    equally ungenerous, all the disapprobation, opposition, and censure that Μ.
                    d’Alembert met with on account of the publication of the famous Encyclopedical
                    Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, in conjunction with Diderot. None surely will
                    refuse the well-deserved tribute of applause to the eminent displays of genius,
                    judgment, and true literary taste, with which Μ. d’Alembert has enriched the
                    great work now mentioned. Among others, the Preliminary Discourse which he has
                    affixed to it, concerning the rise, progress, connections, and affinities of all
                    the branches of human knowledge, is perhaps one of the first productions of
                    which the philosophy of the present age can boast, and will be regarded as a
                    striking specimen of just arrangement and sound criticism, and also as a model
                    of accurate thinking and elegant writing.</p>
                <p>Some time after this D’Alembert published his <hi rend="italic">Philosophical,
                    Historical, and Philological Miscellanies.</hi> These were followed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs of Christina, Queen of Sweden,</hi> in which Μ. d’Alembert
                    showed that he was acquainted with the natural rights of mankind, and was bold
                    enough to assert them. His <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Intercourse of Men of
                    Letters with Persons high in Rank and Office</hi> wounded the former to the
                    quick, as it exposed to the eyes of the public the ignominy of those servile
                    chains which they feared to shake off or were proud to wear. A lady of the court
                    hearing one day the author accused of having exaggerated the despotism of the
                    great, and the submission they require, answered slyly, <hi rend="italic">If he
                    had consulted me, I would have told him still more of the matter.</hi></p>
                <p>Μ. d’Alembert gave very elegant specimens of his literary abilities in his
                    translations of some select pieces of Tacitus. But these occupations did not
                    divert him from his mathematical studies; for about the same time he enriched
                    the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi> with a multitude of excellent articles
                    in that line, and composed his <hi rend="italic">Researchesοη several important
                    points of the System of the World,</hi> in which he carried to a higher degree
                    of perfection the solution of the problem of the perturbations of the planets,
                    that had several years before been presented to the Academy.</p>
                <p>In 1759 he published his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Philosophy;</hi> a work
                    extolled as remarkable for its precision and perspicuity; in which, however, are
                    some tenets, relative both to metaphysics and moral science, that are far from
                    being admissible.</p>
                <p>The resentment that was kindled, and the disputes that followed it, by the
                    article <hi rend="italic">Geneva,</hi> inserted in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopédie,</hi> are well known. Μ. d’Alembert did not leave this field of
                    controversy with flying colours. Voltaire was an auxiliary in the contest; but
                    as, in point of candour and decency, he had no reputation to lose, and as he
                    weakened the blow of his enemies by throwing both them and the spectators into
                    fits of laughter, the issue of the war gave him little uneasiness. It fell more
                    heavily on D’Alembert, and exposed him, even at home, to much contradiction and
                    opposition.</p>
                <p>It was on this occasion that the late king of Prussia offered him an honourable
                    asylum at his court, and the place of president of his academy; and was not
                    offended at his refusal of these distinctions, but cultivated an intimate
                    friendship with him during the rest of his life. He had refused, some time
                    before this, a proposal made by the empress of Russia to intrust him with the
                    education of the grand duke; a proposal accompanied with all the flattering
                    offers that could tempt a man ambitious of titles or desirous of making an ample
                    fortune; but the objects of his ambition were tranquillity and study.</p>
                <p>In the year 1765 fie published his <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the
                    Destruction of the Jesuits.</hi> This piece drew upon him a swarm of
                    adversaries, who confirm the merit and credit of his work by their manner of
                    attacking it.</p>
                <p>Besides the works already mentioned, he published nine volumes of memoirs and
                    treatises under the title of <hi rend="italic">Opuscules,</hi> in which he has
                    solved a multitude of problems relative to astronomy, mathematics, and natural
                    philosophy; of which our panegyrist gives a particular account, more especially
                    of those which exhibit new subjects, or new methods of investigation.</p>
                <p>He published also <hi rend="italic">Elements of Music,</hi> and rendered at
                    length the system of Rameau intelligible; but he did not think the mathematical
                    theory of the sonorous body sufficient to account for the rules of that art. He
                    was always fond of music; which, on the one hand, is connected with the most
                    subtile and learned researches of rational mechanics; while, on the other, its
                    power over the senses and the soul exhibits to philosophers phenomena no less
                    singular, and still more inexplicable.</p>
                <p>In the year 1772 he was chosen secretary to the French academy. He formed, soon
                    after this preferment, the design of writing the lives of all the deceased
                    academicians from 1700 to 1772; and in the space of three years he executed this
                    design, by composing 70 eulogies.</p>
                <p>Μ. d’Alembert died on the 29th of October 1783. There were many amiable lines of
                    candour, modesty, disinterestedness, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193034996"
