                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">ALBIGENSES</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Church History,</hi>
                    a sect or party of reformers, about Toulouse and Albigeois, in Languedoc, who
                    sprung up in the 12th century, and distinguished themselves by their opposition
                    to the discipline and ceremonies of the Romish church.</p>
                <p>This sect had their name, it is supposed, either by reason there were great
                    numbers of them in the diocese of Albi, or because they were condemned by a
                    council held in that city. In effect, it does not appear that they were known by
                    this name before the holding of that council. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Albigenses</hi> were also called <hi rend="italic">Albiani,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Albigesei,</hi><hi rend="italic">Albii,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Albanenses,</hi> though some distinguish these last from them. Other names
                    given to them are <hi rend="italic">Henricians, Abelardists, Bulgarians,</hi>
                    &amp;c.; some on account of the qualities they assumed; others on that of the
                    country from whence it is pretended they were derived; and others on account of
                    persons of note who adopted their cause, as Peter de Brius, Arnold de Bresse,
                    Abelard, Henry, &amp;c. Bcrengarius, if not Wickliffe himself, is by some ranked
                    in the number. The <hi rend="italic">Albigenses</hi> are frequently confounded
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Waldenses</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> from whom,
                    however, they differ in many respects, both as being prior to them in point of
                    time, as having their origin in a different country, and as being charged with
                    divers heresies, particularly Manicheism, from whence the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Waldenses</hi> are exempt. But several Protestant writers have vindicated them
                    from that imputation. Dr Allix shows that a great number of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manichees</hi> did spread over the western countries from Bulgaria, and settled
                    in Italy, Languedoc, and other places, where there were also <hi rend="italic"
                    >Albigenses</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by which means, being both under the
                    imputation of <hi rend="italic">heresy,</hi> they came, either by ignorance or
                    malice, to be confounded, and called by the same common name, though in reality
                    entirely different.</p>
                <p>Other errors imputed to them by their opponents, the monks of those days, were,
                    that they admitted two Christs; one evil, who appeared on earth; the other good,
                    who has not yet appeared: that they denied the resurrection of the body, and
                    maintained human souls to be demons imprisoned in our bodies, by way of
                    punishment for their sins: that they condemned all the sacraments of the church,
                    rejected baptism as useless, held the eucharist in abhorrence, excluded the use
                    of confessions and penance, maintained marriage unlawful, laughed at purgatory,
                    prayers for the dead, images, crucifixes, &amp;c. There were likewise said to be
                    two classes of them, the Perfect and the Believers. The perfect boasted of their
                    living in continence, of eating neither flesh, eggs, nor cheese. The believers
                    lived like other men, and were even loose in their morals; but they were
                    persuaded they should be saved by the faith of the perfect, and that none were
                    damned who received imposition of hands from them. But from these charges also
                    they are generally acquitted by Protestants, who consider them as the pious
                    inventions of the Romish church, whose members deem it meritorious by any means
                    to blacken heretics.</p>
                <p>. However this be, the Albigenses grew so formidable, that the Catholics agreed
                    upon a holy league or crusade against them. They were at first supported by
                    Raymond, count of Toulouse· Pope Innocent III., desirous to put a stop to their
                    progress, sent a legate into their country; which failing, he stirred up Phil ip
                    Augustus, king of France, and the other princes and great men of the kingdom, to
                    make war upon them. Upon this the count of Toulouse, who had sided with them,
                    made his submission to the pope, and went over to the Catholics; but soon after,
                    finding himself plundered by -the crusaders, he declared war against them, and
                    was joined by the king of Arragon. His army was defeated at the siege of Muret,
                    where he himself was killed, and the defeat followed by the surrender of the
                    city of Toulouse, and the conquest of the greater part of Languedoc and
                    Provence. His son Raymond succeeded him, who agreed with the king and the pope
                    to set up the inquisition in his estates, and to extirpate the Albigenses. In an
                    assembly held at Milan; the archbishop of Toulouse drew up articles, agreeably
                    to which the count made a most ample declaration against them, which he
                    published at Toulouse in 1253. From this-time the Albigenses dwindled by little
                    and little, till the time of the Reformation, when such of them as were left
                    fell in with the Vaudois, and became conformable to the doctrine of Zuinglius
                    and the discipline of Geneva.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Albigenses</hi> is also a name sometimes given to the
                    followers of Peter Vaud or Waldo, and hence synonymous with what we more
                    properly call <hi rend="italic">Waldenses,</hi> or Poor Men of Lyons. In this
                    sense the word is applied by Camerarius, Thuanus, and several other writers. The
                    reason seems to be, that the two parties agreed in their opposition to the papal
                    innovations and encroachments, though in divers other respects said to be
                    different enough. The bishop of Meaux labours hard to support a distinction
                    between the two sects, alleging that the <hi rend="italic">Albigenses</hi> were
                    heretics and Manichees; whereas the <hi rend="italic">Waldenses</hi> were only
                    schismatics, not heretics; being sound as to articles of faith, and only
                    separating from the church of Rome on account of forms and discipline. Dr Allix
                    endeavours to set aside the distinction, and shows that both of them held the
                    same opinions, and were equally condemned and held for heretics; and this not
                    for points of faith, but for declaiming against the papal tyranny and idolatry,
                    and holding the pope to be the Antichrist; which last, according to Μ. de Meaux,
                    constitutes nothing less than Manicheism. In this sense, the Lollards and
                    Wickliffites in England were not only Albigenses, but Manichees.</p>
