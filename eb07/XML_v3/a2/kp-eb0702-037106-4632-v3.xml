                <p><label type="entry">ALABAMA</label>, a state and constituent member of the North
                    American republic. It is bounded by Florida and the Gulf of Mexicoon the south,
                    the state of Mississippi on the west, Tennessee on the north, and Georgia on the
                    cast. Its length is 275 miles, breadth 185, and area 50,800 square miles. The
                    couιltry, to the extent of more than 100 miles from the coast, consists of
                    uneven lands, of a poor sandy soil, bearing little except pines, but
                    interspersed with marshes and alluvial tracts on the sides of the streams, which
                    are extremely fertile. Higher up, the country becomes fertile and beautiful, and
                    it bears that aspect as far as the mountains occupying the northern part of the
                    state. These mountains are about. 50 miles in breadth, and are supposed to
                    exceed 1500 feet in height, but have peaks rising much higher. They are covered
                    with a stony soil, but on their southern side are many rich and beautiful
                    valleys, clothed with forests of oak, hickery, walnut, gum, and maple. Under the
                    surface are mines of iron-ore. The climate is very hot in the parts below the
                    latitude of 32½, but comparatively temperate in the upper districts. At Fort
                    Stodart, in latitude 31. the mean heat by day was 84° Or 86° in July, and from
                    43° to 79° in February. The principal river in the state is the Alabama, which
                    is formed of two branches, the Tombeckbee, and the proper Alabama. The former
                    rises in the state of</p>
                <p>Mississippi, and after being joined by several streams, joins the Alabama at Fort
                    Stodart. The Coosa and Talapoosa rivers united, compose the proper Alabama,
                    which, after being joined by the Tombeckbee, falls into the Gulf of Mobile at
                    the latitude of 30½. All these rivers are navigable to a great distance from the
                    sea. Steam-boats ply on the Alabama as far up as Montgomery, which is nearly 400
                    miles by water from Mobile Bay, but only 150 by land. The great employment of
                    the people is agriculture. The soil yields wheat, maize, rye, barley, oats, and
                    rice, and sugar-canes; but the principal object of culture is cotton, of which
                    the state exports large quantities. The imports in 1824 amounted to 91,000
                    dollars, and the exports to 460,000. The number of inhabitants in 1820 was
                    127,901, of whom 41,859 were slaves,’and 571 free blacks. In January 1828 it was
                    estimated at 254,000, including 93,000 slaves. This is exclusive of the Creek
                    Indians, who were estimated at 20,000 in 1818. A great portion of the population
                    consists of emigrants from Georgia. Cahawba, a small place, is the seat of
                    government; but the only considerable town in the state is Mobile, which is
                    situated on the west side of the bay of the same name, 30 miles from the Gulf of
                    Mexico and, in 1826, contained 5000 inhabitants. In 1816 some exiles from France
                    re-cèived a grant of lands on the banks of the Tombeckbee, in this state, with
                    the view of introducing the culture of the vine; but the project <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> did not succeed, and the new settlemeht, named
                    Demopolis, was abandoned in a few years. Alabama has very few made roads, and no
                    canals, but by means of its numerous rivers it enjoys a great extent of inland
                    navigation; and Mobile, the great centre of its trade, now communicates by
                    steam-boats with all the considerable places on the Tombeckbee and Alabama
                    rivers, and by sea with New Orleans. Alabama was admitted to the rank of a state
                    and member of the American union in 1819. Its government is vested in a house of
                    representatives elected annually, a senate elected triennial-ly and renewed by
                    thirds, and a governor elected for two years. The right of suffrage belongs to
                    every white citizen of full age. The judges in this state hold their offices
                    during good behaviour. Owing to the thinness of the population, education is yet
                    in a backward state; but as a fund for its promotion, 640 acres of land are set
                    apart in each township. In 1827 the public revenue amounted to 67,000 dollars,
                    and the expenditure to 82,000. The country is healthful, except in the
                    neighbourhood of wet grounds; and, upon the whole, Alabama possesses advantages
                    over some of the other southern states, and is one of the most prosperous and
                    rapidly progressive in that part of the union. (p.)</p>
