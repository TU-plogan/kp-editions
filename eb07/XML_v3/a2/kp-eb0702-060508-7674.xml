                    continent in its physical, moral, and general relations. In attempting this, we
                    do not intend to go much into detail upon those subjects which will be more
                    fully and appropriately discussed in the distinct articles assigned in this work
                    to the several states included in the western world; but we shall dwell at some
                    length upon those great features, peculiarities, and classes of faets, which
                    either belong to it as a whole, or can be most advantageously considered or
                    described when all its parts are viewed in connection with one another. Such are
                    the climate and physical structure of the country, the geographical distribution
                    of its cultivated plants, its indigenous population, its animal tribes, its
                    commercial and political capabilities, and its means of progressive improvement.
                    The new continent may be styled emphatically, “a land of promise.” The place it
                    now occupies in the civilized world is insignificant compared with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037687" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7687-0606"/>
                    what it must attain. The <hi rend="italic">present</hi> there sinks into nothing
                    in itself, and derives all its importance from the germs it contains of a mighty
                    future. The change must not· only be great, but rapid, beyond all which the past
                    history of mankind would lead us to expect. Even after we have familiarized our
                    minds with the principles upon which its progress depends, we find it difficult
                    to reconcile ourselves to the consequences that inevitably result from them. But
                    time will do its work; and the great-grandsons of those now in existence may
                    live to see the new world contain a greater mass of civilized men than the old.
                    It is this greatness in prospect which lends an interest to the western
                    continent, similar to that which the eastern derives from its historical
                    recollections. The same circumstance requires that We should dwell at some
                    length on the physical structure of America, and on those indigenous tribes
                    which, in the course of three centuries, will only live in poetry and tradition.
                    The future history of the new world must be read by us in the configuration of
                    its surface, the distribution of its mountains and rivers, the productions of
                    its soil, its natural and political capabilities, and in the habits and
                    character, rather than the numbers or the actual progress of its civilized
                    inhabitants. .</p><p>The continental part of America extends from the 54th degree of south to the 71st
                    of north latitude, its extreme length, from the Straits of Magellan to those of
                    Behring, being 10,500 English miles. The island of Terra del Fuego reaches one
                    degree beyond its south extremity into the Antarctic Ocean; and Greenland, which
                    is connected by geographers with America, has been traced to the 78th degree of
                    north latitude, and probably is prolonged much farther into the polar circle.
                    The late discoveries of Captains Parry and Franklin have given us much more
                    exact ideas than we formerly possessed of the northern regions of America. The
                    coast of the mainland has been traced from 108° to 149° of west longitude, and
                    is found to run in a direction nearly east and west, in an uneven line lying
                    between the parallels of 67° and 71°. From the strong current which sets
                    eastward through the Straits of the Fury and Hecla, there is little doubt that
                    the arm of the sea visited by Franklin extends from Point Turnagain, in latitude
                    68⅜°, towards these straits, in latitude 70°. On the western side an interval of
                    no more than 160 miles separates the discoveries of Captain Franklin and Captain
                    Beechy; and as the coast at the two nearest points known is almost precisely in
                    the same latitude, there can be little hazard in assuming that the intervening
                    part does not deviate far from the parallel of 71°. The bounds of continental
                    America may therefore be considered as nearly determined on every side. The
                    additional lights furnished by Captain Parry’s voyages render it extremely
                    probable that a great archipelago of islands occupies all the space between the
                    northern coast of the continent and the 80th parallel; and there is even some
                    reason for believing that the country known by the name of Greenland is
                    traversed from east to west by arms of the sea, like the regions recently
                    explored on the west side of Baffin’s Bay.</p><p>The new continent, when compared with the old, enjoys three important advantages.
                    First, it is free from such vast deserts as cover a large part of the surface of
                    Asia and Africa, and which not only withdraw a great proportion of the soil from
                    the use of man, but are obstacles to communication between the settled
                    districts, and generate that excessive heat which is often injurious to health,
                    and always destructive to industry. Secondly, no part of its soil is so far from
                    the ocean as the central regions of Asia and Africa. Thirdly, the interior of
                    America is penetrated by majestic rivers, the Mississippi, Amazon, and Plata,
                    greatly exceeding in magnitude those of the old continent, and surpassing them
                    still more in the vast facilities they present for enabling the remotest inland
                    districts to communicate with the sea.</p><p>According to the geographical system adopted in the old world, America ought to
                    be considered as two distinct continents, connected by the isthmus of Darien.
                    Its two great divisions have evidently more of a defined and separate character
                    than Africa and Asia, or than Asia and Europe; but though this arrangement may
                    be very properly adopted for the purpose of description, it is too late now to
                    think of assigning separate names to regions which have so long been known by a
                    common appellation. In the physical arrangement of the parts of South and North
                    America there is a remarkable resemblance. Both are very broad in the north, and
                    gradually contract as they proceed southward, till they end, the one in a narrow
                    isthmus, and the other in a narrow promontory. Each has a lofty chain of
                    mountains near its western coast, abounding in volcanoes, with a lower ridge on
                    the opposite side, destitute of any trace of internal fire; and each has one
                    great central plain declining to the south and the north, and watered by two
                    gigantic streams, the Mississippi, corresponding to the Plata, and the St
                    Lawrence to the Amazon. In their climate, vegetable productions, and animal
                    tribes, however, the two regions are very dissimilar.</p><p>The extent of the American continent and the islands connected with it is as

                    times as large as Europe, about one third larger than Africa, and almost one
                    half less than Asia, if we include with the latter Australia and Polynesia. It
                    constitutes about three tenths of the dry land on the surface of the globe. Of
                    the continental part of North America, a considerable part is condemned to
                    perpetual sterility by the rigour of the climate, as we shall explain more fully
                    by and by. At present it is sufficient to state, that if we draw a line from the
                    head of Cook’s Inlet, in latitude 61°, on the west side, to the Straits of
                    Bellisle on the east, so as to pass through Fort Churchill, on Hudson’s Bay, we
                    shall cut off a space rather exceeding one. million and a half of square miles,
                    which may be considered as incapable of cultivation. At the south extremity of
                    America, a small tract, extending 200 miles north of the Straits of Magellan,
                    though far within the limits of the temperate zone, is nearly in the same
                    condition. These and the summits of the Andes are the only parts of the American
                    continent which are rendered incapable of cultivation by the severity of the
                    climate.</p><p>The vast chain of the Andes is distinguished by several peculiar features from
                    all other mountains in the world. It has its principal direction nearly north
                    and south, while all the great ridges of the old continent run from east to
                    west; it is unparalleled in its prodigious length, in the richness of its
                    mineral treasures, and in the number and magnitude of its volcanoes. The Andes,
                    ∏ we connect with them the Mexican Cordillera and thθ Rocky Mountains, extend
                    from the Straits of Magellan, m <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037700" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7700-0607"/>a line which
                    may be considered as unbroken, to Point 'Brownlow on the shores of the Arctic
                    Ocean, in the latitude of 70°, over a space equal to 10,000 miles in length, or
                    two fifths of the circumference of the globe. Their height, which attains its
                    maximum within the tropics, declines towards both poles, but in such a manner
                    that, with a few exceptions, its higher summits ascend to the line of perpetual
                    snow from one extremity to the other. It may thus be said to carry the temper of
                    the pole over the whole length of the American continent. The chain of the Andes
                    is common to the two parts of America, and is in fact the link which connects
                    them and makes them one continent. As we propose, however, to describe North and
                    South America separately, we shall reserve the details for another part of this
                    article.</p><p>South America is a peninsula of a triangular form. Its greatest length from north
                    to south is 4550 miles; its greatest breadth 3200; and it covers an area, as
                    already mentioned, of 6,500,000 square English miles, about three fourths of
                    which lie between the tropics, and the other fourth in the temperate zone. From
                    the configuration· of its surface, this peninsula may be divided into five
                    distinct physical regions, of which at present it will be sufficient to sketch
                    the outlines. 1. The low country skirting the shores of the Pacific Ocean, from
                    50 to 150 miles in breadth, and 4000 in length. The two extremities of this
                    territory are fertile, the middle a sandy desert. 2. The basin of the Orinoco,
                    surrounded by the Andes and their branches, a country consisting of extensive
                    plains or <hi rend="italic">steppes,</hi> called Llanos, either destitute of
                    wood or merely, dotted with trees, but covered with a very high herbage during a
                    part of the year. During the dry season the heat is intense here, and the
                    parched soil opens into long fissures, in which lizards and serpents lie in a
                    state of torpor. 3. The basin of the Amazon, a vast plain, embracing a surface
                    of more than two ’millions of square miles, possessing a rich soil and a humid
                    climate. It is covered almost everywhere with dense forests, which harbour
                    innumerable tribes of wild animals, and are thinly inhabited by savages, who
                    live by hunting and fishing. 4. The great southern plain, watered by the Plata
                    and the numerous streams descending from the eastern summits of the Cordilleras.
                    Open <hi rend="italic">steppes,</hi> which are here called Pampas, occupy the
                    greater proportion of this region, which is dry, and in some parts barren, but
                    in general is covered with a strong growth of weeds and tall grass, which feeds
                    prodigious herds of horses and cattle, and affords shelter to a few wild
                    animals. 5. The high country of Brazil, eastward of the Parana and Araguay,
                    presenting alternate ridges and valleys, thickly covered with wood on the side
                    next the Atlantic, and opening into steppes or pastures in the interior.</p><p>The Andes skirt the shores of the Pacific Ocean, like a vast rampart opposed to
                    its encroachments, along the whole line of the western coast, from 12° of north
                    to 53° of south latitude. They derive their name from <hi rend="italic">anti,</hi> a Peruvian word signifying copper. Except at some points where they
                    have been examined by scientific men, their structure is yet but imperfectly
                    known; and hence they are often incorrectly exhibited in our maps. Though often
                    described as a single chain, they generally consist of a succession of ridges,
                    divided by high and narrow valleys; but these ridges, instead of running in
                    parallel lines, generally ramify from central points in all directions, and thus
                    present the appearance of a confused assemblage of small chains. Between the
                    latitudes of 33° and 6° they Spread out their base to an extent of 300 miles,
                    and even much farther, if we take in the smaller subordinate chains. In the
                    intervals between the ridges are situated many lakes, of which the most
                    considerable are Ondalgola, Pataipo, Hages, and the great lake of Titiaca, 200
                    miles in length’. This lake, and the lake Parimé, in Guiana, are the only sheets
                    of fresh water in South America which vie in magnitude with those singular
                    reservoirs placed on the course of the St Lawrence. From the latitude of 6°
                    south to 2° north, the Andes contract their breadth, and form an elevated
                    plateau. One part of this constitutes the Paramo, or desert of Assuay, a plain
                    at the height of 13,000 feet above the sea, and embracing a surface of 50 square
                    miles, where snow-storms are frequent, and only a few alpine plants grow.
                    Farther north lies another range of table-land, from 9000 to 9400 feet in
                    height, near the north extremity of which the town of Quito is situated. On this
                    elevated plain are placed two lines of lofty summits, standing detached from
                    each other, and crowned with diadems of perpetual snow. Their symmetrical
                    disposition led Bouguer to consider the space between the eastern and western
                    lines as a valley; but Humboldt remarks that it is really the crest of the
                    Cordillera, upon which, as a base, the cones or masses of Pinchincha, Antisana,
                    Atacazo, Chimborazo, and others, rest. When we have lived in this elevated spot
                    for some time, “we forget that every thing which surrounds the observer, those
                    villages which proclaim the industry of a mountainous people, those pastures
                    covered with herds of lamas and flocks of European sheep, those orchards, those
                    fields cultivated with care, and promising the richest harvests, hang as it were
                    suspended in the lofty regions of the atmosphere, at a height exceeding that of
                    the Pyrenees.” From Quito, a single chain extends to Popayan, where it parts
                    into three parallel chains. The westmost of these ridges, which scarcely rises
                    to an elevation of 5000 feet, divides the valley of the river Cauca from the
                    Pacific Ocean; and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> branch proceeding from it passes
                    through the isthmus of Panama, where it sinks to the small elevation of 600 or
                    800 feet above the sea. The second or central ridge maintains nearly the general
                    height of the main trunk, and has summits which rise into the regions of
                    perpetual snow. It separates the valley of the Cauca from that of the Magdalena.
                    The pass of Quindiu, described by Humboldt, is one of the Quebra-das, or
                    transverse ravines, which open a path through this mountain. It is so narrow in
                    some places as to have the appearance of a gallery cut artificially and open to
                    day. It is steep and uneven, and is kept almost perpetually wet by the rains.
                    Travellers are carried through this ravine in chairs strapped on the backs of
                    porters, who follow this mode of life voluntarily for the sake of gain, and
                    think themselves sufficiently paid with twelve or fourteen piasters, for a
                    toilsome journey of fifteen or twenty days. Even the bottom of this ravine, at
                    its highest point, is 11,400 feet above the sea, and of course exceeds the
                    highest summit of the Pyrenees in altitude. The third or eastern ridge separates
                    the valley of the Magdalena from the plains of the Rio Meta, and has its
                    northern termination at Cape Vela, in longitude 72°. This chain, though lower
                    than the central one, has summits which reach to the height of 14,000 feet.
                    Between the eastern and central chains is situated the capital of Colombia,
                    Santa Fe, in a large and beautiful plain 8700 feet above the sea, and which,
                    from the perfect level of its surface, and the barrier of rocks that incloses
                    it, appears to have been an ancient lake. The waters of this plain escape by a
                    narrow outlet, and rushing down a cleft, leap at two bounds to a depth of 573
                    feet, forming the celebrated fall of Tequen-dama, which, in the attributes of
                    beauty and sublimity, is said not to be surpassed in the world. These three
                    parallel ridges are properly component parts of the main trunk, like the two
                    ridges of Upper Peru.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193037713" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7713-0608"/><p>The mean height of the Andes in Peru, or that of the continuous ridge,
                    independent of projecting cones, is ' estimated by Humboldt at 11,000 or 12,000
                    feet (1850 toises); in Chili, according to Mr Miers, the most elevated summits,
                    at the latitude 33°, only reach the height of 15,000 feet, and the mean height
                    of the chain is in some places as low as 8000; in Patagonia its height is
                    unknown. Till lately, the loftiest summits were supposed to be in Quito, where
                    Chimborazo attains the prodigious altitude of 21,400 English feet, and the
                    volcanic caves of Antisana and Cotopaxi have the elevations of 19,100 and 18,900
                    feet respectively; but Mr Pentland, an English gentleman attached to the
                    Peruvian embassy, has ascertained, by measurements performed with care, that the
                    mountains of Quito are greatly surpassed in altitude by those of Upper Peru. The
                    Andes here form two chains, which are separated by a large district of
                    table-land, the northern extremity of which is occupied by the lake Titiaca. The
                    eastern chain presents, between the 14th and 17th parallels, a range of
                    snow-covered peaks, of which several have an elevation exceeding 20,000 feet.
                    Among these, towards the north, in the latitude of 15° 30', is Sorate, 25,250,
                    and farther south Illimani, 24,300 feet in height. The former, therefore, is
                    nearly 4000 feet higher than Chimborazo, and only about 1000 feet lower than
                    Mount Jahaver, the highest in the chain of the Himalaya. The western chain is
                    lower than the eastern, but one of its summits has an altitude of 18,800 feet.
                    Mr Pentland concludes, from astronomical observations, that the eastern chain is
                    310 geographical or 360 English miles from the coast. The mineral wealth of the
                    district has attracted a large population to this table-land, which, with the
                    single exception of Thibet, is probably the highest inhabited soil on the face
                    of the globe. Here are flocks, gardens, cultivated fields, and populous cities,
                    suspended above the region of the clouds. La Paz, with 20,000 inhabitants, and
                    Potosi, which had once 150,000, are situated in this plain, at the height of
                    12,190 and 13,500 feet above the level of the sea; and there are cottages near
                    the mines at 15,700 feet, an elevation exceeding that of Mont Blanc.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Bulletin

                    mountains, they yet afford, on the great scale, striking proofs of beneficent
                    design, and of adaptation to the wants of civilized man. Many chains of
                    mountains, for instance, enter within the regions of eternal frost with one or
                    more of their summits; but there is not a single great chain in any of the
                    fruitful and habitable parts of the world which so far transcends this limit as
                    to present an unbroken line of snow along its whole length. The height of the
                    curve of congelation diminishes as we approach the pole; and if there were not a
                    corresponding diminution in the elevation of the mountains, or if the principal
                    chains in the different habitable zones were raised a little higher, they would
                    sever the nations living on their opposite sides as effectually as a wall of
                    brass reaching above the clouds. The Andes, if we disregard their projecting
                    summits, form an unbroken dike about 2∣ miles high, and 4500 miles long. Were
                    three or four thousand feet added to their height, all access across, from one
                    side of the chain to the other, would be denied to the foot of man. If great
                    perils attend the short journey to the summit of Mont Blanc, what human skill or
                    power could encounter the terrors of a snowy desert a hundred miles in breadth,
                    beset with avalanches and visited with storms. In these circumstances, such
                    towns as Arica and La Paz, or Mendoza and Santiago, which are separated only by
                    a journey of three days, would be as far asunder for the purposes of traffic or
                    intercourse as England and Jamaica. But the line which bounds the means of
                    communication varies from clime to clime. Were the Alps as elevated as the
                    Andes, all the passes across the former would be closed; and were the Dofrines
                    as high as the Alps, Sweden and Norway could only communicate by sea. Though the
                    altitude of the Andes in Chili and Patagonia bas never been measured, various
                    circumstances show that the chain descends as it advances from the torrid zone
                    to its southern termination. In Quito and Peru, the back or crest of the ridge
                    is free from snow, which only rests upon isolated summits; and with the aid of
                    such arrangements as would be created by a dense population, the means of
                    passing from one side to the other might perhaps be found wherever they were
                    deemed necessary. In Chili, beyond the latitude of 30°, the highest point of the
                    most frequented pass was found by Mr Miers to be 11,920 feet above the sea; and
                    the courier travels through it even in winter. In Peru and Quito the passes in
                    many cases consist of deep fissures, called <hi rend="italic">quebradas,</hi>
                    apparently produced by earthquakes, extremely narrow, and often descending to

                    Patagonia, where the snow descends much lower, the passes must be few; but there
                    are some, —and this circumstance authorizes the conclusion, that the height of
                    the chain is smaller here than in Chili.</p><p>Three branches or transverse chains proceed from the Andes, nearly at right
                    angles to the direction of the principal chain, and pass eastward across the
                    continent, about the parallels of 18° of south, and 4° and 9° of north latitude.
                    The most northern of these is the “Cordillera of the coast,” which parts from
                    the main trunk near the south extremity of the lakd Maracaybo, reaches the sea
                    at Porto Cabello, and then passes eastward through Ca-raccas to the Gulf of
                    Paria. Its length is about 700 miles, and its medium height from 4000 to 5000
                    feet; but the Silla de Caraccas, one of its summits, has an elevation of 8400
                    feet; and its western part, which is at some distance from the sea, contains the
                    Sierra of Merida, 15,000 feet in height. The second transverse chain is
                    connected with the Andes at the parallels of 3° and 4° north, and passing
                    eastward, terminates in French Guiana, at no great distance from the mouth of
                    the Amazon. It is sometimes called the Cordillera of Parimé, but is named by
                    Humboldt the “Cordillera of the Cataracts of the Orinoco, because this river,
                    which flows amidst its ridges in the upper part of its course, forms the
                    cataracts of Maypure at the point where it descends into the plains. Its mean
                    height is estimated at 4000 feet above the level of the sea; but only a small
                    part of it has been visited by any European. This chain divides the waters of
                    the Orinoco and the rivers of Guiana from the basin of the Amazon, and is
                    covered with magnificent forests. Its breadth is supposed to be from 200 to 300
                    miles, and it incloses amidst its ridges the great lake Parimé, in longitude
                    60°, and several of smaller size. On a table-land forming part of it, about the
                    67th degree of longitude, the Cassiquiary forms an intermediate channel, which
                    connects the rivers Orinoco and Amazon, so that during the annual floods a part
                    of the waters of the former flow into the latter<pb break="no" facs="nls:193037726" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7726-0609"/>. This singular
                    phenomenon was made known long ago by the Spanish missionaries, but was thought
                    to be a fable, till the truth was ascertained by Humboldt. The length of this
                    chain is about 1500 miles. The third transverse chain, which bears various
                    names, and is little known, crosses the continent between the parallels of 12
                    and 18 degrees, connecting the Andes with the mountains of Brazil, and dividing
                    the waters of the Amazon from those of the Plata. It is a broad plateau of
                    elevated land rather than a distinct mountainous ridge, and consists of low
                    hills or uneven plains, with very little wood, presenting in some places
                    extensive pastures, and in others tracts of a poor sandy soil. Its average
                    height probably does not exceed 2000 or 3000 feet above the level of the
                    sea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Travels of Spix and Von Martins in Brazil,</hi> vol. ii. p. 144. Eng.

                    of country, form an irregular plateau, bristled with sharp ridges and peaks.
                    They extend from the shores of the Plata to within a short distance of the
                    Amazon, over a space of 2000 miles; and their greatest breadth may be nearly
                    equal to half their length. Itacolumi, about 250 miles north-west of Rio
                    Janeiro, which is celebrated for its auriferous sands and gravel, and gives
                    birth to three great rivers, the Parana, the St Francisco, and the Tocantin, is
                    considered the most elevated summit, and the stem of the whole group. According
                    to the German miner Eschwege, it rises to the height of 5710 English feet<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Spix’s 7VαwZf, vol. n. p.

                    numerous ridges which branch off from it is supposed to be 3000 or 4000 feet.
                    The western parts of this chain, which are near the centre of the continent, are
                    supposed to be lower than those on the coast; but they are probably as high, if
                    Dr Spix is correct in stating that the mean heat of the year is below G5° of
                    Fahrenheit (15° or 16° of Reaumur).</p><p>The geology of the South American mountains, particularly the Andes, is
                    distinguished, like their physical form and arrangement, by some remarkable
                    peculiarities. The chain of the Andes, as we have already stated, may be
                    considered as an immense dike, from two to three miles in height, and from one
                    to two hundred in breadth. The first and most peculiar feature of this chain is,
                    that it contains within its limits thirty active volcanoes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On some maps 40 are marked, but erroneously.
                    See Memoir on Active Volcanoes, in the French <hi rend="italic">Annuaire</hi>

                    They are irregularly distributed over the whole line from Pasto to Terra del
                    Fuego, but they are most numerous in Chili and Colombia. Some of them throw out
                    smoke merely, some mud and water, and only a few produce eruptions of lava.
                    These must be viewed as the funnels of an« immense laboratory of subterranean
                    fire, extending along the whole chain, and producing, by its internal
                    agitations, those tremendous earthquakes, which have been more frequent and
                    destructive here than in any equal range of country elsewhere in the world. The
                    second peculiarity in the structure of the Andes is closely connected with the
                    first; it is the prodigious space occupied by the basalts, porphyries, and
                    trachytes, that is, by rocks of igneous origin. It is foreign to our purpose to
                    go minutely into geological details; but a general idea of the composition of
                    these mountains may be communicated in a few sentences. The base of the chain
                    consists of granite, which may be conceived to form a long elevation, protruded
                    from below, in the shape of a swoln ridge, from 5000 to 11,000 feet in height.
                    Incumbent on this are strata of gneiss, mica slate, clay slate, and graywacke,
                    but seldom all together, and probably resting generally on the sides of the
                    granite, without covering its summit. Above these, sometimes in beds, but more
                    frequently in amorphous masses, rest immense deposits, first of an old porphyry,
                    next of a newer porphyry rich in metals, then of basalt, clinkstone, and
                    amygdaloids, with masses of trachyte and sienite interspersed in various parts
                    of the series. The order, however, must not be understood to be uniform, or very
                    perfectly determined. Trachyte, it may be necessary to mention, is the oldest
                    rock recognised as a volcanic product: but in the Andes, Humboldt thinks that it
                    graduates into the older porphyry; and the two formations, with all the trap
                    rocks resting above them, must therefore be held to be of igneous origin. Now
                    these volcanic rocks, which occupy but a trifling space in Europe, and never
                    occur at great elevations, form almost everywhere the summits of the Andes, and
                    exhibit at some places the enormous thickness of 10,000 or 12,000 feet. Rocks,
                    therefore, which are the acknowledged progeny of* fire, crown this gigantic
                    chain, and constitute probably one third of its bulk; a remarkable fact in
                    geology, and one that associates naturally with the existence of so great a
                    number of active volcanoes. On the flanks of the Andes are found vast beds of
                    sandstone and coal, of limestone containing fossil shells, and of other
                    secondary formations, up to the <hi rend="italic">quadersandstxin,</hi> or Green
                    Sand of the English geologists. Fossil shells and coal have been discovered at
                    the height of 14,000 feet above the sea, and gypsum and rock-salt occur at
                    various elevations. The third peculiarity in these mountains is the abundance of
                    their mineral treasures, which include extremely rich veins of gold, silver, and
                    copper, and all the other metals. Lastly, the Andes are distinguished by having
                    their sides invested with a thick Coat of clay, in which deep gullies have
                    everywhere been worn by the streams. The great diffusion of internal fire in
                    this chain, the newness of some of the strata found in its interior valleys or
                    on its flanks, the frequency of earthquakes in it, and the singular phenomenon
                    of part of its western margin in Chili, over an extent of thirty leagues, having
                    ascended three or four feet during the subterranean concussions in 1822, have
                    led geologists to infer that the Andes, though surpassing in elevation all other
                    mountains, with a single and doubtful exception, are among the last which have
                    been heaved up from the bottom of the ocean.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Personal Narrative,</hi> vol.

                    partly of secondary formations. The Cordillera of Parime, so far as it has been
                    examined, is entirely composed of primitive rocks, viz. granite, gneiss, mica
                    slate, and hornblende; the Cordillera of Chiquito, which divides the Plata from
                    the Amazon, is only known at its eastern extremity, where it joins the mountains
                    of Brazil. These last consist of a great number of ridges, running in general
                    south and north. Granite abounds in those nearest the Atlantic, but the
                    prevailing rock everywhere else, as far westward as the mountains of Cujaba, in
                    longitude 55°, is a quartzy mica slate, intermixed however with granite, gneiss,
                    and quartz rock, and having portions of secondary sandstone resting on its sides
                    or in its low valleys. This quartzy mica slate, in Brazil, is the ma- , trix of
                    the gold and diamonds; and the former is generally accompanied with platinum and
                    iron. The direction of the strata approaches to north-east and south-west, and

                    mountains, like the Andes, are in many parts covered with a stratum of

                    class, were found by Mr Caldcleugh in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres; and since
                    deposits of rock-salt exist on the east side of the Andes, it is probable that
                    the whole plain of the Plata is occupied by secondary and tertiary

                    to the sea, with the direction of the prevailing winds, are the chief
                    circumstances which determine the nature of the climate. We have already
                    mentioned that three fourths of South America lie within the tropics, and the
                    remaining fourth in the temperate zone; but, in both divisions, it might be
                    naturally inferred that a huge wall like the Andes, rising into the atmosphere
                    to the height of two or three miles, and running across the course of the
                    tropical and extra-tropical winds, would exert a powerful influence on the
                    temperature, humidity, and the distribution of the seasons. This is actually the
                    case; and it is this vast chain of mountains, with its prolongation in North
                    America, which affords a key to the most remarkable peculiarities in the climate
                    of the whole continent. The subject, we think, has not been hitherto well
                    understood, but admits of being explained in a very simple manner.</p><p>The trade-winds blowing from the east occupy a zone 60 degrees in breadth,
                    extending from 30° of south to 30° of north latitude. Beyond these limits are
                    variable winds; but the prevailing direction in the open sea, where no
                    accidental causes operate, is well known by navigators to be from the west. Now
                    these winds are the agents which, transport the equable temperature of the
                    ocean, and the moisture exhaled from its surface, to the interior of the great
                    continents, where it is precipitated in the shape of rain, dew, or snow.
                    Mountains attract the moisture which floats in the atmosphere; they obstruct
                    also the aerial currents, and presenting great inequalities of temperature,
                    favour precipitation. Rain, accordingly, in all countries falls most abundantly
                    on the elevated land. Let us consider, then, what will be the effect of a mural
                    ridge like the Andes in the situation which it occupies. In the region within
                    the 30th parallel, the moisture swept up by the trade-wind from the Atlantic
                    will be precipitated in part upon the mountains of Brazil, which are but low,
                    and so distributed as to extend far into the interior. The portion which remains
                    will be borne westward, and, losing a little as it proceeds, will be arrested by
                    the Andes, and fall down in showers on their summits. The aerial current will
                    now be deprived of all the humidity which it can part with, and arrive in a
                    state of complete exsiccation at Peru, where no rain will consequently fall.
                    That even a much lower ridge than the Andes may intercept the whole moisture of
                    the atmosphere, is proved by a well-known phenomenon in India, where the Ghauts,
                    a chain only 3000 or 4000 feet high, divide summer from winter, as it is called;
                    that is, they have copious rains on their windward side, while on the other the
                    weather remains clear and dry; and the rains regularly change from the west side
                    to the east, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> with the monsoons. In the
                    region beyond the 30th parallel, this effect will be reversed. The Andes will in
                    this case serve as a screen to intercept the moisture brought by the prevailing
                    west winds from the Pacific Ocean; rains will be copious on their summits, and
                    in Chili on their western declivities, but none will fall on the plains to the
                    eastward, except occasionally, when the winds blow from the Atlantic. The
                    phenomena of the weather correspond in a remarkable manner with this hypothesis.
                    On the shores of the Pacific, from Coquimbo, at the 30th parallel, to Amotape,
                    at the 5th of south latitude, no rain falls; and the whole of this tract is a
                    sandy desert, except the narrow strips of land skirting the streams that descend
                    from the Andes, where the soil is rendered productive by irrigation. From the
                    30th parallel southward the scene changes. Rains are frequent; vegetation
                    appears on the surface, and grows more vigorous as we advance southward. “At
                    Conception,” says Captain Hall, “the eye was delighted with the richest and most
                    luxuriant foliage; at Valparaiso the hills were poorly clad with a stunted
                    brushwood and a poor attempt at grass, the ground looking starved and naked; at
                    Coquimbo the brushwood was gone, with nothing in its place but a vile sort of
                    prickly pear bush, and a thin sprinkling of grey wiry grass; at Guasea (latitude
                    28⅜°) there was not a trace of vegetation, and the hills were covered with bare
                    sand.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hall’s <hi rend="italic">Extracts from</hi><hi rend="italic">a Journal,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    12.</p></note> It follows from the principle we have laid down, that in this
                    southern part of the continent the dry tract should be found on the east side of
                    the mountains, and such is the fact. At Mendoza, in latitude 30°, rain scarcely
                    ever falls, and the district along the east foot of the Andes is known to
                    consist chiefly of parched sands, on which a few stunted shrubs grow, and in
                    which many of the streams that descend from the mountains are absorbed before
                    they reach the sea. The whole country, indeed, south of the Plata, suffers from
                    drought; but on the eastern side this is remedied to some , extent by winds from
                    the east or south-east, which bring occasional rains to refresh the soil. From
                    Amotape northward, on the other hand, the west coast is well watered and
                    fruitful; and this is easily accounted for. The line of the coast here changes
                    its direction, and trends to the north-east as far as the Isthmus of Panama,
                    where the mountains sink to a few hundred feet in height, and leave a free
                    passage to the trade-witìd, which here often assumes a direction from the
                    north-east, or even the north. The exhalations of the Atlantic are thus brought
                    in abundance to the coast of Quito, which is in consequence well watered; while
                    the neighbouring district of Peru suffers from perpetual aridity.</p><p>Our principle applies equally to the explanation of some peculiar facts connected
                    with the climate of North America. The western coast of Mexico as far as St Blas
                    or Mazatlan, in latitude 23°, is well watered, because, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> the continent here is narrow; <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> the
                    tableland of Mexico which is much lower than the Andes of Chili, is not so
                    effectual a screen to intercept the moisture; and, <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> there is reason to believe that a branch of the trade-wind, which
                    crosses the low part of the continent at Panama and Nicaragua, sweeps along the
                    west coast during part of the year, and transports humidity with it. But beyond
                    the point we have mentioned drought prevails. Sonora, though visited
                    occasionally by rains, consists of sandy plains without herbage, where the
                    streams lose themselves in the parched soil without reaching the sea; and even
                    Old California, which has the ocean on one side, and a broad gulf on the other,
                    and ought apparently to be excessively humid, is covered with sterile rocks and
                    sandy hills, where the vegetation is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037752" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7752-0611"/>scanty, and no
                    timber is seen except brushwood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"/> Shelvocke’s <hi rend="italic">Voyages,</hi> in Harris’s <hi rend="italic">Collection,</hi> vol. i. p. 232;

                    This dry region extends as far as 33° or 34°; but immediately beyond this we
                    have another change of scene. New California is described as in all respects a
                    contrast to the Old. It is rich, fertile, and humid, abounding in luxuriant
                    forests and fine pastures; and the American possessions to the northward
                    preserve the same character. How can we account for this singular diversity of
                    climate, except upon the principle which has been explained, namely, that in all
                    regions where ranges of mountains intersect the course of the constant or
                    predominant winds, the country on the windward side of the mountains will be
                    moist, and that on the leeward dry; and hence parched deserts will generally be
                    found on the west side of countries within the tropics, and on the east side of
                    those beyond them? Our hypothesis applies equally to the country east of the
                    Rocky Mountains. For the space of about 300 miles from the foot of this chain
                    the surface consists of dry sands or gravel, sometimes covered with saline
                    incrustations, al-mostdestitute of trees and herbage, and watered by streams
                    flowing from the mountains, which are sometimes entirely absorbed by the arid
                    soil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>James’s <hi rend="italic">Expedition from Pittsburg to the Rocky Mountains; Supplement</hi>
                    by Major Long, in vol. iii.</p></note> The central and eastern part of the basin
                    of the Mississippi would in all probability have been equally barren had the
                    configuration of the land been a little different in the south. A tract of
                    country extremely low and level extends along both sides of this river; and a
                    portion of the trade-wind blowing from the Mexican Gulf, finding its motion
                    westward obstructed by the high table-land of the Cordillera, is deflected to
                    the right, and ascends the valley of the Mississippi and Ohio. This wind, whose
                    course was first traced by Volney, bears with it the humidity of the torrid
                    zone, and scatters fertility over a wide region that would otherwise be the
                    abode of barrenness.</p><p>The views on the subject of climate we have been unfolding will enable us to
                    throw some light on an interesting point—the distribution of forests. We are
                    induced to think, that in all countries having a summer heat exceeding 70°, the
                    presence or absence of natural woods, and their greater or less luxuriance, may
                    be taken as a measure of the amount of humidity, and of the fertility of the
                    soil. Short and heavy rains in a warm country will produce grass, which, having
                    its roots near the surface, springs up in a few days, and withers when the
                    moisture is exhausted; but transitory rains, however heavy, will not nourish
                    trees, because after the surface is saturated with water, the rest runs off, and
                    the moisture lodged in the soil neither sinks deep enough, nor is in sufficient
                    quantity to furnish the giants of the forest with the necessary sustenance. It
                    may be assumed that 20 inches of rain falling moderately, or at intervals, will
                    leave a greater permanent supply in the soil than 40 inches falling, as it
                    sometimes does in the torrid zone, in as many hours. It is only necessary to
                    qualify this conclusion by stating, that something depends on the subsoil. If
                    that is gravel, or a rock full of fissures, the water imbedded will soon drain
                    off; if it is clay or a compact rock, the water will remain in the soil. It must
                    be remembered, also, that both heat and moisture diminish as we ascend in the
                    atmosphere, while evaporation increases; and hence that trees will not grow on
                    very high ground, though its position in reference to the sea and the prevailing
                    winds should be favourable in other respects. In speaking of the <hi rend="italic">region of forests,</hi> we neither restrict the term to those
                    districts where the natural woods present an unbroken continuity, nor extend it
                    to every place where a few trees grow in open plains. It is not easy to give a
                    definition that will be always appropriate; but in using the expression, we wish
                    to be understood as applying it to ground where the natural woods cover more
                    than one fourth of the surface.</p><p>The small map of America prefixed will enable the reader to follow our statements
                    with ease. The long hatched lines show the positions of the chains of mountains;
                    the shading represents the regions of forests; the dense forests being marked by
                    the double shading, and the thinner ones by the open lines. The white spaces
                    represent the lands on which little or no wood grows. The equator and the
                    parallel of 30° on each side are indicated by the <choice><corr instant="false">horizontal</corr><sic>horziontal</sic></choice> lines marked 0 and 30. The arrows show the direction of the prevailing
                    winds; but it must be remembered that, though the intertropical wind is assumed
                    to have its course right from the east, this is only true at the equator, its
                    direction inclining to north-east as we approach the northern tropic, and to the
                    south-east as we approach the southern. In North America A is the woody region
                    on the west coast, extending from latitude 35° to about 58°, and of unknown
                    breadth. B the region on the east side of the Rocky Mountains, partly a bare
                    desert, partly covered with grass and dotted with trees. C the forests of the
                    Allegany chain, thick on the east and south, and thin on the west; bounded by a
                    curved line passing from St Luis, in Mexico through lake Huron, to the mouth of
                    the St Lawrence, in latitude 50°. The arrow at M points out the direction of the
                    wind, which ascends the valley of the Mississippi, and nourishes the western
                    part <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037765" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7765-0612"/>of thèse forests; and the arrow at R that which
                    blows across the isthmus of Panama. D is the table-land of Mexico graduating on
                    the north-west into the dry plains of Sonora and California, all bare, or nearly
                    bare, of wood. E is the Llanos or bare plains of Caraccas, nearly fenced round
                    with mountains. F G is the long strip of bare dry sands on the west side of the
                    Andes which constitutes Lower Peru and the north part of Chili; and N is
                    Amotape, its northern boundary. H is the great region of forests which
                    constitutes the basin of the Amazon, and occupies all the rest of Brazil. Near
                    the equator the moisture is so excessive, that after 150 or 200 inches of
                    rain<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Personal Narrative,</hi> vol. vi. p. 277.</p></note> have fallen
                    on the east coast, there is still sufficient humidity in the atmosphere to
                    afford copious showers to all the country up to the Andes. Here, therefore, the
                    woods reach from side to side of the continent. But as we recede from the
                    equator the humidity diminishes rapidly; and though the continent becomes
                    narrower towards the south, the supply of rain falls off in a still greater
                    proportion, and the forests extend over a much smaller space. At the foot of the
                    Andes, the forests extend to 16° or 18° of south latitude; on the east coast to
                    25° or probably 30°. K L are the <hi rend="italic">Pampas</hi> or open lands of
                    Buenos Ayres, extending on the east side of the Andes, from Cape Horn to the
                    latitudes just mentioned. If we divide this region into three parts, the
                    eastmost, refreshed by occasional rains from the Atlantic, is covered with a
                    strong nutritive herbage; the second, which is drier, displays a thin coarse
                    wiry grass; and the third portion, which extends to the Andes, receiving little
                    or no <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> rain, is nearly a desert: all the three are
                    destitute of timber, but the surface of the third is dotted with dwarfish
                    shrubs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mr Miers’

                    are from the west, coming loaded with the moisture of the Pacific Ocean, produce
                    copious rains to nourish the herbage and the forests. This applies, however,
                    chiefly to the country south of the 35th parallel. From that to Coquimbo, in
                    latitude 30°, the wood is scanty. Beyond 50° on the east coast of North America,
                    and 55° or 58° on the west, very little wood grows, in consequence of the rigour
                    of the climate.</p><p>Great misapprehensions have arisen with regard to the climate of America, from
                    comparisons being drawn between the east side of the new continent and the west
                    side of the old. We have already pointed out the influence of winds blowing from
                    the sea, in modifying the state of the atmosphere over the land, both as to heat
                    and humidity. When this circumstance is attended to, and when the east and west
                    sides of the old and the new continents are respectively compared with one
                    another, the difference is found to be small, and easily accounted for. In the
                    torrid zone, and on the sea-shore, the temperature of both continents is found
                    to be the same, viz. 82°; but in the interior the difference is rather in favour
                    of America. There is no counterpart in the new world to the burning heats felt
                    in the plains of Arabia and Gedrosia. Even in the western and warmest part of
                    the parched steppes of Caraccas, the hottest known region in America, the
                    temperature of the air during the day is only 98° in the shade, while it rises
                    to 112° in the sandy deserts which surround the Red Sea. At Calabozzo, farther
                    east in the Llanos, the common temperature of the day is only from 88° to 90°;
                    and at sunrise the thermometer sinks to 80°.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Personal Narrative,</hi> vol.
                    iv. p. 315-325.</p></note> The basin of the Amazon is shaded with lofty woods;
                    and a cool breeze from the east, a minute branch of the trade-wind, ascends the
                    channel of the stream, following all its windings, almost to the foot of the'
                    Andes. Hence this region, though under the equator, and visited with almost
                    constant rains, is neither excessively hot nor unhealthful. Brazil, and the vast
                    country extending westward from it between the Plata and the Amazon, is an
                    uneven table-land, blest with an equable climate. At Rio Janeiro, which stands
                    low, and is exposed to a heat comparatively great, the temperature in summer
                    varies from 16° to 22° of Reaumur, and the mean is only about 19° (74° Fahr.)
                    Farther north, and in the interior, the Indians find it necessary to keep fires
                    in their huts; and in the country near the sources of the Paraguay, hoar-frost
                    is seen on the hills during the colder months, and the mean temperature of the
                    year falls below 65° or 67°.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Spix s <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    145.'</p></note> On the declivities of the Andes, and on the high plains of
                    Upper Peru, the heats are so moderate that the plants of Italy, France, and
                    Germany, come to maturity. Lower Peru, though a sandy desert, enjoys a wonderful
                    degree of coolness, owing to the fogs which intercept the solar rays. At Lima,
                    which is 540 feet above the sea, the temperature varies from 53° to 82°, but the
                    mean for the whole year is only 72°. In the plains of La Plata, the mean
                    temperature of the year is very nearly the same as at the corresponding north
                    latitudes on the east side of the Atlantic. At Buenos Ayres, for instance, the
                    mean annual heat is 19° 7 ’ of the centigrade thermometer (68° Fahr.), while
                    that of places on the same parallel in the old world is 19° 8 ’. The range of
                    temperature is probably greater in the basin of the Plata; but as we advance
                    southwards, the diminishing breadth of the continent makes the climate
                    approximate to that of an island, and the extremes of course approach each
                    other. In the Straits of Magellan the temperature of the warmest month does not
                    exceed 43° or 46°; and snow falls almost daily in the middle of summer, though
                    the latitude corresponds with that of England. But the inference drawn from
                    this, that the climate is unmatched for severity, is by no means just, for the
                    winter at Staten Island is milder than in London. In point of fact, the climate
                    of Patagonia is absolutely colder than that of places in the same latitude in
                    Europe; but the difference lies chiefly in the very low temperature of the
                    summer. This peculiarity no doubt results chiefly from the greater coldness of
                    the sea in the southern hemisphere; for beyond the parallel of 48°, the
                    difference of temperature in the north and south Atlantic amounts, according to
                    Humboldt, to 10 or 12 degrees of Fahrenheit’s scale.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Distributione Geographica Plantarum,</hi> p. 82; <hi rend="italic">Pers.</hi><hi rend="italic">Nar.</hi> vol. ii∙ p∙ ^5∙</p></note> If we push our researches
                    a step farther, and inquire what is the cause of the greater warmth of the
                    northern sea, we shall be forced to admit that a very satisfactory answer cannot
                    be given. Something may be due to the influence of the gulf stream, a minute
                    branch of which is supposed to carry the waters of the torrid zone to the shores
                    of Shetland and Norway; but such an agent seems too trifling to account for the
                    phenomenon. The sum, then, of the peculiar qualities which distinguish the
                    climate of South America may be briefly stated. Near the equator the new
                    continent is perhaps more humid than the old; and within the tropics generally,
                    owing to its vast forests, the absence of sandy deserts, and the elevation of
                    the soil, it is cooler. Beyond the tropics the heat is nearly the same in the
                    southern temperate zone of America and the northern<pb break="no" facs="nls:193037778" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7778-0613"/> one of the old
                    continent, till we ascend to the neighbourhood of Cape Horn, where we have cold
                    summers, and a very limited range of the thermometer in the western
                    hemisphere.</p><p>Nine tenths of North America lying under the temperate zone, the climate follows
                    a different law from what is observed in the southern peninsula, and presents
                    more striking contrasts with that of the best known parts of the old world. The
                    long narrow region now denominated Central America, which connects the two great
                    divisions of the continent, stretching from Panama to Tehuantepec, has in
                    general a very humid atmosphere; but, for a tropical country, it must be only
                    moderately hot, as every part of it is within a small distance of the sea. At
                    Vera Paz the rains fall during nine months of the year. Mexicois hot, moist, and
                    unhealthy on the low coasts; but two thirds of its area, comprising all the
                    populous districts, consist of table-land, from 5000 to 9000 feet in height. In
                    consequence of this singular configuration of its surface, Mexico though chiefly
                    within the torrid zone, enjoys a temperate and equable climate. The mean heat at
                    the capital, which is 7400 feet above the sea, is 621°, and the difference
                    between the warmest and coldest months, which exceeds 30° at London, is here
                    only about 12°; but the atmosphere is deficient in moisture, and the country
                    suffers from drought. Beyond the parallel of 24°, the western shores are hot and
                    arid.</p><p>In the extensive region lying between the parallels of 30° and 50°, which
                    comprehends three fourths of the useful soil of North America, we have three
                    well-marked varieties of climate, that of the east coast, the west coast, and
                    the basin of the Mississippi. On the east coast, from Georgia to Lower Canada,
                    the mean temperature of the year is lower than in Europe by 9° at the latitude
                    of 40°, and by 12½° at the latitude of 50°, according to Humboldt’s calculation.
                    In the next place, the range of the thermometer is much greater than in Europe,
                    the summer being much hotter and the winter much colder. At Quebec the
                    temperature of the warmest month exceeds that of the coldest by no less than
                    60∙∣∙ degrees of Fahrenheit; while at Paris, which is nearly under the same
                    latitude, the difference is only 31 degrees. In the third place, the climate
                    undergoes a more rapid change in America as we proceed from south to north, a
                    degree of latitude in the middle of the temperate zone producing a decrease of
                    annual temperature of 1∙13° in Europe, and of 1∙57° in America. The comparison
                    is greatly to the disadvantage of America when made in this form; but when the
                    east coasts of the two continents are compared, the case is altered: the old
                    world is found to have no superiority over the new, for Pekin has still colder
                    winters and warmer summers than Philadelphia, which is under the same latitude.
                    It is the west coast of the new continent which ought to exhibit the climate of
                    Europe; and from the few facts known, we have reason to believe that it is quite
                    as mild and equable. At the mouth of Columbia River, in latitude 46⅜°, Captains
                    Lewis and Clarke found the rains to be copious and frequent; but they had very
                    little frost, and saw no ice even in the depth of winter. From observations made
                    in 1822-3-4, it appears that the mean heat of the warmest month was about 62°,
                    of the coldest about 36°, and of the whole year 51°.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi><hi rend="italic">Journal of Science,</hi> April 1827.</p></note> Now, the place is
                    under the same latitude with Quebec, where the snow lies five months, and the
                    mean temperature during the three winter months is 18° below the freezing point.
                    This single circumstance marks emphatically the contrast in the climate of the
                    east and west coasts of North America. But the mouth of Columbia River is also
                    under the same parallel with Nantes at the mouth of the Loire, where snow and
                    ice are no strangers in the cold season of the year. We have, therefore, good
                    grounds to conclude that the west coast of America, in the middle latitudes, has
                    fully as mild and equable a climate as the west coast of Europe. The climate of
                    the great central valley, or basin of Mississippi, has a considerable affinity
                    to that of the east coast. It was long a matter of dispute in what the
                    difference between the two consists; but this seems at last to have been clearly
                    settled, by the meteorological registers kept at the military posts of the
                    United States. From a comparison of four of these registers, from posts near the
                    centre of this great valley, with others kept on the Atlantic coast in the same
                    latitudes, it appears that in the hottest month the temperature is from 5° to 6°
                    higher, and in the coldest month as much lower, in the basin of the Mississippi,
                    than on the coasts of New England. The proportion of fair weather to cloudy is
                    as 5 to 1 in favour of the east coast.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Keating’s <hi rend="italic">Account of Major Long’s Second
                    Expedition,</hi> 1824, vol. ii. p. 417.</p></note> The climate of the interior,
                    therefore, exhibits in still greater excess those extremes of temperature which
                    distinguish the eastern coast of this continent from the western, and from the
                    shores of Europe. The fourth region of extra-tropical America includes the parts
                    beyond Mount St Elie on the west coast, and, in the interior, the plains
                    extending from the 50th parallel to the Polar Seas. The intensity of the cold in
                    this tract of country is scarcely equalled by any thing that is known under the
                    same parallels in northern Asia. The northmost spot in America where grain is
                    raised is at Lord Selkirk’s colony, on Red River, in latitude 50°. Wheat, and
                    also maize, which requires a high summer heat, are cultivated here.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid. vol.
                    ii.</hi> chap. ii.</p></note> Barley would certainly grow as far north as Fort
                    Chippcwyan, in latitude 58¾°, where the heat of the four summer months was found
                    by Captain Franklin to be 4 degrees higher than at Edinburgh. There is even
                    reason to believe, that both this species of grain and potatoes might thrive as
                    far north as Slave Lake, since the spruce fir attains the height of 50 feet
                    three degrees farther north, at Fort Franklin, in latitude 65°. These, however,
                    were low and sheltered spots; but in this dreary waste generally, it will not be
                    found practicable, we suspect, to carry the arts of civilized life beyond the
                    60th parallel; and the desirable country, capable of supporting a dense
                    population, and meriting the name of temperate, can scarcely be said to extend
                    beyond the 50th parallel. At 65° the snow covers the ground in winter to the
                    depth of only two feet, but small lakes continue frozen for eight months. The
                    sea is open only for a few weeks, fogs darken the surface, and the thermometer
                    in February descended, in one instance, to <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> 58°, or
                    90° below the freezing point. At Melville Island, under the 75th parallel, such
                    is the frightful rigour of the climate, that the temperature of the year falls
                    1° or 2° below the zero of Fahrenheit’s scale. It is a peculiarity in the
                    climate of America, that beyond the parallel of 50° or 52°, it seems to become
                    suddenly severe at both extremities. At the one, summer disappears from the
                    circle of the seasons; at the other, winter is armed with double terrors.</p><p>The mountains of North America will not detain us long. The branch of the Andes
                    which divides the seas at the isthmus of Panama is very low, the highest point
                    of the road which crosses it, from this city to the mouth of the river Chagres,
                    having been found, by levellings executed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193037791" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7791-0614"/> in 1829, to be
                    only 633 feet above the Pacific.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Paper by Mr Lloyd, read at a meeting of the Royal Society of
                    London in January 1830.</p></note> Of the height of the ground, from this point
                    to the tableland of La Puebla, 1400 miles to the westward, Humboldt remarks that
                    nothing certain is known. The most considerable elevations are on the south-west
                    side; and twenty-one volcanoes, scattered over this limited space, afford proof
                    that the sources of internal fire exist here in unexampled abundance. From
                    Puebla to Durango the Mexican mountains no longer present the appearance of a
                    chain, but spread out to a table-land or elevated plain, from 5000 to 9000 feet
                    in height, and from 100 to 300 miles in breadth. Across this plain, exactly at
                    the 19th parallel, five volcanoes are distributed, in a line running east and
                    west, as if a vast rent, extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific, had opened
                    a passage for the internal fires of the globe at this spot. Two of these on the
                    east side of the continent, with a group of four or five other cones lying
                    between Jalapa and Cordoba, have an elevation exceeding 17,000 feet, and are the
                    only mountains in New Spain that rise to the region of perpetual snow, which
                    commences here at 15,000 feet above the Ievel of the sea. Jorullo, the lowest of
                    the five volcanoes, rose suddenly, in the middle of a plain, in September 1759,
                    after fearful concussions of the ground, continued for fifty or sixty days. It
                    is 1600 feet high, and is surrounded by a number of smaller cones or burning
                    masses, all resting on a portion of the plain four square miles in extent, which
                    was heaved up in the form of a tumefied dome. Near the tropic the Mexican
                    Cordillera divides into three parts. One runs parallel to the eastern coast, at
                    the distance of thirty or forty leagues, and terminates in New Leon. Another
                    proceeds in a north-western direction, and sinks gradually as it approaches the
                    Californian Gulf, in Sonora. The third or central Cordillera traverses Durango
                    and New Mexico divides the sources of the Rio Gila from the Rio Bravo del Norte,
                    and forms the eastern ridge or main trunk of the Rocky Mountains, which
                    terminates at the Arctic Ocean, about 125° of west longitude. From the southern
                    point of California, a lower chain skirts the coast as far as the volcano of
                    Mount St Elie, in latitude 60°; and between this chain and the eastern several
                    intermediate ones occur, the whole forming apparent-Iy an elevated plateau from
                    200 to 800 miles in breadth. This extensive region is at present a <hi rend="italic">terra incognita,</hi> but the lower valleys included in it between
                    the parallels of 34° and 50°, having neither the excessive humidity of the west
                    coast, nor the extreme heat and cold of the east, will probably be found to
                    present a fine soil, and the most desirable climate in North America. Many of
                    the summits of the Rocky Mountains are within the region of perpetual snow; and
                    their height, where Lewis and Clarke crossed them, and farther south, has been
                    estimated at 10,000 or 12,000 feet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Major Long’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> and the

                    the west coast has since been found, in the direction of the Platte River, about
                    latitude 41°, where an opening in the chain presents a passage so easy of
                    access, that a waggon drawn by horses, it is said, might travel through it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Warden’s <hi rend="italic">Account of the United States,</hi> vol. iii. p. 180.</p></note></p><p>The Allegany Mountains are composed of three, four, and in some places of five
                    parallel chains, extending in a north-east direction from Alabama to New
                    Brunswick, over a space 1100 miles in length, with a breadth varying from 100 to
                    150 miles, and a mean height of 2000 or 3000 feet. They are almost everywhere
                    clothed with forests, and interspersed with delightful valleys. Between the
                    Alleganies and the great western chain, the Ozark Mountains, from 1000 to 2000
                    feet in height, and 500' miles in length, extend along the middle of the great
                    valley of the Mississippi in a south and north direction. The Arkansas and Red
                    River are the only streams that have cut a passage through these mountains,
                    which, though low, occupy a great breadth, and are covered with wood.</p><p>The Allegany Mountains present what must be considered their scarp or steepest
                    side to the east, where granite, gneiss, and other primitive rocks are seen.
                    Upon these repose, first, a thin formation of transition rocks, dipping to the
                    westward; and next a series of secondary rocks, including a very extensive coal
                    formation, reachm«· from Pittsburg, beyond the Mississippi. The Ozark Mountains
                    exhibit similar strata, from the granite to the coal, in the same position and
                    order, and therefore consist, in all probability, of a western portion of the
                    same beds, heaved to the surface by one of those slips or dislocations with
                    which miners are familiar. In the Rocky Mountains primitive rocks are found in
                    the centre or axis of the chain, with old red standstone, coal, and new red
                    sandstone, containing rock-salt leaning against its sides. A great tract
                    eastward of this chain is covered by granitic sands, and near the bed of the
                    Mississippi there is a deep formation of alluvium. The geology of Mexicowould
                    require a more ample development than we have room for. Suffice it to say, that
                    the table-land consists chiefly of transition slaty rocks, having their
                    direction south-east and north-west, intermixed with which are two species of
                    limestone, and enormous masses of porphyry, trachyte, sienite, phonolite,
                    basalt, volcanic tuff, and other rocks of igneous origin. The veins of silver
                    and gold are found chiefly in the older porphyry, the granular limestone,
                    sienite, and transition slates.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    The Mississippi, with its branches, affords a greater amount of inland
                    navigation than all the streams, great and small, which irrigate Europe; and the
                    Plata, in this respect, may probably claim a superiority over the collective
                    water of Africa. But the American rivers not only surpass those of the old world
                    in length and volume of fluid, but they are so placed as to penetrate everywhere
                    to the very heart of the continent. By the Amazon, a person living at the
                    eastern foot of the Andes, 2000 miles of direct distance from the Atlantic, may
                    convey himself or his property to the shores of that sea in forty-five days,
                    almost without effort, by confiding his bark to the gliding current. If he
                    wishes to return, he has but to spread his sails to the eastern breeze, which
                    blows perennially against the stream. The navigation is not interrupted by a
                    single cataract or rapid, from the Atlantic to Jaen, in west longitude 78°,
                    where the surface of the stream is only 1240 feet above the level of its estuary
                    at Para. The remotest and least accessible part of North America is the great
                    interior plain extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Alleganies and the
                    lakes, between the parallels of 40° and 50°; but the Mississippi, Missouri, and

                    Spain and Hungary. It is only necessary to cast the eye over a map of South
                    America, to see that all the most sequestered parts of the interior are visited
                    by branches of the Plata and the Amazon. These streams, having their courses in
                    general remarkably level, and seldom interrupted by cataracts, may be
                    considered, without a figure, as a vast system of natural canals, terminating in
                    two main trunks, which communicate with the ocean at the equator and the 35th
                    degree of south latitude. Since the invention of steam navigation, rivers are,
                    in the truest sense of the term, Nature’s highways, especially for infant
                    communities, where the people are too poor, and live too widely dispersed, to
                    bear the expense of constructing roads. There is little risk in predicting, that
                    in two or three centuries the Mississippi, the Amazon, and the Plata, will be
                    the scenes of an active inland commerce, far surpassing in magnitude any thing
                    at present known on the surface of the globe. The Mississippi is navigable for
                    boats from the sea to the falls of its principal branch the Missouri, 1700 miles
                    from the Mexican Gulf in a direct line, or 3900 by the stream; and the whole
                    amount of boat navigation afforded by the system of rivers, of which the
                    Mississippi is the main trunk, has been estimated as equal to 40,000 miles in
                    length, spread over a surface of 1,350,000 square miles. Perhaps this is rather
                    beyond the truth; but let us call the navigation 35,000 miles, and the following
                    table will exhibit the lengths, size of the basins, and probable extent of the
                    navigable waters of the greater rivers of America.</p><p>Among the branches of the Amazon, the Tunguragua, or Upper Maranon, which rises
                    in a lake 100 miles north of Lima, has generally been considered as its source;
                    but this honour is rather due to the Beni, a branch of the Ucayale, which has
                    its origin in the table-land of Upper Peru, near the town of La Paz, in south
                    latitude 18°. The Amazon contains many islands, is broad, and in the upper part
                    so deep, that on one occasion Condamine found no bottom with a line 103 toises
                    long. At its mouth, two days before and after the full moon, the phenomenon
                    called a <hi rend="italic">Bore</hi> occurs in a very formidable shape. It is a
                    wave of water rushing from the sea, with its front as steep as a wall and as
                    high as a house. No small vessel can encounter it without certain
                    destruction.</p><p>The estuaries of all these great American rivers open to the eastward; and thus
                    Providence seems to have plainly indicated that the most intimate commercial
                    relations of the inhabitants of America should be with the western shores of the
                    old world. It should at the same time be observed, that this position of the
                    great rivers of America is but one example of a physical arrangement which is
                    common to the whole globe; for it is remarkable that, in the old world as well
                    as the new, no river of the first class flows to the westward. Some, as the
                    Nile, the Lena, and the Oby, flow to the north; others, as the Indus and the
                    rivers of Ava, to the south; but the largest, as the Wolga, Ganges, Great River
                    and Yellow River of China, the Euphrates, and the Amour, have their courses to
                    the east or south-east. This arrangement is not accidental, but depends most
                    probably on the inclination of the primary roqķs, which, in all cases where
                    their <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> approaches to south and north, seem to
                    have their steepest sides to the west and their longest declivities to the east.
                    We have examples in the Scandinavian Alps, the mountains of Britain, the Ghauts
                    of India, the Andes, and the Rocky Mountains.</p><p>North America, like the southern peninsula, naturally divides itself into five
                    physical regions: 1. The tableland of Mexico with the strip of low country on
                    its eastern and western shores; 2. The Plateau lying between the Rocky Mountains
                    and the Pacific Ocean, a country with a mild and humid atmosphere as far north
                    as the 55th parallel, but inhospitable and barren beyond this boundary; 3. The
                    great central valley of the Mississippi, rich and well wooded on the east side,
                    bare but not unfertile in the middle, dry, sandy, and almost a desert on the
                    west; 4. The eastern declivities of the Allegany Mountains, a region of natural
                    forests, and of mixt but rather poor soil; 5. The great northern plain beyond
                    the 50th parallel, four fifths of which is a bleak and bare waste, overspread
                    with innumerable lakes, and resembling Siberia both in the physical character of
                    its surface and the rigour of its climate.</p><p>The indigenous population of America presents man under many aspects, and society
                    in various stages, from the regular but limited civilisation of Mexicoand Peru,
                    to savage life in its most brutal state of abasement. At one extremity of the
                    country we find the pigmy Esquimaux of four feet and a half in height, and at
                    the other the Patagonian giants of seven feet. In complexion the variety is
                    great, and may be said to embrace almost every hue known elsewhere on the face
                    of the earth, except the pitchy black of the negro. About one half of all the
                    known languages belong to America; and if we consider every little wandering
                    horde a distinct community, we have a greater number of nations here than in all
                    the rest of the world. Amidst all this diversity, philosophers have thought they
                    were able to discover certain general characters, sufficiently marked to
                    distinguish the American nations from those of the old continent. It is foreign
                    to our purpose to inquire whether the varieties of form, stature, and
                    complexion, in the human species, are modifications produced by external causes
                    operating differently on distinct portions of the progeny of one primitive pair,
                    or whether several races were originally created, and have given birth, by their
                    mixture, to the amazing varieties we witness. We assume the former opinion as
                    true, because the probabilities seem to be in its favour; but the phenomena
                    present themselves to us in the same light in whichever way they originate.</p><p>Physiologists are not at one in their accounts of the characteristics of the
                    aborigines of the new world, nor are they agreed as to whether they should be
                    considered one race or several. Blumenbach places them all under one class,
                    except the Esquimaux. Bory St Vincent, an ingenious but fanciful writer, in a
                    recent work,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">L'Homme</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">Essai</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoologique,</hi> vol. ii. Paris, 1827.</p></note>
                    divides them into four races, or into five if we include the Esquimaux, under
                    the following<pb break="no" facs="nls:193037817" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7817-0616"/> designations :—1. The <hi rend="italic">Colombian·,</hi> which comprehends the tribes formerly inhabiting the Allegany
                    Mountains, Canada, Florida, the eastern coasts of Mexico and Central America;
                    and the Caribs, who occupied the West India Islands and Guiana. 2. The <hi rend="italic">American,</hi> embracing the tribes which occupy all the other
                    parts of South America east of the Andes, except Patagonia. 3. The <hi rend="italic">Patagonian</hi> race, inhabiting the south extremity of the

                    coasts of both divisions of the continent, from California to Cape Horn, and
                    which he considers as essentially the same with the race spread over the Malay
                    Peninsula and the Indian Archipelago. ' With this race he classes the Mexicans
                    and Peruvians. By another writer<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Histoire Naturelle</hi><hi rend="italic">des Races</hi><hi rend="italic">Humaines,</hi> par A. Desmoulins. Paris,

                    all the North American tribes, with the Caribs, the Mexicans, and Peruvians, and
                    other inhabitants of the Cordillera; and the latter the Brazilian Indians and
                    Patagonians. None of these systems, when compared with facts, is very
                    satisfactory. Dr Prichard thinks that the mutual resemblance among the American
                    nations has been exaggerated by some writers; yet it is certain that there is
                    more of a common family character in their organization than in that of the
                    indigenous population of Asia or Africa. “The Indians of New Spain,” says
                    Humboldt, “bear a general resemblance to those who inhabit Canada, Florida,
                    Peru, and Brazil. We have the same swarthy and copper colour, straight and
                    smooth hair, small beard, squat body, long eye, with the corner directed upwards
                    towards the temples, prominent cheek-bones, thick lips, and expression of
                    gentleness in the mouth, strongly contrasted with a gloomy and severe look. Over
                    a million and a half of square leagues, from Cape Horn to the river St Lawrence
                    and Behring’s Straits, we are struck at the first glance with the general
                    resemblance in the features of the inhabitants. We think we perceive them all to
                    be descended from the same stock, notwithstanding the prodigious diversity of
                    their languages. In the portrait drawn by Volney of the Canadian Indians, we
                    recognise the tribes scattered over the Savannahs of the Apure and the Carony.
                    The same style of features exists in both Americas.”</p><p>The American race is distinguished by the form of the skull, which strongly
                    resembles the Mongol type. The forehead recedes more than in any other variety
                    of the human species; the cheek-bones are prominent, but not so angular, as in
                    the Mongol head; the occiput is rather flat, the cavity for lodging the
                    cerebellum small, the orbits large and deep. The nose is generally aquiline, but
                    in some tribes flat; and the nasal cavities are large. Compared with the head of
                    the Negro, that of the American is much broader, and the teeth are less
                    prominent: when placed by the side of the Caucasian head, it is seen to be
                    smaller in size, less rounded and symmetrical, and less developed in the part
                    before the ear. The skull is generally thin and light. There are, however, many
                    deviations from this central form. The Carib skull, and the Araucanian, are
                    large; the Peruvian small, and singularly flattened behind, so as to present a
                    short line from the forehead to the occiput.</p><p>The colour of the Americans, though it includes a considerable diversity of
                    shade, is more uniform than that of the inhabitants of Asia or Africa; and, what
                    is more remarkable, its varieties do not bear any visible relation to the
                    temperature of the climate. A brownish yellow, or copper colour, as it has been
                    called, pervades nearly all the numerous tribes from the Arctic Ocean to Cape
                    Horn but still with many different degrees of intensity. The eastern nations of
                    Chili have but a slight tinge of the brown colour, and the Boroanes are said to
                    be as white as the northern Europeans. On the north-west coast, from latitude
                    43° to 60°, there are tribes who, though embrowned with soot and mud, were
                    found, when their skins were washed, to have the brilliant white and red which
                    is the characteristic of the Caucasian race. But within the tropics, the
                    Malapoques in Brazil, the Guayanis in Paraguay, the Guiacas of Guiana, the
                    Scheries of La Plata, have tolerably fair complexions, sometimes united with
                    blue eyes and auburn hair; and, in the hot country watered by the Orinoco
                    Humboldt found tribes of a dark, and others of a light hue, living almost in
                    juxtaposition. It is remarkable, too, that the nations whose colour approaches
                    nearest to black are found in the temperate zone, namely, the Charruas of the
                    Banda Oriental, in latitude 33° south, and the Cochimies, Peri eus, and
                    Guaycurus, spread over the peninsula of California. These people have skins of a
                    very deep hue, but are not absolutely black; and they have neither the woolly
                    hair of the negroes, nor their social and good-humoured disposition. The
                    Charruas especially are distinguished by a high degree of that austerity and
                    stern fortitude which are common to the American nations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mithridates</hi><hi rend="italic">Einleitung Amerikanischen Sprachen,</hi> p. 313; Prichard’s <hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi> vol. ii. p. 396, 492.</p></note> The Caribs and
                    some Brazilian tribes have the yellowish hue of the Chinese, and the same cast
                    of features. Among the nations dwelling on the west side of the Alleganies, and
                    near the northern lakes, there is also a considerable variety of complexion; but
                    the brown or copper shade is found more or less in them all. It may be said,
                    then, of the American nations, that, with the exception of two or three tribes
                    on the north-west coast, who probably arrived from Asia at a later period than
                    the others, the two extremes of complexion, the white of Northern Europe and the
                    black of Ethiopia, are unknown amongst them; and that, when compared with the
                    Moors, Abyśsinians, and other swarthy nations of the old world, their colour
                    inclines less to the yellow, ańd more to the reddish brown. In stature the
                    variety is great. The North American tribes are generally above the middle size,
                    and of a slender shape. The Brazilian nations and the Peruvians are short and
                    squat. The Caribs of the Orinoco, and the Abipones, Mocoby, and other tribes
                    which rove over the Pampas west of the Plata, are tall and strong; and the
                    Patagonians, a Chilian tribe, exceed in strength and stature all the other races
                    in the known world.</p><p>The origin, history, languages, and condition of the American natives, present
                    ample materials for speculation; but before touching on these subjects, there
                    are two interesting questions to which we must advert, namely, what is the
                    present amount of the indigenous population of America? and into how many tribes
                    or independent communities is it distributed? Humboldt, in a late edition of his
                    work on Mexico estimates the whole number of Indians in the new world as follows
                    :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Civilized or settled Indians of Spanish America

                    questions respecting the new world, we are led to think that he has considerably
                    underrated the number of savage or independent Indians. In a late edition of
                    Morse’s Geography the number of Indians in the territories of the United States
                    alone is estimated at 470,000, of whom even those on the east side of the
                    Mississippi have only in part renounced the chase as a means of subsistence. The
                    independent part of these must amount to fully 350,000, spread over a surface of
                    1,200,000 square miles, affording one inhabitant to less than four square miles.
                    British and Russian America, under the 60th parallel, with the coasts and the
                    northern parts of Mexico and the forests of Central America, occupy about
                    3,000,000 square miles more. If we suppose the southern portion of this space to
                    be peopled to the same density as the former, and the northern to have one
                    inhabitant for 20 square miles, we have about 300,000 in addition to those in
                    the United States, and 650,000 in all North America, without reckoning the
                    Esquimaux and Greenlanders, who may amount to 10,000 more. In South America,
                    where the independent tribes occupy three fourths of the interior, and touch the
                    coast in Brazil, Colombia, La Plata, and Chili, they may be considered as the
                    possessors of 4,000,000 of square miles. As the fruits, fish, and wild animals
                    on which these tribes subsist are more abundant in the torrid zone than
                    elsewhere, the savage population of this region was probably at one time much
                    more dense than that of North America. We know, however, that sad havock has
                    been made among them by the small-pox and spiritous liquors; that they have been
                    destroyed in open war, intentionally poisoned with infected clothes, kidnapped
                    for slaves, or hunted down like wild beasts. Still all the facts we have been
                    able to collect lead us to believe that their numbers cannot be much thinner
                    than on the great plain of the Mississippi. In Colombia alone, an account
                    professing to be official makes the number of independent Indians 203,000. We
                    are therefore disposed to think that 750,000 is a moderate estimate for all the
                    countries south of the isthmus of Panama. We shall thus have in both Americas
                    1,400,000 Indians, instead of 820,000, as estimated by Humboldt. The next
                    question regards the number of the tribes or nations into which this mass of
                    savage population is divided. Two circumstances seem to determine the size of
                    these little communities—the nature of the country, and the degree of rudeness
                    or intelligence possessed by the people. A tribe which has made some advances in
                    arts and military skill is enabled to increase its numbers by gaining territory
                    and means of subsistence from its enemies, and sometimes by compelling weaker
                    tribes to court its protection, or incorporate themselves with it. Conquests and
                    acquisitions are facilitated when the country is open; and they are rendered
                    difficult when it is hilly, or covered with thick woods, or intersected by deep
                    rivers. Hence it is that a single nation may be found in the steppes of
                    Mississippi, or the pampas of La Plata, occupying a territory as large as a
                    kingdom, while Humboldt ascertained that two hundred tribes were crowded into a
                    space of 19,000 square leagues, amidst the dense forests of the Upper Orinoco.
                    In the province of Quito alone there were, a century ago, 116 different tribes,
                    speaking as many distinct dialects. We must attend also to the distinction which
                    ought to exist between <hi rend="italic">nations</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tribes,</hi> though the words are used indiscri minately. A tribe includes
                    those living under one chief, or one government; a nation, those who speak one
                    language, or are confederated for their common defence. A nation may consist of
                    many tribes. The Dacotas or Sioux, one of the most powerful nations of North
                    America, numbers 20,000, some say 28,000 souls; but it is divided into seven, if
                    not fifteen or twenty tribes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Major Long’s <hi rend="italic">Expedition to the Source of
                    St Peter’s River,</hi> vol. i. p. 378; a work which contains a great mass of
                    valuable information respecting the Indian tribes. It was published in
                    Philadelphia in 1824.</p></note> The Powhattans of Virginia, a celebrated nation
                    in former times, were divided into 33 tribes. The Iroquois, who are called “the
                    Five Nations,” consisted of 15 tribes, and, though they made so great a figure
                    in the early history of New England, never counted more than 2600 warriors, or
                    11,000 or 12,000 souls. On the other hand, vast numbers of tribes have become
                    extinct; and many which are hastening to this state may be found reduced to a
                    dozen of families, but still retaining an appearance of independence, perhaps
                    under the protection of others of greater strength. In general, the tendency to
                    subdivide is great; and the process seems to be carried as far as the necessity
                    of being strong enough for self-defence will admit. On a general survey of the
                    aborigines of both divisions of America, we are satisfied that the average
                    number in a tribe (taking the word in the sense we have given to it) must be
                    estimated at less than 1000 souls, probably at 700 or 800. Following out our
                    calculation, we infer that there must be 1600 or 1800 independent communities of
                    savages in America, who are united probably into 400 or 500 confederacies, of
                    fluctuating extent and duration. Towards the two extremities of the continent,
                    the magnitude of these primary communities is greater than in the basin of the
                    Orinoco and Amazon, where the savages are more savage in their character and
                    manners than elsewhere, and where the nature of the country favours their
                    propensity to split into very small societies. Before the arrival of the
                    Europeans, America probably contained three times as many of these children of
                    the woods, divided into three times as many distinct hordes.</p><p>It is the absence of civilisation which has broken human speech into such a
                    countless variety of dialects; and the lower any race of people have sunk m the
                    abasement of savage life, the more languages multiply amongst them. Every
                    unwritten tongue is subject to continual fluctuations, which will be numerous
                    and rapid in proportion as the tribe using it is exposed to frequent
                    vicissitudes of fortune, and the individuals composing it have little
                    intercourse with one another. When the population of one of these societies
                    increases, it splits into several branches; and if these have little
                    intercourse, the original language divides by degrees into as many dialects.
                    These smaller societies subdivide in their turn with the same effects; and, in
                    such continual subdivisions, the dialects of the extreme branches deviate
                    farther and farther from one another, and from the parent tongue, till time,
                    aided by migrations and wars, producing mixtures of different hordes,
                    obliterates all distinct traces of a common origin. The cause of these changes
                    becomes more obvious when we reflect on the principles which give stability to a
                    language. These are, 1. the abundant use of writing; 2. the teaching of a
                    language as a branch of education 3. frequency of intercourse among all the
                    people speaking it; 4. the existence of an order of men, such as priests or
                    lawyers, who employ it for professional purposes; 5. stability of condition in
                    the people, or exemption from vicissitudes and revolutions; 6. a large stock of
                    popular poetry, which, if universally diffused, may almost become <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037843" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7843-0618"/>a substitute
                    for writing. All these conditions were wanting (with some trifling exceptions)
                    in the whole of the wandering tribes of America. The great multiplication of
                    languages, therefore, proves two things; first, that the people are in the
                    lowest state of savage life; and, secondly, that they have been for many ages in
                    this condition; for time is a necessary element in the process of splitting
                    human speech into so many varieties. Now, it is a remarkable fact, that there
                    were as many languages spoken among -a population of two or three millions of
                    American savages, as among the six hundred millions of human beings scattered
                    over the old continent! We call them two or three millions, because we exclude
                    the civilized inhabitants of Mexicoand Peru, and because a considerable number
                    of the facts collected by Hervasand Vater relate to a period from 50 to 100
                    years back, since which, some of the tribes they allude to have become extinct.
                    Balbi, in his Ethnographical Atlas, has enumerated 423 languages, which are, or
                    at no distant period were, spoken in America by the indigenous population. Of
                    these, 211 belong to North, 44 to Central, and 168 to South America; but as the
                    list includes only those tongues of whose structure something is known, it does
                    not embrace more than one or two of the 116 dialects noticed by the missionaries
                    in Quito, some of which have ceased to exist; and many others, unknown, or known
                    imperfectly, are also left out. There cannot be a doubt that the greater
                    multiplicity of tribes in South America is accompanied with a corresponding
                    multiplicity of languages, and that we may add at least 100 for omissions in
                    this section of the continent. Vater says expressly that the number of languages
                    in America “exceeds five hundred.” As a general result, then, we may state, that
                    there are (or <hi rend="italic">were</hi> within a century past) from 500 to 600
                    distinct dialects in the new world, without including in our enumeration any
                    which do not differ from one another as widely as the Spanish from the Italian,
                    or the German from the Dutch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mithridates</hi><hi rend="italic">Einleitung Amerikanischen Sprachen,</hi> p. 3Ĵ3. Balbi, <hi rend="italic">Atlas

                    has been detected in all those which are well known, and is believed to pervade
                    the whole. The American languages are extremely complicated and artificial, and
                    have extraordinary powers of combination. The verb, besides inflections
                    applicable to the varieties of time, has numerous moods, which maybe described
                    as reflected, transitive, compulsive, applicative, meditative, communicative,
                    reverential, frequentative; and forms which indicate by suffixes and affixes
                    whether the ohject be animate or inanimate, male or female, &amp;c.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Prichard’s <hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi> vol. ii∙ p. 341; and Tables 2G, 27, and 29 of

                    Esquimaux to the straits of Magellan,” says Humboldt, “mother tongues entirely
                    different in their roots have, if we may use the expression, the same
                    physiognomy. Striking analogies of grammatical construction are discovered, not
                    only in the more perfect languages, as that of the Incas, the Ayemara, the
                    Guarani, the Mexican, and the Cora, but also in languages extremely rude. It is
                    in consequence of this similarity of structure that the Indians of the missions
                    could learn the tongue of a different tribe much more easily than the Spanish;
                    and the monks had hence adopted the practice of communicating with a great
                    number of hordes through the medium of one of the native languages.” The
                    complication of grammatical forms which these dialects display has induced Mr
                    Duponceau of Philadelphia to give them the name of <hi rend="italic">Polysynthic.</hi> Now the remarkable facts are, first, that this characteristic
                    should not be found in any of the known languages of the old world, except in a
                    faint degree in the Basque, and the dialect of Congo; and, next, that it should
                    belong, not to one or two, but with slight exceptions, so far as is known, to
                    all the languages of America, so extremely numerous, and many of which have
                    nothing else in common. How is this diffusion of a peculiar and common character
                    over materials so dissimilar to be accounted for? To us it seems to imply a
                    community of origin in the tribes, whether few or many, which peopled the
                    continent. As no person has the full command of all the vocables in his native
                    language, individual terms must be continually dropping out of dialects
                    preserved by oral communication; and new ones will be introduced as new wants
                    and new objects solicit attention. But during the gradual change which thus
                    takes place, the new words will be combined and modified according to the rules
                    which belong to the genius of the spoken dialect with which they are
                    incorporated; and thus it may happen that the grammatical forms of an ancient
                    language may live, while its materials perish. The changes of structure which
                    present themselves in the history of European languages, it must be remembered,
                    took place in <hi rend="italic">progressive</hi> communities. Among nations like
                    the American Indians, whose barbarism, we may suppose, remained almost
                    stationary, the forms of speech might be more permanent, though its substance
                    was in a state of slow but constant mutation. We do not mean, however, that the
                    community of origin alluded to was entire and absolute among the American
                    nations. Since weak tribes are often incorporated with strong ones in the
                    present times, it might happen that small parties of separate and dissimilar
                    races might be blended by conquest or treaty with the larger nations of the
                    American stock, and in a generation or two lose their distinctive character, by
                    adopting the language and manners of their new confederates or masters. Neither
                    must it be imagined that there is an entire absence of mutual affinities among
                    the 423 tongues enumerated by Balbi. On the contrary, six, eight, or more, are
                    sometimes united in one family by analogies, in their roots and grammatical
                    forms, as strong as those which obtain among the languages of the Teutonic stem
                    in Europe, the Icelandie, Swedish, Danish, German, Dutch, and English. If
                    philologists had complete vocabularies of them all, it might probably be found
                    that the 500 or 600 American languages could be arranged into eight or ten
                    “reigns,” to use Balbi’s term, or into forty or fifty families, each
                    characterized by affinities sufficiently clear to prove that its component
                    members had sprung from a common parent. On the other hand, the complete
                    absence, in so many instances, of common roots in the dialects of contiguous
                    tribes,—the fading and almost obliterated traces of resemblance in languages
                    which had once been identical,—are very remarkable phenomena, and prepare us for
                    a result which could not have been anticipated otherwise—that none of all the
                    American tongues has any distinct marks of a common origin with any one of those
                    of Asia, Africa, Europe, or Polynesia. The sole exception is the Esquimaux
                    idiom, which belongs to the same family with that of the Tchutkis, a people
                    having the same physical aspect, who inhabit the extreme northeastern parts of
                    Asia. Upon a painful comparison of the known languages of the new world with
                    those of the old, only 170 words have been found ,in the former which have a
                    distinct resemblance to words of the same signification in the latter. These are
                    derived from 83 American tongues; three fifths of them have a resemblance to
                    words in the Mantchou, Tonguse, Mongol, and Samoiede <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037856" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7856-0619"/>dialects, and
                    two fifths to words in the Celtic, Tschoud, Biscayan, Coptic, and Congoese. This
                    number is too small to prove any thing by itself; but it is not entirely to be
                    disregarded when taken in connection with the analogies which have been traced
                    in the physical character, customs, superstitions, and monuments, of the people
                    of the two continents. And if we admit, on the ground of their similarity of
                    organization, that the greater number of the American languages have had a
                    common origin, even in those cases where coincident terms are no longer to be
                    discovered, perhaps it ought to be acknowledged that the affinity between the
                    languages of the two continents is as great as could be expected. In this, as in
                    many questions connected with geology, <hi rend="italic">time</hi> is the
                    element which solves the difficulty; and when a longer course of observation has
                    enabled us to detect the laws which govern the changes of oral language among
                    barbarous and savage nations, the facts will probably speak to us in clearer
                    terms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vater remarks, in

                    some of them are evidently too fain,t to be of any value. We must at the same
                    time keep in view, that philologists have rarely the means of making a complete
                    and satisfactory comparison. In general they are furnished with only 40 or 50
                    words, significant of the most common objects, out of some thousands
                    constituting the dialect of a tribe or people; and these few words are taken
                    down hastily by travellers, mariners, or missionaries, of different nations, who
                    are often betrayed into errors by imperfect means of communication, and must in
                    their turn mislead the philologist by their dissimilar systems o÷‘ orthography.

                    either on physical or ethnographical grounds, would be idle, a brief survey of
                    the most remarkable nations, or families of nations, will enable us to form a
                    more distinct idea of the whole.</p><p>All the northern coast of the new continent is tenanted by the Esquimaux, a
                    dwarfish race, rarely exceeding five feet in height, and of the same stock with
                    the Greenlanders, the Tchutkis, the Samoiedes, and the Laplanders. Near
                    Mackenzie’s River their territories commence at the 68th parallel, and extend to
                    the Arctic Ocean. They occupy all the northern Archipelago, the shores of
                    Hudson’s and Baffin’s Bays, of Labrador, and of Russian America, round by
                    Behring’s Straits, to the peninsula of Alyaska. They live entirely by fishing,
                    the w hale and the seal being their most common food; they inhabit skin tents
                    during their short summer, and in winter caves or houses built with snow in the
                    shape of domes, within which a single rude lamp is kept perpetually burning.
                    They are crafty and dirty, but appeared to Captain Franklin more intelligent and
                    provident than the northern Indians. There is a wide diversity in their
                    dialects, which still display decided marks of identity in their roots. They are
                    the only American race whose Asiatic origin is indisputable.</p><p>The north-west coast of Russian America, from Cook’s Inlet to the 48th parallel,
                    is inhabited by four tribes, of whom the Kaluschi are the most remarkable. These
                    people are distinguished from all the native races of America by having as fair
                    a complexion when their skins are washed as the inhabitants of Europe; and this
                    distinction, accompanied sometimes with auburn hair, has been considered as
                    indicating an origin different from that of the copper-coloured tribes who
                    people all the rest of the continent.</p><p>The Indians of the east coast belong almost entirely to three stems; and, before
                    the arrival of the English colonists, occupied both sides of the Allegany
                    Mountains, from the Gulf of Mexicoto Canada and New Brunswick. 1. The Delaware
                    or Algonquin Indians, comprehending the Ottogamies, Shawanese, Naragansets,
                    Chippeways, Knisteňeaux, Delawares, and other nations, to the number of thirty
                    or forty, were spread over the space between the Mississippi and the Atlantic,
                    as far north as Hudson’s Bay; and all spoke dialects of one language. They
                    preserved a tradition, to which some credit has been given, that they had
                    migrated from the west many centuries before the white men crossed the Atlantic,
                    and gained possession of their country by expelling the A∏egewis (or
                    Alleganies), its former occupants. The latter nation, it is said, lived in
                    towns; and it has been conjectured that they were the race who had constructed
                    the long mounds and walls, and the circular and polygonal inclosures, like
                    fortresses, which are scattered in great numbers over the region between the
                    Ohio and the lakes. 2. The Iroquois, often called the “Five Nations,” and the
                    “Six Nations,” but comprehending 15 tribes or more, among whom were the Mohawks,
                    Oneidas, Hurons, and Senecas, all spoke dialects of one language. They lived on
                    the south side of the great lakes, and finally obtained a complete ascendency
                    over the Algonquin race. 3. The Florida Indians, including the Creeks,
                    Seminoles, Choctaws, Chickasaws, Natches, and Mobiles. The Cherokees and Creeks,
                    two of these nations, who dwell in Alabama and Georgia, have made greater
                    advances in agriculture and the useful arts than any of the other tribes within
                    the territories of the United States. They not only cultivate maize, potatoes,
                    and cotton, but raise cattle and hogs for the market. The former, who have some
                    hundreds of negro slaves, have established schools, set up a newspaper, and even
                    adopted a political constitution, modelled on those of the Anglo-Americans. It
                    has been recently discovered that the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037869" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7869-0620"/>Osages,
                    Missouris, Kanses, and some other tribes inhabiting the country beyond the
                    Mississippi, as far as the Rocky Mountains, speak dialects which are allied to
                    those of the Iroquois; a fact which tends strongly to confirm the opinion
                    entertained by the latter, that their original residence was far in the west.
                    The Natches, near the Mississippi, had a monarchical government, and a class of
                    nobles like the Mexicans. They had temples in which the sun was worshipped, and
                    a perpetual fire kept up. Traces of this superstition existed also among the
                    Gaspes, in New Brunswick. Tribes belonging to these three families, with the
                    Wocons and Katawbas, now almost extinct, occupied nearly all the region east of
                    the Mississippi, from the Gulf of Mexicoto Hudson’s Bay, comprising more than a
                    million of square miles. The Katawbas alone, however, are said to have included
                    20 tribes, and nearly as many dialects. The Powhattans were a confederacy of 33
                    tribes, comprehending 10,000 persons. It is probable that when the English
                    settlers landed in the country, the region mentioned was inhabited by a quarter
                    of a million of Indians, divided into many tribes, and speaking dialects
                    belonging to half a dozen of radically distinct languages. These nations have
                    furnished brilliant models of the most shining qualities of savage life—a high
                    sense of honour, according to their perceptions of duty, mutual fidelity among
                    individuals, a fortitude that mocks at the most cruel torments, and a devotion
                    to their tribe which makes self-immolation in its defence easy. On the other
                    hand, they treat their wives cruelly, and their children with indifference. The
                    apathy under the good and ill of life which the Stoic affected, is the grand
                    element of the Indian’s character. Gloomy, stern, and severe, he is a stranger
                    to mirth and laughter. All outward expression of pleasure or pain he regards as
                    a weakness; and the only feeling to which he ever yields, is the boisterous joy
                    which he manifests in the moment of victory, or under the excitement of
                    intoxication. He is capable of great exertions in war or the chase, but has an
                    unconquerable aversion to regular labour. He is extremely improvident; eats
                    enormously while he has abundance of food, without thinking of the famine which
                    may follow; and, when liquors are supplied to him, wallows in the most beastly
                    intoxication day after day. Most of the Indians believe in the existence of a
                    supreme being, whom they call the Great Spirit; and of a subordinate one, whose
                    nature is evil and hostile to man. To the latter their worship is principally
                    addressed, the Good Spirit, in their opinion, needing no prayers to induce him
                    to aid and protect his creatures. In some cases, however, as when influenced by
                    a dream, they offer sacrifices to the Good Spirit. These consist generally of
                    part of an animal taken in the chase, which is stuck upon the head of a high
                    pole set vertically in the ground, and left in this situation to decay by the
                    action of the elements. The remainder of the carcass is boiled and eaten; and
                    the feast is accompanied with prayers, dancing, and singing. Human sacrifices
                    are not unknown amongst them, but are rare. In their fasts, which are long and
                    severe, they smear the face and other visible parts of the body with charcoal,
                    and abstain from food till the sun has gone down; and this is practised day
                    after day for one or two weeks. Some of them believe in tutelar spirits; and in
                    most of the tribes there are jugglers or soothsayers, who pretend to discover
                    lost property, and foretell the issue of hunting or warlike expeditions. By some
                    tribes, deities are supposed to reside in the sun and moon. They generally
                    believe in a future state, in which the souls of brave warriors and chaste wives
                    enjoy a tranquil and happy existence with their ancestors and friends, spending
                    their time in those exercises in which they delighted when on the earth. The
                    Dacotas believe that the road to these “villages of the dead” leads over a rock
                    with an edge as sharp as a knife, on which only the good are able to keep their
                    footing. The wicked fall off, and descend to the region of the Evil Spirit,
                    where they are hard worked, and severely flogged by their relentless master.
                    Suicide is common among the women of this tribe, in consequence of the cruel
                    treatment they are exposed to; but the practice is viewed as immoral. It is
                    commonly effected by the woman hanging herself upon a tree; and as the popular
                    belief is, that she is doomed to drag this tree after her for ever in the land
                    of spirits, it is said to be usual for a female in committing the act to select
                    as small a tree as will bear her weight.</p><p>Polygamy is allowed; and a number of wives is considered as adding to a man’s
                    consequence. When a youno∙ man has formed an attachment to a girl, he throws a
                    deer, a gun, or some valuable article, into her father’s hut. This is repeated
                    for several days, till the father asks the young man what his object is, and
                    whether he wishes to obtain his daughter. The young man having answered in the
                    affirmative, the relations of the girl, if they approve of his suit, signify
                    their consent by preparing a dress for the youth, which they carry to his house,
                    and put upon his person. The young man’s friends then prepare presents for the
                    girl’s family, into which he goes to reside, serving his father-in-law for a
                    year, during which he gives him all the produce of his hunting. At the end of
                    this period the youth takes his wife home to his own house, and treats her as he
                    pleases, his power over her being unlimited. This is the custom of the
                    P∩towatomies. Other tribes have modes of courting and marrying which are very
                    different; but among all the Indians, the presenting of gifts to the girl’s
                    father is an essential feature of the transaction, and shows that the wife is
                    considered as procured by purchase. Deformed children, and lame or decrepit old
                    persons, are sometimes destroyed; but the practice is uncommon. Incest and
                    unnatural vices are practised in some tribes, but they are always viewed as
                    matters of reproach. The Indian funerals are conducted with much decorum. The
                    deceased is dressed in his best clothes, and laid in a grave, in a vertical,
                    horizontal, or inclined position, according to his own previous directions, with
                    his mocassins, knife, money, and silver ornaments beside him, and a small
                    quantity of food near his head. Some prefer having their bodies sewed up in a
                    blanket, and suspended from the branches of a tree. In this position the corpse
                    is frequently visited by the friends of the deceased, until they observe that it
                    is in a state of decay. They then shake hands with it and bid it farewell; but
                    this does not prevent them from paying a yearly visit to the spot, and leaving
                    some food at the place. It is usual to mark the graves with a post, on which
                    figures are carved expressive of the nature of the pursuits and achievements of
                    the deceased.</p><p>Some nations of Indians wear little or no clothing; but the general dress of the
                    men in the temperate and cold parts of the country, previous to the arrival of
                    the Europeans, consisted of three articles: a cloak of buffalo-skin hanging from
                    the shoulders, a piece of skin used as an apron, and a pair of mocassins or
                    loose boots, made of undressed skin also. The women wore a long robe of the same
                    material, which was fastened round the waist; but among the tribes living near
                    the whites, coarse woollens are now frequently substituted for the hides of wild
                    animals, except for the mocassins. The habitations of the Indians are huts or
                    cabins, generally of a circular form and small size, but sometimes of 30 or 40
                    feet in diameter, formed by stakes fixed in the ground, and covered with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037882" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7882-0621"/> the
                    bark of trees. Sometimes the spaces between the stakes are filled up with twigs,
                    grass, and mud, and the roof is covered nearly in the same way. A hole in the
                    top serves for the escape of the smoke, and the skins of wild beasts form the
                    beds and seats. When they go to a distance to hunt, they erect for temporary use
                    large tents, which are covered with skins. On the west side of the Mississippi,
                    where the ground is open, many of the tribes make use of horses, which are
                    seldom employed amidst the woods covering the territories east of that river.
                    The custom of painting their bodies is nearly universal. They introduce the
                    colours by making punctures on their skin; and the extent of surface which this
                    ornament covers is proportioned to the exploits they have performed. Some paint
                    only their arms, others both their arms and legs, others again their thighs;
                    while those who have attained the summit of warlike renown have their bodies
                    painted from the waist upwards. This is the heraldry of the Indians, the devices
                    of which are probably more exactly adjusted to the merits of the persons who
                    bear them than those of more civilized countries. Besides these ornaments, the
                    warriors also carry plumes of feathers on their heads, their arms, or ancles.
                    Their arms are the tomahawk, the war-club, knife, the bow and arrow; and, since
                    they had intercourse with Europeans, many of them have muskets. Each tribe or
                    community is governed by a chief and council, who are elective; but in matters
                    of importance the whole warriors are consulted; and Mr Keating informs us that
                    questions are not decided by the votes of a majority, but the resolution adopted
                    must have the consent of every individual warrior. Their assemblies are
                    conducted with much formality and decorum. The eldest chief commences the
                    debate, which is often carried on by set speeches, abounding in bold figures and
                    metaphors, and bursts of a rude but impassioned eloquence. The young are
                    permitted to be present, and to express their approbation by cries, but not to
                    speak. In their wars the object commonly is, to secure the right of hunting
                    within particular limits, to maintain the liberty of passing through their
                    accustomed tracts, and to guard from infringement those lands which they
                    consider as their own tenure. War is declared by sending a slave with a hatchet,
                    the handle of which is painted red, to the nation they intend to break with.
                    They generally take the field in small numbers. Each warrior, besides his
                    weapons, carries a mat, and supports himself till he is near the enemy by
                    killing game. From the time they enter the enemy’s country, no game is killed,
                    no fires lighted, or shouting heard, and their vigilance and caution are
                    extreme. They are not even permitted to speak, but must communicate by signs and
                    motions. Having discovered the objects of their hostility, they first
                    reconnoitre them, then hold a council; and they generally make their attack just
                    before day-break, that they may surprise their enemies while asleep. They will
                    lie the whole night flat on their faces without stirring, and, at the fit moment
                    for action, will creep on their hands and feet till they have got within a
                    bow-shot of those they have doomed to destruction. On a signal given by the
                    chief warrior, which is answered by the yells of the whole party, they start up,
                    and, after discharging their arrows, they rush upon their adversaries, without
                    giving them time to recover from their confusion, with their war-clubs and
                    tomahawks. If they succeed, the scene of horror which follows baffles
                    description. The savage fury of the conquerors, the desperation of the
                    conquered, the horrid yells of both, and their grim figures besmeared, with
                    paint and blood, form an assemblage of objects worthy of pandemonium. When the
                    victory is secured, they select a certain number of their prisoners to carry
                    home: they kill the rest in cold blood, take their scalps, and then march off
                    with the spoil. The prisoners destined to death are soon led to the place of
                    execution, where they are stripped, have their bodies blackened, and are bound
                    to a stake. In this situation, while the burning faggots embrace his limbs, and
                    the knives of his revengeful enemies are inflicting a thousand tortures, it is
                    common for the warrior to recount his exploits, boast of the cruelties he has
                    committed upon his enemies, and to irritate and insult his tormentors in every
                    way. Sometimes it happens that this has the effect of provoking one of the
                    spectators to dispatch him with a club or tomahawk. Sometimes the male adult
                    prisoners are given äs slaves to women who have lost their husbands in the war,
                    and by whom they are often married. The women taken are distributed among the
                    warriors; the boys and girls are considered as slaves.</p><p>Nearly all the Indian tribes raise maize, beans, and pumpkins, by the labour of
                    their women, but only to a small extent, and as a resource against famine, their
                    chief reliance being upon the chase. The buffaloes which wander over the
                    prairies of the west, in herds of tens of thousands, are their great support;
                    but deer, bears, and in time of need otters, beavers, foxes, squirrels, and even
                    the most disgusting reptiles, are devoured. And last and worst, there is the
                    horrid banquet of human flesh, which is still in use among some tribes, and to
                    which, at one period of their history or another, perhaps few or none of them
                    have been strangers. The fact has been doubted; but the decided testimony given
                    by Major Long and his party, who all started on their journey with a
                    disinclination to admit it, must be considered as setting the question at rest.
                    After alluding to the incredulity which many felt on the subject, the narrator
                    says,—“With such feelings the gentlemen of the expedition first heard the
                    reports of the anthropophagy of the Potowatomies, and yielded but an unwilling
                    ear to every thing that could induce a belief in the existence of this
                    disgusting trait in the character of the North-West Indians. Truth compels them,
                    however, to assert, that the reports which they have received on this subject
                    were so frequent, so circumstantial, and derived from such respectable sources,
                    that any concealment of it, or any apparent incredulity on their part, would be
                    a dereliction of duty. Even the most incredulous of the party, or those disposed
                    to entertain the most favourable opinion of the Indians, were at last compelled
                    to acknowledge that all doubt on the subject had been removed from their
                    minds.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Narrative of Major Long’s Expedition to St Peter’s River,</hi>

                    origin sometimes in famine, which drives the Indians to this resource, and
                    sometimes in hatred or revenge towards a hostile tribe; for it is only enemies
                    that are thus devoured; and the Indians have a superstitious idea, that the
                    flesh of a brave man, when eaten, especially the heart, imparts a portion of his
                    courage to the individual who consumes it. We have described the manners and
                    dispositions of these nations at some length, because the lights and shadows of
                    savage life, its grand features and marked peculiarities, in that state in
                    which' a brutal ferocity has not obliterated every generous quality, are more
                    strongly depicted in their character than in that of any other American race.
                    For the sake of distinction, they may be denominated the Allegany Indians. <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037895" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7895-0622"/> The
                    Caribs, who have been compared to them, had the same courage and fierceness, but
                    were more gross and brutal; and the Araucanians, who surpassed all the
                    independent tribes of America in intrepidity, intelligence, and generosity, had
                    a slight tincture of civilisation. In speaking of those other nations which make
                    the most considerable figure in the new continent, our limited space will not
                    permit us to do more than to describe very briefly the leading traits of their
                    character.</p><p>It has been generally admitted by physiologists, that the temperate regions of
                    the globe are best fitted to develope all the powers of our nature; and it is a
                    fact in accordance with this opinion, that among the aborigines of America,
                    civilisation followed very closely the chain of the Andes, and was found either
                    upon their sides or the table-land of their summits, where the elevation of the
                    ground moderates the heat of the tropical sun, and produces a climate analogous
                    to that of Central and Southern Europe. This civilisation did not exist merely
                    at the two distant and isolated points of Mexieo and Peru, but presented itself
                    at intermediate places, and maybe said to have formed a continuous line from
                    lat. 35. N. to lat. 35. S., with few interruptions, except at those parts where
                    the mountainous chain disappears, or sinks down to a trifling elevation. Some
                    large buildings near the Rio Gila, in lat. 33. N., with fragments of porcelain,
                    indicate the existence of a people here who had some knowledge of the arts.
                    These were most probably a branch of the Aztecks or Toltecks, who afterwards
                    occupied Mexico as the annals of this country tell. Though some pursued their
                    march southward, it may be reasonably supposed that a part remained in the
                    district; and the Indians living here, who cultivate corn, weave cloth, and live
                    in villages consisting of houses built of solid materials, sometimes two stories
                    in height, may either be their descendants, or have borrowed from them the
                    improvements they possess. Next in order as we proceed southward, are the
                    various nations of Mexico of whose condition we shall speak by and by. In Chiapa
                    were the Zapotecks, in Yucatan the Mayas, in Guatemala the Quiches and
                    Kachiquels, all nearly as much advanced in civilisation as the Mexicans, and
                    probably of the same primitive stock. From this point, where the Andes lose
                    their elevation, or break into isolated cones, no distinct traces of
                    civilisation appear till we enter the southern continent. Here were found the
                    Muyseas or Moseas, on the table-land of Bogota, a nation consisting of several
                    tribes, who worshipped the sun and practised some of the useful arts. To these
                    sueceeded the nations of Peru, living under the Incas, whose dominion extended
                    from the equator to the 35th degree of south latitude. Beyond this boundary were
                    the Chilian tribes, who, though inferior to the Peruvians, had made some
                    advances beyond the rudeness of the savage state. It is proper to mention that
                    some of the nations named were extinct before the arrival of the Spaniards; but
                    the degree of civilisation they had attained is attested by the monuments they
                    have left behind them. There were no other tribes in the new continent which had
                    made any progress in social improvement. We would not except the Guaranis of
                    Brazil, and a few others, who derived their subsistence chiefly from
                    agriculture, but were in other respects savages. We place among the exceptions,
                    however, the extinct race of the Allegewis, or whatever was the name of the
                    people, who erected the military works existing between the Ohio and the
                    northern lakes; but they also, it must be remembered, inhabited a temperate
                    climate, though not a mountainous country. It may be affirmed, then, as a
                    general proposition, that from 35° of north to 35° of south latitude, the sides
                    and summits of the Andes were the exclusive seats of American civilisation. We
                    admit that some of the tribes in Chiapa, Oaxaea, and Yueatan, inhabited low
                    districts; but they were still near the Cordillera, and may be fairly considered
                    as offsets from the nations dwelling upon it. The faet is important, as marking
                    the effect of climate on the active energies of our species. There is no doubt
                    that, with the improved arts of modern times, civilisation can subsist under the
                    burning sky of the torrid zone, but not in such vigour as in countries which
                    enjoy a more moderate temperature. Perhaps it will be found that the moral and
                    physical powers of man attain their highest perfection in those regions, where
                    he is accompanied by w <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">vine.</hi> The zone occupied by the former extends from the 30th to the 57th or
                    58th parallel; and within the tropics the corresponding climate is found on the
                    flanks or summits of mountains, from 4500 to 10,000 feet above the level of the
                    sea.</p><p>It is remarkable that the Mexican annals reach to a more remote date than those
                    of any of the nations of northern Europe, though they were preserved merely by
                    an imperfect species of hieroglyphics, or picture-writing. We do not pretend to
                    enter into the question which may be raised, both as to the authenticity of the
                    records themselves, and their susceptibility of a correct interpretation. It is
                    enough that they have received credit from Humboldt, Vater, and other men of
                    learning and judgment who have examined into their nature and origin. From the
                    annals thus preserved, we learn that several nations belonging to one race
                    migrated in succession from the north-west, and settled in <hi rend="italic">Anahuac</hi> or Mexico The Toltecks, the first of these, left their original
                    seat, far to the west, in 544 of our era, and after a long journey invaded
                    Mexieo, then occupied by wandering hordes, in 648. This people, who penetrated
                    to Nicaragua, if not to South America, were nearly destroyed after the lapse of
                    some centuries; but were followed by the Chichimeks, a half-savage tribe, about
                    1170, and these a few years afterwards by the Anahuatlels, or seven tribes,
                    including the Acol-huans, Elascaltcks, and the Aztecks or proper Mexicans. All
                    these people spoke dialects of one language, and had similar arts, customs, and
                    institutions. The town of Mexicoor Tenochtitlan was founded in 1325, and the
                    series of Mexican kings which commenced in 1352 was continued through eight
                    monarchs to Montezuma. The monarchy was small at first, and passed through many
                    vicissitudes; but it was gradually enlarged, especially by the policy and
                    enterprise of the later princes of the line. When Cortes arrived, it embraced
                    what are now the provinces of Vera Cruz, Oaxaca, Puebla, Mexico and part of
                    Valladolid, a surface of 130,000 square miles; but within this were comprehended
                    three small independent states, Elascala, Cholullan, and Zapeaca. The pastoral
                    state, which forms the intermediate stage between savage and civilized life, had
                    never existed in Mexico for the native wild ox had not been tamed, and the use
                    of milk as food was unknown. The Mexican nations derived their subsistence from
                    agriculture, which, however, was conducted in the rudest manner, with very
                    imperfect instruments. They cultivated maize, potatoes, plantains, and various
                    other esculent vegetables. They raised cotton, and understood the art of
                    spinning and weaving it into cloth, of a texture which excited the admiration of
                    the Spaniards. They had no iron, but showed considerable skill in fashioning the
                    gold, silver, and copper found in a native state, into domestic utensils and
                    ornamental articles. In some of their buildings the stones were hewn into
                    regular forms, and accurately joined; and from the ruins of the palace of Mitla,
                    in Oaxaca, still existing, it appears that they had the art of designing
                    ornaments like arabesques, in paste, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037908" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7908-0623"/>with great
                    neatness, and attaching them to the walls; but solid structures of masonry
                    evincing any considerable skill are extremely rare in the country. Their
                    carvings in wood were tolerably well executed, but the figures were
                    disproportioned and uncouth. The same remark applies to their hieroglyphical
                    drawings, which were far inferior in taste and design to those of the Hindoos,
                    Japanese, and Thibetians. For paper they employed sometimes the large leaves of
                    the aloe, sometimes cotton cloth, or the skins of deer dressed. Their books
                    consisted of strips or webs of such materials, composed of pieces neatly joined,
                    one or two feet broad and twenty or thirty long, which were divided into pages
                    by folding them in a zig-zag manner; and two pieces of thin deal attached to the
                    outermost folds served as boards, and gave these manuscripts, when closed, an
                    appearance very much like our old folios in wooden binding. The written language
                    of Mexicocontained a few real hieroglyphics or symbols, purely conventional, to
                    designate such objects as water, earth, air, day, night, speech, and also for
                    numbers; but it was essentially a system <hi rend="italic">of
                    picture-writing,</hi> in which objects were represented by coloured figures
                    having a resemblance more or less exact to themselves. With all its necessary
                    imperfections, this instrument was familiarly employed to a prodigious extent in
                    deeds and instruments for effecting the transmission and sale of property. The
                    government kept couriers for conveying intelligence from all parts of the
                    empire; and the capital was watched and cleaned by a sort of police
                    establishment. This is the bright side of Mexican civilisation. On the other
                    hand, it must be kept in view, that the Mexicans had no tame animals, no made
                    roads, no money to serve as a universal medium of exchange in commercial
                    transactions. The government was originally a perfect feudal monarchy, in which
                    all power was monopolized by a numerous nobility and the priesthood. The great
                    mass of the people were serfs, attached to the soil, and transferred with it
                    from owner to owner by descent or purchase. The peasants or slaves of a nobleman
                    were allowed a certain portion of land, which they cultivated in common for
                    their subsistence: the rest of their labour belonged to their lord. The country
                    swarmed with beggars, and thousands were swept off every few years by famine. As
                    among the ancient Egyptians and the Chinese, immutable custom, regulating every
                    act of civil and common life, chained up the course of improvement, and spread a
                    languid monotony over society. The crown was elective, and the powers of the
                    monarch small, till the privileges of the nobles were destroyed by the policy
                    and ambition of Montezuma. The religion of the Mexicans breathed a savage
                    spirit, which sinks them, in a moral point of view, far below the hordes of
                    wandering Indians. Their deities, represented by mis-shapen images of serpents
                    and other hideous animals, were the creation of the darkest passions of the
                    human breast, of terror, hatred, cruelty, revenge. They delighted in blood, and
                    thousands of human sacrifices were annually offered at their shrines. The places
                    of worship, called Teocallis, were pyramids composed of terraces placed one
                    above another, like the temple of Belus at Babylon. They were built of clay, or
                    of alternate layers of clay and unburnt bricks, but in some cases faced with
                    slabs of polished stone, on which figures of animals are sculptured in
                    relief.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Robertson was
                    mistaken in believing that the Teocallis were in all cases mere masses of earth,
                    without masonry. See Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    III, English translation.</p></note> One or two small chapels stood upon the
                    summit, inclosing images of the deity. The largest known, which is composed of
                    four stories or terraces, has a breadth of 480 yards at the base, and a height
                    of 55. These structures served as temples, tombs, and observatories; and it is
                    remarkable that their sides are always placed exactly in the direction of the
                    meridian. This leads us to the most interesting fact connected with Mexican
                    civilisation, we mean the perfection of their calendar. The civil year was
                    composed of 365 days, divided into 18 months of 20 days, and 5 supplementary
                    days. The Mexicans had besides a ritual or religious year for the regulation of
                    their festivals; and, by means of a cycle of 52 years, and a very complicated
                    method of computation, the religious and civil periods were connected with one
                    another, and the civil year made to correspond with the natural by the
                    intercalation of 13 days at the end of the cycle. The month was divided into
                    four weeks of five days, but each day of the month had a distinct name; and
                    Humboldt has given strong reasons for believing that these names were borrowed
                    from an ancient zodiac formed of 27 or 28 lunar Houses, which was made use of
                    from the remotest antiquity in Tartary, Thibet, and India. The calendar of the
                    Mexicans bespeaks a degree of scientific skill, and an accuracy of observation,
                    which are not easily reconciled with their semi-barbarous habits, their general
                    ignorance in other things, and the recent date of their civilisation according
                    to their own accounts. It is here, indeed, and not in their language, that we
                    find distinct traces of their connection with Asiatic nations. The character of
                    the Mexicans is probably the same at this day as before the conquest, which, we
                    are disposed to think, made less change in the situation of the people than is
                    often supposed, though it annihilated the rank and privileges of the nobles. The
                    Mexican Indian is grave, suspicious, and taciturn; quiet and placid in his
                    external deportment, but rancorous in his spirit; submissive to his superiors,
                    harsh and cruel to those beneath him. His intellect is limited, and chiefly
                    developes itself in imitative labours and mechanical arts. Slow, cautious, and
                    persevering, he loves, both in his acts and thoughts, to travel in a beaten
                    track. The people, though speaking many different languages, have nearly the
                    same physical character. The Mexicans have olive complexions, narrow foreheads,
                    black eyes, coarse glossy black hair, and thin beards. They are of the middle
                    size, and well-proportioned in their limbs. A person with any defect or
                    deformity is rarely seen amongst them. They are healthy, and live to an advanced
                    age, when life is not shortened by drunkenness. The Tolteck and Azteck races,
                    when they established themselves in the country, diffused their own language
                    partially from the lake of Nicaragua to the 37th parallel. They reclaimed, by
                    degrees, many of the neighbouring savage tribes to a settled mode of life, and
                    spread a feeble degree of civilisation over a mixed mass of nations, speaking,
                    according to Clavigero, 35 languages, of which Humboldt tells us that 20 still
                    exist. The Azteck language is one of the most copious and polished of the
                    American tongues, and abounds in words of the immoderate length of 12 or 15
                    syllables. It is uncertain what was the number of subjects over whom Montezuma
                    ruled. The ruins in the valley of Tenochtitlan, on which the capital stands,
                    show that it must have been more populous before the conquest than now; but the
                    population at present is diffused over an incomparably wider space; and, upon
                    the whole, there are no good grounds for believing that the number of civilized
                    Indians was much greater when Cortes landed, than in 1803, when it amounted to
                    2,000,000.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193037921" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7921-0624"/><p>The civilisation of Mexico as well as Peru, owed its existence to one single
                    cause,—the patient, submissive, and superstitious character of the people, which
                    fitted them to be beasts of burden, under an aristocracy of priests and nobles,
                    who were led, perhaps, partly by lights derived from abroad, partly by the
                    instinct of self-interest, to devise means for holding the mass of the community
                    in subjection. Many of the nations which continued savage, such as the
                    Algonquins and Iroquois, were probably equal to the Mexicans in intellect; but
                    their propensity to superstition was less, and their energy of character was too
                    great to permit of their being enslaved by their chiefs. It is chiefly in the
                    variety of their primitive character that we must seek for the cause of the
                    diversity of manners and institutions we find among the American nations.</p><p>The ancient empire of Peru, more extensive than that of Mexico embraced the whole
                    sea-coast from Pastos to the river Maule, a line of 2500 miles in length. Its
                    breadth is uncertain; but as it included both declivities of the Andes, it must
                    have extended in some cases to 500 miles, and the entire surface of the empire
                    probably exceeded 500,000 square miles. It is plain, however, from the imperfect
                    history of the Incas which has been preserved, that within this space there were
                    many districts where their authority was feeble, and others inhabited by tribes
                    which were entirely independent. One part of the country, besides, consisted of
                    a sandy desert, while the most elevated tracts were uninhabitable from cold. It
                    must not therefore be supposed that the capacity of the country to support
                    population was commensurate with the extent of its surface. Still the magnitude
                    of the Peruvian empire, in the midst of an immense multitude of independent
                    savage communities, so extremely minute, that a hundred of them might have been
                    planted without crowding, in one of its provinces, is an extraordinary
                    phenomenon. The creating and maintaining of such an empire is a proof that the
                    Peruvians had made no trifling progress in the useful arts and in the science of
                    government. To keep in subjection so many remote provinces, there must have been
                    an efficient military force, rapid means of communication, considerable
                    revenues, an organized magistracy capable of understanding and executing the
                    plans of rulers, who had sufficient political skill and knowledge of human
                    nature to adapt their institutions and arrangements to the wants, habits, and
                    character of a great variety of dissimilar nations, spread over a territory
                    reaching as far as from Lisbon to the banks of the Wolga. It is clear that the
                    ruling tribe, which was able to extend its dominion, and to a considerable
                    extent its language, over a space of 2500 miles, must have possessed a marked
                    superiority of some kind over the hordes that surrounded it. We must remember,
                    besides, that the Peruvians lay under the disadvantage of being destitute of
                    even such an imperfect instrument of communication as the hieroglyphical
                    language of the Mexicans, and that they were extremely deficient in military
                    spirit. Indeed it is one of the most singular facts connected with the history
                    of America, that by far the largest empire it contained was formed by the most
                    unwarlike people in it. The dominion of the Incas was founded entirely on
                    policy, superstition, and the arts. It could only be by the intelligence and
                    skill which civilisation developes, that the Peruvians conquered tribes superior
                    to themselves in courage; and it was by policy and superstition that the Incas
                    tamed the rudeness of savage tribes, and held distant countries in
                    subjection.</p><p>Robertson justly observes, that the Peruvians “had advanced far beyond the
                    Mexicans, both in the necessary arts of life, and in such as had some title to
                    the name of elegant.” In two points only were they inferior; in their calendar
                    or mode of computing time, and in their want of such a substitute for writing as
                    the Aztecks possessed in their hieroglyphics.</p><p>Agriculture was conducted with greater care and success in Peru than in Mexico
                    The lands capable of cultivation were divided into three shares. One was
                    consecrated to the service of religion, the erection of temples, and the
                    maintenance of priests; the second was set apart as a provision for the support
                    of the government; and the third and largest share, which was reserved for the
                    people, was parcelled out, not among individuals, but among the hamlets and
                    villages, according to the number and rank of the inhabitants; and a new
                    division was made every year to meet any change that might arise in the
                    circumstances of the parties. The members of each little community went to the
                    fields under overseers, and cultivated the land by their joint labour. The
                    produce was distributed among the families and individuals according to their
                    wants, while the evils of famine were provided against by storing up the corn in
                    granaries. The Peruvians having no draught animals, and no ploughs, turned up
                    the earth with wooden mattocks; but their skill and care were exemplified in
                    irrigation, which they practised extensively, and in their employing the dung of
                    sea birds as manure, of which great stores exist on the islands near the coast.
                    Their masonry was superior to that of the Mexicans. Like the ancient Egyptians,
                    they understood mechanics sufficiently to move stones of vast size, even of 30
                    feet in length, of which specimens are still existing in the walls of the
                    fortress of Cusco. They had the art of squaring and cutting blocks for building
                    with great accuracy; and they did not effect their purpose, as Dr Robertson
                    supposes, merely by chipping the stones, or rubbing them together so as to fit
                    the surface of the one to that of the other, without regard to symmetry of form.
                    It is now known that they had hard chissels, made of copper, with a mixture of 6
                    per cent. of tin; a proof of considerable skill in the working of metals. With
                    these they hewed the stones into parallelopipeds, which were disposed in
                    “courses as regular,” says Humboldt, "as those of Roman workmanship.” They arc
                    joined with such nicety, that the line which divides the blocks can scarcely be
                    perceived; and the outer surface is in some cases covered with carving. The
                    palaces or lodges of the Incas, of which there are many remains, had doors with
                    slanting sides like the Egyptian; sloping roofs, which, it is supposed, were
                    covered with rushes or stone slabs; no windows, but niches symmetrically
                    distributed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Humboldt’s account of the ancient buildings of Callo and Cunnar, vol. i. and ii.

                    which are so rare in Mexico are pretty abundant in Peru; a fact for which we can
                    only account by the difficulty with which the Mexicans erected buildings, in
                    consequence of their inferiority in the art of masonry. The architecture of the
                    Peruvians, like every thing else connected with their social state, displays a
                    remarkable uniformity, not only of style, but of plan. “It is impossible,” says
                    Humboldt, “to examine a single edifice of the time of the Incas, without
                    recognising the same type in all the others which cover the ridge of the Andes,
                    along an extent of 450 leagues.”</p><p>The ancient public roads of Peru are justly considered as striking monuments of
                    the political genius of the government<pb break="no" facs="nls:193037934" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7934-0625"/>. One of these
                    extended along the sides of the Andes from Quito to Cusco, a distance of 1500
                    miles. It is about forty feet broad, and paved with the earth and stones which
                    were turned up from the soil; but in some marshy places it is formed, like the
                    old Roman roads, of a compact body of solid masonry. A tolerably level line is
                    preserved, by filling up hollows, cutting down small eminences, and winding
                    round the sides of large ones. At proper distances zambos or storehouses were
                    erected, for the accommodation of the Inca and his messengers. A similar road
                    was made along the coast in the low country. Fissures a few yards in breadth
                    were passed by bridges formed of beams laid horizontally; and an invention, at
                    once bold and ingenious, afforded the means of crossing deep ravines, or the
                    channels of rivers, which happened to intersect the route. This consisted of a
                    suspension bridge, perfectly analogous in its principle to those recently
                    introduced in Britain. It was formed of half a dozen of cables of twisted
                    osiers, passed over wooden supports, and stretched from bank to bank; then bound
                    together with smaller ropes, and covered with bamboos. Humboldt passed over one
                    of these pendulous bridges, of 120 feet span; and Mr Miers crossed one of 225
                    feet span, over which loaded animals might travel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi>

                    sail, which, by a particular contrivance, could be made to tack and veer. In
                    this respect the Peruvians were a stage in advance of all the other American
                    races, who had nothing superior to the canoe with paddles. The Peruvians
                    manufactured a rude species of pottery: they understood the art of spinning,
                    and, in an imperfect degree, that of weaving. They procured native gold by
                    washing the gravel of rivers, and silver, and perhaps copper, by working veins
                    downward from the outcrop. They knew how to smelt and refine the silver ore; and
                    they possessed the secret of giving great hardness and durability to copper by
                    mixing it with tin. Their utensils and trinkets of gold and silver are said to
                    be fashioned with neatness and even taste. On the other hand, they had no money,
                    no knowledge of iron or glass; and they were ignorant of the mode of mortising
                    or joining beams, and of casting arches. They had no animals fitted for draught;
                    but the llama, a small species of camel, which they had tamed, was employed to
                    some extent as a beast of burden.</p><p>The political organization of Peru, which was artificial in a high degree,
                    reminds one, in some of its features, of the old system of the Saxons in
                    England, but bears a more general resemblance to that of the ancient Egyptians.
                    The mass of the people were in a state of servitude, except a small number, who
                    were free; above these in rank were the Curacas, or chiefs of districts, who
                    formed a sort of nobility; and above the whole, the family of the Incas, the
                    members of which, by intermarrying only with themselves, formed a numerous and
                    distinct caste. For the purposes of police and civil jurisdiction, the people
                    were divided into parties of ten families, like the tythings of Alfred, over
                    each of which was an officer. A second class of officers had control over five
                    or ten tythings, a third class over fifty or a hundred. These last rendered
                    account to the Incas, who exercised a vigilant superintendence over the whole,
                    and employed inspectors to visit the provinces, as a check upon
                    maladministration. Each of these officers, down to the lowest, judged, without
                    appeal, in all differences that arose within his division, and enforced the laws
                    of the empire, among which were some for punishing idleness, and compelling
                    every one to labour. It is probable that the tythings and hundreds, as in
                    England, would lose their numerical signification in course of time, and become
                    mere local allotments. In the hamlets and villages, a person mounted a tower
                    every evening, and announced where and how the inhabitants were to be employed
                    next day. The taxes were paid in the produce of the fields; and magazines for
                    receiving them were established in every district. Such is the account given by
                    Acosta and Garcilasso of the civil institutions of Peru, which may be correct
                    with regard to the oldest possessions of the Incas near Cusco, where their power
                    had been long established; but it is not probable that such a complicated system
                    was ever fully in operation in the more distant parts of the empire.</p><p>The government of Peru was a theocracy. The Inca was at once the temporal
                    sovereign and the supreme pontiff. He was regarded as the descendant and
                    representative of the great deity the sun, who was supposed to inspire his
                    counsels, and speak through his orders and decrees. Hence even slight offences
                    were punished with death, because they were regarded as insults offered to the
                    divinity. The race of the Incas was held sacred. To support its pretentions, it
                    was very desirable that it should be kept pure and distinct from the people; but
                    human passions are often too strong for the dictates of policy; and though the
                    marriages of the family were confined to their own race, the emperor, as well as
                    the other males of the blood royal, kept large harems stocked with beauties
                    drawn from all parts of the empire, and multiplied a spurious progeny, in whom
                    the blood of the “children of the sun” was blended with that of the " children
                    of the earth.” Among a simple-minded and credulous people, the claims of the
                    Incas to a celestial origin seem to have been implicitly believed. They were
                    blindly obeyed, and treated with a respect bordering on adoration, by the nobles
                    as well as the common people. The Peruvians worshipped the sun, the moon, the
                    evening star, the spirit of thunder, and the rainbow; and had erected temples in
                    Cusco to all these deities. That of the sun, which was the most magnificent, had
                    its walls covered with plates of gold. The sacrifices consisted of the objects
                    most prized by the people, of grain and fruits, of a few animals, and of the
                    productions of their own industry. Sabeism, as it is the most rational of all
                    the forms of idolatry, so it is generally the most mild; and doubtless this
                    results from the tendency which it has to fix the thoughts on the marks of
                    beneficence and wisdom which are displayed in the works of nature. The Peruvian
                    temples were accordingly never polluted, like those of Mexico with the blood of
                    human victims; and the Incas even went farther, and signalized their zeal
                    against such horrid rites, by suppressing them in all the countries they
                    conquered. Though their history exhibits some bloody deeds, the general
                    character of their government was the reverse of cruel. The severe punishments
                    prescribed by their laws were rarely inflicted, and rebellion was scarcely known
                    in their dominions. The Inca not only assumed the title of the father of his
                    people, but the vices as well as the merits of his government sprung partly from
                    the attempt made to construct the government on the model of paternal authority,
                    and partly from the blending of moral and religious injunctions with civil
                    duties. Hence the idle pretension of the state to reward virtuous conduct, as
                    well as to punish crimes; hence too the plan of labouring in common, the
                    extinction of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037947" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7947-0626"/>individual property, the absurdities of eating,
                    drinking, sleeping, tilling, building, according to fixed universal rules; in
                    fine, that minute and vexatious regulation of all the acts of ordinary life,
                    which converted the people into mere machines in the hands of an immense corps
                    of civil and religious officers. Such a system may have served to reclaim some
                    tribes from the savage state; but it must have stifled the seeds of improvement,
                    and left the mass of the people more stupid and imbecile than it found them. The
                    government was as pure a despotism, probably, as ever existed; but its
                    theocratical character, no doubt, helped to mitigate the ferocity of its spirit.
                    Superstition and force are the two bases on which tyranny rests in all
                    countries; and in proportion as it is firmly seated on the one, it stands less
                    in need of the support of the other. The Inca had so completely enslaved the
                    minds of his subjects, and the apparatus he wielded for directing and
                    controlling their acts was so perfect, that he was able in a great measure to
                    dispense with those terrific examples of cruelty and bloodshed, by which the
                    pure military despot operates on the fears of those who live under his
                    authority.</p><p>This system of the Peruvian monarchs, by which the people were kept in a state of
                    perpetual tutelage, merits the greater attention, because it is precisely that
                    which the Jesuits employed, in Paraguay and other districts, to reduce the
                    natives to a settled mode of life; and it seems in fact to be the only method by
                    which a semblance of civilisation can be introduced amongst the American
                    nations. Two things must be supposed to account for its prevalence: first, a
                    certain amount of timidity, passiveness, and superstition, in the body of the
                    people, implying weak passions, but not necessarily smallness of intellect; and,
                    secondly, a few minds of a higher class, to give an impulse to the rest, and to
                    control and regulate their acts. In the case of Peru did these ruling intellects
                    spring from the body of the people, and, after striking out new lights in morals
                    and legislation for themselves, devise a complex and artificial system for
                    establishing their power over the minds of the rest, by the help of superstition
                    and force? Or were they strangers from another country, and imbued with the
                    principles of a higher civilisation? If we may believe the Peruvian annals, the
                    latter was the case. About the year 1100 of our era, or perhaps a century later,
                    Manco Capac, with his wife and sister Mama Ocello, appeared as strangers on the
                    banks of the lake Titiaca. They were persons of majestic appearance, and
                    announced themselves as “children of the sun,” sent by their beneficent parent
                    to reclaim the tribes living there from the miseries of savage life. Their
                    injunctions, addressed to a people who probably worshipped the god of day, were
                    listened to by a few, who settled around them, and founded Cusco. By degrees,
                    other tribes were induced to renounce their wandering habits. Manco Capac
                    instructed the men in agriculture and the arts, and Mama Ocello taught the women
                    to spin and to weave. Laws, institutions, and religious rites, were added. The
                    form of a civilized society arose, which was gradually extended by persuasion or
                    conquest; the Incas having always planted their arts and religion wherever they
                    established their authority. Huana Capac, the twelfth in succession from the
                    founder of the dynasty, occupied the throne when the first party of Spaniards
                    visited Peru in 1527; and the empire was then still in a state of progress; for
                    this prince had conquered Quito at no distant date, and nearly doubled the
                    extent of his dominions.</p><p>Such is the account which the Peruvians give of the origin of their civilisation,
                    which we should be disposed to reject as a fable, if there were not peculiar
                    circumstances which give it some credibility. First, their institutions, taken
                    in the mass, do not present what may be called the American type. The mild and
                    paternal character which they display, the injunction to “love one another”
                    raised to the rank of a positive precept, the preference of the useful arts to
                    war, all breathe a spirit, not only foreign to the genius of the American
                    tribes, but exactly opposed in character to any thing which a native self-taught
                    legislator was likely to produce. Secondly, the artificial and systematic form
                    of the Peruvian institutions renders it improbable that they were developed by
                    the natural action of political causes, but strongly favours the idea, that they
                    were framed by a few designing heads, as an instrument to tame and govern a
                    patient, feeble, and credulous people, of rude or savage habits. A small number
                    of Jesuits were led, by a sagacious study of the savage character, to devise a
                    system extremely similar in its nature, which worked admirably. These
                    missionaries were the Manco Capacs of Paraguay; and, like the Incas, might, in
                    the course of two or three centuries, have extended their theocracy over as
                    large a space as Peru, if their situation had permitted them to employ force.
                    Thirdly, a million of native Peruvians yet survive, the living descendants of
                    those who built the temples of Cusco; and their extreme stolidity, apathy, and
                    feebleness of character, sufficiently testify that the chances were nearly as
                    great against a legislator like Manco Capac arising amongst them, as against the
                    Jews in the time of Augustus producing a being like Jesus Christ. They have the
                    weakness and passiveness which fit them to receive an impression from superior
                    directing minds; but they discover no trace of the intelligence, energy, and
                    originality which must have been united in the persons who planned and carried
                    into effect the political system of the Incas. We admit that oppression may have
                    degraded their character; but it cannot have entirely changed it. Look at the
                    Greeks of this day, who have been enslaved for a much longer period.</p><p>If, then, the civilisation of Peru was exotic, whence was it derived? To us it
                    appears most probable, that the legislators of Peru were either Chinese, or
                    persons who had received at second-hand a knowledge of the arts and institutions
                    of China; and our opinion is grounded on traits of resemblance in the manners,
                    laws, arts, and institutions of the two nations, which, in our opinion, are too
                    numerous, striking, and peculiar, to be the effect of chance. We shall mention
                    some of the most prominent.</p><p>1. The first and most obvious resemblance is in the singularly artificial frame
                    of society in both countries. In China, as in Peru, the legislation is <hi rend="italic">directive</hi> as well as punitive, and is distinguished by that
                    minute and elaborate system of regulation, inspection, and control, which
                    interferes with the most trifling actions of ordinary life, and reduces the mass
                    of the people to the condition of automata, moved and guided in every thing by
                    the rulers. China, says Mr Barrow, is a great school, in which the magistrates
                    are the masters, and the people the scholars. It might be more correctly
                    compared to a large monastic establishment, in which each person has his place
                    and his duty assigned to him, and all his acts directed by superiors, whose
                    wisdom and authority he is not permitted to question. The Chinese have the same
                    immense multitude of civil officers which the Peruvians had, and the same chain
                    of subordination from the emperor down to the petty constable. In China this
                    system was undoubtedly the growth of many centuries; but it was too artificial
                    to occur to the thoughts of a cazique, educated amongst a tribe of savages on
                    the sides of the Andes. 2. In China, as in Peru, the emperor assumes the title
                    of the "father <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037960" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7960-0627"/>of his people;” and his government is modelled
                    upon this figure of speech. He affects to be sprung from progenitors who <hi rend="italic">descended from heaven,</hi> like the children of the sun; and he
                    unites the character of supreme pontiff with that of temporal prince. There are
                    vestiges, too, of the worship of the heavenly bodies in China.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See account of the temples at
                    Pekin dedicated to the heavens, the north star, the moon, the earth, &amp;c.,
                    and of the festival kept at the summer solstice, like the grand solar festival
                    in Peru. <hi rend="italic">(Hist. G</hi><hi rend="italic">é</hi><hi rend="italic">n. des Voyages,</hi> tom. vi. p. 32-34.)</p></note> 3. The Chinese
                    emperor extends an ostentatious patronage to agriculture, by celebrating an
                    annual festival in its honour; on which occasion he proceeds to the field in
                    great pomp, and takes a part in the labour of cultivating the ground with his
                    own hands. This singular custom existed in Peru, where the Incas went through an
                    annual ceremony perfectly similar. How foreign was such an institution to the
                    spirit of the American tribes! 4. In China agriculture is in a rude state, and
                    exhibits proofs of intelligence and skill only in two things—the use of manures,
                    and a laborious system of irrigation. Precisely the same circumstances
                    characterized the agriculture of Peru. 5. The internal taxes of China, like
                    those of Peru, are paid in kind (maize, rice, silk, cotton, &amp;c.), and stored
                    in public magazines or granaries. 6. The Chinese government maintained public
                    roads, even in those provinces where neither carriages nor beasts of burden were
                    used, of course for the use of pedestrians; and storehouses or places of
                    refreshment were built upon them at proper distances.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Histoire Générale</hi><hi rend="italic">des Voyages,</hi> tom. vi. p. 170.</p></note> The Peruvians
                    constructed roads on precisely the same plan, and for the same purposes; and
                    this was done by no other people in America. 7. The Chinese do not inter the
                    bodies of the dead, but lay them on the ground, and raise a tumulus or conical
                    heap of earth over them. Such was also the practice in Peru. The only
                    barbarously cruel rite practised in Peru, that of immolating the Inca’s
                    domestics at the obsequies of their master, was brought into China by the
                    Tartars.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> p. 391.</p></note> Its existence is an anomaly in each
                    case; for the genius of both nations was peaceful and mild. 8. The architecture
                    of the Chinese displays little taste, but is distinguished by two
                    peculiarities—the power shown of cutting and moving immense masses of
                    stone,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the account
                    of the bridges formed of huge blocks of stone, without arching, in Prevost’s <hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gén.</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Voyages,</hi> tom. vi. p. 179.</p></note> and the uniformity of style which
                    pervades their structures, of every size and description. “All the buildings,”
                    says Mr Barrow, “from the meanest hut to the viceroy’s palace, are upon one
                    plan.” Humboldt remarks the same adherence to a single model among the
                    Peruvians; and the walls of Cusco show that they were acquainted with the method
                    of moving stones of prodigious size. The Chinese were fond of covering their
                    walls with carving; and examples of the same practice occur in Peru. If any of
                    the Peruvian buildings had remained entire with their roofs on, it would perhaps
                    have been found, that the type or primary architectural form employed in the two
                    countries was not very dissimilar; and some allowance should be made for the
                    circumstance, that Peru must have borrowed her models from China 700 or perhaps
                    1000 years ago. 9. The Peruvians made coarse pottery; and all the world knows
                    that this is an art in which the Chinese excel. The Peruvians were the only
                    American nation who had made any progress in the art of fusing and alloying
                    metals, in which the Chinese have long been distinguished by their skill. 10.
                    The Peruvians had dramas and dramatic spectacles. Where could a people so
                    uninventive have caught the idea of such entertainments, if not from China,
                    where they have been long familiar to the people? There were mimics and buffoons
                    in Mexico but nothing, we believe, to which the term drama could be applied. II.
                    But perhaps the most remarkable coincidence is found in an invention entirely
                    confined to the two countries. We have described the suspension bridges made of
                    ropes, employed by the Peruvians in crossing deep ravines. Now it is singular
                    that bridges of the very same description, some of chains, and <hi rend="italic">some of ropes,</hi> are found in the south of China, and nowhere else except in
                    Thibet, which has interchanged arts and customs with China from time immemorial.
                    This single fact we would consider as a proof of communication between the two
                    countries. The Peruvians made their ropes of twisted osiers, and the Chinese had
                    ropes also of this description.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prevost, <hi rend="italic">Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gén.</hi><hi rend="italic">des Voyages,</hi> tom. vi. p. 179, and tom. vii. p.
                    339.</p></note> 12. From what people nearer than the Chinese could the Peruvians
                    borrow the idea of rafts with a mast and sail? These rafts, supporting covered
                    huts, may be considered as literal copies of some that are used in China; and
                    the peculiar mechanism employed in lieu of a rudder is no doubt borrowed from
                    the paddles attached to the Chinese boats, fore and aft.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> tom. vi. p. 211,
                    and tom. xiii. p. 583.</p></note> 13. The Chinese in ancient times made use of
                    quippus or knotted cords to facilitate calculation. Is it not probable that this
                    invention had passed from them to the Peruvians, the Mexicans, the Kaluschi, and
                    other American nations who employed it? It would be easy to trace similar
                    analogies in many other customs, laws, and institutions of the two nations. Both
                    had nunneries or religious societies of women, who lived under a vow of
                    celibacy; both had a class of literary men (the Havaracs and Amantas, or poets
                    and philosophers, in Peru), patronised by the government; both divided the year
                    into twelve months, and placed the beginning of it in January (a coincidence the
                    more remarkable, as the year of the Mexicans and other northern nations
                    consisted of 18 months); both were strangers to the use of milk, cheese, and
                    butter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Barrow, in
                    his article <hi rend="smallcaps">China</hi> (originally printed in the <hi rend="italic">Supplement,</hi> and incorporated with this edition of the
                    Encyclopaedia), is our authority for this fact, which is the more remarkable, as
                    the Mongols, the neighbours and conquerors of the Chinese, had the use of all
                    the three articles immemorially.</p></note> These facts may suffice, for we have
                    not room for lengthened inquiries; neither are we anxious to press our argument
                    beyond its proper limits. Our position is, not that the Peruvians are descended
                    from the Chinese, but simply that Peru had been inoculated with civilisation by
                    persons who derived their ideas from China. If it is asked why these persons did
                    not import from China the use of letters, the method of casting arches, and many
                    other arts practised there, our answer is, that no individual, and still less
                    any casual assemblage of individuals such as the purposes of trade or navigation
                    might bring together, possesses a knowledge of every art and science which
                    exists in his country. How many men are there in England at this day, who could
                    not even carry the knowledge of the alphabet to another country? We must
                    remember, too, that all the arts existing in China do not exist in every
                    province of it, and have not always existed in those provinces where we now find
                    them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The uniformity and
                    unchangeableness of customs in China have evidently been much exaggerated. The
                    empire is formed of <pb corresp="kp-eb0702-7973-0628" xml:id="pbn7628"/> an
                    assemblage of small states, conquered one after another, each of which must have
                    had its peculiar laws, manners, and superstitions; and common sense tells us,
                    that to blend these into one perfectly homogeneous mass, must have required a
                    much longer period than has elapsed since the empire attained its present
                    magnitude. It would be easy, too, to find instances of the Chinese having
                    changed their customs, both in matters of business and matters of domestic
                    economy.</p></note> As to the means of <pb corresp="pbn7628" facs="nls:193037973" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7973-0628"/> communication,
                    it is evident that the trade-wind renders Peru almost unapproachable from
                    Eastern Asia, between the parallels of 30⁰ north and 30⁰ south latitude. But
                    beyond these limits the west winds prevail, and hence China, in point of
                    facility of access, is nearer to Peru than the Society or Marquesas Islands. The
                    Chinese have long exposed themselves to the casualties of a maritime life, in
                    vessels of large size, provisioned for many months; and at this day they perform
                    voyages of 3000 or 4000 miles, to Ceylon and Polynesia.</p><p>The Quichua language, or that of Peru, was spread, by the care of the Incas, over
                    all the countries which they conquered, so far at least as to be understood, if
                    not spoken, by the great variety of tribes subject to their Sway. It is
                    understood at present as far as Santiago del Estero, 1200 miles of direct
                    distance south-east from Cusco. This single fact proves both the long duration
                    of their power, and the efficiency of their internal administration. It is said
                    to be the most rich, polished, and harmonious of the South American languages,
                    abounding in vowel sounds, but wanting those corresponding to the Spanish
                    consonants b, d, f, g, 1, x, v. Like all the other American tongues, it wants
                    terms for abstract and universal ideas, such as <hi rend="italic">time, space,
                    being, substance, matter, body,</hi> and even such as <hi rend="italic">virtue,
                    justice, liberty, gratitude.</hi> There are five dialects of the Quichua, which
                    are spoken in Peru proper, and in Quito, New Granada, and a considerable part of
                    La Plata, and not only by the Aborigines, but by many Spaniards of the higher
                    classes. The Peruvians had no alphabetic writing. They possessed a very rude
                    species of hieroglyphics, of which little use was made, and the quippus or
                    knotted cords of various colours; but whether these last were employed to record
                    events, or were merely instruments of calculation, is a question which we must
                    confess our inability to solve. The history of Peru, as it has reached us, seems
                    to have been preserved entirely by tradition, aided perhaps by popular
                    songs.</p><p>The Peruvians, according to Mr Stevenson, are of a copper colour, with a small
                    forehead, the hair growing on each side from the extremities of the eye-brows;
                    they have small black eyes, a small nose, a moderately sized mouth, with
                    beautiful teeth; beardless chin (except in old age), and a round face. Their
                    hair is black, coarse, and sleek, the body well proportioned, the feet small,
                    the stature rather diminutive. Their intellectual qualities, according to Μ.
                    Ulloa, are of the lowest order. The most prominent trait in their character is
                    an imperturbable and incurable apathy. Though half-naked, they are as contented
                    as the Spaniard in his most splendid raiment. Gold and silver have so little
                    influence over them, that the greatest recompense will not induce them to
                    perform the slightest service voluntarily. Neither power nor dignity moves them;
                    and they receive with the same indifference the office of alcalde and that of
                    executioner. They are habitually slow in their motions, and extremely indolent.
                    When employed at any piece of labour, if the master withdraw his eye for a
                    moment, they cease to work. They are timid, shy, secretive, and always grave,
                    even in the dances, which are their favourite pastime. The love of intoxicating
                    liquors is deeply rooted in their nature. They prepare a fermented beverage
                    called chicha, from maize, by a process known to them before the conquest, and
                    at. their festivals drink till their senses fail them, day after day. This
                    bestial habit, however, is common to all the American nations, and is confined
                    to the men, for the women are in general strictly sober. The Peruvians are a
                    gentle and mild people; they are fond of their dogs, and breed up hogs, geese,
                    and chickens, for which they have so tender a regard, that they will often
                    neither kill nor sell them. Their huts, says Mr Stevenson, consist of stones
                    laid upon one another without any cement or mortar, thatched over with long
                    grass or straw, affording no defence either from the wind or the rain. One small
                    room contains the whole family; their bed a sheep-skin or two; their furniture
                    one or two earthen pots. The principal food of the Peruvians is maize; but they
                    raise also potatoes, wheat, beans, camates, yucas, pumpkins, and other
                    vegetables. Christianity, imposed upon them in dogmas, by priests who take no
                    pains to enlighten them, has scarcely gained admission to their understandings,
                    and has no hold on their affections. They attend divine service from the dread
                    of chastisement, and give an outward assent to whatever they are taught, but
                    without any real religious impression being made upon their minds. They meet
                    death with the same stupid indifference as the ordinary accidents of life, and
                    rather decline than seek the assistance of a priest in their last hours. It
                    ought not to be forgotten, however, that the intellectual torpor which the
                    Peruvians display may be attributed in part to the deadening and debasing
                    effects of three centuries of brutal oppression. They still cherish in secret a
                    strong veneration for their ancient faith and their native government, which
                    displays itself even in the large towns. The story of Manco Capac (whom, since
                    numbers of our countrymen appeared in Peru, they affect to call an Englishman)
                    and Mama Ocello, the wealth, power, and beneficence of the Incas, are still
                    fresh in their memories, and are handed down from father to son with a degree of
                    fond admiration which three centuries of humiliation and misfortune seem only to
                    have rendered more intense. The barbarous murder of the Inca Atahualpa by
                    Pizarro is annually represented in the form of a tragedy. “In this performance,”
                    says Mr Stevenson, “the grief of the Indians is so natural, though excessive,
                    their songs so plaintive, and the whole is such a scene of distress, that I
                    never witnessed it without mingling my tears with theirs. The Spanish
                    authorities have endeavoured to prevent this exhibition, but without effect. The
                    Indians in the territory of Quito wear black clothes, and affirm that it is
                    mourning for their Incas, of whom they never speak but in a doleful tone.”</p><p>The oppression of the <hi rend="italic">mita,</hi> or forced labour in the mines,
                    with the introduction of the small-pox and the use of spiritous liquors, has
                    destroyed prodigious multitudes of the Indians since the conquest. What their
                    number was before that event it is impossible to tell; but, judging from the
                    extent of the Inca’s dominions, he probably had not less than three or four
                    millions of subjects. A pretended Spanish account, assigning a population of
                    eight millions to Peru shortly after the conquest, is known to be fictitious.
                    According to General Miller, there were 998,000 Indians in Peru about 1826; but
                    he does not include those in Quito or Bolivia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In this account of the Peruvians we have

                    Indians.</p></note></p><p>In Chili there were several tribes who possessed nearly<pb corresp="pbn7629" facs="nls:193037986" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7986-0629"/> all the arts
                    known to the Peruvians, but were distinguished from them by a finer physical
                    constitution, and an unconquerable spirit. When the Spaniards arrived, Chili,
                    according to Molina, was inhabited by fifteen tribes independent of each other,
                    who were spread over the country on both sides of the Andes, from latitude 30⁰
                    to the Straits of Magellan. They all spoke dialects of one language, which is
                    described as rich, harmonious, abounding in compound words, and having, like the
                    other American tongues, very complicated grammatical forms. It has no affinity
                    to the Quichua or Peruvian. The inhabitants of the plains are a stout people, of
                    middle stature; those of the mountains are tall; and one tribe, the Tehuels or
                    Patagonians, surpass in size every other nation in the world. All the tribes
                    inhabiting the plains, except those of the extreme south, now make use of
                    horses. The complexion of the Chilian tribes is, like that of the other American
                    nations, a reddish brown; but one tribe is said to be of a clear red and white.
                    They do not paint their bodies. The Chilians lived partly by hunting, but
                    chiefly by agriculture, before they had any intercourse with Europeans. They
                    cultivated maize, magu, guegen, tuca, quinoa, the potato, pumpkins, and some
                    species of pulse; and to these they added, as food, the flesh of a small rabbit,
                    and of the Chilihueque or Araucanian camel, of whose wool they are said to have
                    manufactured cloth. Like the Peruvians, they understood the use of manure,
                    practised irrigation with considerable skill, and turned up the ground with a
                    wooden spade or mattock. They boiled their grain in earthen pots, or brayed it
                    into meal after roasting it in hot sand; of the meal they made puddings or
                    bread, which they knew how to leaven, and various species of fermented drink.
                    They had gold, silver, copper, tin, and lead, procured probably by washing; but
                    they had few or no edge-tools of metal, as those found are almost always of
                    basalt. They made baskets and mats, extracted salt from sea-water, and were able
                    to give various dyes to their cloths. They used <hi rend="italic">quippus</hi>
                    or knotted cords for calculation, and, according to Mr Stevenson, for the
                    transmission of intelligence and for recording events. They lived in villages
                    formed of houses standing at a distance from one another, under hereditary
                    chiefs, but whose power was limited. It is remarkable that the Chinese mode of
                    catching wild ducks on the rivers, by covering the fisher’s head with a gourd,
                    was practised in Chili.</p><p>The Araucanians, the most intelligent, improved, and warlike of the Chilian
                    tribes, occupy about 200 miles of the sea-coast, between the 37th and 39th
                    parallels. They are of ordinary stature, but vigorously formed; bold, hardy,
                    hospitable, faithful to their engagements, generous to a fallen enemy, ardent,
                    intrepid, and enthusiastic lovers of liberty. Their vices are drunkenness, and a
                    contempt of other nations, springing from pride. Their government, in the
                    regularity of its form, and its sub-division of authority, has an outward
                    resemblance to the Peruvian; but the spirit of the two systems differs as widely
                    as the genius of the two nations. Araucania contains four tetrarchies, under
                    four toquis or princes, who are independent of one another, but confederated for
                    their joint security against foreign enemies. Each tetrarchy is divided into
                    five provinces, ruled by five chiefs called <hi rend="italic">Apo-</hi><hi rend="italic">Ulmen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and each province into nine
                    districts, governed by as many <hi rend="italic">Ulmen,</hi> who are subject to
                    the Apo-Ulmen, as the latter are to the toquis. These various chiefs (who all
                    bear the title of ulmen, as our nobility of all orders are barons) compose the
                    aristocracy of the country. They hold their dignities by hereditary descent in
                    the male line, and in the order of primogeniture. The supreme power of each
                    tetrarchy resides in a diet or great council of the ulmen, who assemble annually
                    in a large plain, like the Poles and Germans in old times; but as the people are
                    all armed, and have a high love of liberty, no resolution of the diet is of any
                    avail if it has not their hearty concurrence. The chiefs, indeed, are little
                    more than leaders in war; for the right of private revenge, which is fully
                    admitted, limits their authority in judicial matters; and they receive no taxes.
                    Their laws are merely primordial usages. The Araucanians can raise altogether
                    6000 or 7000 men, besides a body of reserve. When war is declared by the great
                    council, messengers bearing “arrows dipt in blood” are sent to all parts of the
                    country, to summon the men to arms. Unlike many barbarous nations, which are
                    immovably attached to their ancient customs, the Araucanians were not slow in
                    copying the military arts and tactics of the Spaniards. Their troops now consist
                    of infantry and cavalry; the former armed with pikes or clubs, the latter with
                    swords and lances. The infantry are formed into regiments of ten companies, each
                    company containing a hundred men. When they take the field, they carry parched
                    meal with them for provisions; they station sentinels, send out scouts, and have
                    advanced guards preceding their main body. When necessary for their security,
                    they dig ditches, and plant stakes along their sides, and throw up mounds of
                    earth. They advance to battle in lines well formed, and fight with intrepidity.
                    Their history affords a brilliant example of what a brave nation, animated by an
                    enthusiastic love of liberty, can accomplish under the greatest disadvantages.
                    After resisting the best troops and the best generals of Spain for two hundred
                    years, they at last compelled their proud enemies to acknowledge their
                    independence. The Araucanians were indebted for their success to a deliberate
                    species of courage, to which even the bravest of the North American tribes are
                    strangers; and they combined with it a degree of sagacity and intelligence,
                    which led them to adapt their mode of fighting to the new circumstances in which
                    they were placed. Experience having taught them the inefficiency of their old
                    missiles when opposed to musket balls, they soon laid aside their bows, and
                    armed themselves with spears, swords, or other weapons fitted for close combat.
                    Their practice was to advance rapidly within such a distance of the Spaniards as
                    would not leave them time to reload after firing. Here they received without
                    shrinking a volley, which was certain to destroy a number of them, and then
                    rushing forward in a close column, fought their enemies hand to hand. In this
                    way they gained many victories, and impressed the Spaniards with such a respect
                    for their courage, that an individual of this nation made their achievements the
                    subject of an epic poem. Combining the moral, intellectual, and physical
                    qualities of the Araucanians, they were certainly the finest native race in the
                    new world. They had nearly all the germs of civilisation which belonged to the
                    Mexicans and Peruvians; without the ferocity of the former, the apathy of the
                    latter, or the slavish habits common to both; and without having their minds
                    stupified by that grovelling superstition which the rulers of these two nations
                    seem to have considered as the only secure foundation of their authority. In
                    true courage, in manliness and energy <pb break="no" facs="nls:193037999" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7999-0630"/>of character,
                    they take precedence of all the American nations.</p><p>The Araucanians believe in a supreme being, and in many subordinate spirits, good
                    and bad. They believe also in omens and divination, but they have neither
                    temples nor idols, nor religious rites; and discover upon the whole so little
                    aptitude for the reception of religious ideas, that the Catholic missionaries
                    who are settled among them have had very little success in imbuing their minds
                    with a knowledge of Christianity. They believe in a future state, and have a

                    eminent French naturalist, has collected the authorities on the subject, in a
                    note published by Balbi in his Ethnographical Atlas; and they appear to us to
                    remove every rational doubt as to the fact of a race of men existing there,
                    whose average stature is about six feet, and among whom men seven feet high are
                    perhaps as common as men of six feet two or three inches in England. We cannot
                    help regarding the scepticism in which many writers have indulged upon this
                    question, as unphilosophical. The diversities of size in the human race are
                    innumerable, and stature, like other physical qualities, is hereditary. We form
                    in our minds, indeed, an idea of a standard size for man; but this is merely the
                    mean of all the varieties which come under our notice; and till we know all
                    these, our estimate cannot have any exactness. There are scarcely two nations
                    perhaps whose average height is the same, and who can pretend to such a
                    knowledge of the causes producing these varieties as to fix their precise
                    limits? That individuals seven feet high, free of weakness or defect, have
                    existed among ourselves, is a proof that there is nothing in such stature
                    inconsistent with the physical laws on which human life depends. And since
                    nobody denies that the dwarfish size which we witness occasionally in our own
                    country, as a deviation from the common type, becomes generic and universal
                    among the Laplanders and Esquimaux, why should the natural causes which produce
                    tall men at intervals among ourselves not be rendered equally fixed and
                    permanent in other cases? But the chief source of the incredulity of many
                    persons is obvious. Only one of the fifteen tribes who inhabit the south
                    extremity of the American continent is distinguished by the very tall stature
                    which is ascribed to the Patagonians; and as these tribes probably migrate from
                    place to place, from the coast, for instance, to the interior, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> a navigator touching at a bay where some of his
                    precursors profess to have met with the giants, may find no inhabitants at all,
                    or only men of ordinary size, and in either case may attribute to false reports
                    what is really the consequence of a change of habitation.</p><p>Of the numerous nations which inhabited Brazil, there is only one to whom we can
                    afford any special notice in this article. The Guaranis had at one time formed a
                    numerous people, which seems to have been spread over a larger surface than any
                    other now existing in America. Tribes, or remnants of tribes, whose relationship
                    to the Guaranis is attested by the strong evidence of their language, are found
                    diffused over the wide space between the Orinoco and the embouchure of the
                    Plata, over more than the half of South America. They are met with among the
                    Andes of Peru, in the province of Chiquitos, in Mattogrosso, in Paraguay, in
                    Minas Geraes; and the Omaguas, in the province of Quito, who, from their
                    nautical habits, and the influence they obtained on the upper part of the
                    Amazon, have been called the Phoenicians of the new world, are believed to be of
                    the same race. They constituted the bulk of the native population of Brazil when
                    the Portuguese gained possession of it, but were divided into many distinct
                    tribes, quite independent of one another, and living, not in contiguity, but
                    mixed with other nations. They are of low stature, two inches shorter than the
                    Spaniards, according to Azara, of a square form, fleshy, and ugly. Their colour
                    has a strong shade of the copper red, while that of the other Brazilian tribes
                    inclines generally to the tawny or black. Their character, like their physical
                    form, resembles that of the Peruvians. They are patient, torpid, silent,
                    downcast in their mien, mild, and passionless. Nearly all the Indians whom the
                    Portuguese have civilized or converted belong to this race. It is difficult to
                    account for their dissemination through the southern continent, amidst nations
                    much more brave and powerful than themselves. May we suppose that, like the
                    subjects of the Incas, they had been at one time the dominant tribe of an
                    extensive empire, which derived its force from union and civilisation? But if
                    such a state did exist, its date cannot be very ancient; for the identity or
                    close resemblance of the dialects spoken by the scattered portions of the
                    Guaranis, shows that their dispersion from a common point did not happen at a
                    very remote period.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr
                    Prichard’s <hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi> vol. ii. p. 487.</p></note> Yet no
                    memorial of its existence survives, either in traditions or monuments. The
                    supposition, therefore, that the Guarani tribes are the remnants of a once
                    powerful and united people, is scarcely admissible; and Azara thinks it more
                    probable that they have crept gradually from north to south. Their dispersion is
                    the more remarkable, as they are not a wandering but an agricultural people.
                    They live in the woods, or in small open spaces in the forests; cultivate maize,
                    beans, gourds, yams, mandioc; and eat also wild honey, and the flesh of monkeys
                    and various small quadrupeds.</p><p>The Indians whom the Jesuits civilized and collected into communities in the
                    celebrated settlements of Paraguay belonged chiefly to the nation of the
                    Guaranis. These missionaries are said to have borrowed the plan of the theocracy
                    which they established here from that which the Incas had introduced into Peru.
                    There is no doubt that the spirit of their system was the same; and, considering
                    that they were precluded from any other means of extending and supporting their
                    authority than persuasion, their success was remarkable. The settlements were
                    commenced about 1610, and were gradually extended over the country watered by
                    the Parana and Uruguay, between the 27th and 30th degrees of south <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038012" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8012-0631"/>
                    latitude, till the order of the Jesuits was suppressed in 1767. The plan of the
                    government may be called <hi rend="italic">parochial,</hi> for it was
                    administered entirely by the parochial clergy. The Indians were collected into
                    villages. Each village had its church, and its curate, who was assisted by one,
                    two, or more priests, according to the number of Indians under his charge. The
                    curate and assistant priests were nominated, not by the Spanish authorities, but
                    by the father superior, also a Jesuit, who exercised <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    vigilant superintendence over the whole. Indians were appointed in each village
                    with the titles of regidors and alcaldes; but they were merely instruments in
                    the hands of the curate and his assistants, in whom all power was lodged. The
                    curate gave his whole attention to religious offices, saying mass in the church,
                    and visiting the sick; while the assistant priests managed all secular matters,
                    directing the labour of the Indians who cultivated the ground, and training
                    others to the crafts of the weaver, mason, carpenter, goldsmith, painter, and
                    sculptor; for the fine arts were by no means neglected. Private property did not
                    exist The produce of the labour of the community was stored in magazines, from
                    which each family was supplied according to its wants, special provision being
                    made for aged persons, widows, and orphans. The surplus was sold by agents at
                    Buenos Ayres, and the proceeds employed in paying the taxes to the king, in
                    procuring ornaments for the churches, and various articles which the colonists
                    could not manufacture for themselves. The religious instruction was of the most
                    simple kind; but the service of the church was conducted with a well-trained
                    choir, a pompous ceremonial, and every accessory calculated to strike the
                    senses. The punishments were mild, and they were always accompanied with such
                    admonitions as a parent would address to a child whom he was chastising. Crimes,
                    in truth, were rare. The Indians, who regarded their spiritual chiefs with the
                    veneration due to beneficent beings of a superior order, scarcely felt humbled
                    in confessing their misdeeds; and offenders may have solicited correction, as
                    Raynal says, for the quieting of their consciences. The incursions of the
                    Portuguese compelled the Jesuits to take means for repelling force by force. All
                    the male Indians of the proper age were accordingly armed with muskets, and
                    disciplined as a militia. In 1732, according to Dobrizhoffer, the thirty
                    villages or parishes under the care of the missionaries contained a population
                    of 141,000 souls. The Jesuits had another establishment of the same kind among
                    the Chiriguas, a branch of the Guaranis, in the province of Chiquitos,
                    containing 30,000 or 40,000 Indians; a third, of smaller size, in the province
                    of Moxos; a fourth in California; and probably others. After the suppression of
                    the order, all these were committed to the care of friars of other descriptions;
                    and we believe they have universally fallen into a state of decay. The social
                    system established in Paraguay was the most effectual ever contrived for
                    reclaiming the Indians from their savage mode of life; but even its success
                    shows how hopeless the attempt is to raise the American tribes to the rank of
                    thoroughly civilized nations. The Jesuits were able to introduce settled habits
                    and a slight knowledge of religion and the arts among the Indians only by means
                    of the personal ascendency they acquired over them. It was a few superior minds
                    gaining the respect and confidence of a horde of savages, then employing the
                    influence they acquired to lead them as children; giving them such portions of
                    instruction as taught them to trust implicitly in their guides, working
                    alternately on their fears, their pride, their kind affections, but never fully
                    unveiling to them the springs of the machinery by which they were governed. The
                    incurable indolence of the savages rendered it necessary to prescribe the labour
                    as task-work, and to carry it on under the constant inspection of the
                    missionaries. The plan of cultivating the ground in common, and of storing the
                    produce in magazines, out of which the wants of each family were supplied, was
                    resorted to as a check upon their improvident habits. In short, the eye and the
                    hand of the missionaries were everywhere; and the social system was held
                    together entirely by their knowledge and address. When these were withdrawn, the
                    fabric soon fell into ruins, and the Indians relapsed into their idolatry and
                    savage habits, just as boys drop their tasks the moment they are liberated from
                    school.</p><p>We have dwelt a little upon this topic, because we think the experiment made by
                    the Jesuits in Paraguay and Chiquitos is almost an <hi rend="italic">instantia
                    crucis</hi> with regard to the capacity of the American tribes for receiving
                    Christianity and civilisation. From the moment that the Europeans landed in the
                    new world, benevolence has been at work to instruct some portions of these
                    tribes in religion and the arts; and flattering accounts have been published
                    from time to time of the success of those humane persons who dedicated their
                    lives to the task. But, after three centuries of incessant exertion, what is the
                    result? Is there one tribe that exhibits the steady industry, the provident
                    habits, the spirit of improvement, and the rational views of religion, which are
                    to be found in any parish of England? We cannot find that there is. Many tribes,
                    living near the whites, have adopted their habits and ideas to a certain extent,
                    but merely under the influence of imitation. While missionaries and teachers are
                    among them, every thing wears a favourable aspect; but their civilisation is
                    never self-sustained. It is created by the agency of men of higher natural
                    endowments; and when this is removed it moulders away, because it has no
                    foundation in their character. Many parties of Indians, remnants of tribes once
                    powerful, have lived peaceably on reserves of land, inclosed amidst the
                    population of the United States, for more than a century. No situation can be
                    imagined better fitted to promote their improvement; but in no one instance, so
                    far as we know, have they melted into the mass of the white population, or risen
                    to any thing near their level in knowledge and the useful arts. They live in
                    huts in no material degree better than the wigwams of their wandering brethren.
                    They are generally honest, but drunken, indolent, and ignorant, though teachers
                    and missionaries are employed by the government to instruct them. Basket-making
                    is almost the only trade they ply, and in their habits and character they may be
                    aptly compared to the gypsies of Europe, who exist in the midst of civilisation,
                    without partaking of its spirit or its benefits. It should be observed that
                    there is not the same reluctance in the whites to mingle their blood with the
                    red men, as with the blacks.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, on the habits and character of the Indians, Cooper’s

                    Much has been recently said of the progress made by the Cherokees; but we
                    suspect that what is witnessed there is but a flimsy veil of improvement, spread
                    over habits which are essentially savage. We are convinced, in short, that the
                    Indian is truly the man of the woods; and that, like the wild animals he lives
                    upon, he is destined to disappear before the advancing tide of civilisation,
                    which falls upon him like a blight, because it supplies new food to nourish his
                    vices, while it demands intellectual and moral faculties in which he is
                    deficient, and renders useless <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038025" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8025-0632"/>those qualities which predominate in his
                    character. We would not discourage the attempt to meliorate the lot of the
                    Indians; but this will succeed best when it is grounded on a true knowledge of
                    their natural capacities. Some of them are much more susceptible of moral and
                    religious improvement than others; but, to instruct and reclaim them
                    effectually, our belief is, that the system of the Jesuits is the only one that
                    holds out a chance of success. They must not merely be taught and preached to,
                    but they must be retained in a state of pupilage, trained to their duties,
                    controlled and directed in all their proceedings by intellects superior to their
                    own; and there are many tribes too ferocious and intractable for even this
                    method of tuition. We do not maintain that the character of the Indian nations
                    is indelible; but to effect any considerable change in it, the lapse of a longer
                    period would be required than the existence of these tribes is likely to extend
                    to. Neither do we think that there is any thing in the extinction of these
                    people by natural means which humanity should mourn over. In every state of life
                    man has but a brief span of existence allotted to him. Successive generations
                    fall like the leaves of the forest; and it should be remembered that the
                    extinction of a race of men by natural causes, means merely its non-renewal, or
                    the suspension of those circumstances which enabled it to continue its
                    existence.</p><p>To complete our general view of the aboriginal races, a few particulars remain to
                    be mentioned. Many of the tribes who inhabit the Pampas of South America make
                    use of horses. Dobrizhoffer enumerates eight equestrian tribes in the province
                    of Chaco, on the west side of the river Paraguay, who are generally
                    distinguished by tall and vigorous forms, and a bold and active character. The
                    Abipones and Mbayas are the most celebrated of these. The woods of Brazil are
                    too dense for equestrians; but horses are used by a few hordes in the great
                    plain of the Mississippi and in the north of Mexico The American tribes in
                    general either kill their prisoners or adopt them; but a few retain them as
                    slaves, and compel them to work. The Guaycurus of Brazil are an example. The
                    food of different tribes is extremely various. Maize, beans, pumpkins, and
                    mandioc, are raised in small quantities by some; natural fruits, berries,
                    bulbous roots, and bananas, are gathered by others. Those who dwell on the sides
                    of rivers live greatly on fish; in the plains, buffaloes, horses, and sheep, are
                    killed. In the forests of Brazil, monkeys, pigs, armadillos, pacas, agoutis, and
                    tapirs, are the favourite food; but birds, turtles, deer, and the coati, are
                    also taken; and in an emergency the Indians do not scruple to feed on serpents,
                    toads, and lizards, the larvae of insects, and other disgusting substances.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Spix’s <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi> vol. ii. p. 260.</p></note> Salt is used where it can be easily
                    obtained, and some season their food with capsicum. Some roast their meat,
                    others boil it; and not only several savage tribes, but even the civilized
                    Peruvians, ate their flesh raw. The Ottomaques, a tribe near the Orinoco, eat a
                    species of unctuous clay; and this strange diet, which no doubt owed its
                    introduction to the stern monitor, famine, is probably not extremely rare; for
                    Drs Spix and Martius noticed a similar practice in Brazil, and Captain Franklin
                    found the same food in use among an Indian tribe near the Frozen Ocean. The clay
                    is stated by this traveller to have a milky and not disagreeable taste.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Franklin’s <hi rend="italic">Second Journey,</hi> p. 24.</p></note> A great proportion of the tribes in
                    Brazil and the basin of the Orinoco, and some in all parts of America, indulge
                    in the horrid banquet of human flesh. Shame, in our sense of the term, is nearly
                    a stranger to the breasts of these savages. In the warm regions of Brazil, men
                    and women go entirely naked, except in the neighbourhood of the Portuguese
                    settlements, where some wear a band of cloth round the loins.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Spix’s <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi> vol. ii. p. 220.</p></note> In such situations, where the want of
                    shelter is little felt, their dwellings are often nothing more than a sort of
                    arbour formed by interlacing the open space between two or three trees with
                    twigs, and covering it with leaves so as to form a screen on the windward side,
                    while it is left entirely open on the other. The manufacture of bows and arrows,
                    war-clubs, baskets, mats (which, swung from a tree, serve them both as seats and
                    hammocks), and in some cases a coarse pottery, comprises the sum of their
                    practical skill in the arts. It has long been the practice of bands of
                    Portuguese, consisting chiefly of outlaws and vagabonds, to make marauding
                    expeditions among the Indians living near the great rivers, and to carry them
                    off and sell them clandestinely for slaves. This infamous trade is carried on in
                    despite of the orders of the government, which has issued many decrees for the
                    protection of the Indians, and, besides employing missionaries to convert them,
                    enjoined the governors of provinces to furnish them with hoes and other
                    agricultural implements. Wherever the negroes are introduced in great numbers,
                    as in the Capitanias of Santa Paulo and Rio Janeiro, and in the whole of the
                    West India islands, the red men rapidly disappear, the former being more
                    intelligent, more tractable in their habits, and more active and industrious.
                    The negroes are indeed a superior race to the Indians; and the existence of one
                    or two hundred blacks, as slaves, among some thousands of the Cherokees, does
                    not detract from the accuracy of this opinion. Missions for the conversion of
                    the Indians have been supported for more than two centuries by the governments
                    of Spain and Portugal. They are thinly spread over those parts of Mexico La
                    Plata, Peru, Brazil, and Colombia, which are still occupied by the savages; but
                    there are extensive districts in all these provinces in which they have never
                    been established, owing to the fierce character of the tribes, or the remote and
                    inaccessible nature of the country. A mission consists in general of one or two
                    friars or priests, who settle among the savages, learn their language, and,
                    besides teaching them the elements of Christianity, always endeavour to instruct
                    them in the more simple and useful arts, and to train them to settled habits. We
                    have seen many scattered natives of these establishments, but we have not met
                    with any work that gives a distinct account of them collectively to a recent
                    period. We believe, however, that many of them have been abandoned, owing to the
                    failure of the funds with which they were supported; and that the success of the
                    others has been extremely trifling. The late revolutions in these countries, by
                    liberating the Indians from their ancient state of tutelage under the whites,
                    has in many cases broken up the little settlements which the missionaries had
                    formed. This has been the result even in Brazil, where the political changes
                    have been least felt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> vol. i. p. 302, vol. ii. p. 261.</p></note></p><p>The problem as to the source whence America derived its population presents no
                    difficulty now, when the contiguity of the old and the new continent at
                    Behring’s Straits is known. The breadth of the sea here (latitude 66°) is only
                    forty-five English miles; the transit across is facilitated by two islands
                    placed almost exactly midway between Asia and America; and in severe winters a
                    firm body of ice joins the two continents. The climate, though rigorous, does
                    not prevent the country on each side from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038038" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8038-0633"/>being
                    inhabited. The Aleutian Isles, besides, at the latitude of 53⁰, which run in a
                    line like the piers of an immense bridge, from one continent to the other,
                    present such easy means of communication, that few savage tribes a little
                    familiar with sea-life could be long in Kamtschatka without threading their way
                    across the Pacific to the peninsula of Alyaska. Indeed, if a doubt could exist,
                    we have positive proof that America received part of its population from the
                    north-east extremity of Asia; for the Esquimaux, living on the east side of
                    Behring’s Straits, speak a language which is radically the same with that of the
                    Tchutkis on the opposite shores. Two other questions however present themselves.
                    Did all the tribes which inhabit America pass into it through this one channel?
                    And from what nation or nations of the old world are these tribes descended?
                    Now, it appears to us probable, that inhabitants may have been conveyed to
                    America by other routes besides that of Behring’s Straits and the Aleutian
                    Isles. We may form some idea of the chances of human beings from other climes
                    being cast on the shores of America, from the countless accidents which must
                    have scattered inhabitants over the thousands of islands on the Pacific Ocean.
                    Take the case, for instance, of Easter Island, which is within the zone of
                    variable winds for half of the year, and is 1500 miles from the nearest known
                    land whence it could receive inhabitants. This island is a mere speck in the
                    ocean, 10 miles in diameter; and supposing that it could be seen by an Indian in
                    his canoe from a distance of 25 miles on each side, a space of 60 miles in the
                    circumference of a circle of 1500 miles radius would thus represent the
                    probability of a canoe carried away by a storm coming within sight of it. If
                    then we suppose the wind to blow from any westerly point between north and
                    south, we shall find that the probability of a drifted canoe reaching the island
                    is only as 1 to 75. If we add the chances of the isle being passed in the
                    night-time, when it could not be seen, the probability will be only as 1 to 150.
                    But, further, to plant a breeding population on the isle, the canoe must have
                    carried women in it; and as the savages have not women with them in their canoes
                    perhaps more than once in three or four of their voyages, the probability is
                    thus diminished to 1 in 500. In other words, the peopling of an island in such a
                    situation as Easter Island may be considered as representing the result of 500
                    accidents, in which canoes were drifted to sea and wrecked. This single example
                    may give us an idea of the myriads of casualties which must have been
                    instrumental in dispersing the human species over the isles of
                    Polynesia,—casualties so numerous and so various, that they may be compared to
                    the chance sowing of the volatile seeds of plants by the winds. If we neglect
                    distance, it will be seen at once that the probability of a canoe reaching any
                    land in such circumstances, is in proportion to the angle the land subtends on
                    the horizon. In the extra-tropical regions the prevailing winds are from
                    north-west to south-west. The part of South America accessible with such winds
                    from Gambier’s Islands subtends an angle of about 40⁰, or ten times as great as
                    the angle subtended by a space of 25 miles on each side of Easter Island from
                    the same station. If we throw <hi rend="italic">distance</hi> out of view,
                    therefore, the chances of a boat drifted with any wind between north-west and
                    south-west reaching the coast of Peru or Chili, would be ten times as great as
                    of its reaching Easter Island. But from this latter well peopled island the
                    accessible coast of Peru subtends an angle of 60°, and the chances are so much
                    higher in proportion. Easter Island is about 2800, and Gambier’s Island 3600
                    miles from the American coast; and the question is, whether, of many hundred
                    canoes drifted off in this direction in the lapse of ages, it is improbable that
                    one or two carrying persons of both sexes might reach America. We may allow an
                    unrigged boat to make 100 miles a day with a strong wind. From 28 to 36 days,
                    then, would suffice for the voyage; and though savages often go to sea with
                    little provisions, we must remember that they have a horrid resource in their
                    cannibal habits. There are besides, we think, well-attested cases of the South
                    Sea Islanders surviving a storm which has kept them a month at sea. Many of
                    these islanders have boats capable of carrying 20 or 30 persons; and their
                    ferocious wars are continually creating emergencies which compel crowds of males
                    and females to take suddenly to the water to save their lives.</p><p>We have referred to Easter Island merely as an example, to illustrate causes
                    which have been in operation in all parts of the maritime world. Setting aside
                    Behring’s Straits and Greenland, there are four points from which, according to
                    the principles we have explained, there is a possibility that inhabitants might
                    be transported to America. These are, first, Gambier’s Isles and Easter Island,
                    of which we have already spoken. Secondly, Southern Africa: from Congo,
                    Benguela, and the Cape, to the coast of Brazil, the distance is from 3700 to
                    4100 miles; and a boat abandoned to itself, favoured at once by the tropical
                    current, which sets north-westward, and by the trade-wind, might perform the
                    voyage in 30 or 40 days. Thirdly, the north-west coast of Africa, and the Canary
                    and Cape Verd Islands. From the latter (which were inhabited when discovered by
                    the Portuguese) the distance to Brazil is only about 2000 miles, and the motion
                    of a boat would be aided both by the trade-wind and the returning great current
                    of the North Atlantic. The voyage might occupy from 20 to 30 days. The
                    possibility of men being carried to America is shown by the stern of a vessel,
                    such as the American nations could not build, which Columbus found on one of the
                    Caribbean Islands on his second voyage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Washington Irving’s abridged <hi rend="italic">Life of

                    procure a sight of the work; but we find, from the introduction to the section
                    on the American languages in the <hi rend="italic">Mithridates,</hi> that he
                    speaks in decided terms of the possibility, or rather the probability, of the
                    western coasts of Europe and Africa contributing, as well as the east coast of
                    Asia, to people the new continent.</p></note> It is true that both Madeira and
                    the Azores, though nearer the old world, were uninhabited when discovered in the
                    15th century; but we must remember that these isles are but specks in the wide
                    ocean, compared with America; and, further, that the mariners accidentally cast
                    upon them might have no females with them, and would find none there. The Azores
                    had been the residence of some luckless shipwrecked Europeans, as the figures
                    found carved on the rocks proved. The fourth channel through which inhabitants
                    might reach America is the Sandwich Islands. The distance is 3000 miles; and
                    when the sun is at the southern tropic, it is probable that the western winds
                    may blow for a time in their vicinity.</p><p>In a comprehensive view of all the causes which, in the lapse of ages, have
                    contributed to spread the human race over the new world, the conjectures we have
                    hazarded are not without value. There are, for instance, two parts of the new
                    continent in which nations almost black are found, namely, California and
                    Paraguay. In the latter <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038051" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8051-0634"/>the Charmas, Minuanes, Bohanes, and Yaros, are of

                    and seated amidst tribes of a much lighter hue. Is it unreasonable to suppose,
                    that a few persons belonging to a South African tribe had been cast ashore at an
                    early period on the north banks of the Plata, the district to which the natural
                    motion of the winds and waves would most readily waft them, and had grown up
                    into a tribe before they mixed with any other race? The Californians may be
                    descended from the Papuas or black race inhabiting New Guinea, and who are
                    supposed to constitute the swarthy people of the Sandwich Isles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>
                    p. 424.</p></note> At any rate it is remarkable that the only race of a very
                    dark complexion in North America should be found exactly at the part of the
                    coast nearest to these isles, and to which the agency of the extra-tropical wind
                    would conduct any object left to its guidance. We admit, however, that they
                    might come from the Kurile Isles, where the same black race is found. By the
                    mixture of persons belonging to tribes of this hue with others of the copper
                    colour, the varieties of complexion found among the American nations may be
                    accounted for. It affords a slight corroboration of this idea, that among the
                    scanty affinities traced between the languages of the old and new world, there
                    are some few which connect certain American dialects with that of Congo. The
                    superior intelligence, great stature, light complexion, and personal beauty of
                    some of the Chilian tribes, on the other hand, favour the supposition that they
                    are of the same race with the tall, fair, handsome people of the Society and
                    Marquesas Isles, who have displayed so great an aptitude for civilisation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>

                    birth also had been carried to America by the accidents of maritime life, is
                    rendered probable by physical causes; and it is singular that traditions,
                    describing the arrival of a white or bearded man from an unknown country, and
                    his teaching them to build houses and cultivate the ground, are preserved in
                    three other parts of America besides Peru. ∙ Such is the Quetzalcoatl of the

                    of the old world have not succeeded. We except the Esquimaux, who are distinct
                    from all the other nations of the new continent, and clearly of the same race
                    with the Tchutkis of north-eastern Asia. Many analogies, however, in the
                    physical character of the people, their rites, monuments, and superstitions,
                    establish a connection between the Mexicans and some Asiatic nations. A general
                    resemblance has been observed between the American nations and some tribes of
                    Mongols and Mantchous, in the form of the scull, the brown colour of the skin,
                    the thinness of the beard, and the oblique position of the eye. Humboldt has
                    shown that the Mexican calendar is identical in its principles, which are very
                    artificial and complicated, with that which was in use among the Chinese,
                    Japanese, Thibetians, Hindoos, and Tartars; and he has rendered it probable that
                    the names of their days are borrowed from an extinct zodiac of 27 or 28 houses
                    anciently familiar to the same nations. The cosmogony of the Mexicans has too
                    many analogies with that of the Jews to admit of the coincidence being
                    accidental. Their traditions speak of the serpent woman or the mother of mankind
                    falling from a state of innocence, of a great inundation from which a single
                    family escaped, of a pyramid raised by the pride of man, and destroyed by the
                    anger of the gods; they practised the ceremony of ablution upon children at
                    their birth; they had the rite of confession for penitents; and religious
                    societies like those of monks existed among them. Now, we know that the
                    Nestorians about the seventh century carried the rites and doctrines of
                    Christianity into China and Tartary, where they were found by Carpini,
                    Rubruquis, and Marco Polo, in the thirteenth, mixed with many strange
                    corruptions. There is little doubt that the traditions and customs alluded to
                    reached Mexicothrough this channel. Further, a species of picture-writing like
                    the Mexican was practised in China about the year 1325. Vestiges of the same art
                    are found among the Kaluschi or Yucuatl, tribes inhabiting the north-west coast
                    between the latitudes of 50⁰ and 60⁰, and whose languages bear a resemblance to
                    that of the Mexicans. Finally, the records of this people speak distinctly of
                    their ancestors migrating from a distant country in the north-west; and the
                    traditions of the Muskogees, Chickasas, Mohicans, Iroquois, and the tribes of
                    Cinaloa, point to the same region as their original seat.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Humboldt’s <hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi>

                    taken collectively, leave no doubt that more than one of the American nations
                    were somehow connected with the people of eastern Asia; but they scarcely
                    authorize the conclusion, that ’ the one were a colony directly sent off from
                    the other. The Chinese, Mongols, Tartars, and Mantchous, have cultivated the
                    cerealia, employed horses, and tamed cattle, from very remote times. It was
                    scarcely possible that such necessary arts should be entirely lost by a colony
                    sprung from any of these people; yet the Mexicans were unacquainted with wheat,
                    oats, and barley; they had no horses (which a migrating Tartar tribe might
                    probably have carried across Behring’s Straits); and they had never attempted to
                    tame the native ox of America, nor to use the milk of its female. There is
                    perhaps only one hypothesis by which these diverging facts can be reconciled.
                    Tribes belonging to the races of eastern Asia had separated from them while they
                    were still living in the state of hunters, and, crossing Behring’s Straits, had
                    spread themselves by degrees over America. Among some of these tribes, dwelling
                    probably north of Columbia River, a few emigrants from China, Japan, or Chinese
                    Tartary, at a comparatively late period, had been thrown by some of the
                    accidents to which a seafaring life is liable, and bringing with them
                    picture-writing, the art of building and weaving, a few mystical rites and
                    traditions, and the calendar which was in use in their native country, had
                    established their influence among the savages by address or force, and sown the
                    seeds of civilisation. After social life had made a few advances, the increasing
                    numbers and power of the people would enable them to send off several swarms in
                    succession to the eastward, and dispossess the earlier and rudcr inhabitants of
                    Anahuac and the plains of the Mississippi. The Toltecks were perhaps the first
                    of these colonists; the Hurons, Iroquois, Chichi-mecks, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038064" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8064-0635"/>and Aztecks
                    (all of whom had hieroglyphics), must have been separated from the parent stock
                    at a later period, probably two or three centuries after the Nestorians had
                    spread some knowledge of the Christian rites and the Hebrew cosmogony among the
                    people of eastern Asia. To all appearance there was no race in America anterior
                    to the Toltecks who possessed any germs of civilisation; for the military works
                    in Ohio can scarcely be referred to a period farther back than 800 or 1000 years
                    from the present day. But for 2000 or 3000 years anterior to this the new
                    continent had been overrun by tribes of hunters. This, we think, is clear; for
                    while the analogies of physical character observed in the American nations, and
                    in the structure of their dialects, show, on the one hand, that nine tenths of
                    them had sprung from one tribe, or a few tribes of one stock; the existence of
                    500 of these varieties of speech proves, on the other hand, that a very long
                    period must have elapsed to admit of the subdivision of one, two, or even
                    half-a-dozen of mother tongues into such a prodigious number of dialects. That
                    the original seat of Tolteck and Azteck civilisation was not in Asia, but in the
                    north-west parts of America, results, we think, from the non-existence of the
                    cerealia and of tame cattle in the new world; and that the glimmering of
                    knowledge which these people possessed had been kindled by the arrival of a few
                    chance emigrants, perhaps at different periods, from China, Japan, or Chinese
                    Tartary, seems equally certain, from the resemblances formerly noticed in the
                    calendars, the superstitions, and the cosmogonical traditions of the Asiatic and
                    American races.</p><p>The discovery of a continent so large that it may be said to have doubled the
                    habitable world, is an event so much the more grand and interesting, that
                    nothing parallel to it can ever occur again in the history of mankind. America
                    had of course been known to the barbarous tribes of eastern Asia for thousands
                    of years; but it is singular that it should have been visited by one of the most
                    enterprising nations of Europe five centuries before the time of Columbus,
                    without awakening the attention of either statesmen or philosophers. Iceland was
                    discovered about 860, and colonized by the Norwegians in 874. About 50, or,
                    according to other accounts, 100 years later, the same people planted colonies
                    in Greenland. Into the disputes respecting the situation of these colonies we
                    have not room to enter. Sir Charles Gieseke, a good authority, states that their
                    ruins exist near the southern point of the peninsula. It is obvious that the
                    same adventurous spirit which enabled these northern mariners to discover the
                    southern extremity of the country, would not permit them to stop short without
                    visiting what is now known to be the most habitable part of it—the western
                    coast; and the fact has been established by an inscription in <hi rend="italic">Punic</hi> characters, found on a stone four miles beyond Uperna-vik, at the
                    73d parallel, intimating that “Erling, the son of Sigvat, and Enride Oddsoen,
                    had cleared that place and raised a hillock on the Friday after Rogation day.”
                    The marking of the date is indistinct, but it is supposed by Professor Rask, the
                    translator, to be either 1135 or 1170; and the Runic characters show at any rate
                    that it was anterior to the Reformation, when this mode of writing was
                    prohibited.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ferussac,

                    the fact that the Norwegians must have been ascending through Davis’ Straits as
                    high as the latitude mentioned, annually, perhaps for two or three centuries,
                    will admit that, with half the spirit of enterprise which had carried them so
                    far, the discovery of some portion of the west coast of these straits was almost
                    unavoidable. Now, the position and direction of this coast once known, it
                    required no great effort to trace it southward to Labrador and Newfoundland. We
                    mention these particulars, because Mr Murray, one of the few who now deny the
                    discovery of America by the Norwegians, grounds his disbelief chiefly on the
                    hypothesis that the colonies and the navigation of this people at the period
                    alluded to were confined to the east coast of Greenland.</p><p>In 1001 an Icelander sailing to Greenland, was driven away by a tempest far to
                    the south-west, where he saw a level country covered with wood. The wind
                    abating, he turned his course homeward, and on his arrival, gave such a
                    flattering account of the country he had seen, as induced Lief, the son of the
                    founder of the Greenland colony, to undertake a voyage thither. Lief and Biorn,
                    who sailed together, first reached a rocky island, to which they gave the name
                    of Helleland; then a low country, thickly wooded, which they called Mark-land;
                    and some days afterwards they found trees loaded with fruits on the banks of a
                    river. They spent the winter in the country; and one of them, who was a German,
                    having found wild vines growing, they called it Vinland. They had some
                    intercourse, and traded for furs, with a people who came in leathern boats, and
                    were called <hi rend="italic">Skr</hi><hi rend="italic">aeli</hi><hi rend="italic">ngs,</hi> from their dwarfish size. A colony was planted and
                    remained for many years in the country, the situation of which is indicated by a
                    fact casually mentioned, that the sun remained eight hours above the horizon at
                    the shortest day. It should of course have been under the 49th parallel; and
                    this is the actual latitude of Newfoundland, the country which every collateral
                    circumstance would lead us to fix upon as the seat of the colony. The Skraelings
                    were of course the Esquimaux. Vines most probably grow in Newfoundland, since
                    they are found on St John’s River, under the same latitude, on the neighbouring
                    continent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Haliburton’s

                    settlement are preserved; but it was probably abandoned or destroyed, like the
                    Greenland colonies, of which it was an offset. The account, though meagre, is
                    distinct and consistent. Its authenticity can scarcely be disputed; and it is
                    almost equally obvious that the country it refers to under the name of Vinland
                    is Newfoundland. A conclusion resting on such strong grounds scarcely requires
                    to be supported by the high authority of Humboldt and Malte-Brun. That the
                    colony disappeared, and that the discoveries made were not prosecuted farther,
                    are not circumstances which will shake the credit of the narrative in the minds
                    of those who know the numerous reverses which befell the early colonies in New
                    England and other parts of America. The extreme rigour of the winter, the
                    perpetual fogs which obscure the sky, and the sterile aspect of the land, might
                    mislead these ignorant Norsemen, and the people to whom their proceedings were
                    reported, to confound the island and adjacent parts of the continent with those
                    inhospitable polar regions which defy the industry of the cultivator. Helleland,
                    Markland, and Vinland, were no doubt regarded as countries either connected with
                    or similar to Greenland, the flattering descriptions of which, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038077" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8077-0636"/>given by the
                    first discoverers, were sadly belied by later experience.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Μ. Rafn, a Dane, who has been engaged in
                    researches respecting these early voyages, announces that he has ascertained,
                    from original documents, various facts previously unknown; among others, that
                    America (first discovered in 985) was repeatedly visited by the Norwegians in
                    the llth, 12th, and 13th centuries; that the embouchure of the St Lawrence, and
                    in particular the bay of Gaspe, was their principal station; that they had
                    penetrated along the coast as far south as Carolina; and that they introduced a
                    knowledge of Christianity among the natives. The announcement is contained in a
                    letter addressed to a person in Washington, and published in Nile’s <hi rend="italic">Register</hi> (Baltimore), in November 1828. Μ. Rafn is preparing
                    a work on the subject.</p></note> The interest excited by the obscure accounts
                    of these countries was probably such as the announcement of a new island
                    eastward of Spitzbergen would produce at the present day. No reasonable doubt
                    can exist, however, that the north-eastern portions of America (considering
                    Greenland as a distinct country) were familiarly known to the Norwegians in the
                    11th century.</p><p>The obscure allusions of Aristotle, Plato, and Seneca, to a country hid in the
                    Western Ocean, must have derived fresh importance from the discovery of the
                    Canary Isles, Madeira, and the Azores, in the early part of the 15th century.
                    The love of maritime adventure was excited by these events; and among the active
                    spirits who were attracted to nautical life by the career of distinction which
                    was then opened up, was Christopher Columbus. Our limits do not permit us to
                    enter into details respecting this great man, an outline of whose life will be
                    found under the proper head. Having received a learned education, the study of
                    the geographical systems then in vogue impressed him with a strong conviction
                    that a voyage to India, by a course directly westward, was quite practicable,
                    with the degree of nautical science which his contemporaries possessed. From the
                    old and imperfect maps of Ptolemy, he was led to believe that the parts of the
                    globe known to the ancients embraced 15 hours, or 225 degrees, of longitude,
                    which exceeds the truth by more than one third. The discovery of the Azores on
                    the west side had lengthened the space by one hour; and the accounts gleaned by
                    Marco Polo in Asia, induced him to think that the isles connected with this
                    continent stretched out so far to the eastward that their distance from Europe
                    could not be great. Columbus was, however, without the fortune necessary to fit
                    out ships; and when he attempted to interest some of the princes of those times
                    in his project, he encountered neglects and difficulties which would have
                    exhausted the patience of any mind less ardent than his own. At length, after
                    many delays and discouragements, Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain supplied him
                    with three small vessels, two of them only half-decked; and in this little
                    armament, accompanied by 120 men, he set sail from the port of Palos on the 3d
                    of August 1492. He proceeded first to the Canary Isles, where he was detained
                    three weeks in repairing one of his vessels. On leaving these isles he entered
                    on an unknown sea, where all was chaos and mystery. The trade-wind, however,
                    bore him steadily along, and the labour of the ships proceeded cheerfully, till
                    the increasing length of the voyage, the failure of prognostics which had from
                    time to time kept alive the hopes of the crew, and various circumstances
                    interpreted by their superstition as evil omens, produced a mutinous spirit,
                    which all the address and authority of Columbus would not have been able to
                    quell, had the discovery of land happened one day later than it did. It was on
                    the 8th of October that the western world revealed itself to the wondering eyes
                    of Columbus and his companions. What a triumph for this extraordinary man, who
                    had treasured in his breast for twenty years, amidst neglect, discouragement,
                    and ridicule, the grand truth, which his own incomparable skill, wisdom, and
                    firmness, had now demonstrated in the eyes of an incredulous world! The spot
                    which he first touched was San Salvador, one of the Bahama Islands, 3650 English
                    miles from Teneriffe. After spending nearly three months in visiting Cuba,
                    Hispaniola, and other isles, he returned to Spain. He made three other voyages,
                    and in the second coasted along a part of South America, which he rightly judged
                    to be a continent, from the volume of water poured into the sea by the Orinoco;
                    but he died ignorant of the real extent and grandeur of his discoveries, still
                    believing that the countries he had made known to Europe belonged to that part
                    of Eastern Asia which the ancients called India. Hence the name of West Indies,
                    which the tropical islands and part of the continent have ever since received.
                    This distinguished man, who had opened up sources of countless wealth to his
                    sovereign, languished out the last two years of his life in neglect and poverty,
                    and died in 1506, leaving scarcely aught behind him but a name, which will
                    survive that of a thousand heroes and conquerors, and will ever be equally dear
                    to the lovers of virtue and honour, and to the admirers of genius.</p><p>We should extend this article to an unreasonable length were we to describe in
                    detail the discoveries and settlements made by the several nations of Europe in
                    America. We shall, therefore, confine ourselves to a very brief chronological
                    notice of the more important events.</p><p>1495. The first place in which the Spaniards established their power was the
                    large island of Hayti, or Hispaniola, which was inhabited by a numerous race of
                    Indians, of a mild and gentle character, a third part of whom are said to have
                    perished within two or three years after the Spaniards conquered them.</p><p>1497. John Cabot, in the service of Henry VII. of England, discovered
                    Newfoundland, and coasted along the shores of North America to Florida.</p><p>1500. Cabral, a Portuguese, visited the coast of Brazil, and discovered the mouth
                    of the Amazon. It was probably colonized before 1515, as the first cargo of wood
                    was sent from it to Portugal in that year.</p><p>1508. Vincent Pinzon is said to have entered the Rio de la Plata. It was in the
                    same year that the Spaniards, finding the aborigines too weak for the labour of
                    the mines in Hayti, first imported negroes from Guinea, and thus laid the
                    foundation of a traffic which continues to this day to disgrace the civilisation
                    of Europe.</p><p>1511. Diego Columbus conquered the island of Cuba with 300 soldiers, of whom he
                    did not lose one.</p><p>1513. Balboa crossed the isthmus of Darien with 290 men, and discovered the South
                    Sea.</p><p>1519. Hernando Cortes sailed from Cuba with 11 ships and 550 men, and landed on
                    the coast of Mexico which had been discovered in the previous year. The conquest
                    of the empire was finished in 1521 by 950 Spaniards, assisted by a vast number
                    of the Indians of Elascala.</p><p>1531. Peru invaded by Pizarro, and conquered in little more than one year, with a
                    force of 1000 men.</p><p>1534. James Cartier, a Frenchman, discovers the Gulf of St Lawrence.</p><p>1535. Mendoza, a Spaniard, with 2000 followers, founds Buenos Ayres, and conquers
                    all the country as far as <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038090" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8090-0637"/>Potosi, at which silver mines were discovered nine
                    years after.</p><p>1537. Cortes discovers California.</p><p>1541. Chili conquered; Santiago founded; Orellana sails down the Amazon to the
                    Atlantic from the sources of the Rio Napo.</p><p>1578. New Albion on the north-west coast of America discovered by Sir Francis
                    Drake.</p><p>1586. The Spaniards found St Thomas’s Island, in Guiana.</p><p>1587. Davis’ Straits and Cumberland Islands discovered by John Davis.</p><p>1604. De Monts, a Frenchman, founded the first settlement in Nova Scotia, then
                    called Acadie.</p><p>1607. After many ineffectual attempts during more than twenty years, the first
                    permanent settlement of the English in North America was made this year, on the
                    banks of James’ River, in Virginia.</p><p>1608. Quebec founded by the French, who had had a small neglected colony in
                    Canada since 1542.</p><p>1611. Newfoundland colonized by the English; a Dutch colony established at
                    Hudson’s River. New York was founded in 1614.</p><p>1618. Baffins penetrates to the 78th degree of latitude, in the bay which bears
                    his name.</p><p>1620. The first English colony established in New England at Plymouth. It was in
                    this year that the first negroes were imported into Virginia. They were brought
                    by a Dutch vessel.</p><p>1635. A French colony established in Guiana.</p><p>1655. Jamaica conquered by the English.</p><p>1664. The Dutch colonies on Hudson’s River capitulate to the English.</p><p>1666. The Buccaneers begin their depredations on the Spanish colonies.</p><p>1682. William Penn establishes a colony in Pennsylvania. La Salle takes
                    possession of Louisiana, in the name of the French king.</p><p>1698. A colony of 1200 Scots planted at Darien, and ruined in the following year,
                    in consequence of the miserable jealousy of the English.</p><p>1733. Georgia colonized by the English.</p><p>1760. Canada, and all the other French settlements in North America, conquered by
                    the English.</p><p>We must pause at this point to give a very short account of the colonial system
                    introduced by the principal European nations who occupied extensive tracts of
                    the new world. The English settlements extended from the 31st to the 50th degree
                    on the east coast, and were divided into 15 or 16 provinces. The colonists had
                    carried the love of liberty characteristic of their countrymen with them; and
                    after many struggles with their British rulers, all the provinces, with one or
                    two exceptions, were permitted to enjoy a form of government extremely popular.
                    The executive power was vested in a governor appointed by the king. He was
                    assisted by a council, which sometimes conjoined the functions of a privy
                    council and a house of peers. The people were represented by a house of
                    assembly, consisting of persons chosen by the freeholders in the country parts,
                    and the householders or corporations of towns. The governor could levy no money
                    without the consent of the house of assembly: the British parliament, however,
                    claimed, but scarcely ever exercised, the privilege of imposing taxes upon the
                    colonists, without consulting them. Against this assumption of power the local
                    legislatures always protested as an infringement of their rights. The vessels of
                    foreign states were not permitted to trade with the colonies; but the colonists
                    were allowed to trade in their own ships with one another, with the mother
                    country, and, to a limited extent, with foreign states. Their taxes, which were
                    always small, were all consumed in defraying internal expenses; and, compared
                    with any other people in the new world, they enjoyed an unexampled degree of
                    commercial and political liberty. It was the growing prosperity of the colonies,
                    and the increasing debt of the mother country, which induced the British
                    ministers, for the first time, in 1764, to attempt raising a revenue in America,
                    for purposes not colonial. The experiment was made by imposing a stamp-duty on
                    newspapers and commercial writings. The sum was trifling; but the Americans,
                    long-sighted and jealous of their rights, saw in it the introduction of a
                    principle which deprived them of all security for their property. The people
                    declared themselves against it as one man, in local assemblies, and by petitions
                    and publications of all kinds. The ministers became uneasy, and repealed the
                    tax; but, as a salvo to the pride of the mother country, a declaratory act was
                    passed, asserting her right “to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever.” The
                    idea of raising a revenue in America was not renounced, but another mode was to
                    be tried. Duties were laid on glass, colours, paper, and tea, and were met by an
                    opposition in the colonies still more zealous and determined. The British
                    ministers, irritated, but wavering in their purpose, dropped all the taxes but
                    that on tea, and commenced at the same time a series of alarming innovations.
                    They closed the port of Boston, changed the charter of the province, placed
                    judges and juries on a footing to render them more subservient to the views of
                    the government, and introduced a strong military force to overawe the people. On
                    the other side, the colonists passed resolutions not to import or consume any
                    British goods, and hastened to supply themselves with powder and arms. Blood was
                    at length drawn in April 1775, at the village of Lexington; and in the following
                    year the American congress published their celebrated declaration of
                    independence. We shall not enter into the details of the war, which was closed
                    in 1782. Suffice it to say, that, on the part of the Americans, it rested on
                    high grounds; it was a war to vindicate a principle—for the practical grievance
                    was admitted to be slight; and it was conducted with a regard to humanity, of
                    which there are few examples in history.</p><p>The Spanish possessions in America, before the revolution, formed nine distinct
                    governments, all constructed on the same plan, and independent of one another.
                    Four of these, of the first rank, were vice-royalties, viz. Mexico Peru, La
                    Plata, and New Granada; and five were captain-generalships, viz. Yucatan,
                    Guatemala, Chili, Venezuela, and the island of Cuba. The government was vested
                    in the viceroy or captain-general, who was held to represent the king, and to
                    enjoy all his prerogatives within the colony. But in these countries, as in
                    others where the supreme power is apparently unlimited, it was indirectly
                    restrained by the influence of the courts of justice, corporations, and other
                    public bodies. The royal audiencias or supreme courts, consisting of Spaniards
                    nominated by the crown, had extensive judicial powers, and were independent of
                    the viceroys. The cabildos or municipalities, and the fueros or corporations
                    (similar to our guilds), also possessed considerable privileges, which derived
                    security and importance from long prescription. Lastly, the clergy, who were
                    numerous and rich, necessarily possessed great influence among a superstitious
                    people. The vices inherent in the colonial system existed in their utmost
                    rankness in the Spanish American dominions. There was tolerable security for all
                    classes except the miserable Indians, who were regarded and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038103" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8103-0638"/>treated
                    precisely as beasts of burden, out of whose toil and sufferings a provision as
                    ample as possible was to be extracted, first to supply the wants of the royal
                    treasury, and next to feed in idleness, and to satisfy the cupidity of a
                    countless shoal of public officers and priests. Edicts were indeed issued for
                    the protection of the Indians, and persons appointed to enforce them; but these
                    were feeble correctives to the evils rooted in the system, and not unfrequently
                    increased their weight. The Indians, after the conquest, were at first slaves;
                    they paid a capitation tax to the crown, and their labour was entirely at the
                    disposal of their lord. This system was modified from time to time; but all the
                    changes introduced down to the revolution did not release them from their state
                    of vassalage. They still continued subject, in a less or greater degree, to the
                    performance of compulsory labour, under the orders of persons over whom they had
                    no control. This was an enormous grievance; but, what was equally bad, being
                    held incompetent in law to buy or sell, or enter into any pecuniary engagement
                    beyond the value of a few shillings, without the agency of white men, the swarm
                    of public functionaries had an unlimited power of interfering in their concerns,
                    of vexing, harassing, and plundering them, under the forms of law. The memoir of
                    Ulloa, long buried amidst the Spanish archives, with various other documents
                    published since the revolution, depicts acts of extortion, perfidy, cruelty, and
                    oppression practised upon the Indians which have rarely been paralleled. Men
                    rose to affluence in offices without salaries; and the priests rivalled the
                    laymen in the art of extracting money from those whom they ought to have
                    protected. As the sole aim of the Spaniards in the colonies was to enrich
                    themselves, so the government at home made all its acts and regulations
                    subordinate to the grand object of raising a revenue. Spain retained in her
                    hands the whole trade of the colonies, and guarded her monopoly with the most
                    severe penalties. The price of all European commodities was enhanced three,
                    four, or six fold, in America. The colonists were not allowed to manufacture or
                    raise any article which the mother country could supply; they were compelled to
                    root up their vines and olives; and for a long period one colony was not even
                    permitted to send a ship to another. To support such a system it was necessary
                    to keep the people in profound ignorance, and to cherish prejudices and
                    superstition. The schools were extremely few, and permission to establish them
                    was often refused, even in towns where the Spaniards and Creoles were numerous.
                    The importation of books, except books of Catholic devotion, was rigorously
                    prohibited. Even the more grave and dry sciences, such as botany, chemistry, and
                    geometry, were objects of suspicion. And the more effectually to crush all
                    mental activity, natives of America could rarely obtain leave to go abroad, to
                    seek in foreign countries what was denied them in their own. On the other hand
                    the priests, sharing in the spoil, filled the minds of the people with childish
                    superstitions, as a means of confirming their own power; and employed the
                    terrors of religion to teach them patience under oppression. To create a race of
                    servants devoted to its purposes, the court bestowed all offices, from the
                    highest to the lowest, on natives of the peninsula exclusively. The wisdom of
                    the plan seems questionable; but that it was adhered to with wonderful
                    pertinacity is certain. “It was the darling policy of Spain,” says Mr Ward, “to
                    disseminate through her American dominions a class of men distinct from the
                    people in feelings, habits, and interests, taught to consider themselves as a
                    privileged <hi rend="italic">caste,</hi> and to regard their own existence as
                    intimately connected with that of the system of which they were the principal
                    support.” With all those means and appliances, it is extraordinary that Spain
                    should have been able to uphold, for three centuries, a system in which the
                    interests of so many millions of human beings were so habitually and
                    unrelentingly sacrificed. It was the course of events, much more than its own
                    inherent weakness, which ultimately caused its subversion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mexico</hi> by H. G. Ward,

                    throne of Spain, orders were dispatched to all the colonies with the view of
                    securing their obedience to the new dynasty. The men in office were generally
                    disposed to submit, but the treacherous conduct of the French excited a
                    universal hatred of their cause among the people; and when the regency
                    established in Spain presented the semblance of a patriot government, the
                    loyalty of the Americans blazed forth, and poured large contributions of money
                    into the hands of Ferdinand’s adherents. The weak and suspicious conduct of the
                    regency, however, and its subserviency to the grasping spirit of the merchants
                    of Cadiz, at length alienated the colonists, and roused them to take measures
                    for their own security. But the diversity of views and interests among the
                    colonists rendered the course to be adopted a matter of some delicacy.
                    Ferdinand, being a prisoner, was, politically speaking, a nonentity. Napoleon’s
                    brother was clearly an usurper, odious to, and rejected by, the mass of the
                    Spanish people. The regency, shut up in Cadiz, without troops or revenue, was
                    but a phantom; and the little power it had was so employed as to raise doubts
                    whether its members were not secretly in league with the enemy. In these
                    circumstances, when the only government to which the colonists owed allegiance
                    had fallen into abeyance, the wisest course they could have pursued was to
                    declare themselves independent. ∙ This would at once put a stop to the
                    machinations of France, which they dreaded, and prevent the regency from
                    compromising or sacrificing their interests by its weakness or treachery. The
                    Spaniards, however, who occupied all public situations, were averse to a change
                    which they foresaw must lead to the downfall of their power. This was perfectly
                    understood by the other classes; and in the first movements which took place in
                    the different colonies, nothing was said derogatory to the supremacy of Spain,
                    though independence was clearly aimed at. By spontaneous efforts of the people
                    “juntas of government” were formed, at Caraccas in April 1809, at La Paz in
                    Upper Peru in July, at Quito in August, at Santa Fe and at Buenos Ayres in May
                    1810, and at Santiago in Chili in September the same year. In 1810, also, the
                    first insurrection broke out in Mexico The colonists unluckily had been too long
                    the slaves of superstition and tyranny to be fit for conducting so bold an
                    experiment; and after a struggle, which was generally short, but almost
                    everywhere bloody, the juntas were all put down except in Colombia and Buenos
                    Ayres. But in the stir and tumult of the contest, old prejudices had received a
                    shock, and the seeds of political change had struck their roots too deep in the
                    soil to be eradicated. A desultory war was carried on for six years between
                    Buenos Ayres and Upper Peru, with little advantage on either side. At length, in
                    1817, the former state, which had assumed the style of an independent republic
                    four years before, sent an army across the Andes to Chili, under General San
                    Martin, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038116" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8116-0639"/>defeated the Spaniards at Chacabuco. A second
                    victory, gained at Maipo in April 1818, led to the entire subversion of the
                    Spanish power in this colony. The war was now transferred to Peru, where the
                    Spaniards continued to lose ground, till the decisive battle of Ayacucho put an
                    end to their power in December 1824. Rodil and Olaveta, with the obstinacy of
                    their nation, held out for some months longer, when every chance of success was
                    gone; but after the surrender of Callao in January 1826, the Spanish flag no
                    longer waved on any spot in the land of the Incas.</p><p>In New Granada and Venezuela the struggle was more bloody, variable, and
                    protracted than in any other part of South America. As this portion of the
                    dominions of Spain was comparatively easy of access, and from its central
                    position was in some measure the key to the whole, she made immense efforts for
                    its preservation. No less than ten thousand troops were sent out to it within
                    the course of one year. The patriots, on the other hand, possessed advantages
                    here, in the greater intelligence of the population, and the easy intercourse
                    with the West Indies. From 1809, when juntas were established in Caraccas and
                    Quito, to the surrender of Porto Cabello in 1823, the vicissitudes of the war
                    were numerous and extraordinary. The patriots were repeatedly on the eve of a
                    complete triumph, and as often the state of their affairs seemed nearly
                    hopeless. But the spirit of resistance never was entirely subdued. The cause was
                    rooted in the hearts of the people, and was insensibly gaining ground even
                    during its reverses. To attempt the faintest outline of the military operations
                    would lead us beyond our proper limits. It is enough to state, that the decisive
                    victory of Carabobo, gained by the patriots in 1819, gave them an ascendency
                    which they never afterwards lost; but the Spaniards, according to their custom,
                    continued to maintain the contest as long as they had a foot of land in the
                    country, and were only finally expelled in 1823.</p><p>In Mexicothe revolutionary movement began at Dolores in 1810, and soon wore a
                    very prosperous appearance; but the weakness or false pride of the Creoles, who
                    were cajoled into the ranks of their oppressors the old Spaniards, armed against
                    the patriots those who should have been their firmest supporters; and by one or
                    two mischances, the force of the independent party was ruined in November 1815,
                    when Morelos, their able leader, was taken prisoner and executed. For six years
                    after this period many guerilla bands maintained themselves in the provinces,
                    and greatly annoyed the Spaniards; but they did not act in concert, and no
                    congress or junta professing to represent the Mexican people existed. Even
                    during this interval the desire for independence was making great progress among
                    the population; but the establishment of a constitutional government in Spain in
                    1820, and its extension to the colonies, gave a new aspect to the affairs of
                    Mexico The viceroy Apodaca, while outwardly yielding obedience to the new
                    system, was silently taking measures to effect its overthrow; but mistaking the
                    character of the agent he employed, this person, the celebrated Iturbide, turned
                    his own arms against him, proclaimed a constitution, under the name of “the
                    three guarantees,” and put an end to the dominion of Spain in 1821, almost
                    without bloodshed. Iturbide, who had nothing in view but his own aggrandizement,
                    called a congress, which he soon dissolved, after getting himself proclaimed
                    emperor. His usurpation kindled a spirit of resistance. He was exiled in 1823,
                    made .a new attempt on the liberties of his country in 1824, was taken prisoner,
                    and expiated his crimes by a military death within a few weeks after he
                    landed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ward’s <hi rend="italic">Mexico</hi>.vol..i. ,p. 93-210.</p></note></p><p>Guatemala was the last portion of the American continent which threw off the
                    Spanish yoke. In 1821 the persons in office assembled and formed a junta.
                    Divisions arose, which were fomented by the intrusion of a Mexican army sent by
                    Iturbide. This force, however, was beaten, and an elective assembly called,
                    which declared the country independent, and established a constitution in July
                    1823. Spain now retains none of her possessions in the new world but Cuba and
                    Porto Rico</p><p>It is impossible for any one to read the narrative of the wars produced by these
                    revolutions, without having a conviction forced upon him, that the Spaniards
                    rank far below all the Christian nations of Europe, not excepting the Russians,
                    in those moral qualities which are the surest tests of civilisation, a respect
                    for human life, and a strict regard to engagements, whether binding on the
                    honour or the conscience. The executions in cold blood, the countless massacres,
                    the treachery, perfidy, and contempt of the most solemn oaths and engagements,
                    of which they were guilty, in every colony, and almost in every district, are,
                    we believe, without a parallel in the modern civilized world, and strongly
                    remind one of the barbarous and exterminating hostilities of the Jenghis Khans
                    and Tamerlanes of Asia. The Indians were destroyed by thousands on the slightest
                    provocation; and even the officers of European birth who fell into the hands of
                    the Spaniards, were either shot or brutally treated, long after the period when
                    any pretext existed for disregarding the rules of civilized war. More blood, we
                    are satisfied, was shed by Morillo alone in one year, in the single state of
                    Venezuela, than in the thirteen North American states during the seven years of
                    their revolutionary struggle. The patriots, bred in the same school, were too
                    often equally culpable. General Miller estimates the number of human beings
                    destroyed by the sword in Spanish America between 1810 and 1825 at one million!
                    This is probably an exaggeration; but it merits attention, as showing the
                    opinion formed by an observer, who, though a partisan, is both candid and well
                    informed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Memoirs of General Miller,</hi> 2 vols. 1828. <hi rend="italic">Geographical, Statistical, Agricultural, &amp;c. Account of Colombia,</hi> 2

                    similar to that of the Spanish colonies. The monopoly which the mother country
                    retained of the commerce of the colony was equally rigorous; the restrictions on
                    its internal industry as severe; and the same means were employed to keep the
                    people in a state of pupilage and ignorance. Down to 1806 a single printing
                    press had never existed in Brazil. In 1807, when the emperor Napoleon had
                    resolved to possess himself of Portugal, and if possible to get the royal family
                    into his power, the king, seeing no other means of escaping from the clutches of
                    his enemy, embarked with his suite in several ships, and sailed for Brazil,
                    where he arrived in January 1808. He was received with joy by the colonists, who
                    anticipated great benefits from his residence, of which they were not
                    disappointed. One by one the fetters of colonial dependence fell off. Within a
                    few months printing presses and newspapers were established, the ports were open
                    to the trade of all <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038129" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8129-0640"/>nations, and the people were invited and
                    encouraged to prosecute all those branches of internal industry from which they
                    had till now been interdicted. To crown and secure these advantages, Brazil was
                    declared an independent kingdom in 1815, subject to the crown of Portugal, but
                    entitled to its separate administration and its own laws. The revolutionary
                    spirit pervading the Spanish colonies now found its way into Brazil, and
                    produced an insurrection at Pernambuco in 1817. It was soon subdued, but
                    received a new impulse from the constitutional systems suddenly introduced into
                    Spain and Portugal in 1820. To quiet the popular feeling, it was announced that
                    the Portuguese constitution would be extended to Brazil. Before this had been
                    done, however, the old king had sailed for Europe, leaving his son Don Pedro to
                    rule in his absence. The people now discovered, or believed, that the object of
                    the king was to degrade Brazil again to the rank of a colony, and to restore the
                    old system in all its rigour. Meetings were held and resolutions adopted, to
                    maintain the independence of the country at all hazards; and the patriots,
                    gaining confidence by degrees, called loudly for the establishment of a
                    legislature, and besought Don Pedro to put himself at the head of the
                    independent government. Ambition or policy induced Pedro to listen to the
                    solicitation: in 1822 he was proclaimed emperor, and had his own title and the
                    independence of Brazil acknowledged by his father three years afterwards. A
                    representative system was at the same time introduced. An unlucky war now arose
                    with Buenos Ayres, which weakened both countries; but it was at ength terminated
                    in 1828, by the recognition of the disputed territory as an independent state,
                    under the title of the Banda Oriental.</p><p>Having finished this brief notice of the series of revo- .utions which broke the
                    fetters of America, we shall now give a very short sketch of the new political
                    order of things which has arisen out of these changes, referring for a detailed
                    account of the several states to the articles appropriated to them in the
                    different volumes of the present ,vork.</p><p>America, with its isles, embraces at present (1830) twelve independent states,
                    and various colonies belonging to six European powers. The states are, 1.
                    Brazil; 2. Co-ombia; 3. Peru; 4. Bolivia or Upper Peru; 5. La Plata; 3. Chili;
                    7. Paraguay; 8. Banda Oriental; 9. Guatema-a; 10. Mexico 11. the United States;
                    12. Hayti. The colonies belong to Russia, Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands,
                    France, and Spain.</p><p>Brazil is the largest state in the new world, and enjoys the greatest combination
                    of natural advantages. It is bounded on the south, west, and north, by La Plata,
                    Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Guiana. Embracing in area of 3,050,000
                    English miles, it is nearly as large as Europe, and is capable of supporting a
                    much greater population. Its climate is probably cooler and more salubrious than
                    that of any other extensive tropical country; and every part of its soil is rich
                    and fruitful, as its magnificent forests and the exuberance and boundless
                    variety of its vegetable productions attest. Its commercial advantages are
                    admirable. No country in the new world has the same facilities for carrying on
                    intercourse with Europe, and with all its neighbours. The Amazon, with its
                    numerous branches, the Parana, the Tocantin, the St Francisco, and other
                    streams, supply the most remote parts of the interior with easy means of
                    communication with the sea. Brazil possesses iron, copper, and probably all the
                    other metals; but her mines of gold and diamonds are remarkably rich. Her most
                    valuable productions for exportation are, cotton, sugar, coffee, hides, tobacco,
                    vanilla, dyewoods, aromatic plants, timber, &amp;c. We have seen no detailed
                    accounts of her commerce; but if her dealings with Britain be taken as an index
                    of its extent, as we think it may, it is three times as great as that of all the
                    Spanish colonies put together. According to a parliamentary paper printed in
                    1830 (No. 292), the imports into Britain from Brazil in 1829 were L.l,488,000
                    official value, and the exports to the same country no less than L.6,155,000.
                    Now the British trade with the states of Spanish America, Mexico Guatemala,
                    Colombia, La Plata, Chili, and Peru, was only— imports L. 534,000, exports
                    L.3,286,000. Of the goods to the value of six millions sent to Brazil, the whole
                    except L. 100,000 were British produce or manufactures. The cultivation of
                    cotton, sugar, mandioc, maize, and other raw produce, is the staple branch of
                    industry in Brazil; and manufactures, though no longer prohibited, cannot be
                    said yet to exist. The Brazilians are lively, irritable, hospitable, but
                    ignorant, superstitious, and rather inclined to indolence. Their recent
                    acquisition of independence, however, has worked like a charm, and produced an
                    extraordinary change in their industry, opinions, and modes of thinking.
                    Lancas-terian and other schools are spreading in all directions; the press
                    brings forth new publications; and 25 journals existed in 1828, in a country
                    where the art of printing was unknown in 1807. According to the constitution
                    introduced by Don Pedro, the legislature consists of a senate of 50 members, who
                    hold their places for life, and a house of representatives of 100 elected by the
                    people for three years; upon the acts of both of which bodies the emperor has a
                    negative. The members of the lower house are chosen by elections of two stages.
                    The householders of a parish meet and appoint one elector for every hundred of
                    their number, and the electors thus chosen meet in districts and choose the
                    deputies. The debates are conducted with open doors, and with much boldness and
                    freedom, according to Mr Walsh.

                    therefore amount to L.3,700,000. The expenditure for the same year was estimated
                    at 19,271,000,000 rees, or L.5,300,000.</p><p>The population of Brazil amounted to 3,671,558, according to returns published in
                    1818, and procured probably for the purpose of taxation. This was exclusive of

                    Judging by the trade of the country, and the consumption of British goods, we
                    should think that it must have been greater then, and may now amount to more
                    than five millions. Μ. Schoeffer, a German, carries it to 5,700,000; and Μ.

                    ill for its future repose and prosperity. That the statement is near the truth
                    we are inclined to believe. Mr Walsh thinks that two thirds of the population of

                    Maranham, Pernambuco, and other northern provinces, we know that the slaves are
                    still more numerous. It is probable, therefore, that the black and coloured
                    inhabitants of Brazil fall little short of three millions, which must be nearly
                    equal to the number of persons of African blood in all the other parts of
                    continental America. Brazil is divided into 19 provinces.</p><p>Colombia is bounded on the south by Peru, on the south-east and east by Brazil
                    and Guiana, on the other sides by the sea, and embraces an area of 1,020,000
                    square English miles. The soil is fruitful, and the climate salubrious, except
                    along the coast and in a few other low situations. The eastern part consists
                    chiefly of the llanos or steppes of the Orinoco, which are very hot; the
                    western, of the mountain ridges of the Andes, which support tracts of table-land
                    where the blessings of a temperate climate are enjoyed, and the ccrealia of
                    Europe can be successfully cultivated. The tropical vegetation extends to the
                    height of 4000 feet; from 4000 to 9000 is the region where wheat, barley, and
                    leguminous plants thrive. Above the level of 9000 feet the climate becomes
                    severe; and at 15,700 feet vegetation ceases. The situation of Colombia is
                    highly favourable for commerce. It has excellent ports on both seas; and being
                    mistress of the isthmus of Panama, it has superior facilities for establishing a
                    communication from the one to the other, and engrossing the commerce between the
                    Atlantic and Pacific. The Orinoco, the Magdalena, and the Amazon, afford its
                    inmost districts the advantages of water-carriage to the ocean. The Cassiquiari,
                    an intermediate channel, by which the Orinoco <hi rend="italic">anastomoses</hi>
                    or connects with the Amazon (a remarkable hydrographical phenomenon), is within
                    the limits of Colombia. Its greatest disadvantage, in a commercial point of
                    view, arises from the obstruction caused by the immense wall of the Andes to the
                    free communication of its eastern and western provinces.</p><p>Colombia contains much gold and silver; the former in alluvial deposits: it has
                    mines of copper and mercury also, with platinum, iron, and coal. Its tropical
                    productions are similar to those of Brazil, but it has as yet cultivated few
                    articles for foreign markets, and its exports are inconsiderable. The civilized
                    population of this country is chiefly located in the districts near the coast,
                    and in the high valleys or table-land of the Andes. Its amount, as stated in the
                    Gazette of Colombia of 30th September 1827, was,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Venezuela</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.. 659,633</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>New Granada</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.. 1,228,303</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Quito</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.. 491,996</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Free population</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>..2,379,932</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Slaves</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.. 103,892</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Independent Indians</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.. 203,835</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>-</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2,687,659</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Some fractional parts, however, must be omit</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>ted; for the actual number announced by the minister, in his report

                    It is always of importance to know in what proportions the different races are
                    blended; but on this subject we have data only for New Granada, and for Guiana,
                    which has a very small civilized population. In New Granada, containing
                    1,228,000 inhabitants, we find the different races classed thus :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Whites</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Mestizoes (from whites and Indians)</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>23</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Indians (civilized)</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>26</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Mulattoes</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>32</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Negroes, free or slaves</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p></cell></row></table><p>The anomalous proportion between the blacks and mulattoes leads us to think that

                    mulattoes 5. In Guiana (a thinly inhabited province of the department of
                    Maturin, distinct from the English, Dutch, and French Guianas), the whites are
                    only 7 per cent., and the men of colour 8, while the Indians are 84.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>
                    Novembre 1828.</p></note> Though slavery exists in Colombia, it is hastening to
                    its extinction; for, by a law passed in 1821, the children of all slaves born
                    after that year are free. The commerce of the republic is trifling at present;
                    but when her internal distractions are settled it must increase greatly. The
                    principal articles for exportation are, cocoa, coffee, cotton, indigo, sugar,
                    tobacco, and hides. We have not been able to lay our hands on any recent and
                    complete statement of the amount of imports and exports. The custom-house
                    valuation of the imports into Caraccas in the first six months of 1828, was
                    969,000 dollars; the exports 627,000. But a better criterion is afforded by the
                    official value of the goods sent from Britain to Colombia in 1829, which was
                    L.557,000: those sent from other countries may probably be equal to twice this
                    amount. Neither have we seen any recent account of the revenue, on which we can
                    depend. The government is republican: the supreme power is lodged in a senate,
                    composed of 32 members elected by the people for eight years, and a house of
                    representatives elected for four years. The number of the latter, being fixed at
                    one for each 30,000 inhabitants, should be about 80. They are chosen by the
                    indirect mode, the parochial assemblies choosing ten electors for each
                    representative, and these ten electing the member.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193038155" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8155-0642"/><p>The president is elected for four years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Colonel Hall’s <hi rend="italic">Present State of

                    we are writing this, we learn that the constitution of 1821 has been abolished,
                    and that a new one is framing. The republic of Colombia had a harder struggle
                    than any of the other Spanish colonies for its independence; and since it
                    expelled the Spaniards, it has been engaged in wars with its neighbours, and
                    sadly shaken by internal dissensions. In December 1829 the province of Caraccas
                    resolved to separate from the others, and erect itself into an independent
                    state. The government, which sits at Bogota, determined to resist this
                    dismemberment; and Bolivar, as president, has been authorized to employ force
                    against the revolters. The issue is not yet known.</p><p>La Plata is, in point of natural advantages, the third state of importance in
                    South America. It is bounded on the west by Chili and Peru; on the north by
                    Bolivia, Paraguay, and the Banda Oriental; on the east and south by the sea. It
                    embraces an area of 1,030,000 square miles, if we include in its territories
                    Tucuman, Salta, Santiago del Estero, and Jujuy, which scarcely acknowledge its
                    authority; and to this 250,000 should still be added for the Patagonian country
                    east of the Andes, which it will no doubt claim in course of time, after the
                    manner of the other civilized states in the new world. Nearly the whole
                    territory of this republic consists of open plains destitute of timber, called
                    <hi rend="italic">pampas,</hi> extending from the Atlantic and the river
                    Paraguay to the Andes. The eastern part of these plains exhibits a vigorous
                    growth of herbage, intermixed with a forest of gigantic plants 9 or 10 feet
                    high, which have been called thistles, but are now known to be artichokes: in
                    the middle they are covered with grass; and the western division, which extends
                    to the foot of the Andes, consists of barren sandy plains, thinly sprinkled with
                    shrubs and thorny trees. The openness and dryness of the country, however,
                    render it healthy; and by the Parana, the Paraguay, and their branches, it
                    possesses a great extent of natural inland navigation. It has mines of gold,
                    silver, copper, lead, and probably iron; but its mineral riches have been
                    greatly diminished by the separation of Potosi, Cochabamba, La Paz, and other
                    provinces, now forming part of Bolivia. The force of this republic lies almost
                    entirely in the wealth, intelligence, and commercial spirit of its capital,
                    Buenos Ayres, which contains 80,000 souls, and is the only city perhaps in the
                    world which has been found impregnable to the assaults of hostile armies,
                    without fortifications, or any other defences than the peculiar structure of its
                    houses and the courage of its inhabitants. The viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres
                    having few valuable mines, and depending chiefly on commerce and agriculture,
                    had fewer attractions for the Spaniards than most of the other colonies, and is
                    very thinly peopled. Its capital contains a large proportion of foreigners; and
                    a small number of <hi rend="italic">estancias,</hi> or grazing farms, are
                    sparingly diffused over its boundless plains, the proprietors of which keep
                    multitudes of horses and mules, flocks of sheep, and vast herds of cattle, the
                    latter being chiefly valued for their skins. These people are a bold, frank,
                    hardy, half-civilized race, who live isolated in the wilderness, and scarcely
                    acknowledge any government. Owing to these circumstances, the smallness of the
                    towns, and their distance from one another, there is little cohesion between the
                    parts of this republic, which may be said, in fact, to consist of a head without
                    a body, for its strength is concentrated in the capital. The republic is, or
                    rather was, divided into 14 provinces; and, according to an imperfect census
                    taken in 1815, contained 523,000 inhabitants, exclusive of Indians, and without
                    reckoning the Banda Oriental. Mr Miers, excluding from the republic the
                    provinces north of Cordova, and reducing the estimated numbers in the others to
                    less than one half, makes the whole population amount only to 152,000. This is
                    unquestionably below the truth. In what proportion the races are mixed we do not
                    know; but including the Sierra, or hilly region in the west, which comprehends
                    Upper Peru, Humboldt classes the population thus :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Whites</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Mixed</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>33</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Indians</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>53</p></cell></row></table><p>Since the revolution, printing presses have been introduced, which issue many
                    useful works; and several journals are established. Education has made great
                    advances in the cities, especially in the capital, where it is rare to find a
                    boy who cannot read and write. La Plata had never any nobility, and always much
                    less inequality of fortune than Mexicoand Peru. Slavery, which prevailed only to
                    a small extent in former times, is now verging to its extinction under a new
                    law; and the Indians are not numerous, either in the capital or the provinces,
                    except in those adjacent to Upper Peru. There is less bigotry too, and probably
                    more intelligence and industry, in the capital of La Plata, than in any town of
                    Spanish America. The trade and prosperity of the republic have been greatly
                    retarded by its internal dissensions, and the tedious, indecisive war which it
                    waged for some years with Brazil about the Banda Oriental. Mr Rodney estimated
                    the exports in 1818 at 10,000,000 dollars, and the revenue at 3,000,000. The
                    latter, in 1824, was officially announced to be 2,588,000, and in 1825,
                    2,633,000 dollars. The exports from Britain to Buenos Ayres in 1829 amounted to
                    L.484,000, and the imports from it to L. 143,000. The government of these vast
                    provinces has for a long time been in a state of extreme confusion. The two
                    parties of Unitarians and Federales have alternately chased each other from
                    power, and shed much blood. The former, who wished to <hi rend="italic">unite</hi> all the provinces under one legislature, and were thence named
                    Unitarians, comprise the men most distinguished for talent and intelligence, and
                    the most zealous friends to education and general improvement. They introduced a
                    plan of government founded on their own views, in 1826, consisting of a
                    president and two chambers. Subsequently they were driven from power, and their
                    system annihilated, by the Federales, who include in their ranks a great
                    majority of the priests and the most ignorant classes, and those who were
                    anciently the partisans of the Spanish power. Under these persons the ties that
                    connected the several provinces have been severed. Each now governs itself, and
                    has custom-houses on its frontiers; so that the intercourse between what are
                    professedly parts of one community is as difficult as that between distinct
                    kingdoms. The only remaining vestige of the federal bond is, that the other
                    provinces leave to Buenos Ayres the arrangement of their relations with foreign
                    powers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Rodney and

                    extending from the Atlantic to the river Uruguay. Its extent we have not seen
                    correctly stated, but it may amount to 80,000 square miles: its population has
                    been estimated at 175,000, but is probably much less. Monte Video, with 16,000
                    inhabitants, is the chief town, This province, after a long struggle <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038168" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8168-0643"/>
                    between Brazil and Buenos Ayres for its possession, was erected into an
                    independent state in 1829.</p><p>The country which bears the name of Paraguay at present is not, strictly
                    speaking, that in which the Jesuits had their celebrated missions, but a
                    district lying between the rivers Parana and Paraguay, and extending from the
                    23d to the 28th degree of south latitude. The government of Buenos Ayres sent an
                    army in 1810 to overturn the Spanish power in this district. The people rose in
                    arms under two leaders, who had probably laid their own schemes already, and,
                    after repelling the aggressors, quietly put an end to the Spanish dominion, and
                    asserted their independence. One of the leaders, Dr Francia, soon assumed the
                    whole power, and has proved one of the most singular despots recorded in
                    history. He is sober, abstinent, and unostentatious, economical of the public
                    money, and disinterested, but stern and capricious, employing the arm of
                    absolute power to correct the vices and increase the industry of his subjects.
                    He lives among the people with the simplicity and familiarity of a patriarch,
                    and yet is a tyrant in spirit, and carries his tyranny into the most ordinary
                    acts of private life. He seems to have borrowed his notions of social order from
                    the Jesuits, but employs naked force to effect what they accomplished by
                    persuasion. He directs one man how to build his house, another how to till his
                    ground, a third how to fabricate the articles which he manufactures; he fixes
                    the price of commodities, and enforces all his orders with the most summary and
                    rigorous penalties. Idleness is punished as a crime. He keeps a small army to
                    support his authority and guard his frontiers; and will neither permit any
                    stranger to enter the country, nor any of his subjects to leave it. Being
                    dissatisfied with the meanness and irregularity of his capital, the small town
                    of Assumption, he compelled the inhabitants to pull down their houses, and
                    rebuild them on a new plan. The church has not escaped his reforming zeal. He
                    prohibited nocturnal processions as sources of profligacy, expelled the monks,
                    abolished the Inquisition, and diminished the number of festivals. In fine, the
                    writers to whom we are indebted for these details inform us, that after having
                    played the despot to accomplish reforms, and trained his subjects to habits of
                    industry and order, he has latterly relaxed his severity, and is now obeyed
                    rather from respect and confidence than fear. He governs the country under the
                    title of dictator. The number of his subjects is estimated by Balbi at 250,000;
                    and of these, probably one third are whites, and two thirds Indians or
                    Mestizoes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Extrait de

                    its length is 1300 miles; its breadth varies from 30 to 120; and its surface,
                    exclusive of Araucania and the district beyond the 44th parallel, is 66,960
                    square miles, according to Mr Miers. The country consists properly of the
                    western slope or declivity of the Andes; for the branches of the mountains,
                    running out in tortuous directions from the main trunk, reach to the seashore.
                    It enjoys an excellent and healthful climate; severe cold is unknown in the
                    inhabited parts, and the heat is seldom excessive. The useful soil bears a small
                    proportion to the entire surface of the country, consisting merely of the bottom
                    of the valleys. It has rich mines of gold, silver, and copper in the northern
                    provinces; but very few of them can be worked, in consequence of the absolute
                    sterility of the adjacent country. It is divided into 13 provinces; and of
                    these, the two northern, occupying 450 miles of the coast, are nearly perfect
                    deserts. The soil continues extremely dry, and yields nothing without
                    irrigation, till we reach the latitude of 35⁰; and it is believed that not one
                    fiftieth part of the country is fit for cultivation. But south of the river
                    Maule the land is covered with fine timber, and bears crops of wheat and other
                    grain, without the aid of any other moisture than what is supplied by the
                    atmosphere. This is in truth the fine and fruitful part of Chili; and the
                    project has already been discussed of selecting its chief town, Conception, for
                    the seat of the government. Chili has no manufactures, and is unfavourably
                    situated for commerce. It has no navigable rivers, while its mountainous surface
                    is an obstacle to the formation of roads; and its communications with all other
                    parts of the world are circuitous and difficult. A representative constitution,
                    but of a strange character, was established in Chili in 1823. A “Supreme
                    Director” was placed at the head of the executive, but who was to perform no
                    important act without the advice and consent of a senate of nine members, who
                    hold their seats for six years. The house of representatives, consisting of not
                    more than 200 members, chosen for eight years, was to be assembled only upon
                    extraordinary occasions; but 25 of its members, selected by ballot, and called
                    together by an order of the executive, was to be sufficient to sanction any law
                    or act which might be submitted to it by the executive. This constitution, and
                    some others which succeeded it, remained mere empty forms. The people, ignorant
                    and widely scattered, have continued passive spectators of political events,
                    while different factions have alternately chaced one another from power, and
                    indulged in proscriptions and confiscations. The revenue in 1824, according to
                    Mr Miers, was 1,636,000 dollars, and the expenditure was announced by the
                    minister to be 2,497,000. The exports from Britain to Chili in 1829 were
                    L.l,182,000, and the imports L.58,000, official value. The population is usually
                    estimated at 1,200,000, but is reduced by Mr Miers to 560,000, which is probably
                    under the truth. With regard to its composition, our information is not
                    precise. The author just named says, that the race of pure Indians, with their
                    language, have disappeared from all the country between Araucania and Peru; but
                    among the poorer settlers are men of all complexions, from the mixture of the
                    above genus with the Spaniards. Mr Stevenson says that the population of the
                    southern province of Conception consists of “a few Spaniards, some white
                    Creoles, Mestizoes, a few slaves of different colours, and fewer Indians ;” and
                    that the Mestizoes are scarcely to be distinguished from the whites. From these
                    and other notices we would infer that the part of the population in which Indian
                    blood is not distinctly perceptible is probably less than one half.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Miers’ <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi><hi rend="italic">in Chili and La</hi><hi rend="italic">Plata,</hi> 1826.

                    western declivities of the Andes, from the 4th to the 25th degree of south
                    latitude, with the addition of a considerable tract on the east side of the
                    mountains, between the 4th and the 15th parallels. There are few countries in
                    the world which have a more singular physical character than the western part of
                    Peru. It is a belt or zone of sands, 1700 miles in length, and from 7 to 50 in
                    breadth, with inequalities of surface which might be called mountains, if they
                    were not seen in connection with the stupendous back ground of the Andes. This
                    long line of desert is intersected by rivers and streams which are seldom less
                    than 20, or more than 80 miles <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038181" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8181-0644"/>apart, and on the sides of which narrow strips of
                    productive soil are created by means of irrigation. These isolated valleys form
                    the whole habitable country. Some of the large rivers reach the sea; the smaller
                    are either consumed in irrigating the patches of cultivated land, or absorbed by
                    the encompassing desert, where it never rains, where neither beast nor bird
                    lives, and a blade of vegetation never grew. No stranger can travel from one of
                    these valleys to another without a guide, for the desert is traekless; and the
                    only indications of a route are an occasional cluster of bones, the remains of
                    beasts of burden that have perished. Even experienced guides, who regulate their
                    course by the stars, the sun, or the direction of the wind, sometimes lose their
                    path, and then they almost inevitably perish. Of a party of 300 soldiers thrown
                    ashore by a shipwreck in 1823 on one of these desert spaces, nearly a hundred
                    expired before they reached the nearest valley. Ignoranee and wonder have been
                    busy with this singular region: legends are current, which tell that descendants
                    of the ancient Peruvians have lived in some of these mysterious valleys, hid
                    from the knowledge of their merciless invaders, since the days of the
                    Incas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"> Memoirs of General Miller,</hi> chap. xix.</p></note> We have no
                    reason to believe that more than one acre in a hundred of maritime Peru will
                    ever be available for the sustenance of mankind. The country has two
                    advantages—its mines of the precious metals, and a temperate and delightful
                    climate, in consequence of the absence of rain, and the fogs which intercept the
                    solar heat. It can never be rich in the proper sense of the term, or make much
                    progress in the improvements which depend upon a dense population. Like Chili,
                    it has no navigable rivers—and nature has not only deprived it of the means of
                    forming good roads, but placed it in a situation the most unfavourable for
                    intercourse with the other parts of the civilized world. Even its metallic
                    wealth has been greatly reduced by the separation of Bolivia. There are indeed
                    few countries in the world whose natural advantages have been so much overrated
                    as Peru; and it requires little sagacity to discover that its future career
                    cannot correspond with its past celebrity. The districts east of the Andes,
                    which have a hot climate, accompanied with a rich soil, will ultimately be the
                    most valuable part of the country; but their secluded situation, and want of
                    communication with other countries, must keep them long in a backward state. The
                    government of Peru is republican and central, not federal; but the numerous
                    alterations it has undergone render it hazardous to speak of its particular
                    provisions; and indeed the struggles of faction have rendered it a dead letter.
                    The revenue of Peru in 1826, according to an official statement, was 5,203,000
                    dollars, or L. 1,140,000; but most of these accounts, put forth by authority in
                    the new American states, both respecting money and population, are prepared with
                    the view of creating favourable impressions in Europe as to their resources, and
                    should be received with suspicion. Peru is divided into eight departments, which
                    comprehend a surface of 350,000 square miles; the capital, Lima, contains 70,000
                    inhabitants; and the entire population of the state is given as under by General
                    Miller :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Whites</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>240,819</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Indians</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>998,846</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Mestizoes</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>383,782</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Free Mulattoes</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>69,848</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Slaves .</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>43,628</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1,736,923</p></cell></row></table><p>Bolivia, or Upper Peru, lies eastward of Lower Peru, and is bounded on the south
                    by the river Pilcomayo. It is of a triangular form, and comprehends a space of
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> 480,000 square miles. The climate is pleasant and
                    healthful, the soil is generally dry, and in the eastern parts, as well as the
                    elevated table-land, its aridity produces barrenness. Nature, however, as a
                    compensation for its other disadvantages, has bestowed upon it some of the
                    richest mines in the world. This country was erected into an independent state
                    only in 1825, and named Bolivia in honour of its liberator Bolivar. It consists
                    of five departments, Charcas, Potosi, La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz de la
                    Sierra, which were originally subject to the viceroy of Peru, but, in the later
                    times of the Spanish rule, were joined to the viccroyalty of Buenos Ayres.
                    Chuquisaca, a small town about 50 miles eastward of Potosi, is the capital.
                    Bolivia has a small strip of barren territory on the shores of the Pacific
                    Ocean, between the 22d and 25th parallel; but it is, properly speaking, entirely
                    an inland country, and more deficient in the means of communicating with foreign
                    nations than any other state in America. This circumstance must greatly retard
                    its improvement. It has a very complex political constitution, planned and
                    introduced by its founder in 1826. The government is vested in a tribunate, a
                    senate, a council of censors chosen for four years by electoral colleges, and a
                    president nominated by these bodies for life. The electoral colleges consist of
                    electors chosen by all the male adults in each province, in the proportion of
                    one elector for every ten voters. The population of Bolivia, according to
                    General Miller, is 1,200,000, of whom probably two thirds are Indians. Of the
                    revenue or trade of the new state we have not seen any account.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"/>Ibid, and

                    the 83d to the 94th degree of west longitude, extending 800 miles in length, and
                    covering a space of 130,000 square miles. The surface of the country is hilly,
                    and in some parts mountainous; the climate warm and very moist. The mineral
                    wealth of the country is not great; but this is compensated by the richness of
                    its soil, and its excellent commercial position. It is a federal republic,
                    consisting of five states, whose population, estimated at 1,600,000 by Humboldt,
                    is, we suspect, a little overrated in the following statement received from the

                    of North America. Each of the five states has its own legislature; and the
                    general <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038194" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8194-0645"/>government is vested in a congress, consisting of
                    a senate of 10 members, and a house of representatives of 31, elected directly
                    by the people; while the executive power is confided to a president, chosen for
                    a term of years. Slavery has had no existence in Central America since the
                    revolution. In this state, as in Mexico there is much inequality of fortune: Mr
                    Thompson enumerates seven persons in the capital, whose property exceeds 500,000
                    dollars each, and eleven others whose property exceeds 100,000. The revenue,
                    which was about 360,000 under the Spanish regime, is now about 806,000. The
                    imports are estimated at L.2,000,000 sterling, which is certainly an
                    exaggeration. The articles shipped from Britain for the republic in 1829
                    amounted only to L.10,000 official value; but British goods probably reach the
                    country indirectly through the West India islands. Its leading productions for
                    exportation are, cochineal, indigo, cocoa, cotton, hides, and drugs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thompson’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of an Official Visit io Guatemala.</hi> London. 829.</p></note></p><p>Mexicois the most populous and powerful of all the new states erected in America
                    since the commencement of the present century. If we include merely the 19
                    confederated governments, the republic covers an extent of 605,000 square
                    English miles; but if we add the country still occupied by independent tribes
                    over which it extends a claim, the Mexican territory comprehends an area of
                    1,600,000 square miles. About three fourths of the surface consists either of
                    mountains or table-land, raised from 5000 to 10,000 feet above the sea. Owing to
                    this extraordinary elevation, even those parts of the country which lie within
                    the torrid zone, the low ground on the coast excepted, enjoy a dry, cool, and
                    salubrious atmosphere; but this advantage is counterbalanced by the insufficient
                    supply of moisture, and the rapid evaporation resulting from the same cause,
                    which render the soil generally rather arid, and in many parts absolutely
                    barren; by the smallness of the rivers, and the almost entire absence of inland
                    navigation; and by the obstacles which the steep and rugged ascents from the
                    coast present to land carriage. The republic is besides almost destitute of
                    ports on the Atlantic side. Mexicois rich beyond every other country in the
                    world in the precious metals; and there are few regions upon which nature has
                    lavished so great a variety of vegetable productions, or where plants fitted to
                    the coldest and the hottest climates may be seen so nearly in juxtaposition. The
                    low ground on the east coast is admirably calculated for raising sugar, with
                    which the state of Vera Cruz alone could supply all Europe; and no country is
                    more favourably situated for growing the other great articles of West India
                    produce, coffee, cotton, cocoa, indigo, and tobacco. In drugs, gums, and
                    balsams, it can scarcely rival Brazil, Colombia, and Guatemala. Those
                    productions which belong chiefly to the belt of warm low land along the eastern
                    and western coast, and are yet cultivated only to a small extent, together with
                    the precious metals, which come from the interior, must be the great articles of
                    exchange for Mexicowith foreign countries. The raising of <hi rend="italic">bread stuffs,</hi> as they are termed by the Anglo-Americans, wheat, maize, and
                    barley, with potatoes, the cassava root, beans, pumpkins, fruits, &amp;c. for
                    domestic consumption, will necessarily be the chief branch of industry on the
                    table-lands. The mines have never employed above 30,000 labourers; and their
                    superior productiveness depends chiefly on two circumstances—the great abundance
                    of the ore, which is only of poor quality, and the comparative facility with
                    which they can be worked, owing to their being generally situated in fertile
                    districts, where provisions, wood, and all materials can be easily procured.
                    Many of the Peruvian mines are rendered useless by the sterility of the
                    surrounding country. Mexicohas her full share of the ignorance and superstition
                    which belonged to Old Spain and all its foreign possessions; and these evils,
                    long cherished by a rapacious, immoral, and intolerant clergy, are now the
                    greatest obstacles to her improvement. That excessive inequality of fortune
                    which corrupts both extremes of society was nowhere in the world more prevalent
                    than in Mexico Individual proprietors possessed immense tracts of land and
                    boundless wealth, while all the great towns swarmed with beggars,and thousands
                    fell a sacrifice to famine from time to time. The Mexican constitution, which is
                    federal, and almost a literal copy of that of the United States, was established
                    in 1824. The republic consists of 19 states, each of which has its distinct
                    government; while a congress representing the whole is intrusted with the
                    management of those affairs which concern the collective body. The house of
                    representatives is chosen for two years, by the inhabitants at large, in the
                    proportion of one member for 80,000 voters. The senate is composed of 38
                    members, or two for each state, who are elected by the state legislatures, for
                    four years, and renewed by halves. The president is elected for four years by
                    the state legislatures. The clergy before the revolution consisted of about
                    10,000 persons, the one half secular and the other regular. They enjoyed large
                    revenues, which were very unequally divided. The monks and friars are now much
                    reduced; the secular clergy, in 1827, amounted to 3677 individuals, who are but
                    poorly paid, in consequence of the funds belonging to the order being
                    dilapidated in the course of the revolution. The Catholic church in Mexicohas
                    not relaxed in its intolerance. The revenue of the country, which amounted to
                    20,000,000 of dollars in 1803, is estimated by Mr Ward at 14,000,000 of dollars
                    for 1828, the two most productive items being the duties of customs, and the
                    monopoly of tobacco, which has been recently revived. But the finances are in
                    extreme disorder, in consequence of the frequent changes in the government and
                    the unsettled state of the country. The exports were estimated by Humboldt in
                    1803 at 21,700,000 dollars, of which 17,000,000 was in gold and silver; and the
                    imports at 14,000,000. In 1824 the former were valued at 4,500,000 dollars, and
                    the latter at 12,000,000. The value of all foreign commodities, however, has
                    been completely changed by the suppression of the old monopoly; and the amount
                    of goods imported now is greater than before the revolution. The distinction of
                    <hi rend="italic">castes,</hi> which was maintained in the greatest rigour under
                    the colonial system, has now disappeared, and power and office are open, not
                    only legally, but practically, to men of all colours. The African blacks formed
                    an extremely small proportion of the Mexican population at all times, and since
                    the revolution slavery has ceased. The number of inhabitants, which Mr Ward
                    thinks, might amount to 8,000,000 in 1827, is estimated at 6,800,000 by Humboldt
                    in 1823, and classed as follows :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Numbers.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Proportions.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Whites</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1,230,000</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>29 per cent.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Mixed races</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1,860,000</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>27</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Indians</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3,710,000</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>54</p></cell></row></table><p>Mr Ward states, however, that very few of the whites, so called, are free of a

                    place in their governments render it too obvious that, owing to the ignorance
                    and corruption of the people, not one of them has a sufficient force of cohesion
                    to hold its parts together. In all probability, the nine states which we have
                    mentioned will soon be dismembered into twenty or thirty, unless it happen, as
                    it probably may, that military leaders, erecting thrones to themselves by the
                    sword, apply the compressing force of despotic power to hold together the
                    heterogeneous materials. The Spanish population of the new world are evidently
                    unfit at present to conduct a government on the broad principles of republican
                    liberty exemplified in the United States. They are yet in their political
                    nonage, and will probably pay dear, as other nations have done, for the
                    knowledge and experience of which they stand in need. The Brazilians, with
                    apparently less liberty, enjoy more of the real advantages of good government;
                    but the country, from its great extent, is not likely to remain permanently
                    united. The lapse of a few years may be expected to produce great changes in the
                    political condition of all Spanish and Portuguese America.</p><p>We have said nothing respecting the produce of the gold and silver mines in the
                    different parts of America, because our object was to bring the information on
                    this subject into one short general statement. The following table, given by
                    Humboldt, exhibits the average produce of all the gold and silver mines in the
                    new world about 1803.</p><p>The Spanish mark, in which the quantity is expressed in the first two columns, is
                    valued at 145∙82 dollars in gold, and at 9∙4 dollars in silver. Mr Ward
                    concludes, from his researches, that in the 15 years ending with 1810, the
                    produce of the Mexican mines exceeded Humboldt’s calculation by 1,000,000 of
                    dollars. This branch of industry has been injured more deeply than any other
                    during the late wars. The great exertions required to retain the mines free of
                    water, the amount of capital necessary to keep them working, and the facility
                    with which violent hands could be laid upon their produce, all rendered these
                    establishments extremely liable to suffer from domestic convulsions. Mr Ward
                    computes, that in the 15 years between 1810 and 1825, the annual produce of the
                    Mexican mines did. not exceed 10,000,000 of dollars, or about <hi rend="italic">two fifths</hi> of their average produce during the 15 years preceding. If we
                    suppose that the reduction has been as great in the other Spanish colonies, the
                    entire produce of the American mines will not exceed L.4,000,000. In Brazil the
                    washings have probably experienced no interruption; but, accordińg to the
                    Edinburgh Review, Humboldt’s estimate for the country is too high by a third.
                    This author computes that the whole produce of the American mines, from 1492 to
                    1803, was 5,706,000,000 dollars, or L.l,255,000,000, of which only 4⅜ per cent
                    was retained in America, and 5,445,000,000 dollars (L. 1,197,900,000), or 95∣
                    per cent., was remitted to Europe. If we add L. 110,000,000 for what has been
                    remitted since 1803, the whole value of the precious metals sent from America to
                    Europe will be L.l,307,900,000 sterling. There is no reason to dread any falling
                    off in the mineral treasures of America for a long period of time. On the
                    contrary, were the country tranquil, and the skill and capital which some years
                    of good government will create, applied to the development of this branch of
                    industry, there is no doubt that many rich veins yet unknown would be opened,
                    and the annual produce increased far beyond its utmost amount while in the hands
                    of the Spaniards. Owing to causes which can no longer operate, it is believed
                    that the richest mines of Mexicohave never yet been opened, while a great number
                    remain unknown; and this probably holds true to a still greater extent in the
                    other new states.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ward’s

                    and speculation predominant at the time was incompatible with all sober

                    brilliant and rapid progress shows, in a striking light, how much more the
                    prosperity of nations depends on <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> than on <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> advantages. The North Americans had no gold mines,
                    and a territory of only indifferent fertility, covered with impenetrable woods;
                    but they brought with them intelligence, industry, a love of freedom, habits of
                    order, and a pure and severe morality. Armed with these gifts of the soul, they
                    have converted the wilderness into a land teeming with life, and smiling with
                    plenty; and they have built up a social system so pre-eminently calculated to
                    promote the happiness and moral improvement of mankind, that it has truly become
                    the “envy of nations.” The republic is bounded on the north by Canada, on the
                    south-west by Mexico and on the other sides by the sea or the Indian lands. It
                    now consists of twenty-four sovereign states, and of three <hi rend="italic">territories,</hi> which will be converted into <hi rend="italic">states</hi> as
                    soon as each acquires a population of 60,000 souls. The extent of the country,
                    if we include merely the settled districts marked off with defined boundaries as
                    states or territories, is 1,009,000 square English miles; but if we add the
                    Indian lands stretching west to the Pacific Ocean, over which it claims a right
                    of pre-emption, it embraces an area of 2,300,000 square miles. The agriculture
                    of the United States partakes to some extent of a tropical character. The
                    sugar-cane is cultivated in Louisiana, Florida, and other states, as high as the
                    latitude of 31∣°. Cotton is raised in all the southern states within the 37th
                    parallel, and tobacco in those within the 41st. Wheat succeeds in the middle and
                    northern states, and maize thrives in every part of the union. Agriculture is
                    conducted with considerable skill; but the “high farming” practised in England
                    would not pay in America, where money is of much value, and land of little.
                    Scarcely any portion of the soil is rented in the United States: the farmers <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038220" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8220-0647"/>are
                    almost universally proprietors; and when their property is extensive, which
                    rarely happens, it is soon broken 'into small occupancies, under the law of
                    equal division. The Americans are making considerable progress in manufactures,
                    particularly in those of cotton. The mechanical skill which has been developed
                    in England, by centuries of progressive industry, is rapidly transplanted to the
                    United States by crowds of emigrants; while the increasing use of machinery is
                    depriving England of the superiority derived from her cheap labour. In the
                    useful arts generally America is on a level with France and England; in the fine
                    arts and the sciences she is much behind. The internal commerce of the United
                    States is conducted with extraordinary spirit. The capital expended on roads,
                    canals, harbours, bridges, and other public works, appears scarcely credible to
                    those who reflect on the short term of the republic’s existence. Her foreign
                    trade is nearly as great as that of France, and her amount of shipping is half
                    as great as that of the British Isles. Her exports and imports in 1827

                    whites, but they are less numerous in the other states. Slavery does not exist
                    in the nine states of Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode
                    Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio; and it is verging to its
                    extinction in the four states of Delaware, Maryland, Indiana, and Illinois. The
                    slaves multiply as fast as the whites, a proof that their treatment is
                    incomparably more mild than in the West Indies, where their numbers constantly
                    diminish.</p><p>The American government is a pure representative democracy, in which the people
                    are recognised as the fountain of all power; and the sole object of all its
                    mechanism is to give effect to their deliberate opinions. The federal and state
                    governments are constituted on the same plan. The legislature consists in every
                    case of two bodies, a house of representatives chosen for one or two years, and
                    a senate for a period varying from two years to six; but both always by popular
                    election, except in the case of the federal senate, which is chosen by the
                    legislatures of the twenty-four states. The president holds his office for four
                    years, but is generally re-elected for four years more. While the politicians of
                    Europe, bred in the schools of monarchy and aristocracy, have been predicting
                    anarchy and confusion as the result of these republican institutions, their
                    solid excellence has been quietly developing itself, in the cheering spectacle
                    which the United States present of perfect order, security, and contentment,
                    combined with growing intelligence, prosperity, and unrivalled liberty. On an

                    condition in all the populous parts of the country. The most numerous
                    denominations are, the presbyterians, independents, baptists, and
                    methodists.</p><p>The characteristic facts in the condition of America are, the non-existence of
                    titles, of privileged classes, of corporations in our sense of the term, of a
                    landed aristocracy, of mendicity except to a very limited extent, and of an
                    endowed church; the cheapness and efficiency of its government, the universality
                    of education, the omnipresence of its periodical press, the high feeling of
                    self-respect which exists in the very humblest classes, and the boundless spirit
                    of enterprise which pervades society from top to bottom. The higher classes are
                    less polished than in England, the middle are perhaps less carefully instructed;
                    but the American people, taken collectively, are better educated, and have more
                    intelligence and manliness of character, than any other nation in the world. The
                    master evils of the republic are three,—the complex, tedious, and expensive law
                    of England, which has been borrowed wholesale; an insecure and ever fluctuating
                    paper currency; and the negro slavery, which blackens and benumbs all the
                    southern states.</p><p>The portion of the American continent claimed by the British is bounded on the
                    south by the territories of the United States, on the north by the Polar Sea, on
                    the west by the Russian territories, from which it is divided by the meridian of
                    141° west. It contains an area of 2,600,000 square miles, of which about one
                    half may be habitable, and one seventh part tolerably fertile; but the districts
                    which have been marked out into counties or townships, and in which settlements
                    are begun, form a very small portion of this immense region. We have measured
                    the surface of these districts with some care, on a map published in the third
                    report of the parliamentary committee on emigration in 1827; and have put the
                    result into the first column of the following table, which contains the
                    population of each colony, with its imports and exports for 1825, as given in

                    at the rate of about 3∣ per cent, per annum, it must amount to 1,020,000 in
                    1830. Canada is generally fertile, and is rapidly improving. The Welland canal,
                    to be opened in 1830, unites lakes Erie and Ontario; and by a projected canal at
                    the falls below the latter, and the great Rideau canal, now executing, to
                    connect the river Ottawa with Kingston, an unbroken line of water-carriage of
                    1100 miles in length will be secured. The long duration of the winter, and the
                    closing of the river navigation for five months by ice, is the greatest
                    disadvantage to which these colonies are exposed.</p><p>Russian America comprises the north-west angle of the continent, as far as the
                    141st meridian west from London, with a narrow strip of coast reaching as far
                    south as 55⅜° of north latitude. It occupies a surface of about 500,000 square
                    miles, of which the useful soil probably does not constitute a tenth part. The
                    Russians have merely a number of posts or factories stationed along the coast
                    for conducting the trade in furs, which gives these pòssessions their only
                    value. New Archangel, in latitude 57∙3° and longitude 135∙20° west, is the head
                    establishment. It is a fortress, with a small garrison and 40 pieces of cannon.
                    Owing to the rigour of the climate, this portion of America can never support
                    more than a very limited population.</p><p>Hayti, called formerly Hispaniola and St Domingo, was a colony belonging partly
                    to France and partly to Spain, till 1791, when the blacks rose in arms, killed a
                    number of the whites, and expelled the rest. The attempt of England in 1793, and
                    of France in 1801, to conquer the island, both failed, and Hayti has at length
                    been acknowledged as an independent state by all the great powers, including
                    France. The island, which contains about 26,000 square miles, is remarkably
                    fertile; but its climate, like that of the West Indies generally, is rather
                    unhealthful. The population, which before the revolution was estimated at
                    600,000, now amounts, according to a late article in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> to 035,000. It is entirely composed of blacks and
                    mulattoes, no white man being allowed to become a citizen, or hold property in
                    land. Slavery is prohibited. The government is republican. The president holds
                    his office for life, and, with the consent of the senate, nominates his
                    successor. The chamber of representatives consists of 72 members, chosen by the
                    males of adult age, for five years; the senate of 24 members, elected for nine
                    years by the house of representatives. The black republic has a code of laws
                    compiled for its own use, a national guard, regular courts of justice, many
                    schools on the Lancasterian plan, and one or two superior seminaries, where
                    logic, moral philosophy, Latin, and mathematics, are taught. The army consists
                    of 33 regiments of infantry, and 5 of cavalry, constituting a force of 24,800
                    men in 1827. The island is divided into 66 communes, and 33 parishes or
                    districts not yet populous enough to rank as communes; and each of these
                    divisions has its Council of Notables, or municipality, composed of three, four,
                    or six persons, nominated for five years. The blacks have disproved the
                    assertions of those who maintained that they could not support any regular
                    system of government. There is little doubt that life and property are as well
                    protected in Hayti as in Spain or Naples. It has indeed been found necessary to
                    enforce the cultivation of the fields in the black republic by penal enactments;
                    and the provisions of what is called the “rural code” on this subject, have been
                    triumphantly referred to by the abettors of compulsory labour in the country. We
                    must remember, however, that the bad habits generated by ages of slavery cannot
                    be eradicated in the lapse of one generation. The small amount of the exports
                    and imports now, compared with what they were in the colonial period, proves
                    nothing against the blacks. Formerly the population lived on imported corn, and
                    employed their labour in raising sugar and coffee for foreign countries; but at
                    present the Haytians subsist on the produce of their own fields, and have of
                    course fewer articles for exportation. The revenue arises from a land-tax,
                    customs, stamp-duties, and a patent tax or graduated duty on trades and
                    professions, similar to that which exists in France.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Extrait de l' <hi rend="italic">Almanaclι

                    description of the West India colonies, insular and continental. The islands
                    have been variously denominated, but the most convenient division seems to us
                    the following :—1. The Great Antilles, comprehending Cuba, Hayti, Jamaica, and

                    the coast of Guiana; 3. The Bahama Isles, about 500 in number, but only a small
                    number of which are inhabited.</p><p>The British colonies are 18 in number, viz. 15 <hi rend="italic">insular,</hi>

                    Lucia, St Vincents, Tobago, Tortola, Trinidad, Bahamas, Bermuda; and 3 <hi rend="italic">continental,</hi> Demerara, Berbice, Honduras. According to a
                    parliamentary paper, these 18 colonies contained 713,000 slaves in 1824. The
                    number of whites was probably about 70,000; and, adding as many more for the
                    free persons of colour, the whole population may be estimated at 850,000
                    souls.</p><p>The Spanish possessions consist of the two islands of Cuba and Porto Rico
                    According to a statement which appeared in the English newspapers in 1829, the
                    population of Cuba amounted to 259,000 whites, 154,000 free blacks, and 225,000
                    slaves; total 638,000. We have seen no account of the number of inhabitants in
                    Porto Rico but Humboldt computed the collective population of the two Spanish
                    islands at 800,000 in 1823.</p><p>The French colonies in the West Indies consist of French Guiana on the continent,
                    containing 17,300 inhabitants, of whom 13,600 are negro slaves? Guadaloupe, with
                    109,700 inhabitants, including 90,300 negroes; and Martinique, with 97,300
                    inhabitants, including 77,000 negroes. Total population of the French colonies,

                    to 100,000. Slavery brings two evils with it, which strike at the roots of
                    national prosperity; it produces an aversion to labour in the free-population,
                    and it renders person and property insecure. We may therefore safely predict,
                    that the countries where the African race most abound will be the most
                    unimproved and backward part of the American continent a century hence.</p><p>One of the most interesting questions connected with America relates to the
                    increase and probable amount, at a future period, of its inhabitants. It was the
                    astonishing progress of the United States that first clearly unfolded the
                    principles on which the multiplication of human beings depends. We now know with
                    certainty that a prosperous community, possessing abundance of unoccupied land,
                    will double its numbers in 25 years, without any aid from emigration; and as the
                    scale ascends in a geometrical ratio, a short time necessarily produces a
                    wonderful change. It is to be observed, however, that the whites, possessing the
                    advantages of superior industry, order, and forethought, naturally increase
                    faster than the other classes. In the United States this part of the population
                    increases at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum; and when the Spanish American
                    republics have settled down into a tranquil state, there is no doubt that their
                    white inhabitants will multiply at the same rate. The Mexican Indians, and
                    probably the Peruvians, have been increasing also, but slowly, while nearly all
                    the independent tribes are mouldering away. The black population does not
                    maintain its numbers in the West Indies; it is rather increasing in Brazil; and
                    in the United States it grows rapidly. Setting aside the West Indies, where the
                    negroes do not increase, and attending to the continent merely, let us take the
                    number of each class as it stands at present, and see what the result will be in
                    a course of years, assuming the rate of increase to be 3 per cent, for the
                    whites, 1⅜ per cent, for the negroes, and 1 per cent, for the civilized Indians.
                    If the whole population is 40,000,000 at present, the continental whites will be
                    about 16,000,000, the Indians about 9,500,000, the negroes 5,000,000, and the
                    mixed race about 7,000,000.</p><p>In Spanish America, it may be assumed that the mixed race, consisting almost
                    entirely of mestizoes, will merge into the white, and increase nearly in the
                    same ratio. We shall therefore add 5-7ths of the former to the latter, which
                    will raise the whites to 21,000,000.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Number of</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>the whites in</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1830,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>21,000,000</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Do.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>do.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1855,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>42,000,000</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Do.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>do.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1880,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>84,000,000</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Do.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>do.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1905,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>168,000,000</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Do.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>do.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1930,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>336,000,000</p></cell></row></table><p>As the difficulty of providing for the growing annual increment of inhabitants

                    the numbers of the other classes, supposing the rate of increase to receive a
                    similar check at the end of a century, and adding two millions of the mixed race

                    the fate of the wandering tribes, and disappear before the superior energy of
                    the European race, when increasing numbers bring the two classes more into
                    competition for employment and the means of subsistence. Either this will
                    happen, or the red race will be gradually blended with the white before it
                    attains the magnitude which our calculations exhibit. Much more difficulty will
                    be felt in disposing of the negroes, with whom, on account of the deeper dye of
                    their skins, and the taint which slavery has communicated to their blood, the
                    whites will always be much more averse to contract alliances. Their increase, it
                    is probable, will receive a check long before it has reached the number of 160
                    millions. The superior humanity developed in a well-organized society may
                    shelter the blacks to some extent from cruelty; but in the long run, when stern
                    necessity presses, weakness and ignorance must yield to intelligence and vigour.
                    Another question, however, remains, and that relates to the number of human
                    beings whom the new world could support. We seek, of course, only approximate
                    results; and, in this point of view, the question is not incapable of
                    solution.</p><p>Paradoxical as the fact may appear, we are satisfied that the new continent,
                    though less than half the size of the old, contains at least an equal quantity
                    of useful soil, and much more than an equal amount of productive power. America
                    is indebted for this advantage to its comparatively small breadth, which brings
                    nearly all its interior within reach of the fertilizing exhalations of the
                    ocean. In the old continent, owing to its great extent from east to west, the
                    central parts, deprived of moisture, are <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038259" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8259-0650"/>almost
                    everywhere deserts; and a belt round the western, southern, and eastern shores,
                    comprises nearly all that contributes to the support of man. How much fruitful
                    land, for instance, is there in Continental Asia? If we draw a line from the
                    Gulf of Cutch (near the Indus) to the head of the Yellow Sea, we cut off India
                    and China, with the intervening Birman empire, and the southern valleys of
                    Thibet; and this space, which comprises about 3,500,000 square miles, if we take
                    surface and fertility together, embraces five sixths of the productive power of
                    Asia, though it covers 17,000,000 of square miles! Arabia, Persia, Central
                    Thibet, Western India, Chinese and Independent Tartary, are deserts, with
                    scattered patches of useful soil not amounting to the twentieth part of their
                    extent. Siberia, or northern Asia, is little better, owing to aridity and cold
                    together. Anatolia, Armenia, the Punjab, and a narrow strip along the western
                    shores of the Pacific Ocean, north as far as the 60th parallel, compose the only
                    valuable agricultural territory beyond India and China. Europe, which is merely
                    the western margin of Asia, is all fruitful in the south; but on the north its
                    fruitfulness terminates at the 60th or 62d parallel. Africa has simply a border
                    of useful soil round three fourths of its sea-coast, with some detached portions
                    of tolerably good land in its interior. Of the 31,000,000 of square miles which
                    these three continents occupy, we cannot find, after some calculation, that the
                    productive soil constitutes so much as one third, and of that third a part is
                    but poor.</p><p>Now, in estimating the useful soil in America, we reject, 1. all the region
                    northward of the latitude of 53°, amounting to 2,600,000 square miles; 2. a belt
                    of barren land about 300 miles broad by 1000 in length, or 300,000 square miles,
                    lying on the east side of the rocky mountains; 3. a belt of arid land-of similar
                    extent situated on the east side of the Andes, between 24° and 40° of south
                    latitude; 4. the desert shore of Peru, equal to 100,000 square miles; 5. an
                    extent of 100,000 square miles for the arid country of California and Sonora;
                    and, 6. an extent of 500,000 square miles for the summits of the Andes and the
                    south extremity of Patagonia. These make an aggregate of 3,900,000 square miles;
                    and this, deducted from 13,900,000, leaves 10,000,000 square miles as the
                    quantity of useful soil in the new world.</p><p>Now, what relation does the fruitfulness of the ground bear to the latitude of
                    the place? The productive powers of the soil depend on two circumstances, heat
                    and moisture; and these increase as we approach the equator. First, the warm
                    regions of the globe yield larger returns of those plants which they have in
                    common with the temperate zones; and, next, they have peculiar plants which
                    afford a much greater portion of nourishment from the same extent of surface.
                    Thus, maize, which produces 40 or 50 for one in France, produces 150 for one on
                    an average in Mexico and Humboldt computes that an arpent (five sixths of an
                    acre), which will scarcely support two men when sown in wheat, will support
                    fifty when planted with bananas. From a consideration of these and other facts,
                    we infer that the productive, or rather nutritive powers of the soil, will be
                    pretty correctly indicated by combining the ratios of the heat and the moisture,
                    expressing the former of these in degrees of the centigrade scale. Something, we
                    know, depends on the distribution of the heat through the different seasons; but
                    as we do not aim at minute accuracy, this may be overlooked.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="2" role="data" rows="1"><p>Latitude.

                    of ground which supports four persons at the latitude of 60°, would support 15
                    at the latitude of 45°, and 100 at the equator. But the food preferred will not
                    always be that which the land yields in greatest abundance: and another most
                    important qualifying circumstance must be considered,—it is labour which renders
                    the ground fruitful; and the power of the human frame to sustain labour is
                    greatly diminished in hot climates. In the torrid zone, in low situations, we
                    doubt if it is possible for men to work regularly in the fields for more than
                    five hours a day, or half the daily period of labour in England. On these
                    grounds, and to avoid all exaggeration, we shall consider the capacity of the
                    land to support population as proportional to the third power of the cosine (or
                    radius of gyration) for the latitude. It will therefore stand thus in round
                    numbers :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Latitude, 0°,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>15°,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>30°,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>45°, 60°.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Productiveness, 100,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>90,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>65,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>35, 12⅜.</p></cell></row></table><p>In England the density of population is about 230 persons per square mile; but
                    England is in some measure the workshop of the world, and supports, by her
                    foreign trade, a greater population than her soil can nourish. In France the
                    density of population is about 160; in Germany it varies from 100 to 200.
                    Assuming, on these grounds, that the number of persons whom a square mile can
                    properly sustain, without generating the pressure of a redundant population, is
                    150 at the latitude of 50°, we have 26 as the sum which expresses the
                    productiveness of this parallel. Then taking, for the sake of simplicity, 35 as
                    the index of the productiveness of the useful soil beyond 30° in America, and 85
                    as that of the country within the parallel of 30° on each side of the equator,
                    we have about 4,100,000 square miles, each capable of supporting 200 persons,
                    and 5,700,000 square miles, each capable of supporting 490 persons. It follows,
                    that if the natural resources of America were fully developed, it would afford
                    sustenance to 3,600,000,000 of inhabitants, a number five times as great as the
                    entire mass of human beings existing at present upon the globe! The novelty of
                    this result may create perplexity and doubt on a first view; but we are
                    satisfied that those who investigate the subject for themselves will be
                    satisfied that our estimate is moderate. But, what is even more
                    surprising,—there is every probability that this prodigious population will be
                    in existence within three or at most four centuries. We are quite aware of the
                    objections which may be raised to this conclusion, but they all seem to us to
                    admit of an answer. In particular, we would observe, that the expense and
                    difficulty of transporting men from situations where they are redundant, to
                    others where vacant space exists, which is so much felt in the old world, will
                    be incredibly facilitated by the employment of steam-navigation upon the
                    innumerable rivers which are ramified over four fifths of the new continent.</p><p>The imagination is lost in contemplating a state of things which will make so
                    great and rapid a change in the condition of the world. We almost fancy that it
                    is a dream; and yet the result is based on principles quite as certain as those
                    which govern the conduct of men in their ordinary pursuits. There are many
                    elements of disorder now operating in Spanish America, but these are merely the
                    dregs left by the old Spanish despotism; and the Anglo-American republic is a
                    pole-star to guide the people in their course towards freedom and prosperity.
                    Nearly all social improvements spring from the reciprocal influence of condensed
                    numbers and diffused intelligence. What, then, will be the state of society in
                    America two <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038272" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8272-0651"/>centuries hence, when a thousand or two thousand
                    millions of civilized men are crowded into a space <hi rend="italic">comparatively</hi> so narrow, and when this immense mass of human beings speak
                    only two languages! We take for granted that the Portuguese will merge into the
                    Spanish; and it is dear to us that the Russian will never obtain a footing in
                    the new world. Such a state of things may be said to undo the curse of Babel,
                    and restore the great mass of mankind to their pristine facility of intercourse;
                    for the languages spoken by the communities of Europe and Asia will be as
                    unimportant then, in the general scale of the globe, as the dialects of Hungary,
                    Finland, and Bohemia, are in Europe at this day. History shows that wealth,
                    power, science, literature, all follow in the train of numbers, general
                    intelligence, and freedom. The same causes which transferred the sceptre of
                    civilisation from the banks of the Euphrates and the Nile to western Europe,
                    must, in the course of no long period, carry it from the latter to the plains of
                    the Mississippi and the Amazon. When we reflect on these changes, which are not
                    more extraordinary than they are near and certain, the conviction is forced upon
                    us, that society, after all its advances, is yet but in its infancy; that the
                    habitable world, when its productive powers are regarded, may be said hitherto
                    to have been an untenanted waste; and that we have at present only an imperfect
                    glimpse of the state of things under which the true destiny of man, and the
                    grand scheme of providence in this lower world, is to receive its full
                    development. We are quite aware that some will smile at these speculations; but
                    if any one suspects us of drawing on our fancy, we would just request him to
                    examine thoroughly the condition and past progress of the North American
                    republic. Let him look at its amazing strides in wealth, intelligence, and
                    social improvement; at its indestructible liberty; and, above all, at the
                    prodigious growth of its population; and let him answer the question to himself,
                    “what power can stop the tide of civilisation which is pouring from this single
                    source over an unoccupied world ?” Let him trace the laws on which this progress
                    depends, and let him then apply them to unfold the future history of society in
                    the new continent.</p><p>The project of joining the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by a canal carried across
                    the narrow part of the American continent, has often excited the attention of
                    statesmen and commercial men. This canal, if executed upon a scale sufficient to
                    admit vessels of 300 or 400 tons, would have a powerful influence upon the fate
                    of America. For all the purposes of commercial intercourse it would bring the
                    east and west sides of the continent within one third part of their present
                    distance from one another; and would be of even more advantage to the new world
                    than the discovery of the passage to India by the Cape has been to the old. With
                    regard to the practicability of the scheme, we want precise data; but some rays
                    of light have been thrown upon it by Humboldt, whose mighty genius has so often
                    extracted valuable results from very imperfect materials. There are five points
                    which have been supposed to offer facilities for the execution of the plan.</p><p>1. The isthmus of Tehuantepec, in Mexico at 95° of west longitude. The breadth of
                    the continent here is 140 English miles; but the ground is low; and two streams,
                    the rivers del Passo and Chimalapa, flowing to the opposite seas, could be
                    rendered navigable for small vessels so far into the interior, that, according
                    to the report of two Spanish engineers, a canal of seven leagues would complete
                    the navigation from the one sea to the other.</p><p>2. The lake of Nicaragua, at 85° west longitude," is connected with the Atlantic
                    by the river San Juan, and is divided from the Pacific only by a narrow tract of
                    ground, the precise nature of which was unknown, till Mr Thompson, British envoy
                    to Guatemala, published the details of a rude survey carried across it by a
                    Spanish engineer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thompson’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of an Official Visit to
                    Guatemala,</hi> Appendix.</p></note> From this survey, it appears that the
                    distance between the lake and the South Sea, along the line considered most
                    suitable for a canal, is 32,687 Spanish yards, or 17 English miles. The summit
                    level, or the highest part of the land which the canal would pass over, seems to
                    be 150 feet above the lake, or 270 above the sea. The river San Juan, flowing
                    from the lake to the Atlantic, is said by Mr Davis Robinson to be navigable for
                    sloops through its whole length; and in the lake there is depth of water for
                    vessels of any size. The execution of the canal across the isthmus of 17 miles,
                    into the gulf of Papagayo, would apparently be attended with no serious
                    difficulty. This is, in short, the spot where nature, by doing so much, seems to
                    hold out to man the strongest inducements to complete her work. Judging from the
                    best maps, the length of the inland navigation here would be,—</p><table cols="2"><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1">English Miles.</cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1">From the Atlantic to the lake through the river San Juan</cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1">90</cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1">Through the lake to the head of the canal</cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1">60</cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1">The canal</cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1">17</cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1">167</cell></row></table><p>In 1824 three companies in England, Holland, and the United States, were on terms
                    with the government of Guatemala for executing this canal; but the scheme fell
                    to the ground, like a multitude of others created during the speculating mania
                    of that period; and the unsettled state of all the new republics must for the
                    present discourage any private association from advancing money upon the
                    guarantee of their rulers.</p><p>3. The isthmus of Panama. Levels were carried across this isthmus in 1828 and
                    1829 by Mr Lloyd and Mr Falmarc, under orders from Bolivar; and an account of
                    the result was read to the Royal Society of London in the winter of 1829. The
                    line of the survey extended from Panama in a north-west direction, along the Rio
                    Chagres to its mouth, and the highest point of the ground crossed was found to
                    be 633⅓ English feet above the sea. The mean difference of level between the
                    Atlantic and Pacific seas here was found to be very trifling, as Humboldt
                    conjectured, the former being only 3ļ feet higher than the latter. It is
                    obvious, that though a railway with inclined planes might be advantageous at
                    this spot, a canal is out of the question.</p><p>4. The river Atrato, which flows northward into the gulf of Darien (long. 77. W.)
                    affords two lines of communication with the Pacific. One of these is by the
                    Naipi, which rises six leagues or 20 miles from the port of Cupica, on the
                    Pacific Ocean (lat. 7. 15. N.) Humboldt was informed that the chain of hills
                    almost disappears here, and that, either by a tract of low country or a pass, an
                    easy communication exists between the shores of the South Sea and the Atrato,
                    which is navigable for boats much farther south than the Naipi. .Captain
                    Cochrane, however, learned from Major Alvarez (<hi rend="italic">Travels in
                    Colombia),</hi> that the Naipi is full of bars, and that the isthmus between the
                    river and the coast is traversed by three ranges of hills. The length of the
                    line of communication here would be at least 120 miles.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193038285" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8285-0652"/><p>5. The second line of communication afforded by the Atrato conducts to the
                    Pacific Ocean by the river San Juan, at 4° of north latitude. The upper branches
                    of the two rivers approach within a distance of 10 or 12 miles of each other, at
                    the 6th degree of north latitude. Being both navigable for boats, and the
                    intervening space forming a quebrada or ravine, the priest of the neighbouring
                    village of Novita induced his parishioners to dig a canal connecting the one
                    stream with the other. Through this channel boats loaded with cocoa have
                    occasionally passed from sea to sea since 1788. The length of the line of
                    communication, however, would be about 350 miles. A line of <hi rend="italic">boat</hi> navigation could probably be established at this place much more
                    easily than at any other; but, to render a canal in Central America useful on a
                    great scale, it must be what Humboldt calls “a canal of oceanic navigation.” It
                    must admit ships large enough to carry on trade advantageously in the main
                    ocean—ships of 300 or 400 tons, drawing 16 or 17 feet of water. From the
                    imperfect accounts we possess of the different lines, our belief is, that the
                    facilities for forming such a canal are much greater at Nicaragua than any where
                    else.</p><p>The opinion entertained in the infancy of natural history, that all the larger
                    animals had spread from one common centre, to the different countries where we
                    find them, is, we believe, now abandoned by all scientific writers. It is found
                    that every region of the globe, separated from others by well-marked boundaries,
                    or by contrasted climates, has plants and animals peculiar to itself. The vast
                    multitude of facts now ascertained respecting the distribution of animals can be
                    explained on no hypothesis but one. We are forced to infer, that after the last
                    catastrophe which destroyed the living beings inhabiting the earth, a great
                    variety of new animal tribes were created; that each was placed on the spot to
                    which its powers and functions were best adapted; and that from this as a
                    centre, it was left to spread by such means of locomotion as nature had provided
                    it with. Some birds, for instance, strong of wing, and some few quadrupeds of
                    migratory habits, are diffused from the west coast of Europe to the east coast
                    of Asia; while many others, which, from their mode of life or their small size,
                    were ill fitted for travelling, are confined within a very narrow space. Where
                    wild animals, resembling each other, exist in regions distant and entirely
                    separated, it is found that they are not of the same species, but are
                    corresponding species belonging to the same genus. The horse, the ox, the
                    antelope, the elephant, and the rhinoceros of Asia, are distinct species from
                    those of southern Africa, where the same genera exist. This hypothesis, as Dr
                    Prichard remarks, does not contradict the testimony of the Scriptures; it merely
                    assumes that there were animals created subsequent to the deluge in various
                    parts of the earth, of which it was not necessary for the sacred historian to
                    speak. Noah was shut up in the ark with the animals peculiar to the region in
                    which the antediluvian race of mankind resided, and what is recorded respecting
                    them is no doubt literally true; but it does not follow that other animals,
                    suited to the new condition of the various parts of the globe, were not created,
                    because Moses, who probably was not informed of the fact, has not mentioned
                    it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prichard’s <hi rend="italic">Researches,</hi> vol. i. p. 82.</p></note></p><p>When this point is admitted, we are saved from the difficulty of explaining how
                    animals which can only live in a warm climate should have wandered from Armenia
                    through the frozen regions of northern Asia and America, and fixed themselves in
                    the plains of the Amazon or the Plata, without being found anywhere in the
                    intermediate space. No well-informed naturalist doubts now that most of the
                    animal tribes of the new world were created in or near the spots where we find
                    them, and never existed in Armenia, or any other part of the old continent. This
                    conclusion is confirmed by the only fact which presents an apparent exception to
                    it, namely, that the few species of quadrupeds common to the old and the new
                    world belong to the arctic region, and to tribes which are capable of bearing
                    such a degree of cold as exists at Behring’s Straits.</p><p>Buffon’s observation is substantially true, that America wants the larger and the
                    more perfect classes of animals. There are no congeners there to the elephant,
                    the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the camelopard, the camel, and the horse. The
                    species corresponding to the lion, the tiger, and the hyena of the old world,
                    are much less distinguished by their strength and ferocity. On the other hand,
                    most of those singular races which display the widest deviation from the usual
                    laws of organization, are found in America, and some are peculiar to it; but
                    nothing can be more wild than the inference drawn from these facts, that the
                    inferior size or fierceness of the American animals arose from some peculiarity
                    in the soil or climate.</p><p>The class Mammalia in <hi rend="italic">North</hi> America, so far as it is
                    known, includes 118 quadrupeds and 28 cetacea, which are arranged thus :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carnivora</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>60</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Glires</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>37</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Edentata</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Pachydermata</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Ruminantia</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>13</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Cetacea</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>28</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>146</p></cell></row></table><p>Of these, 21 species (excluding those in the fossil state), are said to be common

                    demonstrate that some of these animals are merely congeners, and not strictly of

                    wished that some learned naturalist would favour the world with a systematic
                    view of the whole zoology of the new world. As we possess neither skill nor
                    materials for the completion of such a task, we shall content ourselves here
                    with copying the following table of American quadrupeds, compiled from the works
                    of Acosta, Buffon, and other older naturalists, though it is very defective, and
                    not correct in some of its denominations. In treating of the separate parts of
                    the new continent, we hope to be able to do more justice to the subject of
                    natural history.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We

                    old continent, the mammoth or <hi rend="italic">mastodon giganteum.</hi> The
                    bones of this animal, in a very perfect state (and in the extreme north
                    sometimes covered with flesh), have been found in great quantities all over
                    North America and Siberia, and as far south and west as Spain. According to
                    Cuvier, it was fifteen or eighteen feet high, and was covered with coarse red
                    wool, and long stiff black hairs which formed a mane along its back. Its
                    enormous tusks were implanted in alveolae longer than those of the elephant of
                    the present day, but in other respects it was pretty similar to the Indian
                    elephant. It lived on vegetable food, chiefly, it is supposed, on the leaves and
                    tender branches of young trees. Remains of this species are found in abundance
                    beneath the surface of dried marshes along the banks of the great rivers the
                    Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Hudson, &amp;c. It has not been found in South
                    America; but the bones of other species belonging to the same genus, and of
                    smaller size, have been met with in the plains of La Plata.</p><p>It is remarked by Azara, that single species of wild animals are diffused over a
                    much wider surface in the new world than in the old. The cougar, jaguar, and
                    tapir, for instance, are found from the banks of the Plata to those of the Rio
                    del Norte in Mexico This circumstance strengthens the conclusion, that America
                    derived its human inhabitants from the old continent, and remained, of course
                    for a much longer period, entirely in possession of the animal tribes; and
                    further, that, in the former, civilisation (such as it was) arose only at a late
                    period.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Αzara</hi>, French translation.. Preface, p. 50.</p></note></p><p>The European animals which have been naturalized in America are the cow, horse,
                    ass, hog, sheep, goat, dog; and these have multiplied to such a degree as to
                    exceed the native quadrupeds greatly in numbers. The warm climate of the
                    tropical parts of America has produced considerable changes in the habits and
                    physical qualities of most of these species. The hog, which generally wanders in
                    the woods, and lives on the wild fruits and roots found there, has lost in a
                    great measure its domestic habits, and assumed the character of the wild boar.
                    The black-cattle also, roaming at large in a country entirely uninclosed, are
                    found to fall off unless they receive a certain quantity of salt in their food,
                    which in some cases they procure from plants, in others from brackish water. By
                    distributing salt to them ata certain regular hour, they are taught to assemble
                    at the owner’s residence, and are thus kept from becoming wild. In Europe the
                    constant practice of milking cows has enlarged the udder greatly beyond its
                    natural size, and so changed the secretions, that the supply does not cease when
                    the calf is removed. In Colombia, where circumstances are entirely different,
                    nature shows a strong tendency to resume its original type. A cow gives milk
                    there only while the calf is with her. It must be allowed to suck during the
                    day, and the fluid is procured only by separating them during the night, and
                    milking the cow in the morning before the calf visits her. The ass has undergone
                    little alteration in America, and it has nowhere become wild. It is otherwise
                    with the horse. Numbers of these animals in a wild state exist in Colombia, and
                    many other parts of America, both South and North, where they wander over the
                    plains and savannahs in troops. It is observed that the colour of animals living
                    in this state returns to that bay chesnut which is considered as characteristic
                    of the natural wild horse. It is worthy of notice, that the amble, the pace to
                    which the domestic horse in Spanish America is exclusively trained, becomes in
                    the course of some generations hereditary, and is assumed by the young ones
                    without teaching. The sheep thrives and multiplies in the temperate parts of the
                    new world, and shows no tendency to withdraw from the protection of man; but in
                    the warm regions it undergoes a remarkable change. If the lamb is shorn at the
                    usual time, its wool is of the same description as in Europe, and it will grow
                    again in the same way; but if it is suffered to remain on the animal’s body
                    after the proper season for cutting, it thickens, felts together, and detaches
                    itself, and then is succeeded by a short close shining hair, very like that of
                    the goat in the same climate. The goat in Colombia has <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038311" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8311-0654"/>the size of its
                    udder contracted, and undergoes a change similar to that which is experienced by
                    the cow.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Sur</hi><hi rend="italic">les Changemens</hi><hi rend="italic">survenus,</hi> &amp;c. par Μ. Roulin, en <hi rend="italic">Bulletin des
