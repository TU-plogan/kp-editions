                <p><label type="entry">SAHARA, or the <hi rend="smallcaps">Great
                    Desert</hi></label>, an immense tract of territory in Northern and Central
                    Africa, the most desolate and terrible on the face of the globe. It is bounded
                    on the north by the Barbary States; on the south by Soudan, or the countries
                    watered by the upper course of the Niger, and by the Lower Senegal; and on the
                    east it commences near the left bank of the Nile, and stretches westward to the
                    shores of the North Atlantic Ocean, being nearly the whole breadth of Africa.
                    Its actual extent may be stated as from the fifteenth to the thirtieth parallels
                    of north latitude, and from the thirtieth of east to the fifteenth of west
                    longitude. Its length is thus about three thousand miles, and its breadth is in
                    some parts above a thousand miles. It is by many degrees the largest desert to
                    be found in any part of the world, and it occupies about one fifth of the
                    surface of this part of the globe. Sahara seems to be a table-land little raised
                    above the level of the sea, covered with moving sands, and here and there
                    containing some rocky heights, and valleys, or oases, where the water collects
                    and nourishes thorny shrubs, ferns, and grass. From the defective cultivation of
                    the surrounding countries, and the influence of the prevailing winds, the desert
                    has always been gaining ground, so that in the east some of the Egyptian
                    monuments of antiquity, which at the time of their erection were no doubt
                    unencumbered by the sand, even at their bases, are now covered with it. In the
                    south, likewise, it has encroached on the banks of the Niger and the Senegal;
                    and on the north and north-west the southern provinces of Morocco have been
                    partly usurped by it, so that the streams descending from the Atlas Mountains
                    are either drunk up, or have their courses diverted so as to be rendered
                    comparatively useless; while in the west it has, in some parts, extended a
                    hundred miles into the sea, forming immense sandbanks, destructive to the
                    formation of landing-places. The mountains along the Atlantic Ocean are in no
                    continued chain, but rise up in isolated peaks, and through the open spaces
                    between them the sand is drifted by the winds. Towards the interior they again
                    lose themselves in a plain covered with white and sharp pebbles. From being
                    frequently shifted by winds, the sand extends over the vast plain in a billowy
                    or undulating manner, like the sea when agitated. In its nature it is quartzy
                    and calcareous. The solid fixed rocks which occasionally rise above this mobile
                    surface are sometimes extensive enough to form tracts of country. In the eastern
                    part of the Sahara, the rocks are principally secondary, and for the most part
                    limestone, sandstone, gypsum, and rock-salt, which occasionally appear to be
                    traversed by trap-rocks. At Tegazza, and some other places, a sal-gem, whiter
                    than the purest marble, lies in extensive strata under a bed of rock. Golberry
                    informs us, that on its southern margin he found masses of native iron. The
                    waters of the lakes which here and there occur in the desert are in some
                    instances impregnated with carbonate of soda, in others with muriate of soda or
                    common salt, forming the natron and salt lakes of travellers. The rocks on the
                    seacoast of the Sahara, and the islands that lie along it, are said to be
                    principally composed of igneous rock, and chiefly basalt.</p>
                <p>The principal production of Sahara is mineral salt, which, in many places, covers
                    the surface in white glittering crystals, so that at a distance they appear to
                    be rugged fields of snow or ice. This salt constitutes the staple article of the
                    trade of Soudan, and Timbuctoo is indebted to this product of the waste for its
                    existence as well as its prosperity.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable feature of this desolate ocean of sand consists in the oases
                    or verdant islands which, at distant and dreary intervals, agreeably break its
                    appaling uniformity. These are formed by springs, which, fed by distant
                    mountains, burst forth amidst the desert solitudes, and, diffusing a partial
                    verdure and fertility, form a strikingly beautiful contrast with the surrounding
                    desolation. They are embellished with flowering shrubs of peculiar beauty. An
                    aromatic plant resembling thyme, the same which bears the grains of zahara,
                    acacias and other thorny shrubs, nettles, and brambles, constitute the ordinary
                    vegetation of these places. Whole tracts are covered with forests of acacia,
                    from which rich gums distil their odours; and groves of the date and lotus also
                    occur, but more rarely. The fruits and berries which they yield constitute the
                    food of whole tribes of men, while the verdure affords a support for animals
                    chiefly of the antelope species. But lions, panthers, and serpents of enormous
                    size, sometimes augment the horrors of these frightful solitudes. Ravens and
                    other birds of prey are likewise often seen hovering over the track of the
                    caravan, ready to dispute with the Moorish dogs for the carcasses of those who
                    have perished in the desert. These oases are frequented by numerous flocks of
                    ostriches, which feed on snails, lizards, and some coarse plants. For a great
                    part of the year the dry and heated air has the appearance of a reddish vapour,
                    and the horizon looks like the fire of a series of volcanoes. The rain, which
                    descends from July to October or November, does not extend its precarious and
                    momentary blessing to all the districts. In some of them rain does not fall for
                    years together, on which occasions the springs also dry up, and a frightful want
                    of water ensues, which drives men and animals to despair. The air during the day
                    is oppressively hot, without a cloud to mitigate the glowing sunshine; and
                    during the night it is disproportion-ally cool. The natural magic of the <hi

                    often exhibited to the eye of the parched traveller, is pro-vokingly deceptive.
                    Sometimes he sees in the distance what appears almost beyond question to be a
                    sheet of water glittering in the sunbeams. He hastens forward, in hopes of soon
                    allaying his thirst at the welcome lake; but his efforts to reach it are as vain
                    as those of the child to clasp the rainbow. Still his fainting steps pursue, for
                    still the imaginary lake lies before him as lovely and alluring, but as distant,
                    as ever.</p>
                <p>It is of course only on the borders of the Sahara that oases on a great scale
                    occur. In the eastern part they are extensive enough to form small kingdoms,
                    generally dependent on some more powerful neighbour. In other parts,
                    particularly the western, they consist merely of one or more detached villages,
                    serving as emporia for the trade carried on by the caravans. And sometimes,
                    especially as we penetrate into the interior of the desert, the oases are merely
                    springs which nourish too scanty a vegetation to admit of inhabitants settling
                    there, but affording supplies of water to the caravans, whose route is
                    determined by the situation of these fountains. Dreary and encompassed with
                    dangers as such abodes must be, every spot on which inhabitants can subsist is
                    occupied; and notwithstanding the perils and sufferings of such travelling,
                    regular journeys are performed across the whole breadth of this desolate region,
                    from Morocco on the north to Timbuctoo on the south. The only animal fitted for
                    traversing these solitudes as a beast of burden is the camel, which with equal
                    truth and beauty has been designated the ship of the desert. By its patience of
                    hunger and fatigue, by the provision which has been made for its carrying a
                    large supply of water, and by the structure of its hoof, so formed as to glide
                    smoothly over the level sand, it seems expressly designed by nature as a means
                    of communication across these immense wastes The merchandise which they convey
                    is firmly secured on their backs by means of creels and otherwise; and for the
                    sake of mutual aid and defence, as well as to relieve the tedium of the route,
                    they proceed in large bodies, occasionally amounting to the number of two
                    thousand. The trade is carried on by merchants inured from their infancy to the
                    hardships which attend such journeys. Their food consists of the milk of the
                    camel, with barley-meal or Indian com, and a few dates, although the more
                    opulent carry dried flesh and coffee. Water is conveyed in goat-skins, covered
                    with tar for the purpose of preventing evaporation. The caravans, or akkabahs,
                    as the Moors call them, do not proceed in a straight line to their journey’s
                    end, but turn in various directions according to the position of the different
                    oases. At each of these the travellers rest and refresh themselves for a day or
                    two, and take in supplies of water. Two great evils are encountered in crossing
                    the desert. The first and most terrible is, when from a peculiarly dry season
                    one or more of the springs happens to fail; and the second is the burning wind,
                    called the samoom, shoom, or simoom. Less than half a century ago a caravan
                    consisting of two thousand persons and eighteen hundred camels, not finding
                    water at the usual places, perished utterly, both men and animals. The vehemence
                    of the wind, which is more like the breath of a furnace than the natural
                    commotion of the atmosphere, raises and rolls before it the waves of red sand,
                    causing the desert so much to resemble a stormy sea, that the Arabs have given
                    it the name of “Bahar billa-maia,” or waterless sea.</p>
                <p>Major Denham relatés an instance of the terrible effects of the simoom. “The
                    overpowering effect of a sudden sand-wind, when nearly at the close of the
                    desert, often destroys a whole kafila, already weakened with fatigue. The spot
                    was pointed out to us, strewed with bones and dried carcasses, where, the year
                    before, fifty sheep, two camels, and two men, perished from thirst and fatigue,
                    when within eight hours’ march of the well which we were anxiously looking
                    for.”</p>
                <p>Captain Lyon thus describes the appearance of these dead bodies: “We observed
                    many skeletons of animals which had died of fatigue on the desert, and
                    occasionally the grave of some human being. All these bodies were so dried by
                    the extreme heat of the sun, that putrefaction did not appear to have taken
                    place after death. In recently dead animals I could not perceive the slightest
                    offensive smell; and in those long dead, the skin, with the hair on it, remained
                    unbroken and perfect, although so brittle as to break with a slight blow. The
                    sand-winds never cause these carcasses to change their places, as in a short
                    time a slight mound is formed round them, and they become stationary.” The fact
                    here noticed of the preservation of the dead bodies in the sand has been
                    observed in other parts of the world, for instance in South America. It appears
                    that the heat of the sun rapidly exhales the natural juices, which prevents the
                    usual process of putrefaction from going on, and thus the carcass is parched
                    into something resembling the well-known mummy of Egypt.</p>
                <p>The merchants possess some knowledge of the heavenly bodies, and direct their
                    course by the polar star, often preferring to travel during the clear nights of
                    these climates rather than brave the scorching heat of a tropical sun. This
                    nocturnal travelling, however, has its inconveniences, so that the most part of
                    the journey is performed during the day. The camel-drivers sing as they go
                    along; and as they approach houses, or when the camels seem in danger of
                    dropping down with fatigue, their songs acquire additional spirit and
                    expression, which is said to have the intended effect upon the animals. At four
                    o’clock in the afternoon they pitch their tents and join in prayer. Supper
                    follows this act of devotion, after which they sit down in a circle and converse
                    or recite stories until sleep closes their eyes, and the perils of the desert
                    are forgotten in its unconsciousness.</p>
                <p>The coast of Sahara contains some harbours and roadsteads. Those of Rio-do-Ouro
                    and of St Cyprian are formed by large creeks, resembling the mouths of rivers.
                    The Gulf of Ardum, and the Portendic Road, have often been visited by Europeans.
                    On the same line are Cape Boja-dore and Cape Blanco, which latter is supposed to
                    mark the limit of the discoveries of the Carthaginians. At Hoden, Tisheet or
                    Tegazza, and Taudeny, in the western region of Sahara, are extensive mines of
                    rock-salt, an article which is wanting in the populous regions of Central
                    Africa, and is consequently in great demand in those quarters. One of the
                    principal dépôts of salt is Walet, which, by this article, is rendered a place
                    second in importance only to Timbuctoo. Aroun, also, in the very centre of the
                    desert, has become a place of some importance, containing three thousand
                    inhabitants, chiefly by this trade and the passage of caravans. In the heart of
                    Sahara, between Gadamis and Timbuctoo, is the district of Suat or Tuat,
                    inhabited by a mixture of Arabs and Tuaricks, in no respect superior to the rest
                    of the desert tribes. Aghably and Ain-el-Salah, their chief towns, are
                    frequented as caravan stations, <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. r. r.)</hi></p>
