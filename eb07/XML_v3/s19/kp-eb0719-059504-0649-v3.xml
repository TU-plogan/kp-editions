                    from all his works which he had created. From that time the seventh day seems to
                    have been set apart for religious services; and, in consequence of a particular
                    injunction, it was afterwards observed by the Hebrews as a holiday. They were
                    commanded to set it apart for sacred purposes in honour of the creation, and
                    likewise in memorial of their own redemption from Egyptian bondage.</p><p>The importance of the institution may be gathered from the different laws
                    respecting it. When the ten commandments were published from Mount Sinai in
                    tremendous pomp, the law of the Sabbath held a place in what is commonly called
                    the first table; and by subsequent statutes the violation of it was to be
                    punished with death. Six days were allowed for the use and service of man; but
                    the seventh day God reserved to himself, and appointed it to be observed as a
                    stated time for holy offices, and to be spent in the duties of piety and
                    devotion. On this day the ministers of the temple entered upon their week; and
                    those who had attended on the temple service the preceding week went out at the
                    same time. New loaves of shew-bread were placed upon the golden table, and the
                    old ones were taken away. Two lambs were offered for a burnt-offering, together
                    with a certain proportion of fine flour, mingled with oil, for a bread offering,
                    and wine for a libation. The Sabbath, like all other festivals, was celebrated
                    from evening to evening. It began at six in the evening on Friday, and ended at
                    the same time the next day.</p><p>Concerning the time at which the Sabbath was first instituted, different opinions
                    have been held. Some have maintained, that the sanctification of the seventh
                    day, mentioned in Genesis ii., is only there spoken of as <hi rend="italic">b∣α</hi> irjoλs∙ψ∕r, or by anticipation; and is to be understood of the Sabbath
                    afterwards enjoined the children of Israel at the commencement of the Mosaic
                    dispensation. But without entering into a particular examination of all the
                    arguments produced in support of this opinion, a few observations, it is
                    presumed, will be sufficient to show that it rests upon no solid foundation.</p><p>It cannot easily be supposed that the inspired penman would have mentioned the
                    sanctification of the seventh day amongst the primeval transactions, if such
                    sanctification had not taken place until 2500 years afterwards. Writers,
                    ambitious of that artificial elegance which the rules of criticism have
                    established, often bring together in their narrative events which were
                    themselves far distant, for the sake of giving form to their discourse; but
                    Moses appears to have despised all such flimsy refinements, and to have
                    constructed his narrative in conformity to the series of events.</p><p>From the accounts we have of the religious service practised in the patriarchal
                    age, it appears that, immediately after the fall, when Adam was restored to
                    favour through a Mediator, a stated form of public worship was instituted, which
                    man was required to observe, in testimony, not only of his dependence on the
                    Creator, but also of his faith and hope in the promise made to our first
                    parents, and seen by them afar off. Of an institution, then, so grand and
                    important, no circumstance would be omitted that is necessary to preserve it, or
                    that contributes to render the observance of it regular and solemn.</p><p>That determined times are necessary for the due celebra-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=650" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0650-0596"/>
                    tion of divine service, cannot be denied. Such is the constitution of man, that
                    he must have particular times set apart for particular services. He is doomed to
                    toil and labour, to earn his bread with the sweat of his brow; and is capable of
                    performing religious duties only in such a manner as is consistent with his
                    situation in the world. If stated times for religious solemnities had not been
                    enjoined, the consequence would have been, that such solemnities would have been
                    altogether neglected; for experience shows, that if mankind were left at liberty
                    when and how often they should perform religious offices, these offices would
                    not be performed at all. It is the observation of holy times that preserves the
                    practice of holy services; and without the frequent and regular returns of
                    hallowed days, man would quickly forget the duty which he owes to God, and in a
                    short time no vestige of religion would be found in the world.</p><p>Among the ordinances which God vouchsafed his ancient people, we find that the
                    pious observation of holidays was particularly insisted upon; and the Sabbath
                    was enjoined to be kept holy, in the most solemn manner, and under the severest
                    penalties. Can it then be supposed that He would suffer mankind, from the
                    creation of the world to the era of Moses, to remain without an institution so
                    expedient in itself, and as well fitted to answer the end proposed by it under
                    the one dispensation, as ever it could be under the other? No. We have every
                    imaginable reason to conclude, that when religious services were enjoined,
                    religious times were appointed also; for the one necessarily implies the
                    other.</p><p>It is not an objection to the early institution of the Sabbath that there is no
                    mention of it in the patriarchal age. It would have swelled the Bible to a most
                    enormous size had the sacred historian given a particular account of all the
                    transactions of those times; and, besides, it would have answered no end. When
                    Moses wrote the book of Genesis, it was unnecessary to relate minutely
                    transactions and institutions already well known by tradition. Accordingly we
                    see that his narrative is everywhere very concise, and calculated only to
                    preserve the memory of the most important facts. However, if we take a view of
                    the church-service of the patriarchal age, we shall find that what is called the
                    legal dispensation, at least the liturgie part of it, was no new system, but a
                    collection of institutions observed from the beginning, and republished in form
                    by Moses. The Scriptures inform us that Cain and Abel offered sacrifices; and
                    the account which is given of the acceptance of the one, and the rejection of
                    the other, evidently shows that stated laws respecting the service had then
                    taken place. “In process of time,” at the end of the days, “Abel brought an
                    offering.” Here was priest, altar, matter of sacrifice, appointed time, motive
                    to sacrifice, and atonement made, and accepted. The distinction of animals into
                    clean and unclean before the Flood, and Noah’s sacrifice immediately after his
                    deliverance, without any new direction, is an unanswerable proof of the same
                    truth. It is testified of Abraham, by God himself, that he kept his charge, his
                    commandments, his statutes, and his laws. These expressions comprehend the
                    various branches into which the law given at Sinai was divided. They contain the
                    moral precepts, affirmative and negative, the matter of religious service, a
                    body of laws to direct obedience, and to which man was to conform his conduct in
                    every part of duty. Agreeably to this, we find that sacrifices were offered,
                    altars and places of worship consecrated, and the Sabbath also mentioned as a
                    well-known solemnity, before the promulgation of the law. It is expressly taken
                    notice of at the fall of manna; and the incidental manner in which it is then
                    mentioned is a convincing proof that the Israelites were no strangers to the
                    insti tution. For had it been a new one, it must have been enjoined in a
                    positive and particular manner, and the nature of it must have been laid open
                    and explained, otherwise the term would have conveyed no meaning.</p><p>The division of time into weeks, or periods of seven days, which obtained so
                    early and almost universally, is a strong indication that one day in seven was
                    always distinguished in a particular manner. <hi rend="italic">Weck,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>שכע, <hi rend="italic">seven.</hi></p></note><hi rend="italic">'</hi> and <hi rend="italic">seven
                    days,</hi> are in scripture language synonymous terms. God commanded Noah, seven
                    days before he entered the ark, to introduce into it all sorts of living
                    creatures. When the waters of the Flood began to abate, Noah sent forth a dove,
                    which, finding no rest for the sole of her foot, returned to him. After seven
                    days he sent forth the dove a second time, and again she returned to the ark. At
                    the expiration of other seven days he let go the dove a third time; and a week
                    is spoken of (Gen. xxix.) as a well-known period of time.</p><p>This septenary division of time has, from the earliest ages, been uniformly
                    observed over all the eastern world. The Israelites, Assyrians, Egyptians,
                    Indians, Arabians, and Persians, have always made use of a week, consisting of
                    seven days. Many vain attempts have been made to account for this uniformity;
                    but a practice so general and prevalent could never have taken place had not the
                    septenary distribution of time been instituted from the beginning, and handed
                    down by tradition.</p><p>From the same source also must the ancient heathens have derived their notions of
                    the sacredness of the seventh day. That they had such notions of it is evident
                    from several passages of the Greek poets quoted by Aristobulus, a learned Jew,
                    by Clement of Alexandria, and Eusebius.</p><p><hi rend="italic">iζi.μr∣, itς.. hμxζ,</hi></p><p>The seventh, the <hi rend="italic">sacred</hi> day.</p><p>'EC‰ <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> usra 5' l&lt;ι,ra <hi rend="italic">κxrtιλυrt.,

                    ii. p. 60.</p></note> with such evidence as to enforce conviction. The
                    Pythagoreans call it the venerable number, &lt;rsCαcχκ)u <hi rend="italic">άξιο;,</hi> worthy of veneration, and held it to be perfect and most proper to
                    religion. They denominated it fortune, and also styled it voice, sound, muse,
                    because, no doubt, seven distinct notes comprehend the whole scale of music,
                    beyond which neither voice nor instrument can go, but must return from the
                    seventh, and begin again anew. They likewise designed it reλt&lt;rpojoς, leading
                    to the end. Seven, in the Hebrew language, is expressed by a word that primarily
                    signifies fulness, completion, sufficiency, and is applied to a week, or seven
                    days, because that was the full time employed in the work of creation; to the
                    Sabbath, because on it all things were completed; and to an oath, because it is
                    sufficient to put an end to all strife. This opening of the Hebrew root will
                    enable us to come at the meaning of those expressions of the heathens, and also
                    let us see whence they derived their ideas and modes of speaking, and that the
                    knowledge of the transactions at the creation, though much perverted, was never
                    entirely lost by them.</p><p>It has been supposed by some, that the heathens borrowed the notion of the
                    sacredness of the seventh day from the Jews. But this opinion will not readily
                    be admitted, when it is considered that the Jews were held in the greatest
                    con-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=651" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0651-0597"/> tempt by the surrounding nations, who derided
                    them no less for their sabbaths than for their circumcision. All sorts of
                    writers ridiculed them on this account. Seneca charged them with spending the
                    seventh part of their time in sloth. Tacitus said, that not only the seventh
                    day, but also the seventh year, was unprofitably wasted. Juvenal brings forward
                    the same charge; and Persius upbraided them with their <hi rend="italic">recutita sabbata.</hi> Plutarch said that they kept it in honour of Bacchus;
                    Tacitus affirmed that it was in honour of Saturn; but the most abominable
                    assertion of all is that of Apion, who said that they observed the Sabbath in
                    memory of their being cured on that day of a shameful disease, called by the
                    Egyptians <hi rend="italic">sabbo.</hi></p><p>Some, perceiving the force of this objection, have contended that time was
                    divided into weeks of seven days, that each of the planetary gods, the Sun,
                    Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, who were the <hi rend="italic">Dii majorum gentium,</hi> might have a day appropriated to his service. But if
                    such was the origin of weeks, how came the great and ancient goddess Tellus to
                    be omitted? She was worshipped by the early idolaters as well as the other
                    planets, and must surely have been deemed by them as worthy of a particular day
                    set apart to her honour as the planet Saturn, who was long undiscovered,
                    afterwards seen but occasionally, and at all times considered as of malign
                    aspect.</p><p>Others have supposed, that as the year was divided into lunar months of something
                    more than twenty-eight days, it was natural to divide the months into quarters
                    from the different phases of the moon, which would produce as many weeks of
                    seven days. But this supposition is less tenable than the former. The phases of
                    the moon are not so precisely marked at the quarters as to attract to them any
                    particular notice; nor are the quarterly appearances of one month commonly like
                    those of another. We cannot, therefore, conceive what should have induced the
                    earliest observers of the phases of the moon to divide the month into four parts
                    rather than into three, or five, or seven. Had the ancient week consisted of
                    fourteen days, it might have been inferred, with some degree of plausibility,
                    that its length was regulated by the phases of the moon, because the shape of
                    that luminary, at the end of the second quarter, is very precisely marked; but
                    there is nothing which, in the present hypothesis, could have everywhere led
                    mankind to make their weeks consist of seven days. This division of time,
                    therefore, can be accounted for only by admitting the primeval institution of
                    the Sabbath, as related by Moses in the book of Genesis. That institution was
                    absolutely necessary to preserve among men a sense of religion; and it was
                    renewed to the Jews at the giving of the law, and its observance enforced by the
                    severest penalties. It was accordingly observed by them with more or less
                    strictness in every part of their commonwealth; and there is none of the
                    institutions of their divine lawgiver which, in their present state of
                    dispersion, they more highly honour. They regard it, indeed, with a
                    superstitious reverence, call it their spouse, their delight, and speak of it in
                    the most magnificent terms. They have often varied in their opinions of the
                    manner in which it ought to be kept. In the time of the Maccabees, they carried
                    their respect for the sabbath so very high, that they would not on that day
                    defend themselves from the attacks of their enemies. But afterwards they did not
                    scruple to stand upon their necessary defence, although they would do nothing to
                    prevent the enemy from carrying on their operations. When our Saviour was on
                    earth, it was no sin to loose a beast from the stall and lead him to water; and
                    if he had chanced to fall into a ditch, they pulled him out. But now it is
                    absolutely unlawful to give a creature in that situation any other assistance
                    than that of f∞d; and if they lead an animal to water, they must take care not
                    to let the bridle or halter hang loose, otherwise they are transgressors.</p><p>As the law enjoins rest on that day from all servile employments, in order to
                    comply with the injunction, they undertake no kind of work on Friday but such as
                    can easily be accomplished before evening. In the afternoon they put into proper
                    places the meat that they have prepared to eat the day following. They
                    afterwards set out a table covered with a clean cloth, and place bread upon it,
                    which they also cover with another cloth; and during the sabbath the table is
                    never moved out of its place. About an hour before sunset, the women light the
                    sabbath lamps, which hang in the places where they eat. They then stretch forth
                    their hands to the light, and pronounce the following benediction. “thessed be
                    thou, O God, king of the world, who hast enjoined us, that are sanctified by thy
                    commandments, to light the sabbath lamp.” These lamps are two or more in number,
                    according to the size of the chamber in which they are suspended, and continue
                    to burn during the greater part of the night. In order to begin the sabbath
                    well, they wash their hands and faces, trim their hair, and pair their nails,
                    beginning at the fourth finger, then going to the second, then the fifth, then
                    the third, and ending with the thumb. If a Jew casts the parings of his nails to
                    the ground, he is <hi rend="italic">raseah,</hi> that is, a wicked man; for
                    Satan has great power over those parings of nails; and it seems they are of
                    great use to the wizards, who know how to employ them in their enchantments. If
                    he buries them in the earth, he is <hi rend="italic">tzedic,</hi> that is, a
                    just man; if he burns them in the fire, he is <hi rend="italic">chesid,</hi>
                    that is, worthy of honour, or an holy man. When they have performed these
                    preparatory ceremonies, they repair to the synagogue, and enter upon their
                    devotions. As soon as prayers begin, the departed souls spring out of the
                    purgatorial flames, and have liberty to cool themselves in water while the
                    sabbath lasts, for which reason the Jews prolong the continuance of it as much
                    as they can; and the rabbin have strictly commanded them not to exhaust all the
                    water on the sabbath day, lest those miserable souls should by these means be
                    deprived of the refreshing element. When they have ended their prayers, they
                    return home, and salute one another, by wishing a good sabbath. They then sit
                    down to table. The master of the family takes a cup full of wine, and lifting up
                    his hand, says, “thessed be thou, O God our Lord, king of the world, who hast
                    created the fruit of the vine. thessed be thou, O God our Lord, king of the
                    world, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and given us thy holy
                    sabbath; and of thy good will and pleasure hast left it to us an inheritance,
                    the memorial of thy works of creation. For it is the beginning of the
                    congregation of saints, and the memorial of the coming out of Egypt. And thou
                    hast also chosen us from all other people, and sanctified us, and with love and
                    pleasure hast left thy holy sabbath an inheritance. thessed be thou, O God, who
                    sanctifiest the sabbath.” After this benediction is ended, he drinks, and gives
                    the cup to all who are present. He then removes the cloth, and taking bread,
                    says, “thessed be thou, O God our Lord, king of the world, who bringest bread
                    out of the earth.” Then he breaks off a bit, and eats, and also gives a piece of
                    it to every one of the company.</p><p>On the morning of the sabbath, the Jews do not rise so early as they do at other
                    times, thinking, the greater pleasure they take on that day, the more devoutly
                    they keep it. When they come into the synagogue, they pray as usual, only the
                    devotions are somewhat longer, being intermingled with psalmody, in honour of
                    the sabbath. The pentateuch is then produced, and seven sections of it are read
                    in order by seven persons chosen for the purpose. Several lessons are likewise
                    read out of the prophets, which have some relation to what was read out of the
                    law. After morning prayers, they return to their houses, and eat the second
                    sabbath-meal, showing every token of joy, in honour of the festival. But if one
                    has seen any thing ominous in his<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=652" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0652-0598"/>
                    sleep; if he has dreamed that he burned the book of the law, that a beam has
                    come out of the walls of his house, or that his teeth have fallen out; then he
                    fasts until very late at night, for all such dreams are bad ones. In the
                    afternoon they go again to the synagogue, and perform the evening service,
                    adding to the ordinary prayers some lessons that respect the sabbath. When the
                    devotional duties are ended, they return home, and light a candle resembling a
                    torch, and again sit down to eat. They remain eating until near six, and then
                    the master of the family takes a cup, and pouring wine into it, rehearses some
                    benedictions; after which he pours a little of the wine upon the ground, and
                    says, “thessed be thou, O Lord, King of the world, who hast created the fruit of
                    the vine.” Then holding the cup in his left hand, with the right he takes a box
                    of sweet spices, and says, “thessed be thou, O Lord God, who hast created
                    various kinds of sweet spices.” He smells the spices, and holds them out to the
                    rest, that they may do the same. He then takes the cup in his right hand, and
                    going to the candle views the left very narrowly, and pronounces a blessing.
                    With the cup in the left hand, he examines the right in the same manner. Again,
                    holding the cup in his right hand, he rehearses another benediction, and at the
                    same time pours some of the wine on the ground. After this he drinks a little of
                    it, and then hands it about to the rest of the family, who finish what remains.
                    In this manner the sabbath is ended by the Jews, and they may return to their
                    ordinary employments. Those who meet pay their compliments, by wishing one
                    another a happy week.</p><p>The rabbin have reckoned up thirty-nine primary prohibitions, which ought to be
                    observed on the sabbatical festival; but their circumstances and dependents,
                    which are also obligatory, are almost innumerable. The thirty-nine articles are,
                    not to till the ground, to sow, to reap, to make hay, to bind up sheaves of
                    corn, to thrash, to winnow, to grind, to sift meal, to knead the dough, to bake,
                    to shear, to whiten, to comb or card wool, to spin, to twine or twist, to warp,
                    to dye, to tie, to untie, to sew, to tear or pull in pieces, to build, to pull
                    down, to beat with a hammer, to hunt or fish, to kill a beast, to flay it, to
                    dress it, to scrape the skin, to tan it, to cut leather, to write, to scratch
                    out, to rule paper for writing, to kindle a fire, to extinguish it, to carry a
                    thing from place to place, and to expose any thing to sale. These are the
                    primary prohibitions, and each of them has its proper consequences, which amount
                    to an incredible number; and the Jews themselves say, that if they could keep
                    but two sabbaths as they ought, they would soon be belivered out of all their
                    troubles.</p><p>If a Jew on a journey is overtaken by the sabbath in a wood or on the highway, no
                    matter where, nor under what circumstances, he sits down, he will not stir out
                    of the spot. If he falls down in the dirt, he lies there; he will not rise up. A
                    fresh wound must not be bound up on the sabbath day. A plaster that had been
                    formerly applied to a sore may remain on it; but if it falls off, it must not be
                    put on anew. The lame may use a staff, but the blind must not. These
                    particulars, and a great many more of the same nature, are observed by the Jews
                    in the strictest manner. But if any one wishes to know more of the practice of
                    that race, he may consult Buxtorf’s <hi rend="italic">Judaica Synagoga</hi>
                    (chap. X. xi.), where he will find a complete detail of their customs and
                    ceremonies on the sabbath, and likewise see the primary prohibitions branched
                    out into their respective circumstances.</p><p>As the seventh day was observed by the Jewish church, in memory of the rest of
                    God after the works of creation, and their own deliverance from Pharaoh’s
                    tyranny; so the first day of the week has always been observed by the Christian
                    church, in memory of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, by which he completed the
                    work of man’s redemp tion upon earth, and rescued him from the dominion of him
                    who has the power of death.</p><p>This day was denominated by the primitive Christians the Lord’s day. It was also
                    sometimes called Sunday, which was the name given to it by the heathens, who
                    dedicated it to the sun. And, indeed, although it was originally called Sunday
                    by the heathens, yet it may very properly retain that name among the Christians,
                    because it is dedicated to the honour of the true light, which lighteth every
                    man that cometh into the world; of Him who is styled by the prophet the Sun of
                    righteousness, and who on this day arose from the dead. But although it was, in
                    the primitive times, indifferently called the Lord’s day or Sunday, yet it was
                    never denominated the sabbath; a name constantly appropriated to Saturday, or
                    the seventh day, both by sacred and ecclesiastical writers.</p><p>Of the change from the seventh to the first day of the week, or even of the
                    institution of the Lord’s day festival, there is no account in the New
                    Testament. However, it may be fairly inferred from it, that the first day of the
                    week was, in the apostolic age, a stated time for public worship. On this day
                    the apostles were assembled, when the Holy Ghost came down so visibly upon them
                    to qualify them for the conversion of the world. On this day we find St Paul
                    preaching at Troas, when the disciples came to break bread; and the directions
                    which the same apostle gives to the Corinthians concerning their contributions
                    for the relief of their suffering brethren, plainly allude to their religious
                    assemblies on the first day of the week.</p><p>Thus it would appear from several passages in the New Testament, that the
                    religious observation of the first day of the week is of apostolical
                    appointment; and may indeed be very reasonably supposed to be amongst those
                    directions and instructions which our blessed Lord himself gave to his disciples
                    during the forty days between his resurrection and ascension, in which he
                    conversed with them, and spoke of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.
                    Still, however, it must be owned that those passages, although the plainest that
                    occur, are not sufficient to prove the apostolical institution of the Lord’s
                    day, or even the actual observation of it. In order, therefore, to place the
                    matter beyond all controversy, recourse must be had to ecclesiastical
                    testimony.</p><p>From the consentient evidence and uniform practice of the primitive church, and
                    also from the attestation of Pliny, we find that the first day of the week was
                    observed in the earliest ages as a holiday or festival, in honour of the
                    resurrection of Christ. Now there are but two sources whence the custom could
                    possibly have arisen. It must have been instituted either by human or divine
                    authority. But by human authority it was not instituted; for there was no
                    general council in those early times, and without the decree of a general
                    council it was impossible that any ecclesiastical institution could have been
                    universally established at once. It remains, therefore, that it must have been
                    instituted by divine authority; and that it really was so, will further appear
                    from the following considerations. It is certain that the apostles travelled
                    over the greatest part of the world, and planted churches in the remotest parts
                    of it. It is certain also that they were all led by the same spirit; and their
                    desire was, that unity and uniformity should be observed in all the churches
                    which they had founded. It is not therefore surprising that, in the primitive
                    times, the same doctrine, the same worship, the same rites and customs, should
                    prevail all over the Christian world; nay, it would have been unaccountable had
                    the case been otherwise. For this reason we may conclude that every custom,
                    universally observed in the early ages of the Christian church, and not
                    instituted by a general council, was of original appointment.</p><p>As the Lord’s day is sanctified, that is, set apart, to Chris-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=653" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0653-0599"/>
                    tians for the worship and service of God, their Creator, Redeemer, and
                    Sanctifier, a little consideration will easily discover how it ought to be
                    observed. Although a day separated from worldly business, yet it is in no sense
                    a day of idleness, but a season appropriated to the works of salvation and
                    labours of charity.</p><p>In the primitive times this holy day was observed in the most solemn manner. From
                    the monuments of those early ages we learn, that it was spent in a due and
                    constant attendance on all the offices of divine worship. On it they held their
                    religious assemblies, in which the writings of the apostles and prophets were
                    read to the people, and the doctrines of Christianity further pressed upon them
                    by the exhortations of the clergy. Solemn prayers and praises were offered up to
                    God, and hymns sung in honour of Christ; the Lord’s supper was constantly
                    celebrated; and collections were made for the maintenance of the clergy and the
                    relief of the poor. On this day they abstained as much as they could from bodily
                    labour. They looked upon it as a day of joy and gladness; and therefore all
                    fasting on it was prohibited, even during the season of Lent, their great annual
                    fast. Such was the zeal of those times, that nothing, no not the severest
                    persecutions, hindered them from celebrating the holy offices on this day. They
                    were often beset and betrayed, and as often slaughtered in consequence of cruel
                    edicts from emperors, those very emperors for whose happiness and prosperity
                    they always offered up their fervent prayers. For this cause, when they could
                    not meet in the day-time, they assembled in the morning before it was light; and
                    when sick, in exile, or in prison, nothing troubled them more than that they
                    could not attend the service of the church. No trivial pretences were then
                    admitted for any one’s absence from public worship; for severe censures were
                    passed upon all who were absent without some urgent necessity. When the empire
                    became Christian, Constantine and his successors made laws for the more solemn
                    observation of the Lord’s day. They prohibited all prosecutions and pleadings,
                    and other juridical matters, to be transacted on it, and also all unnecessary
                    labour; not that it was looked upon as a Jewish sabbath, but because these
                    things were considered as inconsistent with the duties of the festival.</p><p>But although the primitive Christians did not indulge themselves in the practice
                    of unnecessary labour or trifling amusements, yet they did not wholly abstain
                    from working, if great necessity required it. The council of Laodicea enjoined
                    that men should abstain from work on the Lord’s day if possible; but if any were
                    found to Judaize, they were to be censured as great transgressors. So
                    circumspect were the primitive Christians about their conduct on this festival,
                    that on the one hand they avoided all things which tended to profane it, whilst
                    on the other they censured all those who insisted that it should be observed
                    with Pharisaical rigour and devotion.</p><p>The. primary duty of the Lord’s day is public worship. The nature and design of
                    the Christian religion sufficiently shows the necessity and importance of
                    assembling for the duties of devotion. The whole scope of Christianity is to
                    bring us to an union with God, which cannot be obtained or preserved without
                    frequent communications with him; and the reasons which show religious
                    intercourse to be the indispensable duty of Christians in a private capacity,
                    will bind it with equal or more force on them considered as a community.</p><p>The advantages of public worship, when duly performed, are many and great. There
                    are two, however, which deserve to be considered in a particular manner. It
                    gives Christians an opportunity of openly professing their faith, and testifying
                    their obedience to their Redeemer in the wisest and best manner; and in an age
                    when infidelity has arisen to an alarming height, when the Son of God is
                    crucified afresh, and put to open shame, every man, who has any regard for
                    religion, will cheerfully embrace all opportunities of declaring his abhorrence
                    of the vicious courses pursued by those apostates. He will lay hold with
                    pleasure on every occasion to testify that he is neither afraid nor ashamed to
                    confess the truth; and will think it his indispensable duty openly to disavow
                    the sins of others, that he may not incur the guilt of partaking of them.</p><p>Public worship preserves in the minds of men a sense of religion, without which
                    society cannot exist. Nothing can keep a body of men together, and unite them in
                    promoting the public good, but such principles of action as may reach and govern
                    the heart. But these can be derived only from a sense of religious duties, which
                    can never be so strongly impressed upon the mind as by a constant attendance
                    upon public worship. Nothing can be more weak than to neglect the public worship
                    of God, under the pretence that we can employ ourselves as acceptably to our
                    Maker at home in our closets. Both kinds of worship are indeed necessary; but
                    one debt cannot be paid by the discharge of another. By public worship every man
                    professes his belief in that God whom he adores, and appeals to Him for his
                    sincerity, of which his neighbour cannot judge. By this appeal he endears
                    himself more or less to others. It creates confidence; and it roots in the heart
                    benevolence, and all other Christian virtues, which produce, in common life, the
                    fruits of mutual love and general peace.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sabbath</hi><hi rend="italic">-Breaking,</hi> or
                    profanation of the Lord’s day, is punishable by law. For besides the notorious
                    indecency and scandal of permitting any secular business to be publicly
                    transacted on that day, in a country professing Christianity, and the corruption
                    of morals which usually follows its profanation, the keeping one day in seven
                    holy, as a time of relaxation and refreshment, as well as for public worship, is
                    of admirable service to a state, considered merely as a civil institution. It
                    humanizes, by the help of conversation and society, the manners of the lower
                    classes, which would otherwise degenerate into a sordid ferocity and selfishness
                    of spirit; it enables the industrious workman to pursue his occupation in the
                    ensuing week with health and cheerfulness; it imprints on the minds of the
                    people that sense of their duty to God which is so necessary to make them good
                    citizens, but which yet would be worn out and defaced by an unremitted
                    continuance of labour, without any stated times of recalling them to the worship
                    of their Maker.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
