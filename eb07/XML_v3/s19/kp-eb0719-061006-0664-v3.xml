                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SAGE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alain Rene</hi></label>, an
                    ingenious French romance-writer, was born at Ruys, in Bretagne, in the year
                    1667. He had a fine flow of imagination, was a complete master of the French and
                    Spanish languages, and wrote several admired romances in imitation of the
                    Spanish authors. These were, 1. The Bachelor of Salamanca, two vols. 12mo; 2.
                    New Adventures of Don Quixote, two vols. 12mo; 3. The Devil on Two Sticks, two
                    vols. 12mo; and, 4. Gil Blas, four vols, 12mo. He produced also some comedies,
                    and other humorous pieces. This ingenious author died in the year 1747, in the
                    vicinity of Paris.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sage,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> so justly admired by
                    all who knew him for his classical learning and reasoning powers, was born in
                    1652, in the parish of Creich and county of Fife, where his ancestors had lived
                    for seven generations with great respect, though with little property. His
                    father was a captain in Lord Duffus’s regiment, and fought for his king and
                    country when Monk stormed Dundee on the 30th of August 1651.</p>
                <p>The issue of the civil wars, and the loyalty of Captain Sage, left him nothing to
                    bestow upon his son but a liberal education and his own principles of piety and
                    virtue. In those days the Latin language was taught in the parochial schools of
                    Scotland with great ability and at a trifling expense; and after young Sage had
                    acquired a competent knowledge of that language at one of those useful
                    seminaries, his father, without receiving from an ungrateful court any
                    recompense for what he had lost in the cause of royalty, was still able to send
                    him to the university of St Andrews. Having remained in college the usual number
                    of terms or sessions, and performed the exercises required by the statutes, he
                    was admitted to the degree of master of arts, the highest honour which it
                    appears he ever received from any university.</p>
                <p>During his residence in St Andrews he studied the Greek and Roman authors with
                    great diligence, and was likewise instructed in logic, metaphysics, and such
                    other branches of philosophy as then obtained in the schools. When Mr Sage had
                    taken his master’s degree, the narrowness of his fortune compelled him to accept
                    of the first literary employment which was offered to him; and that happened to
                    be nothing better than the office of schoolmaster in the parish of Bingry in
                    Fifeshire, whence he was soon removed to Tippermuir, in the county of Perth. In
                    these humble stations, though he wanted many of the necessaries and almost all
                    the comforts of life, he prosecuted his studies with great success; but in doing
                    so, he unhappily imbibed the seeds of several diseases, which afflicted him
                    through life, and, notwithstanding the native vigour of his constitution,
                    impaired his health and shortened his days. From the miserable drudgery of a
                    parish-schoolmaster he was relieved by Mr Drummond of Cultmalundie, who invited
                    him to superintend the education of his sons, whom he accompanied first to the
                    public school at Perth, and afterwards to the university of St Andrews. This was
                    still an employment by no means adequate to his merit, but it was not wholly
                    without advantages. At Perth, he gained the friendship and esteem of Dr Rose,
                    afterwards bishop of Edinburgh, and at St Andrews that of every man capable of
                    properly estimating genius and learning.</p>
                <p>The education of his pupils terminated in 1684, when he was left with no
                    determinate object of pursuit. In this moment of indecision, his friend Dr Rose,
                    who had been promoted from the parsonage of Perth to the professorship of
                    divinity in the university which he was leaving, recommended him so effectually
                    to his uncle, then archbishop of Glasgow, that he was by that prelate admitted
                    into orders, and presented to one of the churches in the city. He was then about
                    thirty-four years of age, and had studied the Scriptures with great assiduity;
                    he was no stranger to ecclesiastical history, or the apologies and other
                    writings of the ancient fathers, and had examined with great accuracy the modern
                    controversies, especially those between the Romish and Reformed churches. A man
                    so far advanced in life, and so thoroughly accomplished as a scholar, would
                    naturally be looked up to by the greater part of the clergy as soon as he became
                    one of their body. This was in fact the case. Mr Sage was, immediately on his
                    admission into orders, appointed clerk to the synod or presbytery of Glasgow; an
                    office of great trust and respectability, to which we know nothing similar in
                    the church of England. During the establishment of episcopacy in Scotland, the
                    authority of the bishops, though they possessed the sole power of ordination,
                    was very limited in the government of the church. They did every thing with the
                    consent of the presbyters over whom they presided. Diocesan synods were held at
                    stated times for purposes of the same kind" with those which employ the meetings
                    of presbyteries at present; and the only prerogative which the bishop seems to
                    have enjoyed was to be permanent president, with a negative voice over the
                    deliberations of the assembly. The acts of each synod, and sometimes the charge
                    delivered by the bishop at the opening of it, were registered in a book kept by
                    the clerk, who was always one of the most eminent of the diocesan clergy.</p>
                <p>Mr Sage continued in this office, discharging in Glasgow all the duties of a
                    clergyman, in such a manner as endeared him to his flock, and gained him the
                    esteem even of those who were dissenters from the establishment. Many of his
                    brethren were trimmers in ecclesiastical as well as in civil politics. They had
                    been republicans and presbyterians in the days of the covenant; and, with that
                    ferocious zeal which too often characterizes interested converts, had concurred
                    in the severities which, during the reign of Charles II. were exercised against
                    the party whom they had forsaken at the Restoration. When that party again
                    raised its head during the reign of James, and every thing indicated an
                    approaching change of the establishment, those<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=665" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0665-0611"/>
                    whose zeal for the church had so lately incited them to persecute the
                    dissenters, suddenly became all gentleness and condescension, and advanced
                    towards the presbyterians as to their old friends.</p>
                <p>The conduct of Mr Sage was the reverse of this. He was an episcopalian and a
                    royalist from conviction; and in all his discourses, public and private, he
                    laboured to instil into the minds of others the principles which to himself
                    appeared to have their foundation in truth. To persecution he was at all times
                    an enemy, whilst he never tamely betrayed through fear what he thought it his
                    duty to maintain. The consequence was, that in the end of the year 1688, he was
                    treated by the rabble, which in the western counties of Scotland rose against
                    the established church, with greater lenity than his more complying
                    brethren.</p>
                <p>Mr Sage retired to the metropolis, and carried with him the synodical book, which
                    was afterwards demanded by the presbytery of Glasgow, but not recovered till, on
                    the death of a nephew of Dr Rose, the last established bishop of Edinburgh, it
                    was found in his possession, and restored to the presbytery to which it
                    belonged. Mr Sage had detained it and given it to his friend, in the fond hope
                    that episcopacy would soon be re-established in Scotland; and it was doubtless
                    with a view to contribute what he could to the realizing of that hope, that,
                    immediately on his being obliged to leave Glasgow, he commenced as a polemical
                    writer. At Edinburgh he preached for a time, till, refusing to take the oaths of
                    allegiance when required by the government, he was obliged to retire. Returning
                    to Edinburgh in 1695, he was observed, and obliged to abscond. Yet he returned
                    in 1696, when his friend Sir William Bruce was imprisoned as a suspected
                    person.</p>
                <p>After a time Mr Sage found a safe retreat with the Countess of Callendar, who
                    employed him to instruct her family as chaplain, and her sons as tutor. These
                    occupations did not wholly engage his active mind; for he employed his pen in
                    defending his order or in exposing his oppressors. When the Countess of
                    Callendar had no longer sons to instruct, Sage accepted the invitation of Sir
                    John Stewart of Grandtully, who wanted the help of a chaplain and the
                    conversation of a scholar. With Sir John he continued till the decency of his
                    manners and the extensiveness of his learning recommended him to a higher
                    station; and, on the 25th of January 1705, he was consecrated a bishop by
                    Paterson the archbishop of Glasgow, Rose the bishop of Edinburgh, and Douglas
                    the bishop of Dumblane. But this promotion did not prevent him from falling into
                    sickness in November 1706. After lingering for many months in Scotland, he tried
                    the effect of the waters of Bath in 1709, without success. At Bath and at London
                    he remained twelve months, recognised by the great and caressed by the learned.
                    Yet though he was invited to stay, he returned in 1710 to his native country,
                    and died at Edinburgh on the 7th of June 1711.</p>
