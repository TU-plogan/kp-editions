                <p><label type="entry">SCHOMBERG, <hi rend="smallcaps">Frederick-Armand, Duke
                    of</hi></label>, a distinguished officer, sprung from an illustrious family in
                    Germany, and the son of Count Schomberg by an English lady, daughter of Lord
                    Dudley, was born in 1608. He was initiated into the military life under
                    Frederick-Henry prince of Orange, and afterwards served under his son William
                    II. prince of Orange, who highly esteemed him. He then repaired to the court of
                    France, where his reputation was so well known that he obtained the government
                    of Gravelines, of Furnes, and the surrounding countries. He was reckoned
                    inferior to no general in that kingdom, except Marshal Turenne and the Prince of
                    Condé; men of such exalted eminence, that it was no disgrace to acknowledge
                    their superiority. The French court thinking it necessary to diminish the power
                    of Spain, sent Schomberg to the assistance of the Portuguese, who were engaged
                    in a war with that country respecting the succession to their throne.
                    Schomberg’s military talents gave a turn to the war in favour of his allies. The
                    court of Spain was obliged to solicit a peace in 1668, and to acknowledge the
                    house of Braganza as the just heirs to the throne of Portugal. For his great
                    services he was created Count Mentola in Portugal; and a pension of L.5000 was
                    bestowed upon him, with the reversion to his heirs.</p>
                <p>In 1673 he came over to England to command the army; but the English being at
                    that time disgusted with the French nation, Schomberg was suspected of coming
                    over with a design to corrupt the army, and bring it under French discipline. He
                    therefore found it necessary to return to France, which he soon left, and went
                    to the Netherlands.<pb break="no"

                    In the month of June 1676, he forced the Prince of Orange to raise the siege of
                    Maestricht; and it is said he was then raised to the rank of Marshal of France.
                    But the French <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Historique,</hi> whose information
                    on a point of this nature ought to be authentic, says that he was invested with
                    this honour the same year in which he took the fortress of Bellegarde from the
                    Spaniards whilst serving in Portugal.</p>
                <p>Upon the revocation of the edict of Nantes, when the persecution commenced
                    against the Protestants, Schomberg, who was of that persuasion, requested leave
                    to retire into his own country. This request was refused; but he was permitted
                    to take refuge in Portugal, where he had reason to expect he would be kindly
                    received on account of past services. But the religious zeal of the Portuguese,
                    though it did not prevent them from accepting assistance from a heretic when
                    their kingdom was threatened with subversion, could not permit them to give him
                    shelter when he came for protection. The inquisition interfered, and obliged the
                    king to send him away. He then went to Holland by the way of England. Having
                    accepted an invitation from the Elector of Brandenburg, he was invested with the
                    government of Ducal Prussia, and appointed commander-in-chief of the elector’s
                    forces. When the Prince of Orange sailed to England to take possession of the
                    crown which his father-in-law James II. had abdicated, Schomberg obtained
                    permission from the Elector of Brandenburg to accompany him. He is supposed to
                    have been the author of an ingenious stratagem which the prince employed after
                    his arrival in London, to discover the sentiments of the people respecting the
                    revolution. The stratagem was, to spread an alarm over the country that the
                    Irish were approaching with fire and sword. When the prince was established on
                    the throne of England, Schomberg was appointed commander-in-chief of the forces,
                    and master of the ordnance. In April 1689 he was made knight of the garter, and
                    naturalized by act of parliament; and in May following he was created baron,
                    earl, marquis, and duke of the kingdom of England, by the name and title of
                    Baron Teys, Earl of Brentford, Marquis of Harwich, and Duke of Schomberg. The
                    House of Commons voted to him L.100,000 as a reward for his services. Of this he
                    only received a small part; but after his death a pension of L.5000 a year was
                    bestowed upon his son.</p>
                <p>In August 1689 he was sent to Ireland to reduce that kingdom to obedience. When
                    he arrived, he found himself at the head of an army consisting only of twelve
                    thousand foot and two thousand horse, while King James commanded an army three
                    times more numerous. Schomberg thought it dangerous to engage so superior a
                    force, and being disappointed in his promised supplies from England, he judged
                    it prudent to remain on the defensive. He therefore posted himself at Dundalk,
                    about five or six miles distance from James, who was encamped at Ardee. For six
                    weeks he remained in this position, without attempting to give battle, while
                    from the wetness of the season he lost nearly the half of his army. Schomberg
                    was much blamed for not coming to action; but some excellent judges admired his
                    conduct, as evincing great military talents. Had he risked an engagement, and
                    been defeated, Ireland would have been lost. At the famous battle of the Boyne,
                    fought on the 1st of July 1690, which decided the fate of James, Schomberg
                    passed the river at the head of his cavalry, defeated eight squadrons of the
                    enemy, and broke the Irish infantry. When the French Protestants had lost their
                    commander, Schomberg went to rally and lead them on to charge. While thus
                    engaged, a party of King James’s guards, which had been separated from the rest,
                    passed Schomberg, in attempting to rejoin their own army. They attacked him with
                    great fury, and gave him two wounds in the head. As the wounds were not
                    dangerous, he might soon have recovered from them; but the French Protestants,
                    perhaps thinking their general was killed, immediately fired upon the guards,
                    and shot him dead on the spot. He was buried in St Patrick’s cathedral. Bishop
                    Burnet says Schomberg was “a calm man, of great application and conduct, and
                    thought much better than he spoke; of true judgment, of exact probity, and of a
                    humble and obliging temper.”</p>
