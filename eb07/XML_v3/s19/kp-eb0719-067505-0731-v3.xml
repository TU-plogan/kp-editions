                    burlesque writer, was the son of a counsellor in parliament, and born at Paris
                    about the end of the year 1610, or in the beginning of the succeeding year. His
                    father having married a second time, he was compelled to assume the
                    ecclesiastical profession. At the age of twenty-four he visited Italy, where he
                    freely indulged in licentious pleasures. After his return to Paris, he persisted
                    in a life of dissipation, till a long and painful disease convinced him that his
                    constitution was almost worn out. At length, when engaged in a party of pleasure
                    at the age of twenty-seven, he lost “the use of those legs which danced so
                    gracefully, and of those hands which could paint and play on the lute with so
                    much elegance.” In the year 1638 he was attending the carnival at Mons, of which
                    he was a canon. Having dressed himself one day as a savage, his singular
                    appearance excited the curiosity of the children of the town. They followed him
                    in multitudes, and he was obliged to take shelter in a marsh. This wet and cold
                    situation produced a numbness which totally deprived him of the use of his
                    limbs; but notwithstanding this misfortune he continued gay and cheerful. He
                    took up his residence at Paris, and by his pleasant humour soon attracted to his
                    house all the men of wit about the city. The loss of his health was followed by
                    the loss of his fortune. On the death of his father he entered into a process
                    with his mother-in-law. He pleaded the cause in a ludicrous manner, though his
                    whole fortune depended on the decision, and accordingly lost the cause.
                    Mademoiselle de Hautefort, compassionating his misfortunes, procured for him an
                    audience of the queen. The poet requested to have the title of valetudinarian to
                    her majesty. The queen smiled, and Scarron considered the smile as the
                    commission to his new office. He therefore assumed the title of “Scarron, by the
                    grace of God unworthy valetudinarian to the queen.”</p><p>Cardinal Mazarin gave him a pension of five hundred crowns; but that minister
                    having received disdainfully the dedication of his Typhon, the poet immediately
                    wrote a <hi rend="italic">Mazarinade,</hi> and the pension was withdrawn. He
                    then attached himself to the Prince of Conde, and celebrated his victories. He
                    at length formed the extraordinary resolution of marrying, and was accordingly,
                    in 1651, married to Mademoiselle d’Aubigné, afterwards Madame de Maintenon, who
                    was then only sixteen years of age. “At that time,” says Voltaire, “it was
                    considered as a great acquisition for her to gain for a husband a man who was
                    disfigured by nature, impotent, and very little enriched by fortune." When
                    Scarron was questioned about the contract of marriage, he said he acknowledged
                    to the bride two large invincible eyes, a very beautiful shape, two fine hands,
                    and a large portion of wit. The notary demanded what dowry he would give her.
                    Scarron immediately replied, “The names of the wives of kings die with them, but
                    the name of Scarron’s wife shall live for ever.” She restrained by her modesty
                    his indecent buffooneries, and the good company which had formerly resorted to
                    his house were not less frequent in their visits. Scarron now became a new man.
                    He grew more decent in his manners and conversation; and his gaiety, when
                    tempered with moderation, was still more agreeable. But, in the mean time, he
                    lived with so little economy, that his income was soon reduced to a small
                    annuity and his marquisate of Quinet. By the marquisate of Quinet, he meant the
                    revenue he derived from his publications, which were printed by one Quinet. He
                    was accustomed to talk to his superiors with great freedom in his jocular style.
                    In the dedication to his <hi rend="italic">Don Japhet d’Armenie,</hi> he thus
                    addresses the king: “I shall endeavour to persuade your majesty that you would
                    do yourself no injury were you to do me a small favour; for in that case I
                    should become more gay. If I should become more gay,</p><p>I should write sprightly comedies; and if I should write<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=732" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0732-0676"/>
                    sprightly comedies, your majesty would be amused, and thus your money would not
                    be lost. All this appears so evident, that I should certainly be convinced of it
                    if I wore as great a king as I am now a poor unfortunate man.”</p><p>Although Scarron wrote comedies, he had neither time nor patience to study the
                    rules and models of dramatic poetry. Aristotle and Horace, Plautus and Terence,
                    would have frightened him; and perhaps he did not know that there was ever such
                    a person as Aristophanes. He saw an open path before him, and he followed it. It
                    was the fashion of the times to pillage the Spanish writers. Scarron was
                    acquainted with that language, and he found it easier to use the materials which
                    were already prepared, than to rack his brain in inventing a subject; a
                    restraint to which a genius like his could not easily submit. As he borrowed
                    liberally from the Spanish writers, a dramatic piece did not cost him much
                    labour. His labour consisted not in making his comic characters talk humorously,
                    but in keeping up serious characters; for the serious was a foreign language to
                    him. The great success of his <hi rend="italic">Jodelet Maître</hi> was a vast
                    allurement to him. The comedians who acted it eagerly requested more of his
                    productions. They were written without much toil, and they procured him large
                    sums. They served to amuse him. When the office of historiographer became
                    vacant, he solicited for it without success. At length Fouquet gave him a
                    pension of sixteen hundred livres. Christina queen of Sweden having come to
                    Paris, was anxious to see Scarron. “I permit you,” said she to Scarron, “to fall
                    in love with me. The queen of France has made you her valetudinarian, and I
                    create you my Roland.” But Scarron did not long enjoy that title. He was seized
                    with so violent a hiccough, that every person thought he would have expired. “If
                    I recover,” he said, “I will make a fine satire on the hiccough.” His gaiety did
                    not forsake him to the last. Within a few minutes of his death, when his
                    domestics were shedding tears about him, “My goods friends,” said he, “I shall
                    never make you weep so much for me as I have made you laugh.” Just before
                    expiring, he said, <hi rend="italic">“</hi> I could never believe before that it
                    is so easy to laugh at death.” He died on the l4th of October 1660, in the
                    fifty-first year of his age.</p><p>His works have been collected and published by Bruzen de la Martiniere, in ten
                    volumes 12mo, 1737. There are, 1. The AEneid travestied, in eight books. It was
                    afterwards continued by Moreau de Brasey. 2. Typhon, or the Gigantomachia. 3.
                    Many comedies, as Jodelet, or the Master Valet, Jodelet Cuffed, Don Japhet
                    d’Armenie, the Ridiculous Heir, Every Man his own Guardian, the Foolish Marquis,
                    the Scholar of Salamanca, the False Appearance, and the Prince Corsaire, a
                    tragi-comedy. Besides these, he wrote other pieces in verse. 4. His Comic
                    Romance, in prose, which is the only one of his works that deserves attention.
                    It is written with much purity and gaiety, and has contributed not a little to
                    the improvement of the French language. Scarron had great pleasure in reading
                    his works to his friends as he composed them, which he called trying his works.
                    Segrais and another of his friends coming to him one day, “Take a chair,” said
                    Scarron to them, “and sit down, that I may examine my Comic Romance.” When he
                    observed the company laugh, “Very well,” said he, “my book will be well
                    received, since it makes persons of such delicate taste laugh.” Nor was he
                    deceived. His romance had a prodigious run. It was the only one of his works
                    that Boileau could submit to read. 5. Spanish novels translated into French. 6.
                    A volume of Letters. 7. Poems, consisting of songs, epistles, stanzas, odes, and
                    epigrams. The whole collection abounds with sprightliness and gaiety.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
