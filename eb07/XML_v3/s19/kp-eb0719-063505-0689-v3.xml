                <p><label type="entry">SANCHONIATHO</label>, a Phoenician philosopher and historian,
                    who is said to have flourished before the Trojan war, and about the time of
                    Semiramis. Of this most ancient writer the only remains extant are various
                    fragments of cosmogony, and of the history of the gods and first mortals,
                    preserved by Eusebius and Theodoret, both of whom speak of Sanchoniatho as an
                    accurate and faithful historian; and the former adds, that his work, which was
                    translated by Philo-Byblius from the Phoenician into the Greek language,
                    contains many things relating to the history of the Jews which deserve great
                    credit, both because they agree with the Jewish writers, and because the author
                    received these particulars from the annals of Hierombalus, a priest of the god
                    Jao.</p>
                <p>Several modern writers of great learning, however, have called in question the
                    very existence of Sanchoniatho, and have contended, with much plausibility, that
                    the fragments which Eusebius adopted as genuine upon the authority of Porphyry,
                    were forged by that author or by the pretended translator Philo, from enmity to
                    the Christians, and that the Pagans might have something to show of equal
                    antiquity with the books of Moses. These opposite opinions have produced a
                    controversy that has filled volumes, and of which our limits would hardly admit
                    of an abstract. We shall therefore in few words state what appears to us to be
                    the truth, and refer such of our readers as are desirous of fuller information
                    to the works of the authors mentioned below.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Bochart, Scaliger, Vossius, Cumberland, Dodwell,
                    Stillingfleet, Mosheim’s Cudworth, and Warburton.</p></note></p>
                <p>The controversy respecting Sanchoniatho resolves itself into two questions:
                    First, was there in reality such a writer? and, second, was he of the very
                    remote antiquity which his translator claims for him?</p>
                <p>Now that there was really such a writer, and that the fragments preserved by
                    Eusebius are indeed parts of his history, interpolated perhaps by the
                    translator, we are compelled to believe by the following reasons.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of these indeed there are
                    several proofs. Philo makes Sanchoniatho speak of Byblus as the most ancient
                    city of Phoenicia, which, in all probability, it was not. We read in the book of
                    Judges of Berith or Berytus, the city where Sunchoniatho himself lived; but not
                    of Byblus, which was the native city of Philo, and to which he is therefore
                    partial. He makes him likewise talk of the Greeks at a period long before any of
                    the Grecian states were known or probably peopled.</p></note> Eusebius, who
                    admitted them into his work as authentic, was one of the most learned men of his
                    age, and a diligent searcher into antiquity. His conduct at the Nicene council
                    shows, that on every subject he thought for himself, neither biassed by
                    authority on the one side, nor carried over by the rage of innovation on the
                    other. He had better means than any modern writer can have of satisfying himself
                    with respect to the authenticity of a very extraordinary work, which had then
                    but lately been translated into the Greek language, and made generally known;
                    and there is nothing in the work itself, or at least in those parts of it which
                    he has preserved, that could induce a wise and good man to obtrude it upon the
                    public as genuine, had he himself suspected it to be spurious. Too many of the
                    Christian fathers were indeed credulous, and ready to admit the authenticity of
                    writings without duly weighing the merits of their claim; but then such writings
                    were always believed to be favourable to the Christian cause, and inimical to
                    the cause of Paganism. That no man of common sense could suppose the cosmogony
                    of Sanchoniatho favourable to the cause of revealed religion, further proof
                    cannot be requisite than what is furnished by the following extract.</p>
                <p>“He supposes, or affirms, that the principles of the universe were a dark and
                    windy air, or a wind made of dark air, and a turbulent evening chaos; and that
                    these things were boundless, and for a long time had no bound or figure.<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0690-0636"/> But when tins wind fell in love with his own
                    principles, and a mixture was made, that mixture was called desire or cupid <hi
                    rend="italic">(πoθoς).</hi></p>
                <p>“This mixture completed, was the beginning of the (<hi rend="italic"
                    >χτιoεως</hi>) making of all things. But that wind did not know its own
                    production; and of this with that wind was begotten <hi rend="italic">Mot,</hi>
                    which some call <hi rend="italic">Mua,</hi> others the putrefaction of a watery
                    mixture. And of this came all the seed of this building, and the generation of
                    the universe.</p>
                <p>“But there were certain animals which had no sense, out of which were begotten
                    intelligent animals, and were called <hi rend="italic">Zophesemin,</hi> that is,
                    the spies or overseers of heaven; and were formed alike in the shape of an egg.
                    Thus shone out <hi rend="italic">Mot,</hi> the sun and the moon, the less and
                    the greater stars.</p>
                <p>“And the air shining thoroughly with light, by its fiery influence on the sea and
                    earth, winds were begotten, and clouds and great defluxions of the heavenly
                    waters. And, when all these things first were parted, and were separated from
                    their proper place by the heat of the sun, then all met again in the air, and
                    dashed against one another, and were broken to pieces, whence thunders and
                    lightnings were made; and at the stroke of these thunders the fore-mentioned
                    intelligent animals were awakened, and frighted with the sound, and male and
                    female stirred in the earth and in the sea. This is the generation of
                    animals.”</p>
                <p>After these things Sanchoniatho goes on to say, “These things are written in the
                    Cosmogony of Taautus, and in his memoirs; and out of the conjectures and surer
                    natural signs which his mind saw, and found out, and wherewith he has
                    enlightened us.”</p>
                <p>Afterwards declaring the names of the winds north and south, and the rest, he
                    makes this epilogue: “But these first men consecrated the plants shooting out of
                    the earth, and judged them gods, and worshipped them; upon whom they themselves
                    lived, and all their posterity and all before them; to these they made their
                    meat and drink offerings.” Then he concludes: “These were the devices of
                    worship, agreeing with the weakness and want of boldness in their minds.”</p>
                <p>Let us suppose Eusebius to have been as weak and credulous as the darkest monk in
                    the darkest age of Europe, a supposition which no man will make who knows any
                    thing of the writings of that eminent historian, what could he see in this
                    senseless jargon, which even a dreaming monk would think of employing in support
                    of Christianity? Eusebius calls it, and calls it truly, direct atheism; but
                    could he imagine that an ancient system of atheism would contribute so much to
                    make the Pagans of his age admit as divine revelations the books of the Old and
                    New Testaments, that he should be induced to adopt, without examination, an
                    impudent forgery, not two hundred years old, as genuine remains of the most
                    remote antiquity?</p>
                <p>If this Phoenician cosmogony be a fabrication of Porphyry, or of the pretended
                    translator, it must surely have been fabricated for some purpose; but it is
                    impossible for us to conceive what purpose either of these writers could have
                    intended to serve by forging a system so extravagantly absurd. Porphyry, though
                    an enemy to the Christians, was not an atheist, and would never have thought of
                    making an atheist of him whom he meant to obtrude upon the world as the rival of
                    Moses. His own principles were those of the Alexandrian Platonists; and had he
                    been the forger of the works which bear the name of Sanchoniatho, instead of the
                    incomprehensible jargon about dark wind, evening chaos, Mot, the overseers of
                    heaven in the shape of an <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> and animation proceeding
                    from the sound of thunder, we should doubtless have been amused with refined
                    specula tions concerning the operations of the Demiurgus and the other persons
                    in the Platonic Triad.</p>
                <p>Father Simon of the oratory imagines,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    that the purpose for which the history of Sanchoniatho was forged, was to
                    support Paganism, by taking from it its mythology and allegories, which were
                    perpetually objected to it by the Christian writers. But this learned roan
                    totally mistakes the matter. The primitive Christians were too much attached to
                    allegories themselves to rest their objections to Paganism on such a foundation.
                    What they objected to that system was, the immoral stories told of the priests.
                    To this the pagan priests and philosophers replied, that these stories were only
                    mythological allegories, which veiled all the great truths of theology, ethics,
                    and physics. The Christians said this could not be; for that the stories of the
                    gods had a substantial foundation in fact, these gods being only dead men
                    deified, who in life had like passions and infirmities with other mortals. This,
                    then, was the objection which the forger of the works of Sanchoniatho had to
                    remove, if he really forged them in support of Paganism; but instead of doing so
                    he gives the genealogy and history of all the greater gods, and shows that they
                    were men deified after death for the exploits, some of them grossly immoral,
                    which they had performed in this world. We have elsewhere (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Polytheism</hi>) given his account of the deification of
                    Chrysos, and Ouranos, and Gé, and Hypsistos, and Muth.; but our readers may not
                    perhaps be ill pleased to accompany him through the history of Ouranos and
                    Kronus, two of his greatest gods; whence it will appear how little his writings
                    are calculated to support the tottering cause of Paganism against the objections
                    which were then urged to it by the Christian apologists.</p>
                <p>“Ouranos,” says he, “taking the kingdom of his father, married Gé, his sister,
                    and by her had four sons; Ilus, who is called Kronus; Betylus; Dagon, who is
                    Siton, or the god of corn; and Atlas. But by other wives Ouranos had much issue,
                    wherefore Gé, being grieved at it and jealous, reproached Ouranos, so as they
                    parted from each other. But Ouranos, though he parted from her, yet by force
                    invading her, and lying with her when he listed, went away again; and he also
                    attempted to kill the children he had by her. Gé also often defended or avenged
                    herself, gathering auxiliary powers unto her. But when Kronus came to man’s age,
                    using Hermes Trismegistus as his counsellor and assistant (for he was his
                    secretary), he opposed his father Ouranos, avenging his mother. But Kronus had
                    children, Persephone and Athena; the former died a virgin, but by the counsel of
                    the latter Athena, and of Hermes, Kronus made of iron a scimitar and a spear.
                    Then Hermes, speaking to the assistants of Kronus with enchanting words, wrought
                    in them a keen desire to fight against Ouranos in the behalf of Gé; and thus
                    Kronus, warring against Ouranos, drove him out of his kingdom, and succeeded him
                    in the imperial power of office. In the fight was taken a well-beloved concubine
                    of Ouranos, big with child. Kronus gave her in marriage to Dagon, and she
                    brought forth at his house what she had in her womb by Ouranos, and called him
                    Demaroon. After these things Kronus builds a wall round about his house, and
                    founds Byblus, the first city in Phoenicia. Afterwards Kronus, suspecting his
                    own brother Atlas, with the advice of Hermes, throwing him into a deep hole of
                    the earth, there buried him, and having a son called Sadid, he despatched him
                    with his own sword, having a suspicion of him, and deprived his own son of life
                    with his own hand. He also cut off the head of his own daughter, so that all the
                    gods were amazed at the mind of Kronus. But in process of time, Ouranos, being
                    in flight, or banishment, sends his daughter Astarte, with two other sisters,
                    Rhea and<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=691"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0691-0637"/> Dione, to cut off Kronus by deceit, whom Kronus
                    taking, made wives of these sisters. Ouranos, understanding this, sent Eimarmene
                    and Hore, Fate and Beauty, with other auxiliaries, to war against him; but
                    Kronus, having gained the affections of these also, kept them with himself.
                    Moreover, the god Ouranos devised Baetulia, contriving stones that moved as
                    having life. But Kronus begat on Astarte seven daughters called Titanides or
                    Artemides; and he begat on Rhea seven sons, the youngest of whom, as soon as he
                    was born, was consecrated a god. Also by Dione he had daughters, and by Astarte,
                    moreover, two sons, Pothos and Eros, that is, Cupid and Love. But Dagon, after
                    he had found out bread-corn, and the plough, was called Zeus Aratrius. To Sydyc,
                    or the just, one of the Titanides bare Asclepius. Kronus had also in Peraea
                    three sons, first, Kronus, his father’s namesake; second, Zeus Belus; and,
                    third, Apollo.”</p>
                <p>Is it conceivable, that a writer so acute as Porphyry, or indeed that any man of
                    common sense, either in his age or in that of Philo, would forge a book filled
                    with such stories as these, in order to remove the Christian objections to the
                    immoral characters of the Pagan divinities? The very supposition is impossible
                    to be made. Nor let any one imagine that Sanchoniatho is here writing
                    allegorically, and by his tales of Ouranos, and Gé, and Kronus, is only
                    personifying the heaven, the earth, and time. On the contrary, he assures us,
                    that Ouranos, or Epigeus, or Autochthon (for he gives him all these names), was
                    the son of one Eliaun or Hypsistos, who dwelt about Byblus, and that from him
                    the clement which is over us was called heaven, on account of its excellent
                    beauty, as the earth was named Gé after his sister and wife. And his translator
                    is very angry<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Apud
                    Euscbium, <hi rend="italic">Praep. Evang.</hi> lib. i. cap. vi.</p></note> with
                    the Neotoric Greeks, as he calls them, because that, “by a great deal of force
                    and straining, they laboured to turn all the stories of the gods into allegories
                    and physical discourses.” This proves unanswerably that the author of this book,
                    whoever he was, did not mean to veil the great truths of religion under the
                    cloak of mythological allegories; and therefore, if it was forged by Porphyry in
                    support of Paganism, the forger so far mistook the state of the question between
                    him and his adversaries, that he contrived a book, which, if admitted to be
                    ancient, totally overthrew his own cause.</p>
                <p>The next thing to be inquired into with respect to Sanchoniatho is his antiquity.
                    Did he really live and wτite at so early a period as Porphyry and Philo pretend?
                    We think he did not; and what contributes not a little to confirm us in our
                    opinion, is that mark of national vanity and partiality, common to after-times,
                    in making the sacred mysteries of his own country original, and conveyed from
                    Phoenicia into Egypt. This, however, furnishes an additional proof that Porphyry
                    was not the forger of the work; for he well knew that the mysteries had their
                    origin in Egypt (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mysteries),</hi> and would not have
                    fallen into such a blunder. He is guilty, indeed, of a very great anachronism,
                    when he makes Sanchoniatho contemporary with Semiramis, and yet pretends that
                    what he writes of the Jews is compiled from the records of Hierombalus the
                    priest of the god Jao; for Bochart has made it appear in the highest degree
                    probable,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">’ Geogr. Sac.</hi> p. 2, book ii. lib. ii. cap. xvii.\</p></note>
                    that Hierombalus or Jeromb-baal is the Jerub-baal or Gideon of Scripture.</p>
                <p>Between the reign of Semiramis and the Trojan war a period elapsed of near eight
                    hundred years, whereas Gideon flourished not above seventy years before the
                    destruction of Troy. But supposing Sanchoniatho to have really consulted the
                    records of Gideon, it by no means follows that he flourished at the same period
                    with that judge of Israel. He speaks of the building of Tyre as an ancient
                    thing, while our best chronologers<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>’ Scaliger.</p></note> ’ place it in the time of Gideon.</p>
                <p>Indeed, were we certain that any writings had been left by that holy man, we
                    should be obliged to conclude, that a large tract of time had intervened between
                    the death of their author and their falling into the hands of Sanchoniatho; for,
                    surely, they could not, in a short period, have been so completely corrupted as
                    to give any countenance to his impious absurdities. His atheistic cosmogony he
                    does not indeed pretend to have got from the annals of the priest of Jao, but
                    from records which were deposited in his own town of Berytus by Thoth, a
                    Phoenician philosopher, who was afterwards made king of Egypt. But surely the
                    annals of Gideon, if written by himself, and preserved pure to the days of
                    Sanchoniatho, must have contained so many truths of the Mosaic religion, as must
                    have prevented any man of sense from adopting so impossible a theory as Thoth’s,
                    although sanctioned by the greatest name of profane antiquity. Stillingfleet
                    indeed thinks it most probable that Sanchoniatho became acquainted with the most
                    remarkable passages of the life of Jerub-baal from annals written, by a
                    Phoenician pen. He observes, that immediately after the death of Gideon, the
                    Israelites, with their usual proneness to idolatry, worshipped Baal-berith, or
                    the idol of Berytus, the town in which Sanchoniatho lived; and from this
                    circumstance he concludes, that there must have been such an intercourse between
                    the Hebrews and Berytians, that in process of time the latter people might
                    assume to themselves the Jerub-baal of the former, and hand down his actions to
                    posterity as those of a priest instead of a great commander. All this may be
                    true; but if so, it amounts to a demonstration that the antiquity of
                    Sanchoniatho is not so high by many ages as that which is claimed for him by
                    Philo and Porphyry; though he may still be more ancient, as we think Vossius has
                    proved him to be, than any other profane historian whose writings have come down
                    to us either entire or in fragments.</p>
                <p>But granting the authenticity of Sanchoniatho’s history, what, it may be asked,
                    is the value of his fragments, that we should be at any trouble to ascertain
                    whether they be genuine remains of high antiquity, or the forgeries of a modern
                    impostor? We answer, with the illustrious Stiilling-fleet, that though these
                    fragments contain such absurdities as it would be a disgrace to reason to
                    suppose credible, though the whole cosmogony is the grossest sink of atheism,
                    and though many persons make a figure in the history, whose very existence may
                    well be doubted; yet we, who have in our hands the light of divine revelation,
                    may in this dungeon discover many excellent relics of ancient tradition, which
                    throw no feeble light upon many passages of holy scripture, as they give us the
                    origin and progress oif that idolatry which was so long the opprobrium of human
                    nature. ’ They furnish, too, a complete refutation of the extravagant chronology
                    of the Chaîdaeans and Egyptians, and show, if they be genuine, that the world is
                    indeed not older than it is said to be by Moses.</p>
