                    von</hi></label>, was born at Marbach, a small town in the duchy of Wurtemberg,
                    on the 10th day of November 1759. It will aid the reader in synchronizing the
                    periods of this great man’s life with the corresponding events throughout
                    Christendom, if we direct his attention to the fact, that Schiller’s birth
                    nearly coincided in point of time with that of Robert Burns, and that it
                    preceded that of Napoleon by about ten years.</p><p>The position of Schiller is remarkable. In the land of his birth, by those who
                    undervalue him the most, he is ranked as the second name in German literature;
                    everywhere else he is ranked, as the first. For us, who are aliens to Germany,
                    Schiller is the representative of the German intellect in its highest form; and
                    to him, at all events, whether first or second, it is certainly due, that the
                    German intellect has become a known power, and a power of growing magnitude, for
                    the great commonwealth of Christendom. Luther and Kepler, potent intellects as
                    they were, did not make themselves known as Germans: the revolutionary vigour of
                    the one, the starry lustre of the other, blended with the convulsions of
                    reformation, or with the aurora of ascending science, in too kindly and genial a
                    tone to call off the attention from the work which they performed, from the
                    service which they promoted, to the circumstances of their personal position.
                    Their country, their birth, their abode, even their separate existence, was
                    merged in the mighty cause to which they lent their co-operation. And thus at
                    the beginning of the sixteenth century, thus at the beginning of the
                    seventeenth, did the Titan sons of Germany defeat their own private pretensions
                    by the very grandeur of their merits. Their interest as patriots was lost and
                    confounded in their paramount interest as cosmopolites. What<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=737" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0737-0681"/>
                    they did for man and for human dignity eclipsed what they had designed for
                    Germany. After them there was a long in-terlunar period of darkness for the land
                    of the Rhine and the Danube. The German energy, too spasmodically excited,
                    suffered a collapse. Throughout the whole of the seventeenth century, but one
                    vigorous mind arose for permanent effects in literature. This was Opitz, a poet
                    who deserves even yet to be read with attention, but who is no more worthy to be
                    classed as the Dryden whom his too partial countrymen have styled him, than the
                    Germany of the Thirty Years’ War of taking rank by the side of civilized and
                    cultured England during the Cromwellian era, or Klopstock of sitting on the same
                    throne with Milton. Leibnitz was the one sole potentate in the fields of
                    intellect whom the Germany of this century produced; and he, like Luther and
                    Kepler, impresses us rather as a European than as a German mind, partly perhaps
                    from his having pursued his selfdevelopment in foreign lands, partly from his
                    large circle of foreign connections, but most of all from his having written
                    chiefly in French or in Latin. Passing onwards to the eighteenth century, we
                    find, through its earlier half, an absolute wilderness, unreclaimed and without
                    promise of natural vegetation, as the barren arena on which the few insipid
                    writers of Germany paraded. The torpor of academic dulness domineered over the
                    length and breadth of the land. And as these academic bodies were universally
                    found harnessed in the equipage of petty courts, it followed that the lethargies
                    of pedantic dulness were uniformly deepened by the lethargies of aulic and
                    ceremonial dulness; so that, if the reader represents to himself the very
                    abstract of birthday odes, sycophantish dedications, and court sermons, he will
                    have some adequate idea of the sterility and the mechanical formality which at
                    that era spread the sleep of death over German literature. Literature, the very
                    word literature, points the laughter of scorn to what passed under that name
                    during the period of Gottsched. That such a man indeed as this Gottsched, equal
                    at the best to the composition of a Latin grammar or a school arithmetic, should
                    for a moment have presided over the German muses, stands out as in itself a
                    brief and significant memorial, too certain for contradiction, and yet almost
                    too gross for belief, of the apoplectic sleep under which the mind of central
                    Europe at that era lay oppressed. The rust of disuse had corroded the very
                    principles of activity. And, as if the double night of academic dulness,
                    combined with the dulness of court inanities, had not been sufficient for the
                    stifling of all native energies, the feebleness of French models (and of these
                    moreover naturalized through still feebler imitations) had become the law and
                    standard for all attempts at original composition. The darkness of night, it is
                    usually said, grows deeper as it approaches the dawn; and the very enormity of
                    that prostration under which the German intellect at this time groaned, was the
                    most certain pledge to any observing eye of that intense re-action soon to stir
                    and kindle among the smouldering activities of this spell-bound people. This
                    re-action, however, was not abrupt and theatrical: it moved through slow stages
                    and by equable gradations: it might be said to commence from the middle of the
                    eighteenth century, that is, about nine years before the birth of Schiller; but
                    a progress of forty years had not carried it so far towards its meridian
                    altitude, as that the sympathetic shock from the French Revolution was by one
                    fraction more rude and shattering than the public torpor still demanded. There
                    is a memorable correspondency throughout all members of Protestant Christendom
                    in whatsoever relates to literature and intellectual advance. However imperfect
                    the organization which binds them together, it was sufficient even in these
                    elder times to transmit reciprocally from one to every other, so much of that
                    illumination which could be gathered into books, that no Christian state could
                    be much in advance of another, supposing that Popery op posed no barriers to
                    free communication, unless only in those points which depended upon local gifts
                    of nature, upon the genius of a particular people, or upon the excellence of its
                    institutions. These advantages were incommunicable, let the freedom of
                    intercourse have been what it might.: England could not send off by posts or by
                    heralds her iron and coals; she could not send the indomitable energy of her
                    population; she could not send the absolute security of property; she could not
                    send the good faith of her parliaments. These were gifts indigenous to herself,
                    either through the temperament of her people, or through the original endowments
                    of her soil. But her condition of moral sentiment, her high-toned civic
                    elevation, her atmosphere of political feeling and popular boldness,—much of
                    these she could and did transmit, by the radiation of the press, to the very
                    extremities of the German empire. Not only were our books translated, but it is
                    notorious to those acquainted with German novels, or other pictures of German
                    society, that as early as the Seven Years’ War (1756-1763), in fact, from the
                    very era when Cave and Dr Johnson first made the parliamentary debates
                    accessible to the English themselves, most of the German journals repeated, and
                    sent forward as by telegraph, these senatorial displays to every village
                    throughout Germany. From the polar latitudes to the Mediterranean, from the
                    mouths of the Rhine to the Euxine, there was no other exhibition of free
                    deliberative eloquence in any popular assembly. And the <hi rend="italic">Luise</hi> of Voss alone, a metrical idyll not less valued for its truth of
                    portraiture than our own Vicar of Wakefield, will show, that the most
                    sequestered clergyman of a rural parish did not think his breakfast equipage
                    complete without the latest report from the great senate that sat in London.
                    Hence we need not be astonished that German and English literature were found by
                    the French Revolution in pretty nearly the same condition of semi-vigilance and
                    imperfect animation. That mighty event reached us both, reached us all, we may
                    say (speaking of Protestant states), at the same moment, by the same tremendous
                    galvanism. The snake, the intellectual snake, that lay in ambush among all
                    nations, roused itself, sloughed itself, renewed its youth, in all of them at
                    the same period. A new world opened upon us all; new revolutions of thought
                    arose; new and nobler activities were born; “and other palms were won.” .</p><p>But by and through Schiller it was, as its main organ, that this great
                    revolutionary impulse expressed itself. Already, as we have said, not less than
                    forty years before the earthquake by which France exploded and projected the
                    scoria of her huge crater over all Christian lands, a stirring had commenced
                    among the dry bones of intellectual Germany; and symptoms arose that the breath
                    of life would soon disturb, by nobler agitations than by petty personal
                    quarrels, the death-like repose even of the German universities. Precisely in
                    those bodies however it was, in those as connected with tyrannical governments,
                    each academic body being shackled to its own petty centre of local despotism,
                    that the old spells remained unlinked; and to them, equally remarkable as firm
                    trustees of truth, and as obstinate depositories of darkness or of superannuated
                    prejudice, we must ascribe the slowness of the German movement on the path of
                    reascent. Meantime the earliest torch-bearer to the murky literature of this
                    great land, this crystallisation of political states, was Bodmer. This man had
                    no demoniac genius, such as the service required; but he had some taste, and,
                    what was better, he had some sensibility. He lived among the Alps; and his
                    reading lay among the alpine sublimities of Milton and Shakspeare. Through his
                    very eyes he imbibed a daily scorn of Gottsched and his monstrous compound of
                    German coarseness with French sensual levity. He could not look at his native
                    Alps, but he saw in them, and their austere grandeurs or their dread realities,
                    a spiritual reproach to the hollowness and falsehood<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=738" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0738-0682"/>
                    of that dull imposture which Gottsched offered by way of substitute for nature.
                    He was taught by the Alps to crave for something nobler and deeper. Bodmer,
                    though far below such a function, rose by favour of circumstances into an
                    apostle or missionary of truth for Germany. He translated passages of English
                    literature. He inoculated with his own sympathies the more fervent mind of the
                    youthful Klopstock, who visited him in Switzerland. And it soon became evident
                    that Germany was not dead, but sleeping; and once again, legibly for any eye,
                    the pulses of life began to play freely through the vast organization of central
                    Europe.</p><p>Klopstock, however, though a fervid, a religious, and for that reason an
                    anti-Gallican mind, was himself an abortion. Such at least is our own opinion of
                    this poet. He was the child and creature of enthusiasm, but of enthusiasm not
                    allied with a masculine intellect, or any organ for that capacious vision and
                    meditative range which his subjects demanded. He was essentially thoughtless,
                    betrays everywhere a most effeminate quality of sensibility, and is the sport of
                    that pseudo-enthusiasm and baseless rapture which we see so often allied with
                    the excitement of strong liquors. In taste, or the sense of proportions and
                    congruences, or the harmonious adaptations, he is perhaps the most defective
                    writer extant.</p><p>But if no patriarch of German literature, in the sense of having shaped the
                    moulds in which it was to flow, in the sense of having disciplined its taste or
                    excited its rivalship by classical models of excellence, or raised a finished
                    standard of style, perhaps we must concede that, on a minor scale, Klopstock did
                    something of that service in every one of these departments. His works were at
                    least Miltonic in their choice of subjects, if ludicrously non-Miltonic in their
                    treatment of those subjects. And, whether due to him or not, it is undeniable
                    that in his time the mother-tongue of Germany revived from the most absolute
                    degradation on record, to its ancient purity. In the time of Gottsched, the
                    authors of Germany wrote a macaronic jargon, in which French and Latin made up a
                    considerable proportion of every sentence: nay, it happened often that foreign
                    words were inflected with German forms; and the whole result was such as to
                    remind the reader of the medical examination in the <hi rend="italic">Malade
                    Imaginaire</hi> of Molière,</p><p>Quid poctea est à faire?</p><p>Saignare</p><p>Baignare</p><p>Ensuita purgare, 4c.</p><p>Now is it reasonable to ascribe some share in the restoration of good to
                    Klopstock, both because his own writings exhibit nothing of this most abject
                    euphuism (a euphuism expressing itself not in fantastic refinements on the
                    staple of the language, but altogether in rejecting it for foreign words and
                    idioms), and because he wτote expressly on the subject of style and
                    composition.</p><p>Wieland, meantime, if not enjoying so intense an acceptation as Klopstock, had a
                    more extensive one; and it is in vain to deny him the praise of a festive,
                    brilliant, and most versatile wit. The Schlegels showed the haughty malignity of
                    their ungenerous natures, in depreciating Wieland, at a time when old age had
                    laid a freezing hand upon the energy which he would once have put forth in
                    defending himself. He was the Voltaire of Germany, and very much more than the
                    Voltaire; for his romantic and legendary poems are above the level of Voltaire.
                    But, on the other hand, he was a Voltaire in sensual impurity. To work, to carry
                    on a plot, to affect his readers by voluptuous impressions,—these were the
                    unworthy aims of Wieland; and though a good natured critic would not refuse to
                    make some allowance for a youthful poet’s aberrations in this respect, yet the
                    indulgence cannot extend itself to mature years. An old man corrupting his
                    readers, attempting to corrupt them, or relying for his effect upon corruptions
                    already effected, in the purity of their affections, is a hideous object; and
                    that must be a precarious influence indeed which depends for its durability upon
                    the licentiousness of men. Wieland, therefore, except in parts, will not last as
                    a national idol; but such he was nevertheless for a time.</p><p>Bürger wrote too little of any expansive compass to give the measure of his
                    powers, or to found national impression; Lichtenberg, though a very sagacious
                    observer, never rose into what can be called a <hi rend="italic">power—</hi> he
                    did not modify his age; yet these were both men of extraordinary talent, and
                    Bürger a man of undoubted genius. On the other hand, Lessing was merely a man of
                    talent, but of talent in the highest degree adapted to popularity. His very
                    defects, and the shallowness of his philosophy, promoted his popularity; and by
                    comparison with the French critics on the dramatic or scenical proprieties he is
                    ever profound. His plummet, if not suited to the soundless depths of Shakspeare,
                    was able ten times over to fathom the little rivulets of Parisian philosophy.
                    This he did effectually, and thus unconsciously levelled the paths for
                    Shakspeare, and for that supreme dominion which he has since held over the
                    German stage, by crushing with his sarcastic shrewdness the pretensions of all
                    who stood in the way. At that time, and even yet, the functions of a literary
                    man were very important in Germany: the popular mind and the popular instinct
                    pointed one way, those of the little courts another. Multitudes of little German
                    states (many of which were absorbed since 1816 by the process of <hi rend="italic">mediatizing)</hi> made it their ambition to play at keeping mimic
                    armies in their pay, and to ape the greater military sovereigns, by encouraging
                    French literature only, and the French language at their courts. It was this
                    latter propensity which had generated the anomalous macaronic dialect, of which
                    we have already spoken as a characteristic circumstance in the social features
                    of literary Germany during the first half of the eighteenth century. Nowhere
                    else, within the records of human follies, do we find a corresponding case in
                    which the government and the patrician orders in the state, taking for granted,
                    and absolutely postulating the utter worthlessness for intellectual aims of
                    those in and by whom they maintained their own grandeur and independence,
                    undisguisedly and even professedly sought to ally themselves with a foreign
                    literature, foreign literati, and a foreign language. In this unexampled display
                    of scorn for native resources, and the consequent collision between the two
                    principles of action, all depended upon the people themselves. For a time the
                    wicked and most profligate contempt of the local governments for that native
                    merit which it was their duty to evoke and to cherish, naturally enough produced
                    its own justification. Like Jews or slaves, whom all the world have agreed to
                    hold contemptible, the German literati found it hard to make head against so
                    obstinate a prejudgment; and too often they became all that they were presumed
                    to be. <hi rend="italic">Sint Maecenates, non dee-runt, Flacce, Marones.</hi>
                    And the converse too often holds good—that when all who should have smiled scowl
                    upon a man, he turns out the abject thing they have predicted. Where Frenchified
                    Fredericks sit upon German thrones, it should not surprise us to see a crop of
                    Gottscheds arise as the best fruitage of the land. But when there is any latent
                    nobility in the popular mind, such scorn, by its very extremity, will call forth
                    its own counteraction. It was perhaps good for Germany that a prince so eminent
                    in one aspect as <hi rend="italic">Fritz der einziger,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">“Freddy the unique;”</hi>
                    which is the name by which the Prussians expressed their admiration of their
                    martial and indomitable, though somewhat fantastic, king.</p></note> should put
                    on record so emphatically his intense conviction, that no good thing could arise
                    out of Ger<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=739" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0739-0683"/>many. This creed was expressed by the quality of
                    the French minds which he attracted to his court. The very refuse and dregs of
                    the Parisian coteries satisfied his hunger for French garbage; the very offal of
                    their shambles met the demand of his palate; even a Maupertuis, so long as he
                    could produce a French baptismal certificate, was good enough to manufacture
                    into the president of a Berlin academy. Such scorn challenged a re-action: the
                    contest lay between the thrones of Germany and the popular intellect, and the
                    final result was inevitable. Once aware that they were insulted, once
                    enlightened to the full consciousness of the scorn which trampled on them as
                    intellectual and predestined Helots, even the mild-tempered Germans became
                    fierce, and now began to aspire, not merely under the ordinary instincts of
                    personal ambition, but with a vindictive feeling, and as conscious agents of
                    retribution. It became a pleasure with the German author, that the very same
                    works which elevated himself, wreaked his nation upon their princes, and poured
                    retorted scorn upon their most ungenerous and unparental sovereigns. Already, in
                    the reign of the martial Frederick, the men who put most weight of authority
                    into his contempt of Germans,—Euler, the matchless Euler, Lambert, and Immanuel
                    Kant,—had vindicated the pre-eminence of German mathematics. Already, in 1755,
                    had the same Immanuel Kant, whilst yet a probationer for the chair of logic in a
                    Prussian university, sketched the outline of that philosophy which has secured
                    the admiration, though not the assent, of all men known and proved to have
                    understood it, of all men able to state its doctrines in terms admissible by its
                    disciples. Already, and even previously, had Haller, who wrote in German, placed
                    himself at the head of the current physiology. And in the fields of science or
                    of philosophy, the victory was already decided for the German intellect in
                    competition with the French.</p><p>But the fields of literature were still comparatively barren. Klopstock was at
                    least an anomaly; Lessing did not present himself in the impassioned walks of
                    literature; Herder was viewed too much in the exclusive and professional light
                    of a clergyman; and, with the exception of John Paul Richter, a man of most
                    original genius, but quite unfitted for general popularity, no commanding mind
                    arose in Germany with powers for levying homage from foreign nations, until the
                    appearance, as a great scenical poet, of Frederick Schiller.</p><p>The father of this great poet was Caspar Schiller, an officer in the military
                    service of the Duke of Würtemberg. He had previously served as a surgeon in the
                    Bavarian army; but on his final return to his native country of Würtemberg, and
                    to the service of his native prince, he laid aside his medical character for
                    ever, and obtained a commission as ensign and adjutant. In 1763, the peace of
                    Paris threw him out of his military employment, with the nominal rank of
                    captain. But, having conciliated the duke’s favour, he was still borne on the
                    books of the ducal establishment; and, as a planner of ornamental gardens, or in
                    some other civil capacity, he continued to serve his serene highness for the
                    rest of his life.</p><p>The parents of Schiller were both pious, upright persons, with that loyal
                    fidelity to duty, and that humble simplicity of demeanour towards their
                    superiors, which is so often found among the unpretending natives of Germany. It
                    is probable, however, that Schiller owed to his mother exclusively the
                    preternatural endowments of his intellect. She was of humble origin, the
                    daughter of a baker, and not so fortunate as to have received much education.
                    But she was apparently rich in gifts of the heart and the understanding. She
                    read poetry with delight; and through the profound filial love with which she
                    had inspired her son, she found it easy to communicate her own literary tastes.
                    Her husband was not illiterate, and had in mature life so laudably applied
                    himself to the improvement of his own defective knowledge, that at length he
                    thought himself capable of appearing before the public as an author. His book
                    related simply to the subjects of his professional experience as a
                    horticulturist, and was entitled <hi rend="italic">Die Baum· zuckt im
                    Grossen</hi> (On the Management of Forests). Some merit we must suppose it to
                    have had, since the public called for a second edition of it long after his own
                    death, and even after that of his illustrious son. And although he was a plain
                    man, of no pretensions, and possibly even of slow faculties, he has left behind
                    him a prayer, in which there is one petition of sublime and pathetic piety,
                    worthy to be remembered by the side of Agar’s wise prayer against the almost
                    equal temptations of poverty and riches. At the birth of his son, he had been
                    reflecting with sorrowful anxiety, not unmingled with self-reproach, on his own
                    many disqualifications for conducting the education of the child. But at length,
                    reading in his own manifold imperfections but so many reiterations of the
                    necessity that he should rely upon'God’s bounty, converting his very defects
                    into so many argument of hope and confidence in heaven, he prayed thus: “Oh God,
                    that knowest my poverty in good gifts for my son’s inheritance, graciously
                    permit that, even as the want of bread became to thy Son’s hunger-stricken flock
                    in the wilderness the pledge of overflowing abundance, so likewise my darkness
                    may, in its sad extremity, carry with it the measure of thy unfathomable light;
                    and because I, thy worm, cannot give to my son the least of blessings, do thou
                    give the greatest; because in my hands there is not any thing, do thou from
                    thine pour out all things; and that temple of a new-born spirit, which I cannot
                    adorn even with earthly ornaments of dust and ashes, do thou irradiate with the
                    celestial adornment of thy presence, and finally with that peace that passeth
                    all understanding.”</p><p>Reared at the feet of parents so pious and affectionate, Schiller would doubtless
                    pass a happy childhood; and probably to this utter tranquillity of his earlier
                    years, to his seclusion from all that could create pain, or even anxiety, we
                    must ascribe the unusual dearth of anecdotes from this period of his life; a
                    dearth which has tempted some of his biographers into improving and embellishing
                    some puerile stories, which a man of sense will inevitably reject as too trivial
                    for his gravity or too fantastical for his faith. That nation is happy,
                    according to a common adage, which furnishes little Business to the historian;
                    for such a vacuity in facts argues a condition of perfect peace and silent
                    prosperity. That childhood is happy, or may generally be presumed such, which
                    has furnished few records of external experience, little that has appeared in
                    doing or in suffering to the eyes of companions; for the child who has been made
                    happy by early thoughtfulness, and by infantine struggles with the great ideas
                    of his origin and his destination (ideas which settle with a deep, dove-like
                    brooding upon the mind of childhood, more than of mature life, vexed with
                    inroads from the noisy world), will not manifest the workings of his spirit by
                    much of external activity. The <hi rend="italic">fallentis semita vitee,</hi>
                    that path of noiseless life, which eludes and deceives the conscious notice both
                    of its subject and of all around him, opens equally to the man and to the child;
                    and the happiest of all childhoods will have been that of which the happiness
                    has survived and expressed itself, not in distinct records, but in deep
                    affection, in abiding love, and the hauntings of meditative power.</p><p>Such a childhood, in the bosom of maternal tenderness, was probably passed by
                    Schiller; and his first awaking to the world of strife and perplexity happened
                    in his fourteenth year. Up to that period his life had been vagrant, agreeably
                    to the shifting necessities of the ducal service; and his education desultory
                    and domestic. But in the year 1773 he was solemnly entered as a member of a new
                    aca-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=740" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0740-0684"/> demical institution, founded by the reigning
                    duke, and recently translated to his little capital of Stuttgard. This change
                    took place at the special request of the duke, who, under the mask of patronage,
                    took upon himself the severe control of the whole simple family. The parents
                    were probably both too humble and dutiful in spirit towards one whom they
                    regarded in the double light of sovereign lord and of personal benefactor, ever
                    to murmur at the ducal behests, far less to resist them. The duke was for them
                    an earthly providence; and they resigned themselves, together with their child,
                    to the disposal of him who dispensed their earthly blessings, not less meekly
                    than of Him whose vicegerent they presumed him to be. In such a frame of mind,
                    requests are but another name for commands; and thus it happened that a second
                    change arose upon the first, even more determinately fatal to the young
                    Schiller’s happiness. Hitherto he had cherished a day-dream pointing to the
                    pastoral office in some rural district, as that which would harmonize best with
                    his intellectual purposes, with his love of quiet, and, by means of its
                    preparatory requirements, best also with his own peculiar choice of studies. But
                    this scheme he now found himself compelled to sacrifice; and the two evils which
                    fell upon him concurrently in his new situation were, first, the formal military
                    discipline and monotonous routine of duty; secondly, the uncongenial direction
                    of the studies, which were shaped entirely to the attainment of legal knowledge,
                    and the narrow service of the local tribunals. So illiberal and so exclusive a
                    system of education was revolting to the expansive mind of Schiller; and the
                    military bondage under which this system was enforced, shocked the aspiring
                    nobility of his moral nature, not less than the technical narrowness of the
                    studies shocked his understanding. In point of expense the whole establishment
                    cost nothing at all to those parents who were privileged servants of the duke:
                    in this number were the parents of Schiller, and that single consideration
                    weighed too powerfully upon his filial piety to allow of his openly murmuring at
                    his lot; while on <hi rend="italic">their</hi> part the parents were equally shy
                    of encouraging a disgust which too obviously tended to defeat the promises of
                    ducal favour. This system of monotonous confinement was therefore carried to its
                    completion, and the murmurs of the young Schiller were either dutifully
                    suppressed, or found vent only in secret letters to a friend. In one point only
                    Schiller was able to improve his condition; jointly with the juristic
                    department, was another for training young aspirants to the medical profession.
                    To this, as promising a more enlarged scheme of study, Schiller by permission
                    transferred himself in 1775. But whatever relief he might find in the nature of
                    his new studies, he found none at all in the system of personal discipline which
                    prevailed.</p><p>Under the oppression of this detested system, and by pure re-action against its
                    wearing persecutions, we learn from Schiller himself, that in his nineteenth
                    year he undertook the earliest of his surviving plays, the Robbers, beyond doubt
                    the most tempestuous, the most volcanic, we might say, of all juvenile creations
                    anywhere recorded. He himself calls it “a monster,” and a monster it is; but a
                    monster which has never failed to convulse the heart of young readers with the
                    temperament of intellectual enthusiasm and sensibility. True it is, and nobody
                    was more aware of that fact than Schiller himself in after years, the characters
                    of the three Moors, father and sons, are mere impossibilities; and some readers,
                    in whom the judicious acquaintance with human life in its realities has outrun
                    the sensibilities, are so much shocked by these hypernatural phenomena, that
                    they are incapable of enjoying the terrific sublimities which on that basis of
                    the visionary do really exist. A poet, perhaps Schiller might have alleged, is
                    entitled to assume hypothetically so much in the previous positions or
                    circumstances of his agents as is requisite to the basis from which he starts.
                    It is undeniable that Shakspeare and others have availed themselves of this
                    principle, and with memorable success. Shakspeare, for instance, <hi rend="italic">postulates</hi> his witches, his Caliban, his Ariel: grant, he
                    virtually says, such modes of spiritual existence or of spiritual relations as a
                    possibility; do not expect me to demonstrate this, and upon that single
                    concession I will rear a superstructure that shall be self-consistent; every
                    thing shall be <hi rend="italic">internally</hi> coherent and reconciled,
                    whatever be its <hi rend="italic">external</hi> relations as to our human
                    experience. But this species of assumption, on the largest scale, is more within
                    the limits of credibility and plausible verisimilitude when applied to modes of
                    existence, which, after all, are in such total darkness to us (the limits of the
                    possible being so undefined and shadowy as to what can or cannot exist), than
                    the very slightest liberties taken with human character, or with those
                    principles of action, motives, and feelings, upon which men would move under
                    given circumstances, or with the modes of action which in common prudence they
                    would be likely to adopt. The truth is, that, as a coherent work of art, the
                    Robbers is indefensible; but, however monstrous it may be pronounced, it
                    possesses a power to agitate and convulse, which will always obliterate its
                    great faults to the young, and to all whose judgment is not too much developed.
                    And the best apology for Schiller is found in his own words in recording the
                    circumstances and causes under which this anomalous production arose. “To
                    escape,” says he, “from the formalities of a discipline which was odious to my
                    heart, I sought a retreat in the world of ideas and shadowy possibilities, while
                    as yet I knew nothing at all of that human world from which I was harshly
                    secluded by iron bars. Of men, the actual men in this world below, I knew
                    absolutely nothing at the time when I composed my Robbers. Four hundred human
                    beings, it is true, were my fellow-prisoners in this abode; but they were mere
                    tautologies and reiterations of the self-same mechanic creature, and like so
                    many plaster casts from the same original statue. Thus situated, of necessity I
                    failed. In making the attempt, my chisel brought out a monster, of which [and
                    that was fortunate] the world had no type or resemblance to show.”</p><p>Meantime this demoniac drama produced very opposite results to Schiller’s
                    reputation. Among the young men of Germany it was received with an enthusiasm
                    absolutely unparalleled, though it is perfectly untrue that it excited some
                    persons of rank and splendid expectations (as a current fable asserted) to
                    imitate Charles Moor in becoming robbers. On the other hand, the play was of too
                    powerful a cast not in any case to have alarmed his serenity the Duke of
                    Würtemberg; for it argued a most revolutionary mind, and the utmost audacity of
                    self-will. But besides this general ground of censure, there arose a special
                    one, in a quarter so remote that this one fact may serve to evidence the extent
                    as well as intensity of the impression made. The territory of the Grisons had
                    been called by Spiegelberg, one of the robbers, “the Thief’s Athens.” Upon this
                    the magistrates of that country presented a complaint to the duke; and his
                    highness, having cited Schiller to his presence, and severely reprimanded him,
                    issued a decree that this dangerous young student should henceforth confine
                    himself to his medical studies.</p><p>The persecution which followed exhibits such extraordinary exertions of
                    despotism, even for that land of irresponsible power, that we must presume the
                    duke to have relied more upon the hold which he had upon Schiller through his
                    affection for parents so absolutely dependent on his highness’s power, than upon
                    any laws, good or bad, which he could have pleaded as his warrant. Germany,
                    however, thought otherwise of the new tragedy than the serene critic of
                    Würtemberg; it was performed with vast applause at the neighbouring city <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Mannheim; and thither, under<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=741" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0741-0685"/> a
                    most excusable interest in his own play, the young poet clandestinely went. On
                    his return he was placed under arrest. And soon afterwards, being now thoroughly
                    disgusted, and, with some reason, alarmed by the tyranny of the duke, Schiller
                    finally eloped to Mannheim, availing himself of the confusion created in
                    Stuttgard by the visit of a foreign prince.</p><p>At Mannheim he lived in the house of Dalberg, a man of some rank and of sounding
                    titles, but in Mannheim known chiefly as the literary manager (or what is called
                    director) of the theatre. This connection aided in determining the subsequent
                    direction of Schiller’s talents; and his Fiesco, his Intrigue and Love, his Don
                    Carlos, and his Maria Stuart, followed within a short period of years. None of
                    these are so far free from the faults of the Robbers as to merit a separate
                    notice; for with less power, they are almost equally licentious. Finally,
                    however, he brought out his Wallenstein, an immortal drama, and, beyond all
                    competition, the nearest in point of excellence to the dramas of Shakspeare. The
                    position of the characters of Max. Piccolomini and the Princess Thekla is the
                    finest instance of what, in a critical sense, is called <hi rend="italic">relief,</hi> that literature offers. Young, innocent, unfortunate, among a camp
                    of ambitious, guilty, and bloodstained men, they offer a depth and solemnity of
                    impression which is equally required by way of contrast and of final repose.</p><p>From Mannheim, where he had a transient love affair with Laura Dalberg, the
                    daughter of his friend the director, Schiller removed to Jena, the celebrated
                    university in the territory of Weimar. The grand duke of that German Florence
                    was at this time gathering around him the most eminent of the German intellects;
                    and he was eager to enrol Schiller in the body of his professors. In 1799
                    Schiller received the chair of civil history; and not long after he married Miss
                    Lengefeld, with whom he had been for some time acquainted. In 1803 he was
                    ennobled; that is, he was raised to the rank of gentleman, and entitled to
                    attach the prefix of <hi rend="italic">Von</hi> to his name. His income was now
                    sufficient for domestic comfort and respectable independence; while in the
                    society of Goethe. Herder, and other eminent wits, he found even more relaxation
                    for his intellect, than his intellect, so fervent and so self-sustained, could
                    require.</p><p>Meantime the health of Schiller was gradually undermined: his lungs had been long
                    subject to attacks of disease; and the warning indications which constantly
                    arose of some deep-seated organic injuries in his pulmonary system ought to have
                    put him on his guard for some years before his death. Of all men, however, it is
                    remarkable that Schiller was the most criminally negligent of his health;
                    remarkable, we say, because for a period of four years Schiller had applied
                    himself seriously to the study of medicine. The strong coffee, and the wine,
                    which he drank, may not have been so injurious as his biographers suppose; but
                    his habit of sitting up through the night, and defrauding his wasted frame of
                    all natural and restorative sleep, had something in it of that guilt which
                    belongs to suicide. On the 9th of May 1805 his complaint reached its crisis.
                    Early in the morning he became delirious; at noon his delirium abated; and at
                    four in the afternoon he fell into a gentle unagitated sleep, from which he soon
                    awoke. Conscious that he now stood on the very edge of the grave, he calmly and
                    fervently took a last farewell of his friends. At six in the evening he fell
                    again into sleep, from which, however, he again awoke once more to utter the
                    memorable declaration, “that many things were growing plain and clear to his
                    understanding.” After this the cloud of sleep again settled upon him; a sleep
                    which soon changed into the cloud of death.</p><p>This event produced a profound impression throughout Germany. The theatres were
                    closed at Weimar, and the funeral was conducted with public honours. The
                    position in point of time, and the peculiar services of Schiller to the</p><p>German literature, we have already stated: it remains to add, that in person he
                    was tall, and of a strong bony structure, but not muscular, and strikingly lean.
                    His forehead was lofty, his nose aquiline, and his mouth almost of Grecian
                    beauty. With other good points about his face, and with auburn hair, it may be
                    presumed that his whole appearance was pleasing and impressive, while in later
                    years the character of sadness and contemplative sensibility deepened the
                    impression of his countenance. We have said enough of his intellectual merit,
                    which places him in our judgment at the head of the Trans-Rhenish literature.
                    But we add in concluding, that Frederick von Schiller was something more than a
                    great author; he was also in an eminent sense a great man; and his works are not
                    more worthy of being studied for their singular force and originality, than his
                    moral character from its nobility and aspiring grandeur. (w. w. w.)</p></div></body></text></TEI>
