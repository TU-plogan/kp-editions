                    was born on the 19th of December 1742, at Stralsund, where his father had kept a
                    shop. When he was very young, he received the usual instructions of a private
                    school; and was afterwards advanced to an academy. At a very early age he showed
                    a strong desire to follow the profession of an apothecary, and his father
                    suffered him to gratify his inclinations. With Mr Bauch, an apothecary at
                    Gottenburg, he served his apprenticeship, which was completed in six years. He
                    remained, however, some time longer at that place, and it was there that he so
                    excellently laid the foundations of his knowledge. Among the various books which
                    he read that treated of chemical subjects, Kunckell’s Laboratory seems to have
                    been his favourite. He used to repeat many of the experiments contained in that
                    work privately in the night, when the rest of the family had retired to rest. A
                    friend of Scheele’s had remarked the progress which he had made in chemistry,
                    and had asked him by what inducements he had at first been led to study a
                    science in which he had gained such knowledge. Scheele replied, “The first
                    cause, my friend, arose from yourself. Nearly at the beginning of my
                    apprenticeship you advised me to read Neuman’s Chemistry, from the perusal of
                    which I became eager to make experiments myself; and I remember very well how I
                    mixed together, in a conserve-glass, oil of cloves and fuming acid of nitre,
                    which immediately took fire. I see also still before my eyes an unlucky
                    experiment which I made with pyrophorus. Circumstances of this kind did but the
                    more inflame my desire to repeat experiments.” After Scheele’s departure from
                    Gottenburg in the year 1765, he obtained a place with Kalstrom, an apothecary at
                    Malmo Two years afterwards he went from thence to Stockholm, and managed the
                    shop of Mr Scharenberg. In 1773, he changed this appointment for another at
                    Upsal, under Mr<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=735" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0735-0679"/> Loock. Here he was fortunately situated, as, from
                    his acquaintance with learned men, and from having free access to the university
                    laboratory, he had opportunities of increasing his knowledge. At this place also
                    he happily commenced the friendship which subsisted between him and Bergman.
                    During his residence at this place, Prince Henry of Prussia, accompanied by the
                    Duke of Sudermania, visited Upsal, and chose this opportunity to see the
                    academical laboratory. Scheele was accordingly appointed by the university to
                    exhibit to them some chemical experiments. This office he undertook, and showed
                    some of the most curious processes in chemistry. The two princes asked him many
                    questions, and expressed their approbation of the answers which he returned to
                    them. The duke asked him of what country he was, and seemed to be much pleased
                    when Scheele informed him that he was born at Stralsund. At their departure they
                    told the professor, who was present, that they should esteem it a favour if he
                    would permit the young man to have free access to the laboratory as often as he
                    chose to make experiments.</p><p>In the year 1777 Scheele was appointed by the Medical College to be apothecary at
                    Koping. It was at that place that he soon showed the world how great a man he
                    was, and that no place or situation could confine his abilities. When he was at
                    Stockholm he showed his acuteness as a chemist, as he discovered there the new
                    and wonderful acid contained in the fluor spar. It has been confidently asserted
                    that Scheele was the first who discovered the nature of the aerial acid, and
                    that whilst he was at Upsal he made many experiments to prove its properties.
                    This circumstance might probably have furnished Bergman with the means of
                    treating this subject more fully. At the same place he began the series of
                    excellent experiments on that remarkable mineral substance manganese; from which
                    investigation he was led to make the very valuable and interesting discovery of
                    oxymuriatic acid. At the same time he examined the properties of ponderous
                    earth.</p><p>At Koping he finished his Dissertation on Air and Fire; a work which the
                    celebrated Bergman most warmly recommended in the friendly preface which he
                    wrote for it. The theory which Scheele endeavours to prove in this treatise is,
                    that fire consists of pure air and phlogiston. According to more recent
                    opinions, if inflammable air be phlogiston, water is composed of these two
                    principles. Of these opinions we may say, in the words of Cicero, “Opiniones tam
                    variae sunt tamque inter se dissidentes ut alterum profecto fieri potest ut
                    earum nulla, alterum certe non potest ut plus una vera sit.” The author’s merit
                    in this work, exclusive of the encomiums of Bergman, was sufficient to obtain
                    the approbation of the public; as the ingenuity displayed in treating so
                    delicate a subject, and the many new and valuable observations which are
                    dispersed through the treatise, justly entitled the author to that fame which
                    his book procured him. It was spread abroad throughout every country, became
                    soon out of print, and was reprinted, and translated into many languages. The
                    English translation is enriched with the notes of that accurate and truly
                    philosophical genius Mr Richard Kirwan.</p><p>Scheele now diligently employed himself in contributing to the Transactions of
                    the Academy at Stockholm. He first pointed out a new way to prepare the salt of
                    benzoin. In the same year he discovered that arsenic, freed in a particular
                    manner from phlogiston, partakes of all the properties of an acid, and has its
                    peculiar affinities to other substances.</p><p>In a Dissertation on Flint, Clay, and Alum, he clearly overturned Beaumé’s
                    opinion of the identity of the siliceous and argillaceous earths. He published
                    an Analysis of the Human Calculus. He showed also a mode of preparing <hi rend="italic">mercurius dulcis</hi> in the humid way, and improved the process
                    of making the powder of algaroth. He analysed the mineral substance called
                    molybdena, or flexible black lead. He discovered a beautiful green pigment. He
                    showed us how to decompose the air of the atmosphere. He discovered that some
                    neutral salts are decomposed by lime and by iron. He decomposed plumbago, or the
                    common black lead. He observed, with peculiar ingenuity, an acid in milk, which
                    decomposes acetated alkali; and in his experiments on the sugar of milk, he
                    discovered another acid, different in some respects from the above-mentioned
                    acids and the common acid of sugar. He accomplished the decomposition of
                    tungsten, the component parts of which were before unknown, and found in it a
                    peculiar metallic acid united to lime. He published an excellent dissertation on
                    the different sorts of ether. He found out an easy way to preserve vinegar for
                    many years. His investigation of the colouring matter in Prussian blue, the
                    means he employed to separate it, and his discovery that alkali, sal ammoniac,
                    and charcoal, mixed together, will produce it, are strong marks of his
                    penetration and genius. He found out a peculiar sweet matter in expressed oils
                    after they have been boiled with litharge and water. He showed how the acid of
                    lemons may be obtained in crystals. He found the white powder in rhubarb, which
                    Model thought to be selenite, and which amounts to one seventh of the weight of
                    the root, to be calcareous earth united to the acid of sorrel. This suggested to
                    him the examination of the acid of sorrel. He precipitated acetate of lead with
                    it, and decomposed the precipitate thus obtained by the vitriolic acid, and by
                    this process he obtained the common acid of sugar; and by slowly dropping a
                    solution of fixed alkali into a solution of the acid of sugar, he regenerated
                    the acid of sorrel. From his examination of the acids contained in fruits and
                    berries, he found not one species of acid alone, viz. the acid of lemon, but
                    also another, which he denominated the malaceous or malic acid, from its being
                    found in the greatest quantity in apples.</p><p>By the decomposition of Bergman’s new metal, siderite, he showed the truth of
                    Meyer’s and Klaproth’s conjecture concerning it. He boiled the calx of siderite
                    with alkali of tartar, and precipitated nitrate of mercury by the middle salt
                    which he obtained by this operation. The calx of mercury which was precipitated
                    was found to be united to the acid of phosphorus, so that he demonstrates that
                    this calx was phosphoretted iron. He found also that the native Prussian blue
                    contained the same acid. He discovered, by the same means, that the perlate
                    acid, as it was called, was not an acid <hi rend="italic">sui generis,</hi> but
                    the phosphoric united to a small quantity of the mineral alkali. He suggested an
                    improvement in the process for obtaining magnesia from Epsom salt; and he
                    advises the adding of an equal weight of common salt to the Epsom salt, so that
                    an equal weight of Glauber’s salt may be obtained; but this will not succeed
                    unless during the cold of winter. These are the valuable discoveries of this
                    great philosopher, which are to be found in the Transactions of the Royal
                    Society at Stockholm. Most of his essays have been published in French by Madame
                    Pi-cardet and M. Morveau of Dijon. Dr Beddoes also has made a very valuable
                    present to his countrymen of an English translation of a great part of Scheele’s
                    dissertations, to which he has added some useful and ingenious notes.</p><p>Viewing Scheele as a philosopher, we must judge of him from his many and
                    important discoveries. What concerns him as a man we are informed of by his
                    friends, who affirm that his moral character was irreproachable. It was matter
                    of remark, that his chemical apparatus was neither neat nor convenient; his
                    laboratory was small and confined; nor was he particular in regard to the
                    vessels which he employed in his experiments, so that we may justly wonder how
                    such discoveries and such experiments could have been made. He understood none
                    of the modem languages except the German and Swedish; and he had not the
                    advan-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=736" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0736-0680"/> tage of being benefited by the early intelligence
                    of discoveries made by foreigners, but was forced to wait till the intelligence
                    was conveyed to him in the slow and uncertain channel of translation.</p><p>It was often wished that he would quit his retirement at Koping, and move in a
                    larger sphere. It was suggested to him that a place might be procured in
                    England, which might afford him a good income and more leisure; and indeed
                    latterly an offer was made to him of an annuity of L.300 if he would settle in
                    this country. But death put an end to this project. For half a year before this
                    melancholy event his health had been declining, and he himself was sensible that
                    he would not recover. On the l9th of May 1786 he was confined to his bed; on the
                    21st he bequeathed all of which he was possessed to his wife, who was the widow
                    of his predecessor at Koping, and whom he had lately married; and on the same
                    day he departed this life. Thus, in less than two years, the world lost Bergman
                    and Scheele, of whom Sweden may justly boast, as philosophers who were beloved
                    and lamented by all their contemporaries, and whose memory posterity will never
                    cease to revere.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
