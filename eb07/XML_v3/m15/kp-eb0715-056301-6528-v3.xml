                    rend="italic">in Mortmain (in</hi><hi rend="italic">mortua</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >manu),</hi> is an alienation of lands or tenements to any corporation, sole or
                    aggregate, ecclesiastical or temporal. But these purchases having been chiefly
                    made by religious houses, in consequence of which the lands became perpetually
                    inherent in one dead hand, this occasioned the general appellation of <hi
                    rend="italic">mortmain</hi> to be applied to such alienations, and the religious
                    houses themselves were principally considered in framing the statutes of
                    mortmain. In deducing the history of these statutes, it will be matter of
                    curiosity to observe the great address and subtle contrivance of the
                    ecclesiastics, in eluding from time to time the laws in being, and the zeal with
                    which successive parliaments pursued them through all their finesses; how new
                    remedies were still the parents of fresh evasions, until the legislature at
                    last, though with difficulty, obtained a decisive victory.</p>
                <p>By the common law any man might dispose of his lands to any other private man at
                    his own discretion, especially when the feudal restraints of alienation were
                    worn away. Yet in consequence of these it was always and still is necessary for
                    corporations to have a license of mortmain from the crown, to enable them to
                    purchase lands; for as the king is the ultimate lord of every fee, he ought not,
                    unless by his own consent, to lose his privilege of escheats and other feudal
                    profits, by the vesting of lands in tenants who can never be attainted or die.
                    Such licenses of mortmain appear to have been necessary amongst the Saxons above
                    sixty years before the Norman conquest. But, besides this general license from
                    the king as lord paramount of the kingdom, it was also requisite, whenever there
                    was a mesne or intermediate lord between the king and the alienor, to obtain his
                    license also for the alienation of the specific land; and if no such license was
                    obtained, the king or other lord might respectively enter on the land so
                    alienated in mortmain, as a forfeiture. The necessity of this license from the
                    crown was acknowledged by the Constitutions of Clarendon, in respect of
                    advowsons, which the monks always greatly coveted, as forming the groundwork of
                    subsequent appropriations. Yet such were the influence and ingenuity of the
                    clergy, that, notwithstanding this fundamental principle, we find that the
                    largest and most considerable donations of religious houses happened within less
                    than two centuries after the conquest. When a license could not beobtained, they
                    contrived that, as the forfeiture for such alienations accrued in the first
                    place to the immediate lord of the fee, the tenant who meant to alienate should
                    first convey his lands to the religious house, and instantly take them back
                    again to hold as tenant to the monastery, which kind of instantaneous seisin was
                    probably given not to occasion any forfeiture; and then, by pretext of some
                    other forfeiture, surrender, or escheat, the society entered into those lands in
                    right of such their newly acquired signiory, as immediate lords of the fee. But
                    when these donations began to grow numerous, it was observed that the feudal
                    services, ordained for the defence of the kingdom, were every day visibly
                    withdrawn; that the circulation of landed property from man to man began to
                    stagnate; and that the lords were curtailed of the fruits of their signiories,
                    their escheats, wardships, reliefs, and the like. To prevent this, therefore, it
                    was ordained by the second of King Henry IIL’s great charters, and afterwards by
                    that printed in the common statute-books, that all such attempts should be void,
                    and the land forfeited to the lord of the fee.</p>
                <p>But as this prohibition extended only to religious houses, bishops and other sole
                    corporations were not included therein; and the aggregate ecclesiastical bodies,
                    who had of their counsel the most learned men that they could get, found many
                    means to creep out of this statute, by buying in lands which were <hi
                    rend="italic">bona fide</hi> holden of themselves as lords of the fee, and
                    thereby evading the forfeiture; or by taking long leases for years, which first
                    introduced those extensive terms, for a thousand or more years, which are now so
                    frequent in conveyances. This produced the statute <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Religiosis,</hi> 7 Edward I., which provided, that no person,
                    religious or other whatsoever, should buy, or sell, or receive under pretence of
                    a gift, or term of years, or any other title whatsoever, nor should by any art
                    or ingenuity appropriate to himself, any lands or tenements in mortmain, upon
                    pain of the immediate lord of the fee, or, in default of him for one year, the
                    lords paramount, and in default of all of them, the king, entering thereon as a
                    forfeiture.</p>
                <p>This seemed to be a sufficient security against all alienations in mortmain. But
                    as these statutes extended only to gifts and conveyances between the parties,
                    the religious houses now began to set up a fictitious title to the land, which
                    it was intended they should have, and to bring an action to recover it against
                    the tenant, who, by arrangement and collusion, made no defence; and thereby
                    judgment was given for the religious house, which then recovered the land by a
                    sentence of law upon a supposed prior title. And thus they had the honour of
                    inventing those fictitious adjudications of right, which afterwards became the
                    great assurance of the kingdom, under the name of <hi rend="italic">common
                    recoveries.</hi> But upon this it was enacted by the second statute of
                    Westminster, 13 Edward I. c. 32, that in such cases a jury shall try the true
                    right of the demandants or plaintiffs to the land, and if the religious house or
                    corporation be found to have it, they shall still recover seisin; otherwise it
                    shall be forfeited to the immediate lord of the fee, or else to the next lord,
                    and finally to the king, upon default of the immediate or other lord. A similar
                    provision was made by the succeeding chapter, in case the tenants should set up
                    crosses upon their lands, the badges of knights templars and hospitallers, in
                    order to protect them from the feudal demands of their lords, by virtue of the
                    privileges of those religious and military orders. And. so careful was this
                    prince to prevent any future evasions, that when the statute of <hi
                    rend="italic">Quia</hi><hi rend="italic">emptores,</hi> 18 Edward I., abolished
                    sub-infeudations, and gave liberty to all men to alienate their lands to be
                    holden of their next immediate lord, a proviso was inserted that this should not
                    extend to authorize any kind of alienation in mortmain. When afterwards the
                    method of obtaining the king’s license by writ of <hi rend="italic">ad quod
                    damnum</hi> marked out by the statute 27 Edward I. st. 2, it was further
                    provided, by statute 34 Edward I. st. 3, that no such license should be
                    effectual without the consent of the mesne or intermediate lords.</p>
                <p>Yet still it was found difficult to set bounds to ecclesiastical ingenuity. For
                    when the clergy were driven out of all their former holds, they devised a new
                    method of conveyance, by which the lands were granted, not to themselves
                    directly, but only to nominal feoffees for the use of the religious houses, thus
                    distinguishing between the possession and the use, and receiving the actual
                    profits, whilst the seisin of the land remained in the nominal feoffee, who was
                    held by the courts of equity, then under the direction of the clergy, to be
                    bound in conscience to account to his <hi rend="italic">cestuy</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">que</hi><hi rend="italic">use</hi> for the rents and emoluments of
                    the estate. And it is to these inventions that our practitioners are indebted
                    for the introduction of uses and trusts, the foundation of modern conveyancing.
                    But, unfortunately for the inventors themselves, they did not long enjoy the
                    advantage of their new device; for the statute 15 Richard II. c. 5, enacts, that
                    the lands which had been so purchased to uses should be admortised by license
                    from the crown, or else be sold to private persons, and that for the future uses
                    should be subject to the statutes of mortmain, and forfeitable like the lands
                    themselves. And as the statutes had been notoriously eluded by purchasing large
                    tracts of land adjoining to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193826541"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-6541-0564"/>churches, and consecrating them by the name of
                    “churchyards,” such subtle imagination was also declared to be within the
                    compass of the statutes of mortmain. Civil or lay corporations, as well as
                    ecclesiastical, were also declared to be within the mischief, and of course
                    within the remedy provided by those salutary laws. Lastly, as, during the times
                    of popery, lands were frequently given for superstitious uses, though not to any
                    corporate bodies, or were rendered liable in the hands of heirs and devisees to
                    the charge of obits, chantries, and the like, which were equally pernicious with
                    actual alienations in mortmain, therefore, at the dawn of the Reformation, the
                    statute 23 Henry VIII. c. 10, declared, that all future grants of lands for any
                    of the purposes aforesaid, if granted for any longer term than twenty years,
                    should be void.</p>
                <p>But during the whole of this time it was in the power of the crown, by granting a
                    license of mortmain, to remit the forfeiture, as far as related to its own
                    rights, and to ∙enable any spiritual or other corporation to purchase and hold
                    any lands or tenements in perpetuity; a prerogative which is declared and
                    confirmed by the statute 18 Edward III. st. 3, c. 3. But as doubts were
                    entertained at the time of the Revolution how far such license was valid, since
                    the king had no power to dispense with the statutes of mortmain by a clause of
                    <hi rend="italic">non obstante,</hi> which was the usual course, though it seems
                    to have been unnecessary; and as, by the gradual declension of mesne signiories
                    through the long operation of the statute of <hi rend="italic">Quia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">emptores,</hi> the rights of intermediate lords were reduced to a
                    very small compass; it was therefore provided by the statute 7 and 8 William
                    III. c. 37, that the crown for the future, at its own discretion, might grant
                    licenses to alienate or take in mortmain, of whomsoever the tenements might be
                    holden.</p>
                <p>After the dissolution of monasteries under Henry VIII. though the policy of the
                    next successor affected to grant a security to the possessors of abbey lands,
                    yet, in order to regain as much of them as either the zeal or timidity of their
                    owners might induce them to part with, the statutes of mortmain were suspended
                    for twenty years, and during that time any lands or tenements were allowed to be
                    granted to any spiritual corporation without any license whatsoever. And long
                    afterwards, it was enacted by the statute 17 Car. II. c. 3, that appropriators
                    might annex the great tithes to the vicarages, and that all benefices under
                    L.100 per annum might be augmented by the purchase of lands, without license of
                    mortmain in either case; and the like provision has been since made in favour of
                    the governors of Queen Anne’s bounty. It has also been held, that the statute 13
                    Henry VIII. before mentioned, did not extend to any thing but superstitious
                    uses, and that therefore a man may give lands for the maintenance of a school,
                    an hospital, or any other charitable uses. But as it was apprehended, from
                    recent experience, that persons on their deathbeds might make large and
                    improvident dispositions even for these good purposes, and defeat the political
                    ends of the statutes of mortmain, it was therefore enacted by the statute 9
                    George II. c. 36, that no lands or tenements, or money to be laid out thereon,
                    should be given for or charged with any charitable uses whatsoever, unless by
                    deed indented, executed in the presence of two witnesses twelve calendar months
                    before the death of the donor, and enrolled in the Court of Chancery within six
                    months after its execution (except stocks in the public funds, which may be
                    transferred within six months previous to the donor’s death), and unless such
                    gift were made to take effect immediately, and were without power of revocation,
                    and that all other gifts should be void. The two universities, their colleges,
                    and their scholars, upon the foundation of the colleges of Eton, Winchester, and
                    Westminster, were excepted from the operation of this act; but such exemption
                    was granted with this proviso, that no college should be at liberty to purchase
                    more advowsons than were equal in number to one moiety of the fellows or
                    students upon the respective foundations.</p>
