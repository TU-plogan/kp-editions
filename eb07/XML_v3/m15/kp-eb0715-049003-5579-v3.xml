                <p><label type="entry">MORAVIA</label>, one of those larger divisions of the
                    Austrian empire which has been formed out of the ancient margravate of that
                    name, to which has been joined that portion of Silesia which remained under the
                    Austrian dominion after the cessions extorted from it by Frederick the Great of
                    Prussia. This province is bounded on the north-west by Bohemia, on the
                    north-east by Prussian Silesia, on the east by Gallicia, on the south-east by
                    Hungary, and on the south-west by the province of the Lower Ens. It has nearly
                    the form of a square, the four angles of which point to the four quarters of the
                    compass. It is situated between 15° 6'and 19° Peast longitude, and between 48°
                    41' and 50° 25 ’ north latitude. It extends over 10,593 square miles, and
                    comprehends 119 cities or places once fortified, 178 market-towns, and 3672
                    villages, inhabited in 1822 by 1,890,706 souls, but now supposed by natural
                    increase to exceed 2,000,000. Moravia is generally a hilly country. The
                    Carpathian Mountains, which separate it from Hungary, send into it many of their
                    projections; and besides these, some of the Bohemian and Silesian ranges are
                    extended through various parts of it, whilst in the more southern parts
                    extensive plains are to be seen, which stretch towards the Danube. In the more
                    hilly parts the valleys between arc wide, well watered by rivulets, and covered
                    with a rich verdure, presenting pictures of rural comfort and abundance. The
                    greater part of Moravia is between 400 and 950 feet above the level of the sea
                    ;· and by the sloping of the land, the waters are discharged into rivers, which
                    finally terminate in the German Ocean, in the Baltic, and the Black Sea. The
                    Elbe performs the office of conveying the streams to the first, the Oder and the
                    Vistula to the second, and the Danube to the last of those seas. The greatest
                    body of water, however, passes by the Danube, which receives the river Morawa,
                    from which the province takes its name. The Vistula rises on the confines of the
                    province, and quits it before it becomes a considerable stream, unless at the
                    season when the melting of the snow on the Carpathian Mountains fills a broad
                    channel, and at other times nearly dry. There are no lakes in Moravia, but many
                    stagnant pools and dikes, especially in the circle of Znaym, which yield vast
                    quantities of freshwater fish.</p>
                <p>The climate of Moravia is peculiarly mild and salubrious, and the cold less
                    severe than in any other part of the Continent in the same degree of latitude.
                    This is attributed to the protection from the easterly and northerly winds which
                    the lofty Carpathian Mountains afford. The vine is cultivated, and wine produced
                    as high as latitude 49° 15'; and the harvest in Moravia is generally five or six
                    weeks earlier than in the Prussian province of Silesia which adjoins it.</p>
                <p>This province is, with the exception of the Italian dominions, the best
                    cultivated, the most densely peopled, and the most productive, of any part; of
                    the Austrian empire. About two fifths of the land is under the plough, one fifth
                    is woodland, and the rest is either meadows, upland pasture, or gardens and
                    vineyards. Although the northern part, formerly Silesia, is naturally a poor
                    soil for corn, yet the whole of the province yields more than is required for
                    consumption. Both hemp and’flax are produced in great quantities, and the
                    quality is reported to be excellent. From want of good water conveyance, the
                    woods are made valuable by furnishing much pot and pearl ashes. The northern
                    part is best adapted for the dairy; the breed of cows is good, and yields much
                    butter and cheese. The number of them is nearly equal to that of the sheep,
                    which animals have not yet had so much attention paid to the improvement of
                    their wool as in the adjoining districts of Prussia, or as has been devoted to
                    it in some other parts of Austria.</p>
                <p>The horses, excepting in those parts where they have been improved by a mixture
                    with the Bohemian breed, are small in size and not strong; but pains are taking
                    to improve the race by the introduction of stallions of more power and better
                    forms. Swine, geese, and bees, are objects of rural attention, and yield
                    considerable profit.</p>
                <p>There are some mines of iron worked, as there were formerly of gold, silver, and
                    lead; but these were injured by the wars which broke out against the followers
                    of Huss the Protestant reformer, most of whose adherents were persons who worked
                    in the rich mines. It is only of late years that the silver mines have
                    altogether ceased. At present about 2000 tons of iron are procured. There are
                    also some alum mines, yielding about 800 tons of that substance; and there are
                    mines of coal and of sulphur.</p>
                <p>Moravia is the chief manufacturing district of the empire. The woollen cloth
                    manufacture gives employment to more than 100,000 persons, and yields annually
                    more than 50,000 pieces of fine cloths, and 220,000 pieces of cloth of inferior
                    quality, besides flannels, baizes, and blankets. The cotton trade employs more
                    than 10,000 workmen, and in that branch of industry the machinery invented in
                    other countries has been extensively introduced. The linen trade is a domestic
                    employment which occupies the spare hours of most females in spinning; and in
                    that and subsequent steps it is stated to afford the means of subsistence to
                    more than 250,000 persons, who produce upwards of 500,000 pieces of cloth
                    yearly, from the coarsest canvass to the first damask table-linen and lawns.
                    With this branch is joined the making of twine and of cordage. Hosiery is also a
                    considerable branch of industry, yielding stockings, caps, and net, both by the
                    hand and from knitting. There arc fabrics of paper, glass, hats, cutlery,
                    hardware, china, and earthenware, snuff-mills, and very extensive tanneries. Few
                    countries are so generally well supplied from their own labour with all that is
                    required by the state of their society. The trade is chiefly with the
                    surrounding districts of the same empire, from which, in exchange for its
                    native,productions, it obtains silk goods, tobacco, sugar, coffee, salt, and
                    foreign luxuries.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants consist of two races, distinguished by their difference of
                    language. About three fourths of them are of the great Sclavonian family,
                    divided into four branches, but all with different dialects, using a language
                    originating, like the Polish and Bohemian, from that of the Slavi. These occupy
                    all the most fertile districts. The Germans are about one fourth of the
                    population, and consist of both high and low, and Austrians, each using its own
                    patois. The prevailing religion is that of the Roman Catholic church, but the
                    other sects are also established. The Hussite Protestants once formed a much
                    larger proportion of the inhabitants than they do at present. A body of that
                    persua-. sion under Count Zinzendorf were formed into a colony in Saxony,
                    whence, under the name of Herrnhutters, they have spread over the northern part
                    of Europe, whilst some communities have been formed by them in England, where
                    they are commonly called Moravians, but by themselves are distinguished as the
                    United Brethren. The non-catholic portion of the population at present consists
                    of 54,000 Lutherans, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193825592"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-5592-0491"/>14,000 Calvinists, and 28,000 Jews. The
                    institutions for education are on a low scale. There is a Lyceum at Olmutz, and
                    many inferior schools, to the support of which the estates of the abolished
                    society of the Jesuits have been appropriated.</p>
                <p>Moravia, from the end of the fourteenth century, was an independent principality,
                    sometimes under the protection of Hungary, at other times under-that of Bohemia,
                    and had its own states and margraves. In 1526 it came under the government of
                    the sovereigns of Austria, and has continued so till this time. The states no
                    longer assemble, nor have they done so since 1627. The chief board of government
                    is held at Brunn, where are the supreme courts, both of civil and criminal law.
                    As nearly as can be ascertained, the revenue drawn from the present Moravian
                    province does not exceed L.750,000 sterling annually; but besides this, it
                    furnishes recruits for five regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and three of
                    artillery.</p>
