                    makes us acquainted with all the properties and relations of minerals. It is
                    divided into two grand branches, viz. Mineralogy properly so called, and
                    Geology. Mineralogy treats of the properties and relations of <hi rend="italic">Simple Minerals</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while Geology considers the

                    electricity,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">magnetism of the earth.</hi></p><p>I.—MINERALOGY.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">System of Arrangement.</hi></p><p>The arrangement of simple minerals has always been a subject of controversy with
                    mineralogists; and the discussions to which it has given rise have materially
                    contributed to the advancement of our knowledge of the natural and chemical
                    history of minerals. Berzelius contends for the Chemical arrangement, according
                    to which the species arc grouped in conformity with their chemical composition
                    and characters Werner rejects the pure chemical, and adopts the Mixed method, in
                    which the species are arranged and determined according to the conjoined
                    external and chemical characters; of late years the plan, or the arrangement
                    according to external characters alone, (named the Natural History System), has
                    been advocated by Mohs; and Jameson, in his lectures in the University of
                    Edinburgh, has for some years taught his pupils according to a method of a mixed
                    character, which, had we space, might be more particularly noticed. The system
                    of Mobs having been formerly adopted in this work, as one founded on correct
                    principles, and, very useful in a practical view, is still adhered to.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Characters of Minerals.</hi></p><p>As the characters employed in the natural history system of mineralogy are
                    principally those named external, our attention will here be chiefly directed to
                    the consideration of their various properties, using the chemical characters
                    only in so far as they illustrate the constituent parts of the mineral species.
                    We shall first give an account of the characters used in the construction of the
                    different principal divisions of the system; and next enumerate and define those
                    characters which are employed in the <hi rend="italic">description</hi> of the
                    species, sub-species, kinds, and varieties of simple minerals.</p><p>I. CHARACTERS EMPLOYED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE CLASSES, ORDERS, GENERA, AND
                    SPECIES.</p><p>1. Regular Form.—2. Cleavage—3. Hardness—4. Specific Gravity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Certain varieties of colour,
                    the <hi rend="italic">lustre,</hi> and also the <hi rend="italic">streak,</hi>
                    are occasionally used, in forming the characters of the systematic
                    divisions.</p></note></p><p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Regular Form.</hi></p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Simple and Compound Forms.</hi></p><p>The first step Crystallography takes in the consideration of the regular forms
                    occurring in the mineral kingdom, is to distinguish them into <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> and <hi rend="italic">compound</hi> ones. A simple form is
                    contained under <hi rend="italic">homologous</hi> planes, or such as are equal,
                    similar, and equally disposed in respect to each other; a compound one is
                    contained under planes <hi rend="italic">not homologous,</hi> or such as are not
                    equal, similar, and equally disposed to each other.</p><p><hi rend="italic">2. Combinations.</hi></p><p>A compound form is termed a <hi rend="italic">combination.</hi> The combinations
                    consist of the simple forms, and each face occurring in them, belongs to a
                    particular simple form, in as far as it is not homologous with others.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Edges of Combination.</hi></p><p>The edges, in which the faces of different forms meet or intersect each other,
                    are called <hi rend="italic">edges of combination.</hi> The denomination of the
                    edges between the homologous faces depends upon the simple forms themselves, or
                    upon their peculiar situation, and their other qualities.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Development of the Combinations.</hi></p><p>An object of the greatest importance for crystallography is the illustration of
                    the <hi rend="italic">development</hi> of the; combinations. A combination is
                    developed by shewing of what simple forms it consists, and in what relations
                    those simple forms are to each other. The manner in which this is done is as
                    follows: <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> The connection existing among certain
                    simple forms is exhibited; and these simple forms are arranged accordingly into
                    series, the members of which, between certain-limits, follow constant laws, and
                    are known in all their geometrical relations, if it is possible to determine
                    their distance from a known member, or to assign them their relative position in
                    a series, which contains the same member. The position of a member in the series
                    is determined by considering the situation of the edges of combination; and the
                    development of the latter will, therefore, depend upon two points; first, to
                    make out the kind of the simple forms they contain; and, then, from the observed
                    situation of the edges of combination, to determine to which member of the
                    afore-mentioned series they belong, or which places they occupy in the
                    series.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Preparation for the Development of the
                    Combinations.</hi></p><p>Let fig. 1 .be a combination of two rhomboids or rhombohedrons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“We use, as synonymous, the

                    formed by three equal plane angles of the former, are smaller than the same of

                    which, therefore, is called the <hi rend="italic">more obtuse,</hi> whilst the
                    former bears the denomination of the <hi rend="italic">more acute rhomboid.</hi>
                    It would not be sufficiently intelligible to derive the relation which exists
                    between the two rhomboids, from the figure in its present state, the absolute
                    dimensions remaining unaltered. Let, therefore, the axis of the more obtuse
                    rhomboid increase, till it equals that of the more acute one, without any
                    alteration in the angles, and consequently in the parallelism of the edges of
                    combination depending upon them. Whilst the axis increases, that part of the
                    faces of the more obtuse rhomboid, which is visible in the combination, will
                    become narrower and narrower, till it disappear?, when the length of the axis is
                    equal in both the forms. The planes of the more obtuse rhomboid are in this case
                    tangent to the terminal edges of the more acute one; and the absolute dimensions
                    are now in that state, in which they allow of a clear development of the
                    relations between the forms which the combination contains.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">Upright Position and Horizontal Projection.</hi></p><p>Place a rhomboid in such a position that its axis is vertical. This is called the

                    N ʹ T ʹ belonging to the rhomboids, we find that, the axes being supposed equal,
                    the horizontal projection of the more obtuse is four times as large as that of
                    the more acute; or it is to the same in the ratio of 4: 1. From this follows the
                    ratio of their sides = 2: 1. Therefore, two rhomboids, the horizontal
                    projections of which are in the ratio of 4: 1, or the sides of these in that of
                    2: 1, the axes being supposed equal, will be able to produce a combination in
                    which the edges of combination are parallel to each other; also to the terminal
                    edges of the more acute, and to the inclined diagonals (those which join the
                    apex with the opposite angle of the faces) of the more obtuse rhomboids;
                    provided the absolute dimensions allow the space to be limited by both the forms
                    at the same time. This is one of the relations between simple forms, which are
                    useful and necessary for explaining the combinations, and of which the other
                    relation will be explained in the following paragraphs.</p><p>8. <hi rend="italic">Fundamental Form, Derivation, Derived Form.</hi></p><p>What has been said above leads to a general method, one form being given or
                    chosen, to find one or several others, which are in such relations to it, as to
                    be fit for explaining the combinations. The form chosen for this purpose is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">fundamental form</hi> or <hi rend="italic">type</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the proceeding by which the other forms are

                    Axis.</hi></p><p>The easiest method of expressing the relation of the derived rhomboids to the
                    fundamental form (§ 7.) is not that by the sides of the horizontal projections,
                    the axes being supposed equal. Let, therefore, the derived rhomboid, without any
                    alteration in its angles, diminish in size (as could be done by sections
                    parallel to its faces) till its horizontal projection becomes equal to the
                    horizontal projection of the fundamental form; its axis will decrease to half of
                    its former length. Now, the horizontal projections being supposed equal, the
                    axis of the derived rhomboid will be to the axis of the fundamental "form in the
                    ratio of ∣: 1 = 1: 2, an expression of the relation between the two forms,
                    which, on account of its easy application, we shall retain and make use of as we
                    proceed.</p><p>10. <hi rend="italic">Inversion of the Proceeding.</hi></p><p>The mode of proceeding, by which the more obtuse rhomboid has been derived from
                    the more acute one, can easily be inverted; setting out from the more obtuse
                    one, we can, by the samè way, in an opposite direction, derive the more acute
                    rhomboid. The diagonals being drawn upon the faces of the rhomboid, and by
                    planes laid through three and three of them, those parts which are situated on
                    their outside being taken away, what remains will be a rhomboid more acute than
                    the fundamental form. The axes of both these forms are. equal, whilst the sides
                    of the horizontal projections in the fundamental and the derived rhomboid are in
                    the ratio of 1: ½. Now, the horizontal projections being equal, the ratio of the
                    axes will be =1: 2.</p><p>11. <hi rend="italic">Generality of the Relations.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">Series.</hi></p><p>These modes of proceeding, and the relations between the derived forms, are
                    general. If, therefore, from one rhomboid, taken for the fundamental form,
                    another more obtuse has been derived; this same more obtuse rhomboid, considered
                    as a fundamental form, will yield another still more obtuse; and if, on the
                    other hand, from the fundamental form a more acute rhomboid has been derived,
                    the same proceeding applied to the resultant form will give another still more
                    acute; and this may be continued on either side <hi rend="italic">ad
                    infinitum.</hi> The ratio between the axes of any two subsequent rhomboids, the
                    horizontal projections being supposed equal, has every where the same exponent.
                    The axes are therefore in a geometrical progression, and the rhomboids
                    represented by these axes are themselves said to form such a progression, or a

                    powers of the number 2.</p><p>13. <hi rend="italic">Designation.</hi></p><p>The method of designating crystallizations, whether simple or compound, is
                    founded on the present and similar series, to be developed afterwards. Represent
                    the fundamental form by any arbitrary letter, in this case, according to the
                    practice hitherto observed, by R. The sign of any other member of the series
                    contains the same letter; the exponent of the fundamental number of the series,
                    which, in the present case, is the number 2, being added for the sake of
                    expressing the place occupied in the series by the number to be designated. This
                    yields the crystallographic sign for one member, and by applying the same
                    proceeding to the others, the designation also of the whole series.</p><p>14. <hi rend="italic">Continuation.</hi></p><p>The above mentioned part of the series of rhomboids is C, B, A, B <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, C'; the ratio of their axes</p><p>—2 —ι</p><p>2 ,2 , 2°, 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, 2 <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>;

                    whole numbers, positive or negative, instead of n in the expression.</p><p>15. <hi rend="italic">Usefulness of the Designation.</hi></p><p>From the ratio of the axis to the side of the horizontal projection being known
                    in a rhomboid, all the rest of its ratios, its dimensions (plain and solid
                    angled), &amp;c. can be deduced. The side of the horizontal projection is
                    supposed equal in all the members of the series, and made = 1 in the
                    calculations which refer to the rhomboid. The designation contains therefore, by
                    representing the relation of the axes, every thing required as a basis of
                    calculation; and since it does not require any figures (for instance those of a
                    fundamental form), the letter R signifying by itself a rhomboid, the designation
                    is also evident, and upon this depends the easiness of its application in
                    crystallography.</p><p>16. <hi rend="italic">Limits of the Series.</hi></p><p>There can be no doubt of <hi rend="italic">η</hi> being able to obtain any
                    possible value; or, which is the same, the series may be continued as far as we
                    choose. This produces always new rhomboids, as long as <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    has a finite value. On one side the axis will increase, if <hi rend="italic">n</hi> increase and remain positive; on the other the axes will decrease, if
                    the negative value of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> increases. Let <hi rend="italic">η</hi> become infinite, the axis will likewise be infinite; let — <hi rend="italic">n</hi> become infinite, the axis will be infinitely small. It is
                    clear that the limits of the series will be, on one side, a rhomboid of an
                    infinitely large axis, on the other, a rhomboid of an infinitely small axis, and
                    their several signs must therefore be R+∞ and R — α&gt;; so that</p><p>R—∞ ∙ . . R + n . . . R + ∞ represent the series between its limits.</p><p>17. <hi rend="italic">Th¢ Limits are Regular Six-sided Prisms.</hi></p><p>It is very easily shewn that a rhomboid of an infinite axis is a regular
                    six-sided prism; for at the same time, as the axis increases, the six faces of
                    the rhomboid approach nearer and nearer to parallelism with the axis,· and they
                    become really parallel with it, if the axis becomes infinitely long. For
                    rendering more evident in what manner the régulai· six-sided prism is the limit
                    of the series of rhomboids, we can imagine each face of the rhomboid to make a
                    revolution round an immoveable line QS, fig. 3. This line is the side of that
                    regular hexagon, which can be inscribed into the horizontal projection HORZNT;
                    the hexagon itself will be the basis or transverse section of the prism, and it
                    differs from the horizontal projection by both its contents and its situation.
                    If the axis of the rhomboid decrease till it ultimately evanesce, the faces
                    contiguous not only to one, but also those contiguous to the other apex,
                    coincide in one plane; and the rhomboid is changed into a plane figure, equal
                    and similar to the horizontal projection, to which it is parallel, and appears,
                    therefore, in all the combinations as a face perpendicular to the axis. It must
                    here be remarked, that forms of infinite dimensions cannot be produced by
                    themselves, or as simple forms, but appear only in combinations.</p><p>18. <hi rend="italic">Position.</hi></p><p>The series of rhomboids, already described, contains every thing concerning the
                    dimensions and the ratios of its members, as far as each of them is considered
                    singly or by itself. But there is still one object of great importance to be
                    noticed, if those members are considered connected together, or in combinations.
                    This is their <hi rend="italic">position.</hi> It is evident that two subsequent
                    members of the series, as, for instance, R and R+l, or, in general terms, R+n
                    and R+⅜+1, will produce the above combination; in which the edges of combination
                    are parallel, not only with each other, but also with the terminal edges of the
                    more acute; and with the inclined diagonals of the more obtuse rhomboids; but
                    they will produce this combination only in the case of their being in such a
                    position, that the terminal edges of the one are in the same plane with the
                    inclined diagonals of the other, which plane passes at the same time through the
                    axis, as is shewn by fig. 2. This position of two rhomboids is termed the <hi rend="italic">turned position,</hi> because it arises when a rhomboid is turned
                    out of former position, under an angle of 60° or 180°. If a rhomboid, in the
                    turned position, undergo a new revolution of 60° or 180°, it returns to that
                    which it occupied before, and this is called the <hi rend="italic">parallel
                    position.</hi> Rhomboids that affect a parallel position with each other, have
                    their terminal edges and their inclined diagonals distributed in such a manner,
                    that the terminal edges of both on one side, and the inclined diagonals of both
                    on the other, fall into one and the same plane, passing through the axis.</p><p>19. <hi rend="italic">Position of the Members in respect to each other.</hi></p><p>The position of the fundamental form R is considered as the <hi rend="italic">normal position,</hi> to which those of the derived members are referred. In
                    reference to R, R + 1 and R — 1 will be in a. turned, R + 2 and R—2 in a
                    parallel, R + 3 and R—3 in a turned position again, and so on; from which it
                    follows, that any two subsequent, or, in general, any two members of the series,
                    between which an even number of members (0 in the above case being considered as
                    even) are wanting, will be in the turned position, whilst any two members of the
                    series, between which an odd number of members are wanting, will affect the
                    parallel position. All <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820704" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0704-0115"/> those members, therefore, which have their
                    exponent an even number, are in the parallel, those which have their exponent an
                    odd number in the turned position, if compared with R, the fundamental form of
                    the series. The position exercises no influence upon the regular six-sided
                    prism, since, by turning it under angles of 60° and 180°, its faces will come
                    into their former situation.</p><p>20. <hi rend="italic">Scalene Six-sided Pyramids.</hi></p><p>The rhomboid allows several forms to be derived from it, which are not themselves

                    as the lateral edges of the rhomboids from which they are derived; and the axes

                    those.</p><p>23. <hi rend="italic">Designation.</hi></p><p>The letter P, in general, signifies a pyramid, but more particularly a six-sided
                    pyramid, if referred to a form derivable from the rhomboid. The quality of a
                    scalene sixsided pyramid, in which there occur differences according to the
                    relation of its axis to that of the rhomboid, must be made evident by the
                    designation. Include the general sign for the pyramid, expressed in such a
                    manner as to refer to the rhomboid from which it is derived, within crotchets (
                    ), and add the number of derivation, or that by which the axis of the rhomboid
                    has been multiplied, in order to produce the axis of the pyramid, in the form of
                    an exponent; the result will be the crystallographic sign of a scalene sixsided
                    pyramid. Thus (P+1) <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> represents a scalene sixsided
                    pyramid derived from R+l by multiplying its axis by the number 3; and (P+n) <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> is the general term of any or of each series of
                    scalene six-sided pyramids, which can be derived from a series of rhomboids
                    having R for its fundamental form, according to the value of <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> determined for each particular series. If the axis of the rhomboid from
                    which a scalene six-sided pyramid is derived, and the number of derivation <hi rend="italic">m</hi> are known, the dimensions of the pyramid are easily to be
                    found; thus every thing that has been said above (§ 15.) in respect to the
                    designation, can be equally applied in the present case.</p><p>24. <hi rend="italic">Values of m.</hi></p><p>Although the value of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be, as far as experience goes,
                    most commonly = 2, 3, or 5, yet it sometimes affects others, and even
                    fractionary numbers. The only thing to be said in general of the value of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is, that it must be greater than 1, rational and
                    positive.</p><p>25. <hi rend="italic">Limits.</hi></p><p>Every series leads to its limits; it is, therefore, to be expected, that the
                    series of scalene six-sided pyramids will have limits of their own. It appears
                    by an easy geometrical construction, that scalene six-sided pyramids, derived
                    according to a constant <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> from the different members of
                    a series of rhomboids, or even from any rhomboid though it be no member of that
                    series, if cut perpendicularly upon, and through the centre of their axes; that
                    such pyramids will have a common, or equal and similar transverse section,
                    provided only the horizontal projections of these rhomboids have been equal.
                    This section is an equilateral dodecagon of alternately equal angles. The limits
                    of a series of scalene six-sided pyramids must therefore be a scalene six-sided
                    pyramid of an infinite axis; which, since <hi rend="italic">m</hi> cannot become
                    infinite, must be derivable from a rhomboid of an infinite axis, that is to say,
                    from a regular six-sided prism. The limit will, therefore, appear in the shape
                    of an <hi rend="italic">unequiangular twelve-sided</hi> prism, of the same
                    transverse section, which the finite members of the series produce. Each series
                    of scalene six-sided pyramids is limited by a prism of this kind; the number of
                    different prisms will therefore be equal to the values of <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> upon which the angles of their transverse sections depend. The opposite
                    limit, viz. the scalene six-sided pyramid of an infinitely small axis again
                    appears in a plane figure, equal and similar to the horizontal projection, its
                    faces being perpendicular to the axis of those forms with which it is combined.
                    The general sign of an unequiangular twelve-sided prism is (P+∞) . The face
                    perpendicular to the axis does not require any particular designation, since
                    that of R—∞ (§ 15) is already applied to it. Respecting the position, both of
                    the scalene six-sided pyramids, and of their limits, the unequiangular
                    twelve-sided prisms to each other, and to the rhomboidal form from which they
                    are derived; § § 18 and 19 contain the necessary explanations.</p><p>26. <hi rend="italic">Subordinate Series of Rhomboids.</hi></p><p>” There are several rhomboids in connection with R, without being members of the
                    series derived from it, because their axes, the horizontal projections being
                    equal, are not products of the axes of R, multiplied by powers of the number 2.
                    These rhomboids follow, however, the law <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820717" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0717-0116"/> (§ 12) which
                    governs the series of rhomboids immediately derived from R, and their axes are
                    results of the axes of the members of this series multiplied by a certain
                    coefficient. Series arising in this way are termed <hi rend="italic">subordinate
                    series,</hi> whilst that which has been derived from R has the relative name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">principal series.</hi></p><p>27. <hi rend="italic">Coefficients of the Subordinate Series, and hmv the Members
                    of these belong to each other and to the Mem~ bers of the Principal
                    Series.</hi></p><p>Members of the subordinate series are geometrically obtained by laying planes
                    into the homologous terminal edges of the scalene six-sided pyramids derived
                    from the members of the principal series, and by enlarging these planes till
                    they enclose the space by themselves. By applying the planes to the more obtuse
                    terminal edges, the resulting <hi rend="subscript"> m</hi>. . 3∞+1 , coefficient
                    is = —ξ—; by applying them to the more acute ones, it follows = <hi rend="strikethrough">⅛</hi><hi rend="superscript                 strikethrough"> m</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">J</hi>. If the three most common values 4</p><p>of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> are one after the other put into the expressions,
                    each of the two coefficients give rise to members of two different subordinate
                    series; but at the same time it yields one member of the principal series,
                    namely, if 3 m~4~T becomes equal to a power of the number 2. These numbers of
                    the principal series are not, however, objects of the present consideration. The
                    subordinate series, whose coefficient contains, besides a power of the number 2,
                    the number 5, is styled the <hi rend="italic">first;</hi> that whose
                    coefficient, also besides a power of the number 2, contains the number 7, the
                    <hi rend="italic">second</hi> subordinate series. The members of the subordinate
                    series arrange themselves with those of the principal series in such a manner,
                    that the axes of those which are put together stand in the ratio of 1: £: J.
                    According to this disposition, a rhomboid, whose axis contains five-fourths of
                    the axis of R+n, or which is = f . 2*α, its horizontal projection being equal to
                    that of R, is R+« of the first subordinate series, and its designation fR+n; a
                    rhomboid whose axis is = f.2 <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> is R+n of the second
                    subordinate series, and its designation is ^R+n. Any other value of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> affords other subordinate series. The members of a
                    subordinate series cannot be interpolated, or put between those of the principal
                    one, without undoing both these series themselves. The limits of the subordinate
                    series are identical with those of the principal series; the position of their
                    members follows from their derivation.</p><p>28. <hi rend="italic">Isosceles Six-sided Pyramids.</hi></p><p>Apply pairs of planes to the terminal edges AC, of a rhomboid, fig. 5, in such a
                    manner and inclination, that those from the upper apex, AHO and A OR, may
                    intersect those from the under apex, XHO and XOR, in a plane figure HORZNT,
                    similar to and parallel with the horizontal projection. The result will be an
                    <hi rend="italic">isosceles six. sided pyramid.</hi> The axes of both the
                    pyramid and the rhomboid being equal, as appears from the derivation, the sides
                    of their horizontal projections are in the ratio of 3: 2. Hence the horizontal
                    projections being supposed equal, the ratio between the axis of the pyramid and
                    that of the rhomboid will follow = 2: 3, or the first will contain f of the axis
                    of that rhomboid from which it is derived. The isosceles six-sided pyramid,
                    derived from R+ra, is designated only by P+τt (§ 23), on account of its being
                    always obtained by a similar proceeding from its rhomboid.</p><p>29∙ <hi rend="italic">Series of Isosceles Six-sided Pyramids.</hi></p><p>Each member of the principal series of rhomboids has its concomitant isosceles
                    six-sided pyramid of the ratio just stated, the horizontal projections being
                    equal. This gives rise to a series of isosceles six-sided pyramids, the axes of
                    which, their horizontal projections being equal, increase and decrease as the
                    powers of the number 2; that is to say, they follow the general law of all those
                    forms which are derived from the rhomboid.</p><p>30. <hi rend="italic">Limits and Position.</hi></p><p>The limits of this series are regular six-sided prisms of infinite axes, like
                    those of the series of rhomboids. Let the axis of an isosceles six-sided pyramid
                    increase, whilst the horizontal projection remains unchanged, the inclination of
                    the faces at the edges of the basis (those in which the faces from different
                    apices meet) will likewise increase till it becomes = 180°, in which case the
                    axis will be infinite. In this case, each two corresponding faces from the
                    different apices coincide into a single plane parallel with the axis, and the
                    isosceles six-sided pyramid is thus transformed into a regular six-sided prism,
                    the basis or transverse section of which is the horizontal projection itself. By
                    this basis and its situation the present prism differs from that (§ 17), which
                    limits the series of rhomboids; and by this the necessity of considering them as
                    two distinct forms becomes evident. The crystallographic sign for the limit of
                    the series of isosceles six-sided pyramids is P + ∞ . The opposite limit, merely
                    a face perpendicular to the axis of any of the foregoing forms, requires no
                    particular designation. Since the faces of an isosceles six-sided pyramid, when
                    this is turned round under 60° or 180°, resume their former situation, there is
                    no difference prevailing in the position of the members and limits of this
                    series, either in respect to themselves, or to the other forms derived from the
                    rhomboid.</p><p>31. <hi rend="italic">Derivation from the Isosceles Four-sided Pyramid.</hi></p><p>Consider an <hi rend="italic">isosceles four-sided pyramid</hi> (fig. G), a form
                    contained under eight equal and similar isosceles triangles, as a fundamental
                    form; place it in its upright position, by making its axis AX vertical, and
                    apply to it the process § 5. The tangent planes will limit a space representing
                    again an isosceles four-sided pyramid, the plane angles of which at the apex,
                    and the inclination of the faces at the terminal edges, will be greater than the
                    same in the fundamental form, and hence it will likewise be the more obtuse of
                    both.</p><p>32. <hi rend="italic">Ratio of the Derived Pyramid to the Fundamental
                    Form.</hi></p><p>The axes of these pyramids arc equal to each other. The horizontal projection of
                    the more obtuse is that square which can be circumscribed to the horizontal
                    projection of the fundamental<pb break="no" facs="nls:193820730" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0730-0117"/> form; and, accordingly, its content twice the
                    content of the horizontal projection of the fundamental form, the ratio of their
                    sides = <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">∕ 2</hi>: 1. Suppose now the
                    horizontal projections of the two pyramids to be equal, the axis of the derived
                    more obtuse pyramid will be to the axis of the fundamental form in the ratio of
                    <hi rend="italic">—rz.</hi></p><p>√2: 1.</p><p>33. <hi rend="italic">Inversion of the Proceeding.</hi></p><p>This proceeding can be applied inversely, in order to obtain from the fundamental
                    form the same more acute four-sided pyramid, from which, by the proceeding
                    applied directly, the fundamental form would have been the result. This inverse
                    application is as follows: Draw in the faces of the fundamental form
                    perpendicular lines from the apices to the edges at the basis, lay cutting
                    planes through every two contiguous of these lines, and separate those parts of
                    the pyramids which lie outside of them. The remainder, inclosed by the cutting
                    planes, will be again an isosceles four-sided pyramid, having the same axis as
                    the fundamental form, but a horizontal projection, whose content is half the
                    content of the horizontal projection of the fundamental form, and the ratio of
                    their sides, therefore, = -V^½: 1. The horizontal projections being made equal,
                    the axis of the derived more acute pyramid is to the axis of the fundamental
                    form in the ratio of <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">∕ 2</hi>: 1,
                    which is the inverse of the ratio deduced above.</p><p>34. <hi rend="italic">Series and Designation.</hi></p><p>By continuing the derivation, the more obtuse pyramid produces another still more
                    obtuse; the more acute another still more acute, and thus arises a series of
                    isosceles foursided pyramids, whose axes, their horizontal projections being
                    equal, increase and decrease as the powers of the square root of 2; which law of
                    progression can be expressed by 2^- or <hi rend="superscript"> fy</hi> ∕ 2**.
                    The designation of this series is concordant with the principles already laid
                    down and followed (§ 13). The fundamental form receives the letter P. Hence its
                    neighbouring members will be</p><p>...

                    substitution of any whole positive or negative number in the place of <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> gives a certain determined member. The present designation
                    is quite the same as that in § 28, and as another to be mentioned in § 44.
                    However, the observation in page 135 is sufficient to shew the impossibility of
                    any confusion or ambiguity that could arise from making use of identical signs
                    for the expression of different forms.</p><p>35. <hi rend="italic">Limits.</hi></p><p>If <hi rend="italic">n</hi> becomes greater or smaller than any given number, a
                    transformation takes place similar to that by which the isosceles six-sided
                    pyramid gave rise to the regular sixsided prism: the series of isosceles
                    four-sided pyramids terminates on one side in an unlimited four-sided prism, on
                    the other in a plane figure, equal, similar, and parallel to the horizontal
                    projection, and these two forms represent the limits of the series. In respect
                    to the first, however, there occurs the particular circumstance, that the series
                    is doubly limited; because the different members in their succession assume a
                    different position. The derivation shews the pyramids, P—1 and P +1, to stand in
                    such a position towards P, that the sides of their bases are parallel with the
                    diagonals of the basis of P; whilst in P — 2 and P + 2, the sides and the
                    diagonals are parallel with the same lines in the basis of the fundamental form.
                    The former are said to be in a <hi rend="italic">diagonal,</hi> the latter in a
                    <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> position with P; and every thing contained in §
                    18 and § 19, in respect to position, may be applied here, if only, instead of
                    60° and 180°, a revolution of 45° is imagined. Suppose now the two different
                    prisms, the regular six-sided, as well as the rectangular four-sided, in both
                    their peculiar positions. The faces of the first will, after having been duly
                    turned, assume their former situation, which is not the case in the second; and
                    hence it becomes necessary to adopt two rectangular four-sided prisms of an
                    infinite axis as limits of the series of isosceles four-sided pyramids, one
                    being in a parallel, the other in a diagonal position with P. The sign of the
                    first is P + ∞ , that of the second [P + ∞ ]. The opposite limit, where there is
                    no difference in the position, is represented by P — co; and the whole series of
                    isosceles four-sided pyramids between its limits appears thus, <hi rend="smallcaps">p-</hi><hi rend="subscript                 smallcaps"> 8</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">....p</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> +k</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">....{p+∞J</hi></p><p>36. <hi rend="italic">Scalene Eight-sided Pyramids.</hi></p><p>With the isosceles four-sided pyramids there are connected <hi rend="italic">scalene eight-sided pyramids,</hi> contained under sixteen equal and similar

                    four-sided by the same process of derivation, by which the scalene sixsided
                    pyramids take their rise from the rhomboid. The application of this process to
                    the isosceles four-sided pyramid supposes, however, a preparation of this form,
                    which is effected by enlarging its faces beyond the edges of its basis, and by
                    drawing in these enlargements triangles, equal and similar to the faces of the
                    pyramid. Thus the points <hi rend="italic">a, a</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">, . . x, X .</hi>. are fixed in two
                    squares that are perpendicular to the axis AX, in its terminal points., or in
                    the apices of the pyramids. Now, produce the axis of the pyramid on both sides
                    to an indefinite but equal length, or multiply it by a number <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> greater than 1 positive and rational (§ 24.) Join, then, the upper

                    of the basis of the four-sided pyramid. We now join these points with the
                    neighbouring angles of the base by straight lines, the result of which will
                    represent the basis of the derived scalene eight-sided pyramid, which may now be
                    completed without difficulty. The most common, though not the only values given

                    members of this series will be similar to each other. The designation of an

                    wι</hi>, and it is evident, that as many values of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> as
                    experience gives, so many different series of scalene eight-sided pyramids will
                    arise.</p><p>38. <hi rend="italic">Limits.</hi></p><p>The limits of those series are, on one side unlimited unequiangular eight-sided
                    prisms, the transverse sections of them being similar to the bases of the
                    members of the series; on the other side, a plane figure, which in the
                    combinations appears as a face perpendicular to the axis. This is evident from
                    what has been said above, and there remains only to be added, that the prisms of
                    an infinite axis coming into consideration in two different positions, they must
                    be taken for two different forms, or as double limits of the series. These two
                    positions are the <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">diagonal,</hi> as in § 35; the parallel being that which prevails between
                    scalene eight-sided pyramids and that isosceles four-sided from which they are
                    derived; whilst forms of this kind in the diagonal position are supposed to have
                    undergone a horizontal revolution of 45°. Now, the eight-sided prisms may be
                    considered as scalene eight-sided pyramids, derived from isosceles four-sided
                    pyramids of an infinite axis, namely, the rectangular foursided prism, according
                    to a certain value of rn. The necessity of considering the four-sided prism in
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> two different positions (§ 35) must therefore be
                    extended to the eight-sided. The designation of the series of eight-sided
                    pyramids, between their limits, will accordingly be thus:</p><p>P — ∞ ... (P + √ <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi>... f&lt; <hi rend="superscript">

                    of these series are obtained by placing tangent planes in the homologous
                    terminal edges of the scalene eight-sided pyramids; the same proceeding which
                    applied to the scalene six-sided pyramids produced the subordinate series of
                    rhomboids. The coefficient for the more obtuse terminal edge (if m^1 + √2) is=⅛l

                    the principal series. The positions of its members in respect to each other, and
                    to the members of the principal series, will become evident by comparing what
                    has been stated of their derivation with § 27 regarding the position of the
                    subordinate series of rhomboids.</p><p>40. <hi rend="italic">Scalene Four-sided Pyramids.</hi></p><p>If in the basis of an isosceles four-sided pyramid, the diagonals are supposed

                    acute, as is represented by ABCB'C'X, fig. 8.</p><p>From this we may conjecture that several of the preceding methods of derivation,
                    though with some modifications, will also in this case be applicable.</p><p>41. <hi rend="italic">Derivations from it. Auxiliary Form.</hi></p><p>Apply to the <hi rend="italic">homologous</hi> terminal edges of a scalene
                    four-sided pyramid tangent planes, and enlarge them till they intersect each
                    other in every possible direction; the result will be no form limited on every
                    side, or such as is finite in all its dimensions. If the tangent planes are laid
                    in <hi rend="italic">all</hi> the terminal edges of the fundamental form, a form
                    limited from every side will indeed appear, but this form is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> one, its faces being homologous only
                    by four and four (§ 1). The form thus arising represents a foursided pyramid,
                    with an <hi rend="italic">oblong rectangular</hi> basis, AIĞHFX, fig. 8; and
                    most of the crystallographers consider it as such, and term it accordingly. In
                    this place it must be considered only as an <hi rend="italic">auxiliary</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">intermediate</hi> form, which is not the derived form itself,
                    but useful and auxiliary for its derivation.</p><p>42. <hi rend="italic">Derived Form.</hi></p><p>Suppose tangent planes to be laid in the terminal edges of the <hi rend="italic">auxiliary form,</hi> in such an inclination that those from the upper apex
                    produce by their intersection with those from the under apex, a rhomb similar
                    and parallel to the basis of the fundamental form, and situated in the
                    prolongation of this basis. The result will be a scalene foursided pyramid, the
                    basis of which is similar to that of the fundamental form; but the plane angles
                    at the apex, and the inclination at the terminal edges, being greater than in
                    this form, the derived will be more obtuse than the fundamental form.</p><p>43. <hi rend="italic">Patio to the Fundamental Form.</hi></p><p>The two pyramids, as produced by the derivation, have the same axis, the ratio
                    betweeen the basis of the derived, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820756" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0756-0119"/> and the basis
                    of the fundamental pyramid being that of 4:1. This ratio is evident, since the
                    basis of the auxiliary form is double of the basis of the fundamental form, and
                    that of the derived form again double of the basis of the auxiliary form. Hence
                    the horizontal projection of the two forms being supposed equal, the ratio
                    between the axes of the derived, and of the fundamental pyramid, is that of ∣:
                    1. The process of derivation, by which the more obtuse pyramid is produced, is
                    liable to an inversion like that in § 10.</p><p>44. <hi rend="italic">Series. Designation. Limits. Position.</hi></p><p>From a continued derivation on both sides of the fundamental form, a series of
                    scalene four-sided pyramids, of equal and similar bases, will evidently arise,
                    the axes of which increase on one side and decrease on the other, like the
                    powers of the number 2. P + <hi rend="italic">n</hi> will be the sign of an
                    indeterminate τzth member of the series, and if <hi rend="italic">n</hi> becomes
                    infinite, the series reaches its limits, which are on one side an obliquangular
                    four-sided prism, whose transverse section on the other side is a horizontal
                    plane, whose figure is equal and similar to the horizontal projection of the
                    fundamental form. The designation of the series between its limits becomes
                    thus:</p><p>P — oo ...P + n...P + &lt;jo.</p><p>It must be remarked, that such differences on account of the position of the
                    members of the series as are met with in the rhomboid (§ 18) and the isosceles
                    four-sided pyramid (§ 35), are not to be found in the scalene four-sided
                    pyramid.</p><p>45. <hi rend="italic">Further Derivations.</hi></p><p>The members of the present series are, or this series itself is, now the
                    foundation of several other derivations; and although the forms derived by them
                    will be nothing but scalene four-sided pyramids and obliquangular four-sided
                    prisms, yet the variety in the relations of those forms is great enough to
                    surpass that of the forms in connection with the rhomboid, and with the
                    isosceles four-sided pyramid, for which reason it is one of the most interesting
                    objects of crystallography. The derivations already mentioned apply as well to
                    the fundamental form itself as to the auxiliary form; and they are similar to
                    that which has been employed in deriving the scalene eight-sided from the
                    isosceles four-sided pyramid.</p><p>46. <hi rend="italic">From the Fundamental Form.</hi></p><p>Instead of the isosceles (§ 37), suppose the scalene four-sided pyramid to be the
                    fundamental form, and prepare it for derivation by enlarging its planes beyond
                    the edges at the basis, and by drawing triangles equal and similar to the faces
                    of the pyramid in these enlargements. The points <hi rend="italic">a, a! . . x
                    xf .</hi>. will no longer be the angles of squares, but of oblong rectangles,
                    the planes of which are perpendicular to the axis AX in its terminal points.
                    Produce now the axis of the scalene four-sided pyramid on both sides to an
                    indefinite but equal length, or, what comes to the same, multiply it by a number
                    <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> enjoying the general properties mentioned, §§ 24, 26.
                    Draw straight lines from the points <hi rend="italic">α,a</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">..</hi> in the lower rectangle to the
                    upper apex A ’, from the points <hi rend="italic">x, x</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">.</hi>. in the upper rectangle to the under apex X' of the lengthened axis, and
                    join their intersections <hi rend="italic">s,s</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">..</hi>
                    in the plane of the enlarged basis by straight lines with the angles of this
                    basis. The resultant octagon will not have alternately equal angles, like that
                    in § 36, which is the basis of the scalene eight-sided pyramids, but it will be
                    irregular, fig. 9, since of the angles B, B ’, c, c ’, only the opposite are
                    equal to each other. A form constructed upon such a basis cannot be contained
                    under equal and similar planes, or it cannot be a simple form. Like the
                    four-sided pyra mid of an oblong rectangular basis, it is considered as an
                    auxiliary or intermediate form, whose resolution gives the simple forms of which
                    it consists. '</p><p>47. <hi rend="italic">Resolution of the Auxiliary Form.</hi></p><p>This resolution is executed by enlarging those places which are equal and similar
                    to each other, till the rest disappear. In the present case, the resolution
                    produces two different scalene four-sided pyramids of equal axes, their bases
                    being different amongst themselves, as well as from the bases of the fundamental
                    form. They are termed <hi rend="italic">scalene four-sided pyramids of
                    dissimilar bases, derived from the fundamental form,</hi> and more particularly
                    that in which the long diagonal of the fundamental form remains unaltered, the

                    that in which the short diagonal remains unaltered, the <hi rend="italic">pyramidal belonging to the short diagonal of the fundamental form.</hi></p><p>48. <hi rend="italic">Designation.</hi></p><p>This important difference between the two forms must be expressed by the

                    the same time both of the pyramids just mentioned. In order to make it
                    applicable to each of them singly, it is now necessary to express their
                    difference in respect to the diagonals of the fundamental forms, which is
                    effected by adding the signs o and -. Thus (P + <hi rend="italic">nf</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> represents a scalene four-sided pyramid of

                    few triangles in the figures required for explaining the derivation. Hence the
                    ratio between the diagonals of the bases in the derived forms, that of the
                    fundamental form remaining constant, depends only upon the number <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> Accordingly, if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be supposed
                    constant, all the pyramids of this kind, derived from scalene four-sided
                    pyramids of similar bases, will likewise, as far as they belong to one or the
                    other diagonal, contain similar bases or transverse sections, the axes of the

                    gives rise to <hi rend="italic">two series</hi> of derived pyramids of a

                    each of those series having constant transverse sections in all their members,
                    it appears that the obliquangular four-sided prisms, limiting them, must
                    likewise be subject to the equality of transverse sections or bases. Both the

                    in § 46, but its resolution yields again two simple forms, which are also <hi rend="italic">scalene four-sided pyramids, whose bases are dissimilar to those

                    the derivation is applied to the whole series in § 44, there will arise two
                    series of scalene four-sided pyramids, which proceed according to the law of the
                    fundamental series, and are limited by obliqnangular four-sided prisms,
                    partaking of the similarity in the transverse sections of all the members. The

                    series § 44, which, in reference to the former, may also be considered as the
                    principal series, can easily be suppo sed from the agreement existing between
                    the forms derived from the scalene, and those derived from the isosceles
                    foursided pyramid. In order to obtain the members of these subordinate series,
                    enlarge the faces of the fundamental form, fig. 10, on both sides; draw in the
                    enlarged faces triangles, equal and similar to the faces of the fundamental
                    form; through the point <hi rend="italic">a, a! . . x, x</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> f</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>., thus determined, lay rhombs,
                    similar and parallel to the basis of the fundamental form; multiply the axis by
                    a number <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> join the points X <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, A', of the lengthened axis by straight lines with
                    the said points <hi rend="italic">a, a'. . x, x</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> f</hi>; and, lastly, reduce the derived pyramid which has a basis
                    similar to that of the fundamental form, to an equal horizontal projection with
                    it. The number <hi rend="italic">m</hi> being not yet determined, the
                    coefficient of the subordinate series will be = <hi rend="superscript">
                    m</hi>-⅛∙-; which, if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> + 1</p><p>be equal to any power of the number 2, shews the member to which it belongs to be
                    a member of the principal series. The subordinate series, whose coefficient,
                    besides powers of the number 2, contains the factor 3, is termed the <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> and that which, in the same case, contains the factor
                    5, the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> subordinate series. Members of the
                    principal, of the first and of the second subordinate series, which are supposed
                    to belong together, arrange themselves thus: 1: ∣: f, which numbers express the
                    ratio between their axes. The designation and the position of the members in the
                    subordinate series is evident from the foregoing.</p><p>53. <hi rend="italic">Resolution of the Auxiliary Form,</hi> § 41. <hi rend="italic">Horizontal Prisms.</hi></p><p>The only form now left for examination is the auxiliary form, § 41; which, as has
                    been mentioned above, is not a simple one, its faces not being homologous. By
                    enlarging only those planes which, amongst themselves, are equal and similar,
                    there arise <hi rend="italic">two</hi><hi rend="italic">obliquangular</hi><hi rend="italic">four-sided prisms,</hi> unlimited in the direction of their axis,
                    and which, therefore, like all the prisms, are forms in which one dimensioħ is
                    infinite. The axes of the two prisms are perpendicular to each other, and have a
                    horizontal position, if the fundamental form be in the upright position. These
                    axes coih-cide with the diagonals of the basis of the fundamental form produced
                    to an infinite length. Hence the prisms may be considered as scalene four-sided
                    pyramids, one diagonal of which has become infinite; similarly to the <hi rend="italic">vertical</hi> prisms, that are scalene four-sided pyramids of an
                    infinite axis. For the sake of distinguishing them from these, they bear the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820782" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0782-0121"/>
                    name of <hi rend="italic">horizontal</hi> prisms, and their general designation
                    is Pr + <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> More particularly, Pr + <hi rend="italic">n</hi> expresses the horizontal prism in which the longer diagonal, Pr + ∞ that
                    in which the shorter diagonal of the fundamental form has remained a finite
                    quantity.</p><p>54. <hi rend="italic">Series of Horizontal Prisms.</hi></p><p>Every scalene four-sided pyramid, whatever its properties may be, has its
                    dependent horizontal prisms. To every series of such forms will, therefore,
                    belong two series of horizontal prisms, to be distinguished by their designation
                    according to the properties of those series. It is, however, remarked, that, if
                    we take the common values of <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> as stated above, the
                    angles of several members of those series, and, therefore, the series
                    themselves, will be identical; and, for this reason, one designation will
                    suffice for them. Thus, the number of series of those forms taken together may
                    be reduced to three pairs, of which the first pair belongs to the principal, the
                    others to the subordinate series of scalene four-sided pyramids; each of the
                    diagonals having one series referred to it. The horizontal prisms belonging to a
                    scalene four-sided pyramid are produced by placing tangent planes in its <hi rend="italic">homologous</hi> terminal edges. If those terminal edges connect
                    the terminal point j&gt;f the axis with the long diagonal, the prism is said to
                    belong, or to be referred, to the long; if they connect it with the short, it is
                    said to belong, or to be referred, to the short diagonal of P. The horizontal
                    prisms are remarkable forms, often to be met with in the natural
                    combinations.</p><p>55. <hi rend="italic">Limits of the Series of Horizontal Prisms.</hi></p><p>By comparing the horizontal prisms belonging to members of a series of scalene
                    four-sided pyramids, it becomes evident how, whilst the axis of the pyramid
                    increases, the angle of the horizontal prism contiguous to the axis of the
                    fundamental form becomes smaller and smaller; whilst the other, at the
                    intersection of the planes from different apices, becomes greater and greater.
                    If the axis of the pyramid become infinite, or the pyramid itself a vertical
                    prism, the first of these angles will disappear, the second become = 180°. Hence
                    a horizontal prism is transformed, in this case, in a pair of unlimited parallel
                    planes, perpendicular to the diagonals to which they belong. These planes, which
                    may be considered as forms unlimited, as it were, in two directions, are the
                    limits of the series of horizontal prisms, the axis of the pyramid to which they
                    belong being infinite. The opposite limits, or those which appear, if the
                    pyramid have an infinitely small axis, appear as faces perpendicular to the
                    axis. The series of horizontal prisms between their limits may, accordingly, be
                    represented thus:</p><p>P — ∞ . . . Pr + <hi rend="italic">n . .</hi>. Pr + ∞</p><p>P — ∞. . . Pr + <hi rend="italic">η . .</hi>. Pr + ∞.</p><p>For, having the designation in every respect complete, the coefficient of the
                    series to which the horizontal prism belongs must be added to the sign for a
                    particular member.</p><p>Although this is not a place for entering into the examination of combined forms,
                    yet that peculiar combination which is produced by the two limits of the series
                    of horizontal prisms, and takes the appearance of a vertical rectangular
                    four-sided prism, not yet limited in the direction of its axis, cannot remain
                    unnoticed. This combination is designated by Pr + ∞ . Pr + oo; it must carefully
                    be distinguished from the rectangular four-sided prisms, limiting the series of
                    isosceles four-sided pyramids, which, abstraction being made of the face
                    perpendicular to the axis, are simple forms; a property not belonging to the
                    rectangular prism in connection with the scalene four-sided pyramid.</p><p>56. <hi rend="italic">Dérivations</hi><hi rend="italic">from the
                    Hexahedron.</hi></p><p>Besides the rhomboid, the isosceles, and the scalene four-sided pyramids, there
                    is only one other form existing fit for being considered as a fundamental form,
                    or which, without being derivable from any one of the former, can itself serve
                    as basis to the derivation. This form is the <hi rend="italic">hexahedron,</hi>
                    fig. 11. There are, in connection with the hexahedron, a great number of other
                    forms, remarkable for their properties, differing, however, from each other more
                    by their general aspect than by their dimensions. The complete assemblage of
                    those forms is obtained in the following way. Bring first the hexahedron in an
                    upright position, so as to bring one of its corners uppermost, and the opposite
                    perpendicularly below it, by which means the rhomboidal axis, passing the two
                    corners, becomes vertical; then consider the possible situations of a moveable
                    plane, tangent to the hexahedron in the uppermost point of the said rhomboidal
                    axis. The different situations the plane can effect are seven in number; but in
                    one of them it becomes parallel to the face of the hexahedron itself. Every one
                    of these situations gives rise to a peculiar form; hence there will exist as
                    many forms as the moveable plane can assume different situations, and no more.
                    The forms thus obtained agree in several of their properties, particularly in
                    respect of the kind, number, and situation of their axis, and are as fol lows

                    (fig. 15), contained under twenty-four isosceles triangles, its prominent form

                    forty-eight scalene triangles. The dimensions of the three first of these forms
                    are constant, a property not to be met with in the others, of which, therefore,
                    several varieties may be found differing from each other by their angles.</p><p>57∙ <hi rend="italic">Resolution of some of those Forms into Halves.</hi></p><p>This assemblage, though it is complete, seems not to contain all the forms in
                    connection with the hexahedron, as they are produced by nature, such as, for
                    instance, the tetrahedron, the pentagonal dodecahedrons, &amp;c. Nevertheless it
                    contains them, for they arise from a particular resolution of some of those
                    mentioned in § 56. This resolution is effected by enlarging half of the number
                    of planes to be met with in the form to be resolved, according to certain rules,
                    and by making the rest of them disappear. The two forms which arise out of the
                    resolution of one of the former are termed halves (not half forms, as the simple
                    four, six, or eight sided pyramids), and can be easily distinguished by the
                    lesser number of their axes, as some of those that are common to the original
                    forms disappear by the resolution. The two halves are perfectly equal and
                    similar to each other; they differ, however, amongst themselves by that position
                    in which they are placed by the resolution. The position of one of the halves
                    being considered as the <hi rend="italic">direct,</hi> that of the other will be
                    the <hi rend="italic">inverse.</hi> The latter is changed into the former by
                    inverting the vertical rhomboidal axis of the form, so as to bring the upper
                    apex lowermost, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Thus, the halves produced
                    from octahedron are the two <hi rend="italic">tetrahedrons</hi> (fig. 18),
                    contained un der four equilateral triangles; those from the hexahedral

                    have two pairs of equal angles; those from the octahedral
                    trigonal-icositetrahedron, the <hi rend="italic">two-edged</hi><hi rend="italic">tetragonal dodecahedrons</hi> (fig. 20), contained under twelve
                    tetragonal faces, in which there is only one pair of equal angles; those from
                    the two-edged tetragonal-icositetrahedron, the two <hi rend="italic">trigonal
                    dodecahedrons</hi> (fig. 21), contained under twelve isosceles triangles; and
                    lastly, the halves of the tetracontaoctahedron, viz. <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">tetrahedral trigonal-</hi><hi rend="italic">icositetrahedrons</hi> (fig. 22), contained under twenty-four scalene

                    (fig. 24), contained under twenty-four irregular pentagons, whose angles are all
                    different.</p><p>58. <hi rend="italic">Resolution of some of the Halves into Fourths.</hi></p><p>The three last, or those halves which are obtained from the tetracontaoctahedron,
                    allow of a further dissolution into halves of the halves, or into <hi rend="italic">fourths.</hi> These are the <hi rend="italic">tetrahedral

                    form, and in the pentagonal-icositetrahedron, deserves some attention. If
                    two-fourths are combined in the same position, which they assume in the
                    resolution, the halves are produced; and if the halves, produced by this
                    combination, are combined,likewise in their proper position, they will reproduce
                    the original form, out of which the halves as well as the fourths have been
                    obtained by way of resolution. Most of the original forms and their halves are
                    already known in several varieties of minerals; some of the latter, viz. the
                    tetrahedral pentagonal-dodecahedrons, and the pentagonal-icositetrahedrons, have
                    not yet been found.</p><p>59∙ <hi rend="italic">System of Crystallization and Series of

                    only by the number of objects they contain, the latter being a particular
                    determination of the former; and both refer not so much to the mere aggregation
                    of forms; as to the relations prevailing amongst them.</p><p>60. <hi rend="italic">Denomination of the Systems of Crystallization.</hi></p><p>The systems of crystallization, agreeing in number with the fundamental forms, of
                    which there are four, receive their names according to those fundamental forms.
                    That which has been derived from the rhomboid is called the <hi rend="italic">rhomboidal</hi><hi rend="italic">system,</hi> because its forms agree with the
                    rhomboid in their general properties; that which has been derived from the
                    isosceles four-sided pyramid, for the same reason, the <hi rend="italic">pyramidal system</hi>; that which has been derived from the scalene four-sided
                    pyramid, the <hi rend="italic">prismatic system,</hi> on account of the great
                    number and variety of prisms it contains; and that which has been derived from
                    the hexahedron, the <hi rend="italic">tessular system,</hi> in order to intimate
                    that there occurs no other system of crystallization in nature which shares in
                    the general properties of the hexahedron. It is evident that any form, if known,
                    will suffice for the determination of the system to which it belongs, even
                    though this form be a limiting one. Only the right rectangular four-sided prism
                    is an exception, since it may be a simple form in the tessular, a double
                    combination (P—oo . P+∞ ) in the pyramidal, and a triple' combination (P—∞ .</p><p>Q</p><p>Pr+∞ . Pr+∞ ) in the prismatic system. The consideration of the mere form does
                    not decide at all in this case. Some of the means of removing this uncertainty
                    will be explained hereafter.</p><p>61. <hi rend="italic">Determination of the series of Crystallization.</hi></p><p>A series of crystallization is determined by any one of its members, which is no
                    limiting form, if the dimensions of it are known. These dimensions, if they are
                    not (like those of the hexahedron, the octahedron, &amp;c.) constant, must be
                    made out by direct measurement. From these the dimensions of any other member,
                    or of the fundamental form, if it has not been measured itself, can be found, in
                    compliance with the relations developed above. The series of crystallization
                    proves of great importance for the determination of the natural history species
                    in the mineral kingdom. It is also an external character of the utmost value in
                    the character of the species. This character requires, therefore, the dimensions
                    of a member of the series to be stated, of which the most eligible is the
                    fundamental form. The limits do not determine the series of crystallization,
                    since, in the rhomboidal and in the pyramidal system, they are common to all; in
                    the prismatic, at least to those series which possess a similar transverse
                    section. Hence the obtaining the limiting forms is not sufficient for the
                    character of the natural history species.</p><p>62. <hi rend="italic">General Laws of Combination.</hi></p><p>The second advantage flowing from the above inquiries, consists in the accurate
                    understanding of the qualities of combinations, and of the development of their
                    most general laws. The first of these laws stands thus :— <hi rend="italic">The
                    forms which nature combines must belong to one series of crystallization.</hi>
                    The second, <hi rend="italic">The combination must be effected in that position
                    of the several simple forms it contains, which the derivation assigns to
                    them.</hi> Upon these two laws depends the symmetry of the combinations, which,
                    therefore, is not the <hi rend="italic">fundamental law of
                    crystallization.</hi></p><p>63. <hi rend="italic">Rhomboidal</hi><hi rend="italic">and Dirhomboidal
                    Combinations.</hi></p><p>An accurate investigation of the combinations is one of the most interesting
                    parts of crystallography. Without entering into minute details, some of their
                    relations may be shortly mentioned, as they convey general ideas of the
                    connection between different forms, and as they are, therefore, of consequence
                    in the system of arrangement and discrimination to be explained in this
                    article.</p><p>Combinations of the rhomboidal system, produced by simple forms in such a manner
                    that they appear in the combination with the full number of their faces, and in
                    their proper position, are termed <hi rend="italic">rhomboidal</hi>
                    combinations. Such are the most common combinations in the rhomboidal system.
                    Suppose, on the contrary, a rhomboid to combine with itself in a turned
                    position, it will affect the shape of a simple form, and appear as an isosceles
                    six-sided pyramid. It is termed a <hi rend="italic">dirhomboid,</hi> and
                    designated by 2 ( R + w). The dirhomboids do not arrange themselves with the
                    isosceles six-sided pyramids in the same series (§ 29), because there is a
                    difference existing in the situation of the bases in the one and in the other,
                    as becomes evident in considering the derivation. In a similaf way, two equal
                    scalene six-sided pyramids being combined in a turned position, produce a
                    scalene twelve-sided pyramid, which has as little right as the dirhomboid to be
                    ranked with the simple forms, although its faces are all equal and similar to
                    each other. Combinations produced by, or containing forms of this kind, are
                    termed <hi rend="italic">dirhomboidal</hi> combinations.</p><p>64. <hi rend="italic">Hemi-rhomboidal and Hemi-dirhomboidal
                    Combinations.</hi></p><p>It sometimes happens in the rhomboidal system, that the forms enter only with
                    half the number of their faces into a combination. If these combinations contain
                    simple forms, they are said to be <hi rend="italic">hemi-rhomboidal</hi>; if
                    they contain any of the above-mentioned compound forms under this restriction,
                    they are said to be <hi rend="italic">hemi-dirhomboidal.</hi> A further
                    distinction is to be made among such combinations, in as much as the faces
                    contiguous to one apex are either parallel, or inclined to those of the other.
                    The hemi-rhomboidal, or hemi-dirhomboidal, are said, in the first case, to be
                    <hi rend="italic">of parallel,</hi> in the other to be <hi rend="italic">of
                    inclined</hi> faces. An example will put the importance of this difference in
                    its full light: enlarge in a scalene six-sided pyramid the alternating faces
                    contiguous to one apex, and, at the same time, those of the opposite apex, which
                    are <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> to the former, the resultant form will take
                    the appearance of a rhomboid, without in reality being a form of this kind. If,
                    on the contrary, the faces enlarged on the opposite apex are <hi rend="italic">inclined</hi> to those of the former, the resultant form is contained under six
                    trapezoidal faces.</p><p>65. <hi rend="italic">Pyramidal and Hemi-pyramidal Combinations.</hi></p><p>A relation similar to that which in the rhomboidal system has been expressed by
                    the name of hemi-rhomboidal, is equally found in the pyramidal system, and here
                    it constitutes the <hi rend="italic">hemi-pyramidal</hi> combinations. The
                    hemi-pyramidal combinations <hi rend="italic">of parallel</hi> faces refer only
                    to the eightsided pyramids, which by this affect the shape of isosceles
                    four-sided pyramids, without partaking of their other properties; those <hi rend="italic">of inclined</hi> faces refer also to the isosceles four-sided
                    pyramids, which yield forms analogous to the tetrahedron, whilst the result of
                    the scalene eight-sided pyramid is a particular form, contained under eight
                    scalene triangles.</p><p>66. <hi rend="italic">Prismatic, Hemi-prismatic, and Tetarto-prismatic
                    Combinations.</hi></p><p>The differences already mentioned are particularly remarkable in the prismatic
                    system. From what has been said in respect to the other systems, it becomes
                    evident what is meant by <hi rend="italic">prismatic</hi> and by <hi rend="italic">hemi-prismatic</hi> combinations. The latter expression refers
                    also to one or to several prisms, whose axes are parallel, if they enter into
                    the combinations with only half the number of their faces. A similar relation of
                    forms in the present system, marked by <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820821" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0821-0124"/> the expression
                    <hi rend="italic">tetarto-prismatic,</hi> arises, when of a scalene four-sided
                    pyramid only the fourth part, as to the number, of the faces appear in a
                    combination. Such a combination can also be produced by oblique angular
                    four-sided prisms, whose axes are perpendicular to each other, when only half
                    the number of their faces is visible. The hemi and tetarto-prismatic
                    combinations illustrate the <hi rend="italic">oblique,</hi> the rectangular as
                    well as the obliquangular prisms produced by nature. These belong altogether to
                    the prismatic system, and none of them is a simple form.</p><p>The signs of the hemi-rhomboidal, hemi-pyramidal, and hemi-prismatic, are
                    composed of the signs of the whole forms, and of the number 2, placed below them
                    like a divisor; instead of the latter, the signs of the tetarto-prismatic
                    combinations contain the number 4 as divisor.</p><p>67. <hi rend="italic">Tessular and Semi-tessular Combinations.</hi></p><p>Those combinations of the tessular system, into which no halves or fourths enter,
                    are called <hi rend="italic">tessular</hi> combinations, and in the present
                    place they need no further explanation. Combinations of this system, however,
                    containing halves, are termed <hi rend="italic">semi-tessular</hi> combinations.
                    These allow of a further distinction into semi-tessular combinations <hi rend="italic">of parallel faces,</hi> and into those <hi rend="italic">of
                    inclined</hi> faces, as is the case in the hemi-rhomboidal and hemi-pyramidal
                    combinations. The halves peculiar to the former are those in which every face is
                    parallel to another, as the hexahedral pentagonal dodecahedron, the three-edged
                    tetragonal-icositetrahedron, and the general aspect of the forms undergoes
                    thereby no alteration. The halves peculiar to the latter have not two faces
                    parallel to each other, as the tetrahedron, the tetrahedral
                    trigonal-icositetrahedron, &amp;c., and the combination itself assumes, or at
                    least approaches to a tetrahedral aspect.</p><p>Instead of crystallographic signs, <hi rend="italic">verbal</hi> expressions are
                    employed, in the characteristic part of this article, when describing the forms
                    of the tessular system; because the use of the former is in the present system
                    subject to much greater difficulties, without affording services either so
                    beneficial or so numerous as in the other systems.</p><p>68. <hi rend="italic">Development of the Combinations.</hi></p><p>To develope a combination is to exhibit by itself each of the simple forms which
                    it contains (§ 4). The determination of the kind of these forms has no
                    difficulty whatever. The homologous planes of a combination being enlarged till
                    the rest disappear, one of the forms alter the other is produced. To find out
                    their relations, upon the knowledge of which, nevertheless, depends the
                    demonstration of the combinations, is somewhat more circumstantial, and here the
                    series of simple forms, produced by the derivation, shew their great utility.
                    The following paragraph contains a general idea of the mode of proceeding,
                    followed for this purpose by crystallography, though its full explanation would
                    require too much calculation to be given in this place.</p><p>69∙ <hi rend="italic">Line of Combination, General Formulae for it, and their
                    Application.</hi></p><p>Imagine a combination of two simple forms, whose dimensions are known, and which
                    themselves are in such a position as is peculiar to the system of
                    crystallization to which they belong. Suppose now two terminal edges, or two
                    diagonals, or one terminal edge and one diagonal, that are situated in a plane
                    which, at the same time, passes through the axis, to be prolonged, till they
                    intersect each other above or below, in a finite or infinite distance from a
                    horizontal plane, laid through the centre of the axis. The straight line
                    measuring the distance between the mutual intersection of the two lengthened
                    lines, and that in which one of the lines meets with the horizontal plane, is
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">line of combination.</hi> The length and situation
                    of the line of combination are evidently dependent upon the dimensions of the
                    combined forms; and inversely the situation of the edge of combination (§ 3.) is
                    dependent upon the length and situation of the line of combination: for, join by
                    a straight line the terminal point of the line of combination with one of the
                    points of intersection between the edges and diagonals of the combined forms,
                    amongst themselves or with each other, the prolongation of this line will
                    equally pass through the other point of intersection, and therefore be identical
                    with the edge of combination. Hence if two forms of a system, in a determined
                    position, produce with a third form lines of combination equal both in length
                    and situation, the edges of combination thus produced will be equally situated;
                    and if the two forms enter at once into combination with the third, the edges of
                    combination produced by the first and the third must be parallel to those
                    between the second and the third.</p><p>Crystallography developes general formulae, expressing the quantity of the line
                    of combination respecting the three first systems of crystallization (this not
                    being required for the tessular system), in which due notice is taken of the
                    kind of forms, their position, and the quality of the edges of combination,
                    namely, whether the faces producing them are contiguous to one or to different
                    apices of the simple forms. Of these formulae, that which answers to the
                    circumstances of a given combination between two known simple forms, is chosen
                    and determined for that particular case, by substituting, instead of the
                    variable quantities, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    occurring in them, those finite numbers, which depend upon the place of the
                    members in the series, and those factors by which the axes of the rhomboids and
                    others have been multiplied. Thus the quantity of the line of combination,
                    expressed either by a terminal edge, or by a diagonal, or by the axis of one or
                    the other form contained in the combination, is found. Another formula must now
                    be chosen, answering to a combination between <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of
                    these known forms, and <hi rend="italic">another unknown,</hi> which produces
                    with it edges of combination parallel to those in the combination of the two
                    known forms. The formula must be determined for the case in question, by the
                    substitution of numbers to <hi rend="italic">nι</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> This can only be done in respect to the known forms; <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the unknown remain unaltered in the
                    expression. This expression, as is evident from the preceding, must be equal to
                    the value of the line of combination found above. These two equal terms give an
                    equation to be resolved for the values of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n.</hi></p><p>If the unknown form contains only <hi rend="italic">n</hi> (as for instance it
                    being a rhomboid, where <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1), it
                    is determined in the manner already mentioned. If, on the contrary, it contains
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> at once, another equation
                    must be established in order to determine the second quantity, which is effected
                    in the manner shewn already. Some experience in this method of developing the
                    combinations will teach how to take advantage of certain circumstances offering
                    themselves, by which very often it is rendered possible to argue immediately
                    upon one of the unknown quantities <hi rend="italic">m</hi> or <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> or even sometimes upon both, and to determine the relations of several
                    forms, according to such arguments, without being obliged to employ
                    calculations.</p><p>Every simple form being thus determined as member of a series, and furnished with
                    its crystallographic sign; the combination containing those simple forms will be
                    designated by writing the signs for the simple forms one after the other, as
                    some instances in the preceding, § 60, have already shewn. As to the order in
                    which the signs succeed each other in designating a combination, there are two
                    distinct methods, each of which may be applied. Either those forms, whose planes
                    are perpendicular to the axis, are set down first, those whose planes are
                    parallel to it, last; the rest following each other according to the greater or
                    less inclination which their faces have toward the axis, as decreasing from 90°

                    Combination.</hi></p><p>After having developed the combination, the last office of crystallography is to
                    calculate the angles of combination, or the incidences of the faces of different
                    forms. In many instances this angle follows at once from those of the simple
                    forms. If this will not do, crystallography employs general formulae for the
                    trigonometrical functions of the edge of combination, similar to those for the
                    line of combination, containing equally the variable quantities <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and n. The development of the combinations determines these
                    quantities, and if substituted in the said formulae, they give the value of a
                    trigonometrical function, commonly of the cosine of the angle, produced by two
                    faces of different forms, meeting in the edge of combination.</p><p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cleavage.</hi><hi rend="italic">Foliated Fracture of
                    Werner.</hi><hi rend="italic">Cleavage</hi> is the property which minerals
                    possess of splitting in certain determinate directions. The faces or planes thus
                    obtained, which are termed the <hi rend="italic">faces of the cleavage,</hi> are
                    more or less smooth and shining. The forms contained under these forms are
                    called <hi rend="italic">forms of cleavage,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cleavage-forms.</hi></p><p>The cleavage-forms represent members of the series of crystallization of those
                    mineral species to which the mineral having the cleavage belongs. The same may
                    be inferred of such individuals or species as possess more than one
                    cleavage-form. Hence cleavage extends the application of crystallography in the
                    mineral kingdom, because a mineral, although it be not crystallized, may be
                    cleavable, and thus allow the series, at least the system of crystallization, to
                    be made out by cleavage in most of the cases where no regular crystallizations
                    occur.</p><p>The cleavage-forms are designated like those of crystallization. Cleavage-forms,
                    Mohs remarks, if among the the number of those which, in the preceding pages,
                    served as a basis to the derivation, are by preference chosen for representing
                    the fundamental form in the species to which they belong; as in rhomboidal
                    calc-spar, the rhomboid of 105° 5 ’. This rule, however, suffers an exception in
                    the case of a rhomboid or a pyramid, which occur as cleavageforms, being too
                    obtuse or too acute. For this reason, in pyramidal copper-pyrites, the
                    fundamental form is P, though the cleavage-form is P + 1. No cleavage-form,
                    whose dimensions are infinite, can be employed as a fundamental form.</p><p>A few technical expressions are employed by Mohs in determining the cleavage, of
                    which the following may be enumerated. Cleavage, in the three first systems of
                    crystallization, which are those of variable dimensions, is said to be <hi rend="italic">axotomous,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From <hi rend="italic">α</hi><hi rend="italic">ξ</hi><hi rend="italic">ω</hi><hi rend="italic">v</hi>, the axis, and <hi rend="italic">τ</hi><hi rend="italic">ε</hi><hi rend="italic">μνω</hi>, I cut; cleavable in

                    the fundamental figure, or are inclined to the axis.</p></note> ’ if it is
                    parallel to the faces of a finite form; and <hi rend="italic">peritomous,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From

                    with surrounding cleavage planes parallel to the axis.</p></note> if it takes
                    place parallel to the axis, and equally distinct in more than one direction. In
                    the prismatic system, the expression <hi rend="italic">prismatoidal</hi> means a
                    single cleavage face parallel to the axis; and <hi rend="italic">diprismatic</hi> denotes the cleavage to be parallel at the same time to the
                    faces of a vertical, and to those of a horizontal obliquangular four-sided
                    prism. The expression <hi rend="italic">monotomous,</hi> referring to the three
                    systems, is more general than any of the foregoing; it comprises the axotomous
                    and the prismatoidal, and is applied where a single cleavage-face is met with,
                    whose position in regard to the axes, that is to say, whether it is parallel or
                    perpendicular to the axis, has not been determined. The perfection or
                    distinctness of the cleavage, which is next to be considered, refers to the
                    aspect of the faces of the cleavage, viz. whether these are more or less smooth
                    or shining, whether they are streaked, &amp;c. The most important object to be
                    remarked in this respect, is the sameness of quality existing in the faces
                    belonging to one and the same, and the diversity of faces belonging to different
                    cleavage-forms; the latter is a particular illustrated and confirmed by the
                    derivations of the prismatic system. The nature of the faces of the cleavage is
                    one of the means to remove the uncertainty mentioned in § 60, on account of the
                    right rectangular prism. Lastly, it may be remarked, that we must be careful not
                    to confound certain faces of composition (§ 86), which sometimes likewise keep
                    constant directions with the cleavage-forms.</p><p>HI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hardness</hi></p><p>Is the resistance which solid minerals oppose, when we attempt to separate their
                    parts.</p><p>This important character has been rendered more available by Professor Mohs, who
                    gives the following as a useful scale of hardness:</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Talc,</hi> of a white or greenish colour.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Rock-salt,</hi> a pure cleavable variety, or semitransparent
                    <hi rend="italic">uncrystallized gypsum,</hi> the transparent and crystallized
                    varieties being generally too soft.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Calcareous spar,</hi> a cleavable variety.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Fluor-spar,</hi> in which the cleavage is distinct.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Apatite,</hi> the asparagus stone, or phosphate of lime,
                    from Saltzburg.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">Adularia felspar,</hi> any cleavable variety.</p><p>7. <hi rend="italic">Rock-crystal,</hi> a transparent variety.</p><p>8. <hi rend="italic">Prismatic topaz,</hi> any simple variety.</p><p>9. <hi rend="italic">Corundum</hi> from India, which affords smooth cleavage
                    surfaces.</p><p>10. The <hi rend="italic">Diamond.</hi></p><p>If we wish, by means of this scale, to ascertain the hardness of a mineral, we
                    first try which of the members of the scale is scratched by it. In order to save
                    the specimens of the scale it is desirable to begin, in our determination of
                    hardness, with the highest members of the scale, and proceed downwards, until we
                    reach the one which is scratched. We next take a fine hard file, and draw along
                    its surface, with the least possible force, the specimen we <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820847" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0847-0126"/> are examining,
                    and also one of the minerals in the scale whose hardness is immediately above
                    that of the mineral which has been scratched, in order to compare them together.
                    From the resistance they offer to the file, from the noise occasioned by their
                    passing along it, and from the quantity of powder left on its surface, their
                    relative hardness is deduced. If the two specimens afford the same degree of
                    noise and resistance, and same quantity of powder, their hardness is the same.
                    When, after repeated trials, we are satisfied to which member of the scale of
                    hardness one mineral is most nearly allied, we say its hardness (suppose it to
                    be felspar) is equal to 6, and write after it 11 = 6.0. If the mineral do not
                    exactly correspond with any degree of the scale, but is found to be between two
                    of them, we say H = 6.5.</p><p>In our experiments we must be careful to employ specimens, each of which nearly
                    agree in form and size, and also as much as possible in the shape of their
                    angles. They should also be quite pure, as, if impure, their hardness cannot be
                    determined with accuracy.</p><p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Specific Gravity.</hi></p><p>The specific gravity of minerals, a very important distinctive character, is
                    determined by means of the hydrostatic balance, the hydrometer or areometer, and
                    Adie’s apparatus, a new instrument. (l+⅛ Memoirs of the Wernerian Society.)
                    These instruments, and the mode of taking specific gravities, are given under
                    other articles in this work.</p><p>II. CHARACTERS EMPLOYED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SPECIES, SUB-SPECIES, KINDS,

                    and even the varieties, although often extremely beautiful, and apparently
                    infinite in number, bera but a small proportion to the vast series that
                    characterize the various productions of the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
                    Werner, who bestowed great attention on this interesting and beautiful
                    character, enumerates <hi rend="italic">eight principal colours,</hi> viz.
                    white, grey, black, blue, green, yellow, red, and brown. Each of these principal
                    colours exhibits a greater or less number of varieties; the purest variety is
                    named the <hi rend="italic">characteristic colour,</hi> thus snow-white, the
                    purest colour of the white series, is the characteristic colour. Colours are
                    further divided into <hi rend="italic">non-metallic,</hi> or those without

                    amples, native copper and copper nickel.</p><p>II. <hi rend="italic">The Play of the Colours.</hi></p><p>If we look on a mineral which possesses this property, we observe, on turning it
                    slowly, besides its common colours, many others, which are distributed in small
                    shining points. It is beautifully seen in the diamond when cut, and also in
                    precious opal, both in the rough state and when polished.</p><p>HI. <hi rend="italic">The Changeability of the Colours.</hi></p><p>When the surface of a mineral, which we turn in different directions, exhibits,
                    besides its common colours, different bright colours, that do not change so
                    rapidly, are fewer in number, and occur in larger patches than in the play of
                    the colour, it is said to exhibit what is called the changeability of the
                    colours. The changeability of colour is seen only in particular directions
                    connected with the structure of the mineral, while the play of colour is visible
                    in all directions. Example, Labrador felspar.</p><p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Opalescence.</hi></p><p>Consists in a kind of reflected milky-light, which some minerals exhibit when cut
                    <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">cabachon,</hi> or upon plain faces
                    both natural and artificial. This appearance in catseye stone is alleged to be
                    owing to the fibrous structure of the mineral; while in adularia and sapphire,
                    in which it is beautifully seen, it is traced to the foliated structure.</p><p>V. <hi rend="italic">The Iridescence.</hi></p><p>When a mineral exhibits the colours of the prism or the rainbow, arranged in
                    parallel, and sometimes in variously curved layers, it is said to be iridescent.
                    This appearance is supposed in some cases to depend on fissures in the interior
                    of the mineral, as in iridescent rock-crystal, or on the lamellary structure, as
                    in iridescent or rainbow calcedony.</p><p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Tarnished Colours.</hi></p><p>A mineral is said to be tarnished when it shews on its external surface, or on
                    that of the distinct concretions, fixed colours different from those on its
                    interior or fresh fracture.</p><p>Tarnished colours are <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> or <hi rend="italic">variegated.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. Simple.</hi><hi rend="italic">a.

                    their basis. Of these the following are enumerated by Werner.</p><p><hi rend="italic">α. Pavonine,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">peacock-tail
                    tarnish.</hi> This is an as semblage of yellow, green, blue, red, and brown
                    colours, on a yellow ground. The colours are nearly equal in proportion, and are
                    never precisely distinct, but always pass more or less into one another.
                    Example, copper-pyrites.</p><p><hi rend="italic">b. Iridescent,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rainbow tarnish.</hi>
                    In this variety the colours are red, blue, green, and yellow, on a grey ground.
                    It is more beautiful and brighter than the preceding. Example, specular iron-ore
                    or iron-glance of Elba.</p><p><hi rend="italic">c. Columbine,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pigeon-necked
                    tarnish.</hi> The colours are the same as in the preceding, with this
                    difference, that the tints of colour are paler, and the red predominates.
                    Example, native bismuth of Schneeberg.</p><p><hi rend="italic">d. Tempered-steel tarnish.</hi> The colours are vèry pale blue,
                    green, and very little yellow. Example, grey cobalt.</p><p>VII. <hi rend="italic">Colour Suite.</hi></p><p>Where more than one colour occurs in a species, we find that the tints form
                    characteristic groups or suites, peculiar to the species.</p><p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">Dicroism.</hi></p><p>Some minerals when examined by transmitted light in determinate directions,
                    exhibit different colours. This property is called dichroism. Iolite,
                    tourmaline, and mica exhibit this phenomenon. Iolite is blue in the direction of
                    the axis, yellow or grey perpendicular to it; some varieties of* tourmaline are
                    nearly opaque in the direction of the axis, while they display several degrees
                    of transparency, and different green, brown, and blue colours in the direction
                    perpendicular to it; several varieties of mica are green in the direction of the
                    axis, but brown perpendicular to it.</p><p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Common and Particular External Forms.</hi></p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Common External Shape.</hi></p><p>Common external shapes are those in which there are neither a determinate number
                    of planes meeting under determinate angles, nor any resemblance to known natural
                    or artificial bodies. As they occur more frequently than the other shapes, they
                    are named <hi rend="italic">common external shapes.</hi></p><p>Six different kinds are enumerated by Werner, which are distinguished according
                    to their relative length, breadth, and thickness, their relative magnitude, and
                    their connections with other minerals. The kinds are <hi rend="italic">massive,
                    disseminated, in angular pieces, in grains, in plates, and in
                    membranes.</hi></p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Massive</hi> is that common external shape which is from the
                    size of a hazel-nut to the greatest magnitude, and whose dimensions, in length,
                    breadth, and thickness, are nearly alike. It occurs imbedded in other minerals.
                    A very common form.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Disseminated</hi> is from the size of a hazel-nut until it
                    is scarcely visible, and its dimensions, in length, breadth, and thickness, are
                    nearly alike. It occurs imbedded.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">In angular pieces.</hi> These are distinguished from
                    massive, by their occurring loose and unattached. Of this external shape there
                    are two kinds:</p><p><hi rend="italic">a. Sharp-cornered,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">quartz.</hi><hi rend="italic">b. Blunt-cornered,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">common
                    opal.</hi></p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">In grains.</hi> The form in grains bears the same relation
                    to angular pieces, as disseminated does to massive. They are distinguished into
                    <hi rend="italic">coarse, small,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">flne grains,</hi>
                    and into <hi rend="italic">roundish, angular,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">flat
                    grains.</hi> Examples, garnet, platina, and gold.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">In plates.</hi> This form is distinguished from massive, by
                    its dimensions in breadth and length very much exceeding that in thickness; and
                    are generally formed in veins. Example, red silver.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">In membranes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">flakes.</hi> This
                    shape is distinguished from the former by its thinness, as it never greatly
                    exceeds the thickness of common paper, and the fracture cannot be seen.

                    resemblance to natural or artificial bodies, and in being far more
                    characteristic and varied in their aspect. There arc four different sets,
                    entitled, ' <hi rend="italic">longish, roundish, flat,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cavernous.</hi></p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Longish Particular External Shapes.</hi><hi rend="italic">a. Dentiform.</hi> Adheres by its thick extremity, becomes gradually thinner,
                    incnrvated, and at length terminates in a free point, so that it resembles a

                    terminates by an almost imperceptible diminution of thickness, and is usually

                    thinner, it forms the capillary. It is generally much entangled, and sometimes

                    native silver.</p><p><hi rend="italic">d. Reticulated</hi> is composed of many straight threads, that
                    cross each other under 90°, or under 120° and 60°, and thus form a reticulated

                    and calcedony.</p><p><hi rend="italic">c. Reniform</hi> consists of small segments of large balls,
                    which are so closely set together that the interstices are very inconsiderable.
                    Example, calcedony.</p><p><hi rend="italic">d. Tuberose.</hi> This shape consists of irregular roundish or
                    longish elevations and depressions. Example, flint.</p><p><hi rend="italic">e. Fused-lihe</hi> or <hi rend="italic">liquiform.</hi> This
                    consists of numerous very flat rounded elevations, which are generally depressed
                    in the middle. Example, lead-glance.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Flat Particular External Shapes.</hi><hi rend="italic">a.
                    Specular</hi> has on one side, seldom on two opposite sides, a straight smooth
                    shining surface. It occurs in veins. Example, galena or lead-glance.</p><p><hi rend="italic">b. In leaves.</hi> In this external shape there are thin
                    leaves, which are either irregularly curved, or arc straight, and have
                    throughout the same thickness. It occurs frequently in native gold.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Cavernous Particular External Shapes.</hi><hi rend="italic">a. Cellular.</hi> A mineral is said to be cellular when it is composed of
                    straight or bent tables, which cross each other in such a maimer as to form
                    empty spaces or cells. Example, quartz.</p><p><hi rend="italic">b. Impressed.</hi> That is, when one mineral shews the
                    impression of any particular or regular external shape of another mineral. It
                    borders on the cellular shape, and is formed when a newer mineral is deposited
                    over an’ older, the form of which it assumes and retains, even after the
                    impressing mineral has been destroyed or removed.</p><p><hi rend="italic">c. Perforated</hi> consist of long vermicular cavities, which
                    occupy but an inconsiderable portion of the mass, and terminate on the surface
                    in small holes. When the holes become very numerous, it passes into spongiform.
                    Example, bog iron-ore.</p><p><hi rend="italic">d. Corroded.</hi> A mineral is said to be corroded when it is
                    traversed with numerous hardly perceptible roundish holes. Example, quartz.</p><p><hi rend="italic">e. Amorphous</hi> is composed of numerous roundish and angular
                    parts that form inequalities, between which there are equally irregular hollows.
                    Example, silver-glance or Sulphuretted silver.</p><p><hi rend="italic">f. Vesicular.</hi> When a mineral has distributed through its
                    interior many single, usually round, elliptical, and spheroidal, also
                    amygdaloidal, or irregularly-shaped cavities, it is said to be vesicular.
                    Example, wacke and lava.</p><p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Distinct Concretions.</hi></p><p>Distinct concretions are those parts into which minerals arc naturally divided,
                    and which can be separated from one another, without breaking through the solid
                    or fresh part of the mineral. In describing them, we have to attend to the
                    following appearances. 1. Their shape; 2. Their surface; and, 3. Their
                    lustre.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Shape of the Distinct Concretions.</hi></p><p>They are granular, lamellar, prismatic, radiated, and fibrous.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Granular distinct concretions</hi> are those in which the
                    length, breadth, and thickness are nearly alike. Primitive limestone or marble
                    is composed of granular distinct concretions.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Lamellar distinct concretions</hi> are those in which the
                    length and breadth are nearly equal, and much more considerable than the
                    thickness. Lamellar heavy-spar affords a good example of this kind of
                    concretion.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Prismatic distinct concretions</hi> are those in which the
                    length is very considerable, in comparison of the thickness, thus forming
                    irregular prisms. Examples, amethyst and prismatic heavy spar.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Radiated distinct concretions</hi> are those in which the
                    form is thin prismatic, differing from the preceding in being<pb break="no" facs="nls:193820899" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0899-0130"/> narrower, and
                    in having the form of rays. The <hi rend="italic">radiated fracture</hi> of
                    Werner belongs to this division. Example, radiated iron-pyrites.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Fibrous distinct concretions</hi> are those in form of
                    fibres. The <hi rend="italic">fibrous fracture</hi> of Werner is included under
                    this head. Example, actynolite.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Surface of the Distinct Concretions.</hi></p><p>The surface varies considerably; in some, it is <hi rend="italic">smooth,</hi> as
                    in hematite; in others it is <hi rend="italic">streaked,</hi> as in schorl, or
                    it is uneven, as in hornblende.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Lustre of the Distinct</hi><hi rend="italic">Concretioris.</hi></p><p>Here the varieties of lustre are the same as already enumerated, and therefore
                    require no particular illustration.</p><p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Surface.</hi></p><p>The following are the varieties of this character :—</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Uneven.</hi> This, of all the kinds of external surface,
                    presents the greatest and most irregular elevations and depressions, yet they
                    are not so considerable as to alter the external shape. Example, surface of
                    balls of calcedony.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Granulated.</hi> When the surface appears like shagreen, it
                    is said to be granulated.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Rough.</hi> This kind of surface is marked with small,
                    scarcely-visible elevations, which we can hardly discover but by the feel. It
                    has little or no lustre. Example, rolled pieces of common quartz.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Smooth.</hi> Here there is no perceptible inequality, and
                    the surface reflects more light than the preceding kinds of external surface.
                    Example, fluor-spar.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Streaked.</hi> This kind of surface is marked with linelike
                    elevations. It is either <hi rend="italic">simply streaked</hi> or <hi rend="italic">doubly streaked.</hi><hi rend="italic">a. Simply streaked</hi>
                    when the line-like elevations run but in one direction.</p><p><hi rend="italic">».</hi><hi rend="italic">Longitudinally streaked.</hi> When
                    the streaks are parallel with the length of the lateral planes. Example,
                    topaz.</p><p><hi rend="italic">β. Transversely streaked.</hi> When the streaks are parallel
                    with the breadth of the lateral planes. Example, rock-crystal.</p><p>y. <hi rend="italic">Diagonally streaked.</hi> When the streaks are parallel with
                    the diagonal of the planes. Example, garnet.,</p><p>1 <hi rend="italic">Alternately streaked.</hi> When transverse and longitudinal
                    streaks occur on alternate planes. Example, cubic iron-pyrites.</p><p><hi rend="italic">b. Doubly streaked,</hi> when the streaks run in different
                    directions. This is of two kinds.</p><p><hi rend="italic">».</hi><hi rend="italic">Plumiformly.</hi> When the streaks
                    run obliquely towards a principal streak, like, the disposition of the parts of
                    a feather. Example, plumose native bismuth.</p><p><hi rend="italic">β. Reticularly.</hi> When the streaks either cross each other
                    in a promiscuous manner, or under right angles, forming à kind of flat net-work.
                    Example, silver-, white cobalt.</p><p>c, <hi rend="italic">Drusy.</hi> When a crystal is coated with a number of minute
                    crystals of the same kind as the mineral itself, the new surface is denominated
                    drusy. Example, common iron-pyrites.</p><p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lustre.</hi></p><p>Here we have to consider the <hi rend="italic">intensity</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">sort</hi> of lustre.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Intensity of the Lustre.</hi></p><p>Of this there are five different degrees.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Splendent.</hi> A fossil is said to be splendent, when in
                    full day-light its lustre is visible at a great distance, or when the faces
                    produce distinct and well-defined images. Example, galena or lead-glance.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Shining.</hi> When a mineral at a distance reflects but a
                    weak light, it is said to be shining; or when the lustre, although considerable,
                    does not form a distinct image. Example, heavy-spar.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Glistening.</hi> This degree of lustre is only observable
                    when the mineral is near us, and at no greater distance than arms-length; or
                    when the surface no longer forms an image, but reflects a more feeble light than
                    the preceding. Example, porcelain jasper.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Glimmering.</hi> If the surface of a mineral, when held near
                    to the eye in full and clear day-light, presents a number of small,
                    faintly-shining points, it is said to be glimmering. Example, red hematite.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Dull.</hi> When a mineral is destitute of lustre, it is said
                    to be dull. Example, chalk.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Sort of Lustre.</hi></p><p>The following are the different kinds of lustre :—</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Metallic lustre,</hi> which is always combined with opacity.
                    It is divided into <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> and <hi rend="italic">imperfect.</hi> The perfect occurs in native metals, and in all the species of
                    the orders pyrites and glance; and the imperfect in tantalum ore, uranium-ore,
                    and glance-coal.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Adamantine.</hi> So named from its occurring beautifully
                    marked in the diamond. There are two varieties of this lustre, viz. the <hi rend="italic">perfect</hi> and <hi rend="italic">metallic</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> the diamond, in its rough and polished states, bright red varieties of
                    ruby silver ore, and some varieties of blende, and carbonate of lead, afford
                    examples of the perfect, as the dark varieties of red silver-ore, and of zink
                    blende, of the second.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Pearly,</hi> so named from its resemblance to the lustre
                    observed in pearls, is divided into <hi rend="italic">common</hi> and <hi rend="italic">metallic-like.</hi> Mica and zeolite are examples of the first,
                    and bronzite of the second.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Resinous</hi> is that which a body would present if smeared
                    with oil. Example, pitchstone and vesuvian.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Vitreous</hi> or <hi rend="italic">glassy.</hi> The lustre
                    of glass. Example, rock-crystal.</p><p>VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fracture.</hi></p><p>Fracture surfaces, or planes, are those produced on breaking a mineral. The
                    following are the principal kinds:</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Splintery.</hi> When, on a nearly even fracture surface,
                    small wedge-shaped or sealyparts are to be observed, which adhere by their
                    thicker ends, and allow light to pass through, we say that the fracture is
                    splintery. It sometimes passes into even. Example, quartz.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Even</hi> is that kind of fracture in which the surface is
                    nearly even, or without inequalities. Example, Lydian-stone.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Conchoidal</hi> is composed of concave and convex roundish
                    depressions and elevations, which are more or less regular. When regular, they
                    are accompanied with concentric ridges, as in many shells. Examples, obsidian
                    and rock-crystal.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Uneven.</hi> In this kind of fracture the surface is marked
                    with numerous angular elevations. These inequalities are termed the <hi rend="italic">grain,</hi> so that we have <hi rend="italic">coarse</hi> and <hi rend="italic">finegrained</hi> uneven fractures. Example, copper-pyrites.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Earthy.</hi> When the fracture-surface shews a great number
                    of very small elevations and depressions, which make it appear rough, it is
                    called earthy. Example, chalk.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">Hackly.</hi> When the fracture-surface consists of numerous
                    small slightly-bent sharp inequalities, it is said to be hackly. Example, native
                    copper.</p><p>7. <hi rend="italic">Slaty.</hi> In this kind of fracture the mineral splits into
                    plates or slates which are more or less perfect. Example, common roof-slate.</p><p>VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Shape of the Fragments,</hi></p><p>Fragments are those shapes which are formed when a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820912" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0912-0131"/> mineral is so
                    forcibly struck, that masses having surrounding fracture-surfaces, are separated
                    from it.</p><p>The fragments are either <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> or <hi rend="italic">irregular.</hi></p><p>I. <hi rend="italic">Regular fragments</hi> are enclosed in a certain number of
                    regular planes, that meet under determinate angles. The following are the
                    varieties of regular fragments :—</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cubic,</hi> which occur in minerals possessing a rectangular
                    three-fold cleavage, as galena or lead-glance, and rock-salt.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Rhombohedral</hi> or <hi rend="italic">oblique angular,</hi>
                    which occur in minerals having a three-fold rhombohedral cleavage, as calcareous
                    spar.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Tetrahedral,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">three-sided
                    pyramidal</hi> and <hi rend="italic">octahedral,</hi> occur in minerals having a
                    four-fold cleavage in which the folia meet under equal angles, as in
                    fluor-spar.</p><p><hi rend="italic">4. Dodecahedral.</hi> Fragments of this form occur in minerals
                    having a six-fold cleavage. Example, zinc-blende.</p><p>II. <hi rend="italic">Irregular fragments</hi> are such as have no regular form.
                    The following are the different varieties :—</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cuneiform,</hi> in which the breadth and thickness are much
                    less than the length, and gradually and regularly diminish in magnitude from one
                    end to the other. Example, radiated zeolite. ,</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Splintery,</hi> in which the breadth and thickness are less
                    considerable than the length, but without diminution of magnitude from one
                    extremity to the other. Example, asbestus.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Tabular,</hi> in which the breadth and length are more
                    considerable than the thickness. Example, clay-slate.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Indeterminate angular,</hi> in which the length, breadth,
                    and thickness, are in general nearly alike, but the edges differ much in regard
                    to sharpness, which gives rise to the following distinctions:—</p><p><hi rend="italic">a. Very sharp-edged,</hi> as in obsidian.</p><p><hi rend="italic">b. Sharp-edged,</hi> as in common quartz.</p><p><hi rend="italic">c. Rather sharp-edged,</hi> as in basalt.</p><p><hi rend="italic">d. Rather blunt-edged,</hi> as in pumice.</p><p><hi rend="italic">e. Blunt-edged,</hi> as in gypsum.</p><p><hi rend="italic">f. Very blunt-edged,</hi> as in loam.’</p><p>VIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Transparency.</hi></p><p>The different degrees of this character are ascertained by observing the relative
                    quantity of light transmitted through their substance. The degrees are five.</p><p>1. When a mineral, either in thick or thin pieces, allows the rays of light to
                    pass through it so completely, that we can clearly distinguish small objects
                    placed behind it, as written letters, it is said to be transparent. It is either
                    <hi rend="italic">simply transparent,</hi> that is, when the body seen through
                    it appears single, as in selenite; or <hi rend="italic">duplicating,</hi> when
                    the body seen through it appears double, as in calcareous-spar.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Semi-transparent.</hi> When objects can be discerned only
                    through a thin piece, and then appear as if seen through a cloud, it is said to
                    be semi-transparent. Example, calcedony.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Translucent.</hi> When the rays of light penetrate into the
                    mineral and illuminate it, but objects placed behind it cannot be observed
                    either through thick or thin pieces, it is said to be translucent. Example,
                    pitch-stone.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Translucent on the edges.</hi> When the angles and edges are
                    illuminated in the same degree as the whole mineral in the immediately preceding
                    variety of transparency, it is said to be translucent on the edges. Example,
                    hornstone.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Opaque.</hi> When, even on the thinnest edges of a mineral,
                    no light passes through, it is said to be opaque, as in chalk.</p><p>IX. <hi rend="smallcaps">Opalescence.</hi></p><p>Some minerals, when held in particular directions, reflect from single spots in
                    their interior, a coloured shining lustre, named opalescence.</p><p>X. <hi rend="smallcaps">Streak.</hi></p><p>When a mineral is scratched with a hard body, as a knife or file, or is drawn
                    across the surface of a piece of porcelain biscuit, either a powder is formed,
                    or the scratched part acquires a higher lustre. Both these appearances are
                    comprehended under the term streak. The lustre is increased in the streak in the
                    malleable metals, in some glances, and in clays. Some minerals retain their
                    colour in the streak, as the glances and haloids; while others, as many ores,
                    all the pyrites tribe, many blendes, &amp;c. acquire a different colour when in
                    the streak.</p><p>XI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Soiling or Colouring.</hi></p><p>When a mineral, taken between the fingers, or drawn across a surface, leaves some
                    particles, or a trace, it is said to <hi rend="italic">soil</hi> or <hi rend="italic">colour.</hi></p><p>XII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Tenacity.</hi></p><p>By tenacity is understood the relative mobility, or the different degrees of
                    cohesion of the particles of minerals. The degrees of tenacity are the
                    following:—</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Brittle.</hi> A mineral is said to be brittle, when, on
                    attempting to cut it with a knife, it emits a grating noise, and the particles
                    fly away in the form of dust, and leave a rough surface, which has in general
                    less lustre than the fracture; it cannot therefore be cut into slices. Example,
                    quartz.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sectile or Mild.</hi> On cutting minerals possessing of this
                    degree of tenacity, the particles lose their connection in a considerable
                    degree, but this takes place without noise, and they do not fly off, but remain
                    on the knife. Example, galena or lead-glance, and some micas.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Ductile.</hi> Minerals possessing this degree of tenacity
                    can be cut into slices with a knife, extended under the hammer, and drawn into
                    wire. Example, native gold.</p><p>XIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Frangibility.</hi></p><p>By frangibility is understood the resistance which minerals oppose, when we
                    attempt to break them into pieces or fragments. It must not be confounded with
                    hardness. Quartz is hard, and hornblende comparatively soft; yet the latter is

                    direction; or <hi rend="italic">common flexible,</hi> when they can be bent in
                    different directions without breaking, but remain in the direction in which they
                    have been bent, as molybdena, gypsum, talc, asbestus, and all malleable

                    in the System.</hi></p><p>The characters principally employed in the formation of what is called the <hi rend="italic">Specific Character</hi> are the regular crystallizations
                    (including cleavage); the degrees of hardness; and the specific gravity. The
                    first character given in the <hi rend="italic">Specific Character</hi> is the
                    system of crystallization to which the form and cleavage of the species belongs.
                    Then follows, together with its dimensions (if known), the fundamental form,
                    from which all the other simple and compound forms are derived. In
                    rhombohedrons, that edge which ends in the apex of the axis, that is to say, the
                    terminal edge is given; for instance, in calcareous spar, R = 105° 5'; in
                    isosceles four-sided pyramids, both edges, first the terminal one, and then that
                    on the base, are mentioned; for instance, in pyramidal zircon, P = 123° 19',
                    84°20'; and in scalene four-sided pyramids, first, both of the terminal edges,
                    and then that at the basis, are given: thus, in prismatic topaz, P=141° 7', 10l
                    <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 52 ’, 90° 55′. In this system, besides the
                    dimension of the finite forms, those of the infinite ones, or of the limits, are
                    mentioned, as in the last example, P+∞ =124° 19 ’, and so on; which is very
                    convenient, as the cases in which these can be examined occur more frequently
                    than those in which the edges of pyramids can be measured.</p><p>After this follows the indication of the general aspect of the combinations,
                    explained in the foregoing § § 63-67, under the denominations of dirhomboidal,
                    hemi-prismatic, &amp;c. Of the former are mentioned the angles at the edges of
                    combination, of the latter that terminal edge, which is formed by the
                    intersection of the remaining faces of the scalene four-sided pyramid.</p><p>With respect to cleavage, the expression “cleavage, R,” for instance in
                    rhombohedral calcareous spar, means, that this mineral has its cleavage parallel
                    to the faces of a rhombohedron, similar to the fundamental form of the species;
                    “cleavage P—∞ . P +∞ .[P +∞ ]” in pyramidal garnet means that this mineral has
                    its cleavage parallel to the faces of two rectangular prisms, and at die same
                    time o perpendicular to their axis; “cleavage Pr+∞” in prismatic chrysolite,
                    indicates that the cleavage of this mineral passes at the same time through the
                    axis and the short di-</p><p>Q</p><p>agonal of the prism P+∞; and “cleavage (Pr+∞) <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> =
                    Q</p><p>87° 42'. Pr+∞ . Pr+∞, <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> expresses, for instance, in
                    paratomous augite, that the individuals of this species can be cleaved, first
                    parallel to the faces of an obliquangular foursided prism, of the given
                    dimensions; and, secondly, parallel to planes, which pass through the axis and
                    both diagonals of the prism P + oe; or, what comes to the same, parallel to the
                    faces of a rectangular prism.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Characters mutually excluding each other.</hi><hi rend="italic">If</hi> two or more characters, the one of which excludes the
                    other, be co-existent in the character of an order, or of a genus, as in the
                    genus Corundum, “Tessular, rhombohedral, prismatic,” the meaning is, that an
                    individual belong ing to this genus must be either tessular, or rhombohedral, or
                    prismatic; because only one of these three can take place at the same time. In
                    the specific character this never happens, because all the forms must belong to
                    one system.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Determination of a Mineral in general.</hi></p><p>If a mineral is to be determined, first its <hi rend="italic">form</hi> must be
                    made out, at least so far as to know the system to which it belongs. Then <hi rend="italic">hardness</hi> and <hi rend="italic">specific gravity</hi> must be
                    ascertained, and expressed in numbers. It is sufficient, however, to know the
                    latter to one or two decimals. The specific character requires these data; and
                    they are also of use in the characters of the genera, orders, and classes. This
                    being done, the system maybe consulted, and this will at the same time point out
                    what other characters are wanting; so that a mere inspection of the mineral, or
                    a very easy experiment, for instance, to try the streak upon a file, or, still
                    better, upon a plate of biscuit porcelain, will be sufficient. Having advanced
                    in this manner to the character of the species, it will, in some instances, be
                    necessary, and in all cases advisable, for the sake of certainty, to have
                    recourse to the dimensions of the forms. This is particularly necessary, if the
                    genus to which the mineral belongs contains several species having forms of the
                    same system, as is the case in the genus Augite. This termination of the
                    dimensions of the forms may be effected by the common goniometer, the
                    differences in the angles being in general so great, that they cannot easily be
                    mistaken, even by the application of that instrument.</p><p>It will seldom be necessary to read over the whole of any character of a class,
                    order, genus, or species, excepting that which includes the individual; one
                    character that does not agree sufficing for exclusion. Thus even the characters
                    of the orders, though the longest, will not be found troublesome.</p><p>The application of the method will become very easy and expeditious, by taking
                    particular notice of some characters, which may be termed <hi rend="italic">prominent.</hi> Such are a metallic aspect; a high degree of specific gravity
                    (particularly if the mineral is not metallic), and a high decree of hardness.
                    The observation of these will immediately decide whether an individual can
                    belong to any particular class, order, genus, or species. It is understood, that
                    if it be not thereby excluded, the other characters must next be examined, till
                    either an excluding one be found, or, if not, the individual may be considered
                    as belonging to that class, order, &amp;c. with which it has been compared and
                    found to agree.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Example</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The following example may
                    serve as an illustration :—Let the form of an unknown mineral be a combination
                    of a scalene eight-sided pyramid, of an isosceles four-sided pyramid, and of a
                    rectangular four-sided prism; the cleavage parallel to the faces of two
                    rectangular foursided prisms, in a diagonal position to each other; form and
                    cleavage, therefore, <hi rend="italic">pyramidal,</hi> or belonging to the
                    pyramidal system. Let the <hi rend="italic">hardness</hi> be — 6.5; <hi rend="italic">specific gravity</hi></p><p>In this case, both hardness and specific gravity are prominent characters, and
                    exclude at once the individual from the first and third, but not from the second
                    class; with the characters of which its other properties also perfectly agree.
                    Hence the individual belongs to the second class.</p><p>Comparing the properties of the individual mineral with the characters of the
                    orders in the second class, hardness and specific gravity will be found too
                    great for the order Halo’ide; hardness too great for the orders Baryte and
                    Kerate; both of them too great for the orders Malachite and Mica; and specific
                    gravity too great for the orders Spar and Gem. But in the character of the order
                    Ore, both hardness and specific gravity fall between the fixed limits, and
                    cannot exclude the individual from this order. The other parts of this character
                    are now to be taken in consideration. If the lustre of the individual be
                    metallic, its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820977" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0977-0136"/> colour must be black, otherwise it cannot belong
                    to the order Ore. But the lustre is not metallic; therefore the colour of the
                    individual is of no consequence; that is, this condition part of the character
                    does not affect the individual, and consequently cannot determine its place.
                    Since the lustre is not metallic, the individual must exhibit adamantine, or
                    imperfect metallic lustre: the first will be found particularly in the fracture.
                    The next part of the character refers to minerals of a red, yellow, brown, or
                    black streak; and as the individual gives none of these, its streak being white,
                    this part of the character does not come into consideration. Hardness keeps
                    between the limits, as stated in the character of the order Ore. Should it be =
                    4.5 and less, the streak must be yellow, red, or black; but hardness is = 6.5,
                    therefore the colour of the streak is indifferent. If the hardness be = 6.5 and
                    more, and streak white, then the specific gravity must be =6.5 and more. Now,
                    this condition exists: hardness is = 6.5, and the streak is white; the specific
                    gravity being = 6∙9, which is greater than 6.5. Lastly, the specific gravity
                    keeps within the limits.</p><p>,As far as respects the individual which is to be determined, all the characters
                    in the characteristic of the order Ore may be divided into two parts. The first
                    part contains those which refer to the individual; the second those which do
                    not; the last afford no decisive distinctions. But with the first all the
                    properties of the mineral agree. These properties agree consequently with the
                    whole character of the order, as far as it is applicable to the individual, and
                    determine it to belong to the order Ore; or, in shorter terms, to be an <hi rend="italic">ore.</hi></p><p>Beginners may also compare the characters of the remaining orders. Sometimes they
                    find one individual belonging to two orders, in which case there must be
                    evidently a mistake in the comparison, which would perhaps not have been
                    discovered, had they stopt at the first order, which does not exclude it. In the
                    present case, the want of metallic lustre excludes the individual from the
                    orders Metal, Pyrites, and Glance; hardness from the order Blende; and both
                    hardness and specific gravity from the order Sulphur. The individual can,
                    therefore, be nothing else than an ore. The characters of the genera of the
                    order Ore may next be examined.</p><p>If we consider again hardness and specific gravity as prominent, the individual
                    will be immediately excluded from the genera Titanium-ore, Zine-ore, and
                    Copper-ore, but not from the genus Tin-ore. The form of the pyramidal system,
                    and the white streak, shew that it belongs to this genus. From the genus
                    Wolfram-ore, it is excluded by its too great hardness, and too low specific
                    gravity. From the genera Tantalum, Uranium, Cerium, Chrome, Iron, and
                    Manganese-ore, by hardness and specific gravity, both of them being too high; as
                    also by its white streak, which only agrees with that genus from which the
                    individual differs most by its hardness and specific gravity. The form also does
                    not agree with any in these genera, consequently the individual can belong to no
                    other than to the genus <hi rend="italic">tin-ore.</hi></p><p>This genus contains but one species. The conclusion that the individual must
                    belong to this species might, nevertheless, be erroneous. There could exist a
                    second species of this genus. The dimensions of the form must now be accurately
                    considered. If these coincide with the angles given in the character, the
                    highest degree of certainty that the individual belongs to or is pyramidal
                    tin-ore, will be obtained.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Perfect determination supposes all the Characters to be
                    known.</hi></p><p>The perfect determination of an individual depends, as the above example has
                    shewn, upon the possibility of making out correctly those three properties, viz.
                    form, including cleavage, hardness, and specific gravity. In botany it is the
                    same. The characters must be observable, otherwise the determination will be
                    impossible. In mineralogy, the method affords sometimes more; it leads to a
                    correct determination, even if the knowledge of the form remains imperfect. But
                    it will be an useful rule for beginners to occupy themselves at first with the
                    determination of such individuals as present properties which can be easily and
                    fully investigated. The rest will come of itself, when their knowledge of the
                    mineral kingdom, and particularly of the properties of minerals, increases, and
                    when they have by experience acquired the skill to judge properly of form and
                    cleavage, at least, so far as is necessary for the determination of the system
                    of crystallization, even in those cases where form and cleavage are somewhat
                    difficult to be observed. This exercise is recommended to every naturalist who
                    wishes to acquire a satisfactory knowledge of minerals, by means of the method
                    we have here explained.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Immediate and Mediate Determination.</hi></p><p>The method of determination, already illustrated by an example, is termed the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> determination, because it is applied directly to
                    the individual mineral which is to be determined, without the aid of one or
                    several other minerals. If, on the contrary, we must employ one or several other
                    minerals for this purpose, we determinate it <hi rend="italic">mediately.</hi>
                    That variety of hemiprismatic augite, which is known by the name <hi rend="italic">amianthus,</hi> occurs in crystals so very seldom, as to withdraw
                    their form, supposing it to be regular, from the sight, aided even by the most
                    powerful magnifying instruments; cleavage is evidently still less observable.
                    These crystals are flexible like fibres of flax, their hardness, therefore,
                    cannot be estimated. Their surface has so great an extent in respect to their
                    bulk, that they will swim in water, though endowed with a pretty considerable
                    specific gravity, which, therefore, cannot be ascertained. Some varieties,
                    however, may be observed, whose crystals are a little thicker, though in other
                    respects, these varieties perfectly agree with amianthus. These varieties lose
                    their flexibility, yet they are too frangible to be able to sustain the trial of
                    hardness. Others are still thicker, but the dimensions of their forms cannot be
                    ascertained on account of their minuteness. They sink in water, and scratch
                    prismatoidal gypsum, but they break, if tried upon calcareous spar. By thus
                    proceeding, we come to such varieties, as possessing a discernible form, allow
                    the cleavage to be investigated; we find their specific gravity about three
                    times that of the water, and their hardness between five and six. These will be
                    immediately determinable, and be found to belong to the species of hemiprismatic
                    augite. Chalk, rock-milk, clay-slate, and a great many other minerals not
                    allowing of an immediate determination, are determined in the same way, and thus
                    nothing escapes in the natural history method, which in any one of the other
                    methods can be an object of determination— <hi rend="italic">Vide Edinburgh

                    abundant and widely distributed with which we are acquainted. Calcareous spar,
                    one of its principal kinds, occurs in every rock from granite to the newest
                    member of the secondary series. It generally occurs in veins with numerous
                    metalliferous minerals, and assists in an eminent degree in characterizing the
                    vast host of mineral veins in primitive, transition, and secondary rocks. In the
                    state of granular, foliated, and compact limestones, also in the form of oolite,
                    chalk, and lucullite, it forms beds, hills, mountains, and even ranges of
                    mountains. The beautiful fibrous limestone or satin-spar, occurs in veins in
                    clay-slate, and in rocks of the coal formation, while all the beautiful forms of
                    calc-sinter are met with ornamenting the walls and floors of caverns in
                    limestone and other formations; calc-tuff abounds around cold, and also warm
                    springs, frequently incrusting organic bodies, forming the calcareous
                    incrustations so well known to mineralogists. Peastone is also a production of
                    warm springs. The white, porous, and nearly supernatent mineral agaric incrusts
                    rocky cliffs, particularly in limestone hills, and the rare variety, named
                    slate-spar, has hitherto been found only in primitive limestone.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Geographic Situation.</hi> —England and Scotland abound in
                    interesting varieties of calcareous-spar, and the mountains, hills, and valleys

                    marble, limestone, chalk, ιnarl, Lucullite, and oolite, while its calcareous
                    springs, and caves and caverns, exhibit numerous deposits of calc-tuff and of

                    Observation of the phenomena which now take place in nature, gives us the
                    characteristic effects of modern agencies or causes; comparison of these
                    phenomena with those produced in ancient geological periods, determines the
                    agreement or disagreement in their respective causes; the object of sound
                    geology is to combine the whole series of observed phenomena and inferred causes
                    or agencies into one general history of the successive conditions of our globe,
                    and the changes which have happened to it since the epoch when the present laws
                    of organic and inorganic nature were appointed. We cannot assume that these laws
                    have always been operating under the same circumstances as now, but we are
                    justified in admitting, as a basis of reasoning, that similar natural
                    circumstances in past and present times were consequences of similar preceding
                    agencies, and productive of similar subsequent effects. It is evident that, in
                    proportion to our knowledge of the characteristic effects of modern agencies,
                    separate and combined, will be the power of referring to their proximate causes
                    the phenomena of ancient nature; the more correct and complete this knowledge,
                    the more exact and extensive is the basis of geological theory. The influence of
                    a right view of existing nature is also sensible in directing the researches of
                    observers towards the most important and characteristic circumstances of the
                    phenomena which are to be explained.</p><p>The laws of nature are constant, but so adjusted to the material world that the
                    effects they produce are proportioned to quantity and kind of matter, situation
                    and direction of action, and other circumstances. A precise knowledge of the
                    effects, and a correct view of all the agencies concerned, will lead us to the
                    determination of the conditions under which the laws operated. In no other way
                    than this has any one of the problems of organic and inorganic Nature, as we now
                    behold her, been solved; no other process can possibly lead to real knowledge of
                    the prior conditions of the globe. Geology can only pretend to the rank of
                    science in proportion as it proceeds upon the principles of the Inductive
                    Philosophy, and is aided by the advance of collateral inquiries. The history of
                    a science is the description of its real progress; but if geology could have no
                    existence before the phenomena of chemistry, zoology, and mechanics were studied
                    in relation to laws of nature, its ancient history must be of small importance.
                    Bom in our own days,—based on modern observations,—interpreted by modem
                    philosophy,—why should we seek rational geology in the monstrous systems of
                    astronomy and cosmogony, which once satisfied Greece and Egypt? why attempt the
                    vain task of tracing the various errors of those writers of later days, who,
                    knowing nothing of chemical or vital laws, and little of mechanical science,
                    proposed hypotheses instead of collecting facts, and referred phenomena, which
                    they had not correctly observed, to forces which they had never truly
                    ascertained; resigned the beautiful monuments of ancient life, the fossil
                    remains of animals and plants, to a plastic force of Nature, and attributed the
                    regular and orderly structure of our planet to a general destruction and ruin of
                    an earlier sphere?</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">progress of geology.</hi></p><p>Exactly in proportion to the progress of collateral science is the dawning of
                    geological inquiry. The improvement of mechanical science effected by Galileo
                    and Newton opened, after a long interval, the minds of Mitchell and Saussure to
                    a perception of the effects of great convulsions in the crust of the globe; the
                    progress of chemical philo sophy awakened, amongst the mining schools of Sweden
                    and Saxony, these zealous efforts to develope the history of the mineral
                    constituents of the globe which led to the Wernerian system of Geognosy; but it
                    was reserved to modern days and more refined knowledge of natural history, to
                    establish sound general principles of investigation concerning organic remains,
                    and to unfold the successions of living nature, which constitute the basis of
                    the truths established by Smith and Cuvier.</p><p>The very essence of geology, then, is such, that its conclusions can only be
                    established in consequence of the general progress of the natural sciences; on
                    the other hand, it makes no step without consolidating and enlarging our
                    knowledge of existing nature; and thus it is inseparably united with the general
                    march of the human intellect, and supported by the sympathy of all those who
                    look with wonder and curiosity on the visible works of God.</p><p>Those who have taken a narrow view of this great and growing branch of human
                    knowledge, who have satisfied themselves with collecting a few fossil shells,
                    naming a few compound rocks, and constructing a few sections and maps, may
                    possibly be startled at the mighty circle of perpetual research in which they
                    are unconsciously engaged; yet as, in every branch of natural science, the
                    generalizations which are the object of inquiry can only be based on accurately
                    ascertained facts, every one who is really employed in investigating any of the
                    phenomena of nature, must be hailed as a useful coadjutor to geology. The time
                    is come when enough of general truth is known in geology to direct the labours
                    of observation into right and fertile channels; and those who are best
                    acquainted with the actual state of the science, and most sensible of its many
                    desiderata, will be most likely to devise the best means of supplying them. This
                    consideration should diminish the distrust which men of exact observation feel
                    for the researches of theorists. Theory and useful observation must proceed or
                    be retarded together; a man who is not taught how to observe, and instructed
                    what to observe, is just as likely to mislead by his descriptions of phenomena,
                    as a theorist who leaves the true path of inductive philosophy, substitutes
                    hypothesis for inference, and contends for the ideal speculation instead of
                    working out the true law of nature.</p><p><hi rend="italic">What is possible to be known.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> All

                    Doubtless there are geological problems which can never be solved, many
                    recondite laws which can never be disclosed by investigation of visible
                    phenomena; but yet the progress of the human mind, or rather the combination and
                    mutual irradiation of ascertained truths, continually removes farther and
                    farther the visible barrier of knowledge, and renders possible many problems

                    those dark and unapproachable regions are not wholly hidden from the astronomer;
                    some material properties of the central regions of our planet are already

                    ascertained, and their state of rest or motion, fluidity or solidity, made the
                    subject of probable inference.</p><p>Direct observation may fail to give us complete information concerning the many

                    because it is not certain that monuments remain of all the changes which have
                    occurred, and, if they do remain, it. is not probable, or possible, that we can

                    the globe is therefore not to be at« tempted, at least for a long time to come;
                    but, just as from the incomplete history of the human race, principles are
                    derived which shed a clearer light on the darkness of antiquity, determine the
                    epochs of its changes, and discover more certainly the true relative condition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">existing</hi> races of men,—so the general rules of
                    geology contribute continually to fill up the void spaces in its monumental
                    history, to determine the amount of physical changes performed in particular
                    geological periods, to ascertain the rate and progress of such changes, and thus
                    to characterize the present aspect of nature by reference to many previous
                    ascertained conditions of it.</p><p><hi rend="italic">General data.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The most important
                    of all the data for geological theory are derived from other and very distinct
                    branches of science. It is to astronomy and general physics that we are indebted
                    for the establishment of some leading principles which must ever be observed in
                    reasoning on the revolutions of the globe, and in fact form the only general
                    basis for such reasoning. The singular prejudices which yet prevail, among good
                    observers in geology, as to the real objects and aims of the science, apply even
                    to the facts furnished by astronomy for the guidance of geology; and sure
                    consequences legitimately drawn from considerations of the figure and density of
                    our planet are often confounded, by what are called practical men, with mere
                    speculation; and they imagine they give proof of exceeding wisdom when they
                    reject <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse</hi> the independent
                    conclusions of higher science, and the local and limited inferences from
                    undoubted facts, as if these partial truths were mere hypotheses. Nothing is
                    more common than to hear persons who have never qualified themselves to judge of
                    the question, complaining of the prevailing tendency of geologists to indulge in
                    theories; as if that most enormous and yet unattempted labour,—the construction
                    of a general theory of the earth, was a mere morning’s amusement; as if the
                    combination of individual facts into limited generalizations, and the attempt at
                    eliciting laws of phenomena, which in every other branch of natural science is
                    hailed as the first proof of real progress made, should in geology alone be
                    condemned as dangerous and delusive; as if the search after general truths,
                    which in every other science is known to be the real object, aim, and end of the
                    inquiry, should be in geology alone the thing of all others to be
                    deprecated.</p><p>On the other hand, it seems no less necessary to offer a short caution to those
                    who, seeing-the great accession of local truths and partial laws of phenomena
                    which has of late so rapidly been added to geology, are anxious to anticipate
                    time, and think it more useful to construct a perishable hypothesis than to add
                    to the durable foundation of theory.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Figure of the Earth</hi> —The figure of the earth is known by
                    direct measurement of arcs, and by experiments with the pendulum, to be a
                    spheroid with its polar diameter about - <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> shorter than the equatorial; the former being 7899,170
                    miles, the latter 7925,648 miles; the difference, commonly called <hi rend="italic">the compression,</hi> 26,478 (Herschel— <hi rend="italic">Astronomy).</hi> This peculiar figure is a consequence of the centrifugal force
                    of the superficial parts of the globe removed from the poles; for this
                    diminishes the influence of gravitation, and permits the equatorial parts, where
                    the velocity of rotation is greatest, to recede further from the axis than any
                    other parts, till the equilibrium is obtained, and the curves over all parts of
                    the globe correspond to a <hi rend="italic">spheroid of revolution.</hi> The
                    earth, then, has acquired its present figure under the joint influence of
                    gravitation to its present centre, and rotation on its present axis; but if the
                    mass of the globe were solid, this exact accommodation of dimensions could not
                    take place; we must therefore add a third condition, viz. that, in some way or
                    other, its parts must be yielding and displaceable, fluid or loose. If the globe
                    was formerly, or is now fluid within, wholly or in great measure, the spheroidal
                    figure is a direct and necessary consequence, and this is the view generally
                    adopted; but it has been imagined that even a solid globe whose superficial
                    parts were displaceable, might, in the eternal round of natural changes, be worn
                    down by rains and waves from a perfect sphere to a spheroid of revolution.
                    According to this supposition the former state of the globe was very different
                    from the present; the rotating sphere must have become very elevated land at the
                    poles, and totally drowned in water along an equatorial band; into this
                    equatorial sea, from the north and the south, must have been poured the waste of
                    the high polar lands so as to form strata thickest under the equator; the poles
                    should still be land :—but nothing of the kind appears. On the contrary, the
                    distribution of land and water is excessively irregular, the surfaces of
                    stratified rocks have no peculiar relation to the equator, the poles are in the
                    midst of water, and the equatorial regions include some of the highest mountains
                    on the globe. This hypothesis is therefore entirely gratuitous, and we must look
                    to the interior of the earth for the displacement of substance which allowed it
                    to assume a spheroidal figure.</p><p>Here little difficulty presents itself; it cannot be doubted that, if the
                    interior of the globe were fluid, a spheroidal external figure must necessarily
                    result from rotation on an axis, and the internal surfaces of equal density be
                    also spheroidal; and both these conditions be retained whether it continued
                    fluid or not; if it continued wholly fluid, the figure might continually adapt
                    itself to any change of form corresponding to a variation of the ratio of
                    central and tangential forces; if it became wholly solid, the rocks would upon
                    such change of ratio be put in a state of strain; if internally fluid and
                    externally solid, the crust might upon such change yield in various directions,
                    and produce local irregularity in the distribution of land and water: finally,
                    if the solidification of the surface were to proceed at a certain rate, compared
                    with that of the change of ratio of the forces governing the figure, the form
                    once acquired jnight be almost invariably preserved.</p><p>Of all the conditions stated above,•'which corresponds best to what is known
                    concerning the earth? That its internal surfaces of equal density, are situated
                    symmetrically with respect to the external spheroid is supposed to be true, in
                    consequence of investigations concerning certain irregularities of the moon’s
                    motions, which depend on the figure and density of the earth. This would prove
                    that the earth has been freely yielding within; the irregularities of the
                    pendulum experiments appear sufficient to justify a belief that the
                    solidification of the surface has gone to some considerable depth; the irregular
                    distribution of the land and water appears to indicate the co-existence of a
                    solid crust and yielding interior, accompanied by a change of form. This
                    irregularity of land and water is the effect of great convulsions of the crust
                    of the globe belonging to many geological periods, some of them subsequent to
                    the existence of the present races of animals and plants. It is therefore very
                    probable that the interior of the globe has formerly been wholly fluid; and we
                    are not entitled hastily to reject the supposition that it is partially so at
                    this moment.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Density of the Earth</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Taking water

                    by weighing the most prevalent rocks, to be about 2∙5.</p><p>By direct experiments, and comparison of the local attraction of mountains and
                    insulated masses of matter with the general attraction of the globe, the mean
                    density of our planet has been inferred to be about five times that of water.
                    This result is found sufficiently in accordance with astronomical considerations
                    to allow us to adopt it for geological reasoning.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193821484" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1484-0175"/><p>The interior parts of the globe must therefore be heavier than the exterior
                    rocks.</p><p>From the influence of the earth on the moon’s motions, it is inferred that the
                    internal mass of our planet augments in density towards the centre; the surfaces
                    of equal density being symmetrical with the external spheroidal surface. The
                    materials of the earth have therefore collected round the centre in obedience to
                    the laws of gravitation and rotatory movement, and the internal substances, as
                    having fallen to the lower place when freedom of motion was allowed, would
                    probably be heavier under the same circumstances than the superficial
                    substances. In their present situation, their weight is augmented by the effects
                    of the general pressure towards the centre; if the laws of compression observed
                    among metals, stone, fluids, and gases, at the surface of the earth, obtained in
                    the inner parts of the earth, without some counteracting cause, steel would be
                    compressed into one-fourth, and stone into one-eighth of its bulk at the centre.
                    Water, according to Leslie, would be as heavy as quicksilver at 362 miles depth,
                    and air as heavy as water at thirty-four miles. (Somerville— <hi rend="italic">Connexion of Physical Science?)</hi> Now, though we cannot presume that the law
                    of compression would hold in these bodies to such an extent, enough is known to
                    justify a confident belief that the mean density of our planet would be very
                    much greater than it is, were not the tendency to enormous condensation in the
                    central masses counteracted by some powerful agent of expansion, such as heat,
                    or neutralized by some peculiar and unknown constitution of the substances
                    themselves.</p><p>TEMPERATURE OF THE GLOBE.</p><p>It becomes, therefore, necessary to inquire into the subject of the earth’s
                    temperature. The superficial heat of the earth’s surface is subject to several
                    known, and probably to other unknown, influences; of the known causes of
                    variation, the following are the most worthy of the notice of geologists :—</p><p>1st, The influence of the sun.</p><p>2d, The influence of the distribution of land and water, and the nature of the
                    surface.</p><p>3d, Elevation above the mean level of the sea.</p><p>4th, The temperature of the circumambient space.</p><p>5th, The temperature of the interior of the globe.</p><p>1. The solar rays are the principal source of heat on the surface of the globe;
                    the temperatures vary in relation to the amount of those rays; the mean
                    temperatures consequently decrease continually from the equator toward the
                    poles, nearly in the simple proportion of the cosines of latitude. (Mayer’s
                    formula of the square of the cosine appears very inaccurate both at the equator
                    and toward the poles.) At every point of the earth’s surface the temperature
                    changes with the period of the year, nearly in proportion to the variation of
                    altitude and duration of solar irradiation: it changes also with day and night.
                    No proposition is more certain than the fundamental dependence of the
                    temperature of the surface of the globe on the solar influence.</p><p>It is, therefore, very important for geologists to inquire whether this be
                    variable or constant; whether the amount of solar heat communicated to the earth
                    is and has always been the same in every annual period, or what latitude the
                    laws of the planetary movements permit in this respect.</p><p>Sir John Herschel has examined this question in a satisfactory manner, in a paper
                    read to the. Geological Society of London. The total amount of solar radiation
                    which determines the general climate of the earth, the year being of invariable
                    length, is inversely proportional to the minor axis of the ellipse described by
                    the earth about the sun, regarded as slowly variable; the major axis remaining
                    constant, and the orbit being actually in a state of approach to a circle, and
                    consequently the minor axis being on the in crease, it follows that the mean
                    annual amount of solar radiation received by the whole earth must be actually on
                    the decrease. The limits of the variation in the eccentricity of the earth’s
                    orbit are not known; it is therefore impossible to say accurately what may have
                    been, in former periods of time, the amount of solar radiation; it is, however,
                    certain, that, if the ellipticity has ever been so great as that of the orbit of
                    Mercury or Pallas, the temperature of the earth must have been sensibly higher
                    than it is at present. But the difference of a few degrees of temperature thus
                    occasioned, is of too small an order to be employed in explaining the growth of
                    tropical plants and corals in the polar and te∏}perate zones, and other great
                    phenomena of geology.</p><p>2. Nature of the Surface.—The heating effect of the sun’s rays varies with the
                    nature of the suríàce on which they fall: the colour, texture, capacity for
                    heat, and other circumstances affecting the absorbent and reflective powers of
                    the substances, influence, accordingly, the amount of heat absorbed and
                    retained. The reflective surfaces of snow which cover so large a portion of the
                    polar land, while they refuse admission to the solar heat, and contribute to
                    warm the upper air, prevent also the dissipation of terrestrial warmth. Sandy
                    and rocky tracts reverberate heat into the air; grassy plains and cultivated
                    fields freely absorb heat by day, and freely radiate it by night.</p><p>Though these circumstances are little sensible in registers of annual, monthly,
                    or diurnal temperature, they affect very seriously the growth of plants and
                    animals, and constitute a very important character of local climate which ought
                    to be more attended to. The large forests of equatorial regions maintain, in
                    their ample shade, a permanent coolness, favourable to vegetation; in the
                    temperate climates of Europe, their destruction has perhaps mitigated the
                    periodical severity of cold. But the most important of this class of phenomena
                    is derived from the unequal distribution of land and water upon the globe. The
                    climate of the ocean is very different from that of the land, less extreme in
                    its variations with season, and limited within narrow ranges over the whole
                    watery surface. This is, in a great degree, owing to the movement of the
                    particles of water upwards and downwards, according to the variation of
                    temperature at the surface, and the movement of the tidal and other great
                    oceanic currents. Thus the fluctuations of heat are not merely confined to the
                    surface, but diffused through great depths and breadths of water, and the
                    climates of remotest regions mixed and mutually mitigated by the beneficent
                    movements of the sea.</p><p>On the land a similar, but less regular and continuous, influence is performed by
                    the winds, which, by appointed laws, change and fluctuate in their paths, and
                    cause <hi rend="italic">alternation</hi> rather than <hi rend="italic">gradation
                    of</hi> climate, a variablè succession of different and often extreme
                    temperatures; so that the range of variation of heat is greater at any one point
                    on the land than in the sea, and the difference of temperature in different
                    latitudes is greater.</p><p>The warmest band of the ocean is that running up the Atlantic; the coldest points
                    of the globe are in the northern part of the land of Asia and America. If,
                    instead of so much land round a polar basin, we had broad equatorial continents
                    and small polar isles, the temperature of the globe would have been more uniform
                    than at present; the excessive cold of the polar circles would be reduced; some
                    slight general augmentation of heat in the polar sea might be experienced, but
                    not so great an addition of heat as to account for the phenomena of the growth
                    of coral in the sea, and tree ferns on the islands.</p><p>The distribution of land and water is a variable element of importance in the
                    question of the former temperature of the surface of the globe, but its
                    variations must not be imagined equal to cause a change of more than a few
                    degrees.</p><p>3. Elevation above the mean level of the sea, is another <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821497" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1497-0176"/> important
                    circumstance affecting local climate, and the ge- ’ neral amount of heat on the
                    earth and in the air about it.</p><p>The atmosphere surrounding the earth is not heated by the sun’s rays passing
                    through it; it freely transmits them. Clouds, and particles of all kinds in it,
                    must arrest some heat as it radiates from the sun or from the earth, but the
                    main supply is derived from the earth by conduction. Near the earth, the
                    temperature of the air seldom differs from that of the surface, whether that be
                    land or sea; and in all the higher regions, amidst the complications of aerial
                    currents which rather alternate than mingle, we find the temperatures decrease
                    as the density of the air diminishes, so that, at moderate heights, a diminution
                    of 1° Fahrenheit corresponds to about 323 feet elevation. (Forbes.)</p><p>This settled law of atmospheric heat reacts on the elevated land, and causes a
                    reduction of the mean temperature of the higher stations, exactly of the same
                    nature, and as regularly calculable, as that depending on latitude.</p><p>4. Temperature of the Planetary System—The temperature of the space surrounding
                    the earth cannot be hotter than the coldest point on the surface of the globe:
                    for, since the globe is continually receiving heat from the sun, and radiating
                    it into space, the cooling process can only proceed so far as to reduce the
                    surface temperature to an equilibrium with that of surrounding space.</p><p>The lowest temperature on the globe (Melville Island) being taken at 50° cent,
                    below zero, we may be sure that the ethereal spaces have not a higher
                    temperature. In fact, Fourier and Swanberg agree in adopting this as the real
                    temperature of the planetary spaces. The opinion, daily gaining strength, of the
                    universal diffusion of an elastic ether, renders probable the conclusion that
                    the immense regions in which the planets move have a definite temperature; if
                    the ether vary in density about different centres or systems, which is at least
                    not improbable, the statical temperatures may vary also with situation; but, as
                    far as we have yet learned of the solar system, there is no reason to imagine
                    the temperature is sensibly variable with time; not even if the planets are
                    continually losing heat.</p><p>5. Temperature of the Interior of the Globe—Hitherto we have considered the globe
                    as merely a recipient of heat from the sun, measured in quantity, and
                    distributed in a particular manner. This heat is again partly dissipated into
                    the atmosphere and ethereal spaces, so that there is no superficia! accumulation
                    of heat derived from the sun: the climates on the earth appear to be constant,
                    except by the interference of some of the variable circumstances previously
                    adverted to.</p><p>But we must not bind our views to the surface; the state of the interior of our
                    planet, in relation to the intensity, constancy, and circulation of the heat
                    there, is of the greatest possible importance.</p><p>There can scarcely be found a more striking example of the beneficial influence
                    of geology on collateral science, than the impulse it has created toward the
                    cultivation of the curious and delicate inquiry into the theory of internal
                    terrestrial temperature, both among mathematicians and experimentalists. What a
                    contrast is offered by the wild speculations of Burnet and others, concerning
                    the constitution of the interior of the globe, and the profound conclusions of
                    Fourier, which every succeeding experiment appears to render more certain.</p><p>But for a geological necessity, so to speak, the beautiful mathematical
                    researches of Fourier and the experiments of Humboldt, Cordier, and others,
                    would never have been made; and even philosophers might have been content, with
                    the uninstructed vulgar, to have no thoughts on the matter of the earth’s proper
                    heat. There is a singular prejudice on this subject, which is worth notice, as
                    an example of the difficulties often attending the promulgation of novel truths.
                    Some persons are startled at the very idea of the interior of the earth being
                    hot; as if it were some monstrous and insufferable doctrine; as if it were
                    something utterly unreasonable that the centre of a planet should be asserted to
                    have a temperature very different from that of its surface. Much of the
                    declamation against central heat, as it is incorrectly termed, has no better
                    foundation. But how is it to be known whether the exterior of the earth may be
                    very hot or very cold, or synthermal with the surface, except by mathematical
                    and experimental investigation, especially directed to the question? The problem
                    certainly is difficult, but not impossible, and it is fraught with the highest
                    interest.</p><p>It has been proved by Fourier’s mathematical investigations on the theory of
                    heat, that the temperature of the surface of our planet being, as we know it to
                    be, wholly dependent on the solar radiation, the interior of the mass may have
                    any temperature whatever, any extreme of heat or cold, without producing any
                    sensible effect on the surface.</p><p>The reason of this is very simple; the conduction of heat, by the substances near
                    the surface of the earth, is so exceedingly slow, that ages might pass before
                    there could be any sensible warmth communicated from even intensely hot masses
                    placed at a moderate depth.</p><p>It appears from the mathematical theory, and it is fully established by
                    experiment, that the fluctuations of the solar heat are experienced only to a
                    certain depth, below which the temperature of any one point is invariable; this
                    depth is not every where the same, but, as far as yet appears, nowhere exceeds
                    100 feet. The temperature at this depth is constant, and generally corresponds,
                    at least nearly, to the mean annual temperature of the surface. The temperatures
                    below this depth can only be known by experiment. Before stating the results of
                    these, it may be useful to advert to the simple reasoning which must be employed
                    in drawing conclusions from them. If it be found that the temperatures below the
                    zone of fluctuating heat continually diminish, it is evident that the interior
                    parts of the earth are colder than the surface, and that there is no reason to
                    imagine the earth to have any other source of heat than solar radiation; but if
                    the contrary be found true, the earth has a proper temperature, derived from
                    internal sources. If the augmentation be merely a <hi rend="italic">local</hi>
                    phenomenon, <hi rend="italic">local</hi> chemical action may perhaps explain it,
                    but if it be a <hi rend="italic">general</hi> fact, we must appeal to a
                    corresponding general cause.</p><p>Experiments on the temperature of the interior of the globe require great
                    attention, and must be interpreted with caution. In mines, collieries, &amp;c.,
                    the influence of lights, respiration, &amp;c., is considerable; in these, and
                    almost all situations, chemical processes go on which must be considered; there
                    are local sources of heat to be allowed for, as mineral waters, the augmented
                    density of air, &amp;c. Into the examination of these points it is not necessary
                    to enter further. The reader must suppose that they have been attended to by Μ.

                    inferences. The following examples include single and continued observations in
                    different situations and under varied circumstances.</p><p>1. Single experiment in the deepest colliery in Great Britain at Monkwearmouth,
                    near Sunderland, soon after the sinking of the shaft (Phil. Mag. 1834). Depth of
                    the pit to the place of observation, 528 yards; depth below the level of the
                    sea, 500 yards; mean annual temperature, 47.6. Observed temperature of air at
                    surface on the day of experiment ( 15th November 1834), 49° —of air at the
                    bottom of the pit, 62° —near the forehead (or end of the drift), 64° —close to
                    the coal, 68°. Temperature of water collected in the pit bottom, 67° —of salt
                    water issuing from a bore hole made on the same morning, 70.1—of similar water
                    as it first gushed out, 71.4—of gas bubbles issuing through the water, 72°.6.

                    depended on as those from mines: it is remarkable that the two classes of
                    results coincide, for Monsieur Cordier’s previous conclusion from the latter
                    phenomena is, that the temperature augments one degree of Fahrenheit.in
                    forty-five feet English. The ratio is, however, certainly not uniform at
                    different places, as might be anticipated from the unequal conducting power of
                    the rocks.</p><p>It appears, then, fully ascertained, that, in situations far removed from
                    volcanic action, in different kinds of rocks with very different chemical
                    relations, water, air, and rocks continually grow warmer as wö descend in the
                    earth. <hi rend="italic">Without a single exception,</hi> the interior of the
                    globe is warmer than the surface, and the heat augments constantly with the
                    depth. Combining this result with the mathematical inferences of Fourier, and
                    the generalizations concerning the state of the central parts of the globe, we
                    shall find that it is not without reason the distinguished mathematician above
                    named has favoured the hypothesis that the earth is a cooled globe, very hot
                    within, and still cooling slowly; so slowly, indeed, that the effects of the
                    contraction due to this refrigeration have not been perceived by astronomers in
                    the alteration of the length of the day, which must inevitably have occurred if
                    the diameter of the globe had sensibly diminished. For all short periods of
                    time, that is, for a thousand or two thousand years, the globe may now be
                    supposed to be in a statical condition, both as to interior and superficial
                    heat, magnitude, and figure.</p><p>The hypothesis of a cooling globe, thus brought fairly under our notice, can only
                    be changed into theory by its accordance with geological phenomena of very
                    ancient date, which can in no other way be so well explained.</p><p>DEPTH OF THE OCEAN.</p><p>A knowledge of the probable depth of the ocean is of importance in limiting the
                    range of some speculations in geology. In questions concerning the relative
                    areas of land and water, and the change of level of land and sea, it is
                    desirable to have some notion of the quantity of water on the globe. Its area we
                    know, but its mean depth is uncertain. Laplace and the astronomers appear to be
                    satisfied with believing that the depths of the sea balance the elevations of
                    the land; so that the extreme depths may not be very great, and the mean depth
                    only a small number of miles. If we were to suppose the depths of the sea
                    proportioned to the heights of the land, in the ratio of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821523" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1523-0178"/> respective
                    areas, and similar inequalities of level to prevail, the greatest depths might
                    be taken at about fifteen miles, and the mean depth would not exceed from one to
                    five miles, according to the supposed form of the oceanic bed.</p><p>From the investigations of Mr Whewell on the velocity of the tide-wave (Phil.
                    Trans.), some exact knowledge on this subject is already gathering for geology.
                    According to the supposition of Lagrange, this velocity is a function of the
                    depth of the channel, without regard to other conditions; the velocity is in
                    fact that which a heavy body would acquire by falling through half the depth.
                    According to this view, the depth of the sea on the east coast of England is 120
                    feet, on that of Scotland 360 feet, of the Atlantic coast of Ireland 2600 feet,
                    of the Atlantic (in its middle part) 50,000 feet, or above nine miles. These
                    depths, judging from the soundings on the east coast of England, are good
                    approximations; and inspection of Mr WhewelΓs maps of the cotidal lines seems to
                    forbid our imagining the sea to be any where for great breadths very much deeper
                    than the Atlantic.</p><p>On this subject Mrs Somerville observes,—“The sea has little influence on the
                    variation of the length of the arcs of the pendulum or on gravitation, neither
                    does it much affect the lunar inequalities. The mean depth of the ocean is very
                    small. There may be profound cavities in the bottom of the sea, but its mean
                    depth probably does not much exceed the mean height of the continents and
                    islands above its level.”— <hi rend="italic">(Connexion of Phys.
                    Science.)</hi></p><p>' EXTENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE.</p><p>The quantity of gaseous matter floating above the earth is known by direct
                    weighing with the barometer; analysis resolves this airy ocean into its
                    constituent elements, and shews us the proportions of oxygen and nitrogen,
                    which, with carbonic acid, aqueous vapour, arid other variable admixtures, make
                    up the whole mass. Is the quantity of the atmosphere constant? its composition
                    invariable? or what are the sources and limits of variation? In the present
                    state of meteorology these questions admit of no satisfactory answer. It is true
                    that, within the short period of barometric measurement, no phenomena have given
                    reason to suppose any alteration of atmospheric pressure, and that, in every
                    case of well conducted analysis, the atmosphere has every where and always been
                    found similarly constituted. But when we know by how many operations the air is
                    decomposed, fixed, and released in chemical and vital combinations, how much
                    gaseous matter is daily poured from the earth into the air, it is clearly beyond
                    our power to affirm that the quantity and quality of the air may not be now
                    undergoing a slow and determinate change. If study of the planetary bodies of
                    our system appears to shew that atmospheres are not necessary accompaniments of
                    such bodies, how can we feel confident that our own atmosphere must ever retain
                    one peculiar quality and quantity? It is evidently possible that the sources of
                    variation which are daily in action may not exactly reciprocate their influence,
                    or if they do now (which no one can affirm), who shall prove to us that they
                    have always done so? or rather, who that considers the composition of the most
                    abundant rocks in the crust of the globe, and remarks the immense quantity of
                    oxygen contained in them all, even to the half of their weight, can avoid
                    imagining the liberation of that gas, and a corresponding enlargement and
                    chemical change of the atmosphere? We cannot, however, philosophically assume
                    that the atmosphere is changeable in quantity or quality, except in virtue of
                    well founded inferences from phenomena pointing specially to such a supposition.
                    A case supposed to be of this description will hereafter come under
                    discussion.</p><p>If the dimensions of the earth or the mean temperature of its surface have been
                    changed, the quantity and quality of the atmosphere might remain the same, and
                    yet its vital effects would be greatly altered.</p><p>GEOLOGICAL DATA.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Materials of the Globe.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The solid

                    be compound, and are, therefore, provisionally ranked as elementary sorts of
                    matter. Of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821536" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1536-0179"/> these, five, when they Occur in a separate state
                    (in the ordinary temperature and pressure), are in, the state of gas, viz.
                    hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen or azote, chlorine, fluorine. Five are volatile
                    non-metallic bodies, viz. bromine (fluid), iodine, sulphur, phosphorus,
                    selenium. Two are fixed (or incapable of being volatized) non-metallic bodies,
                    viz. carbon, boron. The remaining substances are metallic or metal- 1oidal.
                    Seven of them are earthy metals or metalloids, which, by combination with
                    oxygen, yield the earths, viz. silicium, aluminum, magnesium, yttrium, glucinum,
                    zirconium, thorium. Six are alkaline metals, yielding alkalies with oxygen, viz.
                    potassium, sodium, lithium, calcium, barium, strontium. Fifteen arc metals which
                    retain oxygen at high temperatures, viz. lead, tellurium, copper, bismuth,
                    titanium, cobalt, cerium, uranium, antimony, columbium, tungsten, chromium,
                    vanadium, molybdenum, arsenic. Nine are metals which part with oxygen at high
                    temperatures, viz. mercury, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium,
                    osmium, nickel. Five absorb and retain oxygen at high temperatures, and
                    decompose water at a red heat, viz. tin, iron, zinc, cadmium, manganese.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Most abundant substances</hi> —The most abundant (and on that

                    many are exceedingly rare, and others occur only in particular situations, so
                    that the principal rocks of the globe are formed of only a small number of
                    mineral substances. The geologist is not absolutely required, except for
                    particular trains of reasoning, to be an accomplished mineralogist; but it seems
                    unwise to countenance the neglect of mineralogy, which appears to have become
                    not unusual among those who have been foremost to cultivate the zoological
                    principles of geology. We must not grant to the lovers of organic remains that a

                    truth be said that the arrangement of materials in the crust of the globe has
                    ever been entirely unknown, because the operations of mining, however ignorantly
                    begun and conducted, must infallibly have led to correct, though very limited,
                    information concerning it. No considerable mining region in the civilized world
                    has ever been visited by geologists where the structure of the metalliferous
                    mountains has not long been partially known. What geologist has been able to add
                    to the knowledge of this kind possessed by the old miners of Aldstone Moor? In
                    what coal district have the workmen been found wholly ignorant of the succession
                    of the sandstones, shales, and coal i∙n which their operations are
                    conducted?</p><p>The great step made by modern geology has been, to unite this scattered
                    information into general truths; and it appears unnecessary to go farther back
                    than to Werner for the proposal of correct views on this subject in Germany; to
                    Saussure in Switzerland; and Smith in England.</p><p>In the latter country, it is true that Mitchell had made some correct researches,
                    more general than could be expected at the period, and Whitehurst shewed himself
                    possessed of enlarged views; but it is undoubtedly to Werner and Smith that the
                    modern system of geology, founded on correct observations of the arrangement of
                    rocks, owes its rapid advances.</p><p>The essential principles admitted by both these eminent men are very simple; they
                    affirm that the materials in the crust of the globe are generally stratified,
                    and that the strata succeed one another in a particular order or series. This is
                    nothing more than asserting generally what is in very many instances found to be
                    true locally by the experience of miners, colliers, well-sinkers, quarrymen, and
                    others.</p><p>For the purpose of shewing more clearly the state of knowledge on this
                    fundamental point, we shall suppose five independent observers engaged in
                    inquiring into it, with all the aids of local knowledge furnished by mines,
                    collieries, and other excavations made by men, and abundance of cliffs, ravines,
                    and mountain slopes where nature displays her works. One of them may be situated
                    in the vicinity of London, another in Oxfordshire, another in Yorkshire, a
                    fourth in the region of the English lakes; a fifth in the Highlands of
                    Scotland.</p><p>Neglecting the variable and irregular covering of soil, gravel, sediment from
                    rivers, &amp;c.; the deep wells, and other excavations in the neighbourhood of
                    London, will prove to the first observer that similar materials lie below the
                    surface for a considerable breadth of country, that they are stratified or
                    collected into masses which have a very great horizontal extension, and small
                    comparative thickness; that, taken on a great scale, the series of beds is
                    reducible to three leading terms, thus :— <hi rend="subscript"> ι f</hi></p><p>Great clay of London and the vicinity at the top.</p><p>Series of sands and clays of different kinds in the middle.</p><p>Chalk at the bottom.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193821549" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1549-0180"/><p>The Oxfordshire observer in the same manner finds that the rocks of the county
                    are all stratified, or widely extended in nearly horizontal masses, and laid one
                    upon another, so that the following is a general type of the series, including
                    some parts of Warwickshire:</p><p>Chalk at the top. Clay and sands. Oolitic limestones, clays, and sands. Blue
                    clays, blue limestones, &amp;c.</p><p>Red clays, and red sandstones at the bottom.</p><p>The Yorkshire observer finds the rocks stratified, of definite thickness, and
                    lying in the following order:</p><p>Chalk at the top.</p><p>Clays.</p><p>Oolitic limestones, &amp;c. Blue clays and limestones. Red clays and red
                    sandstones. Magnesian limestone.</p><p>Coal with sandstones and shales. Limestone, &amp;c.</p><p>Argillaceous slate rocks at the bottom.</p><p>In the district of the lakes, the stratification of some rocks is certain, of
                    others obscure, and some are not stratified. The series of the stratified rocks,
                    ascertained with great difficulty, is thus recorded:</p><p>Red clay and sandstone. Slate rocks.</p><p>Coal, &amp;c. Red argillaceous rocks.</p><p>Limestone, &amp;c. Slate-rocks.</p><p>Slate-rocks. Gneiss and mica schist.</p><p>Limestone.</p><p>Below all these is granite, which does not appear to be stratified.</p><p>Finally, the observer in the Highlands finds it often difficult to say whether
                    the rocks are wholly, partially, or not at all stratified. After infinite
                    labour, he decides that some are, and others not The series of predominant
                    stratified rocks is,</p><p>Red conglomerate and sandstone, Argillaceous slate.</p><p>Chlorite schist, &amp;c. Mica schist, &amp;c. Gneiss, &amp;c.</p><p>And under these is granite, which nowhere appears to be really stratified.</p><p>Thus we have two classes of rocks, stratified and unstratified, which will
                    require distinct examination.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Stratified Rocks</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In each of the
                    localities specified, the series of strata is found to be constant, not that
                    every, particular stratum is everywhere observed; but the <hi rend="italic">order in which they succeed one another when present together</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">is never reversed.</hi> This
                    is consistent with all experience.</p><p>It is found by actual observation, that the chalk, which is the lowest mass of
                    strata noticed in the vicinity of London, is continuous with, and forms a part
                    of, that chalk which is at the top of the Oxfordshire series. It is also found
                    that this same chalk is actually traceable, with little interruption, in a very
                    clear and satisfactory manner, from Oxfordshire into Yorkshire, where also it
                    forms the top of the section; that the oolitic rocks, the blue clays and
                    limestones, the red clays and red sandstones are in the same way continued from
                    Oxfordshire to Yorkshire. The same stratified rocks then occur in very distant
                    situations in the same order of succession, having certain rocks above them. If,
                    now, we compare the Yorkshire and Cumbrian, and afterwards the Cumbrian and
                    Scottish series of rocks, we shall find several common terms in similar parts of
                    the series, and thus be able to unite all the five sets of observations into one
                    general view.</p><p>The continuity of the strata near the surface of the earth, and the constancy of
                    their order of succession being thus shewn to be capable of exact proof, we may
                    suppose • not five but many thousand points and lines in the surface of the
                    British islands to have undergone a scrupulous examination, with a view first to
                    test the laws, and afterwards to exemplify their application. In consequence,
                    they are unequivocally established, and the following is a general arrangement
                    of the groups of strata, discovered in the British islands, proceeding from the
                    surface downwards. It is supposed that all the alluvial and detrital covering of
                    the surface is removed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Table of British Stratified Rocks.</hi></p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Names of Formations or Groups of Strata.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Thickness in yards.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Subdivisions adopted</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Remarks.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell cols="2" role="data" rows="1"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tertiary Strata.</hi></p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Crag,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p><hi rend="superscript"> 16</hi> "i</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Upper or red crag, Lower or coralline 7 crag, . .

                    necessary to explain. The whole mass of known stratified rocks is conceived to
                    be divided into three great portions, called Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary,
                    from the respective eras of their production: the lowest being the oldest or
                    earliest, the uppermost being the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821575" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1575-0182"/> newest or
                    latest. These great portions are again subdivided into systems or assemblages,
                    named from the most characteristic kinds of rock in each; cretaceous from chalk,
                    oolitic from oolite, carboniferous from coal, &amp;c. or else from locality, as
                    Silurian system. The systems are composed of formations, or groups of stratified
                    rocks, proved to have many characters in common, so as to indicate many
                    analogies of origin; thus the chalk formation is obviously of one general type,
                    the green sand formation contains repetitions of green and irony sands and
                    clays, the oolitic formation is a series of oolite, sandstone, and clay in many
                    repetitions; and so of the others.</p><p>The subdivisions of formations are not established upon similar principles in all
                    cases; the general character of them ought to be to include each one stratified
                    rock, as the coralline oolite, or one series of alternations of particular
                    strata, as purbeck beds, has limestones, variegated marls, &amp;c.</p><p>Upon this principle all the formations of the carboniferous and other lower
                    systems should be more subdivided; but this must be left to time, and not rashly
                    attempted without sufficient data.</p><p>Each of the stratified rocks or series of alternations thus constituting
                    subdivisions of formations contains one or many strata, layers, or beds; the
                    Bath oolite, the magnesian limestone, &amp;c. are formed of many strata or beds;
                    and so of the others. Nor is this the last term of the analysis; for many
                    strata, as sandstones especially, are composed of parallel laminae, which are
                    often separable, and bear the same relation to the stratum that this bears to a
                    stratified rock.</p><p>SCALE OF STRATA IN OTHER COUNTRIES.</p><p>The series of strata classed in the preceding table is always recognisable,
                    wholly or partially, in every part of the British islands; that is to say, the
                    stratified rocks occurring in any situation can be referred to their respective
                    types in the general table. But the local variations are considerable; several
                    of the stratified rocks are only of limited extent; even whole formations, as
                    the oolitic formation, change their characters, or, as the millstone grit, are
                    entirely extinct in particular regions where the groups above and below them are
                    complete.</p><p>This being the case, it is evident that such subdivisions are too minute and
                    variable to be employed in comparisons between British and foreign series of
                    strata. We must be satisfied with comparing formations and systems, and in some
                    cases omit even these and look only to the succession of primary, secondary, and
                    tertiary classes of rocks.</p><p>This examination has been made in almost all parts of the world, nowhere, indeed,
                    except in Europe and certain portions of the other continents completely, yet
                    every where sufficiently to establish the truth of the following
                    propositions·.</p><p>1. The series of British strata represents very well the succession of stratified
                    rocks in Europe, parts of Africa, Asia, and North America; this agreement is
                    most strict in those parts which are nearest to the British islands, and becomes
                    more vague and indefinite as the distance increases. In France and Germany, for
                    instance, as far as the Pyrenees and the Alps, not only the greater divisions,
                    but nearly all the formations, most of the smaller groups, and many of the
                    particular rocks, are well exemplified.</p><p>Round the shores of the Mediterranean analogies to the same type continually
                    present themselves. In the basin of the Indus and on the slopes of the Himalaya
                    mountains some of the secondary strata of Great Britain have been recognised.
                    What is known of Australia offers less exact analogies of the same kind. In
                    North America not only are secondary and tertiary strata known corresponding in
                    general characters to those of Europe, but several of the European formations
                    have been satisfactorily identified.</p><p>2. In all parts of the globe where a considerable extent of country has been
                    surveyed stratified rocks have been found; but many small portions of the
                    terrestrial surface are devoid of them. Stratification is, therefore^ not an
                    universal, but yet it is the most general form in which the rocky materials of
                    the globe are accumulated.</p><p>The three great divisions of stratified rocks appear to hold the same relative
                    position in all parts of the globe. In very distant localities the successive
                    formations are identical, similar, Or analogous, and it is evidently not
                    unreasonable to expect from the union of observations, conducted upon one
                    general plan, that a general history may at last be formed of all the stratified
                    rocks in the crust of the globe, and according to the relative periods of their
                    production.</p><p>The unstratified rocks of Great Britain, though numerous and individually
                    variable, can yet be generally referred to a few leading divisions, according
                    chiefly to their constituent minerals. This classification will be given
                    hereafter; we shall now content ourselves with noticing two predominant groups
                    of these rocks, remarkably contrasted in the circumstances of their
                    occurrence—granitic and basaltic rocks—the former lying in great masses below
                    all the strata, frequently in the centre of a mountain district; the latter
                    occupying fissures in them or spreading irregularly over their surface.</p><p>Few parts of the globe except some of its vast plains and deserts are entirely
                    deficient of rocks which are not stratified, though the surface which they
                    occupy is not nearly so great as that covered by the strata. Granitic and
                    basaltic rocks compose generally , the greater portion of the unstratified
                    masses, as in Britain, and he in the same relations to the strata. For granitic
                    rocks, throughout the globe, are the most frequent axes or centres of mountain
                    groups, and basaltic rocks fill dykes and spread in irregular cappings over the
                    strata. It is evident, therefore, that the structure of the exterior parts of
                    the globe, though full of local diversity, is all formed upon one general plan,
                    and produced by similar agencies.</p><p>GENERAL VIEW OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE CRUST OF THE GLOBE.</p><p>An observer stationed on any of the widely extended plains, which occupy so large
                    a proportion of the surface of the earth, finds, beneath the soil and loose
                    materials, the different rocks almost universally stratified, lying in a settled
                    order of succession, and nearly horizontal, or gently inclined in some one
                    direction.</p><p>On the other hand, the high mountain districts generally exhibit in the central
                    points, or along their axes, granitic and other unstratified rocks under all
                    their strata, which slope away on all sides at high angles of inclination,
                    descend to lower and still lower ground, and finally pass under the plains and
                    more level regions, and are there covered up and buried under other superimposed
                    strata. Very few parts of the world offer real exceptions to this general
                    statement. The narrow mountain chains and groups occupy far less space than the
                    wide plains which they divide, and were the surface of the continents lowered
                    only a thousand feet, most of them would form small islands in prodigiously wide
                    seas. Yet they are really connected together, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821588" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1588-0183"/> all united
                    into one system beneath, both by the unstratified rocks of the axis, and the
                    strata of the slopes.</p><p>Let the diagram (No. 2.) be supposed a section through two mountain ranges and
                    one intervening plain; it will be seen that the sloping strata of each mountain
                    group are continued beneath the plain to unite with those on the other side; the
                    strata lying in the lower countries are higher in the scale than those which
                    rise against the mountains, and thus it happens that a person proceeding from
                    low regions towards high districts finds strata which lay deep below gradually
                    and successively emerge towards the mountains, and the lowest of all rise to
                    form the highest crests and loftiest ridges. Hence also it happens that the
                    strata are seldom quite horizontal, but generally have an inclination depending
                    on some mountain axis. Hence also the term basin, so much used in geology, to
                    express the sloping of strata in several directions toward a centre, a
                    circumstance which seldom happens unless the country also agrees in geological
                    features with the basin of the hydrographers. To discover in the plain countries
                    the strata of the mountains, we must penetrate the earth by deep pits; but man’s
                    power is soon limited in this direction, and a much easier method is at hand for
                    obtaining the complete section of strata existing together in any one great
                    geological basin.</p><p>Proceeding from the point where the uppermost stratum is found, towards the
                    borders of the basin, the country rising gradually or by undulations, the strata
                    <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> &amp;c. coming out successively, may be
                    successively examined and measured, and a section be drawn representing the
                    whole series, till we reach the axis of the mountains composed of unstratified
                    rocks <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> visible in
                    one mountain ridge, but covered in another.</p><p>In this diagram, the stratified masses <hi rend="italic">ed</hi> may be conceived
                    to be primary strata, <hi rend="italic">cb</hi> secondary, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> tertiary; <hi rend="italic">t</hi> may shew one of the irregular
                    overlying masses of basaltic and some other rocks. The reader will understand
                    from this, how it happens as a general rule that the lowest strata rise to the
                    highest ground, and die contrary.</p><p>In comparing the sections of different geological basins, a very striking general
                    similitude prevails, but differences perpetually occur; the whole may be reduced
                    to one general law. The lowest or primary strata, in all the mountain ranges,
                    and throughout all the basins of the globe, have very much of a common
                    character; gneiss, mica schist, clay-slate, quartz rock, with few or no organic
                    remains, are the most characteristic strata of every country.</p><p>The secondary and tertiary strata, recurring mostly in lower ground, every where
                    exhibit very similar chemical and mineralogical characters: they are composed of
                    limestone, sandstone, and clay, with abundance of organic remains; but in
                    distinct regions, the formations in which they naturally group themselves are
                    rather analogous than closely related. The primary strata are the effects of
                    almost universal agencies, accompanied by very similar local conditions; those
                    of later date also agree in some general features, but exhibit diversities of
                    character apparently due to diversity of local circumstances. In this sense, the
                    primary deposits are almost universal, those of later date are more local and
                    limited.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Origin of the Stratified Rocks</hi> That the stratified masses
                    of the globe, resting upon one another in a settled order of succession, have
                    been deposited from water in the same order as we now see them—the lowest
                    first—the uppermost last—is a proposition so fully and freely admitted, that it
                    may seem unnecessary to adduce arguments in its support; but the facts which
                    prove the watery origin of the strata open at the same time a great variety of
                    other truths, and disclose so clearly the history of many great physical changes
                    on the globe that a full examination of them is essential to the acquisition of
                    right fundamental views in geology.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nature of the Rocks.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Viewed
                    generally, the most abundant stratified rocks may be referred, according to
                    their chemical constitution, to one of three great groups, viz. Siliceous rocks,
                    Siliceo-aluminous rocks, Calcareous rocks.</p><p>The secondary and tertiary series of strata consist principally of alternating
                    strata of these qualities, and the same is less obviously true of the primary
                    strata. If we consider on what mineralogical characters this general result
                    depends, we find the siliceous rocks have almost universally a preponderance of
                    the mineral quartz; the siliceo-argillaceous rocks consist of quartz with
                    distinct or indistinct admixtures of felspar, mica, chlorite, or other minerals,
                    containing alumina. Distinct mixtures of these minerals occur both in the
                    primary and later classes of strata, but there is a great difference in the
                    appearances of the compounds. Gneiss, mica-schist, &amp;c. in the primary
                    series, have very much the air of crystalline Aggregation; the secondary and
                    tertiary sandstones are clearly mechanical aggregates; yet upon more close
                    scrutiny, this difference diminishes or vanishes. Several sandstones are almost
                    crystalline, the particles of gneiss are really fragmentary; in both the parts
                    are truly crystallized as to the interior texture, but in neither of them
                    entirely free from the effects of some mechanical movement. The mica of gneiss
                    is not often perfectly hexagonal as in granite, the quartz has generally lost
                    its exact prismatic shape, the felspar its prominent angles. Exceptions to this
                    occur certainly, but it is quite true as a general rule, and when fully
                    investigated leads to a positive conclusion that nearly all the noncalca-reous
                    primary and secondary strata have been subjected, but in very different degrees,
                    to mechanical agencies, like those concerned in the accumulation of common
                    sandstone. Nôw the least examination of sandstone rocks, and comparison of them
                    with the sandy and argillaceous deposits from rivers, in lakes, and on the
                    borders of the sea, leaves no doubt that they have experienced the agitation of
                    water; in fact, that they were sedimentary deposits.</p><p>Some limestones do and others do not yield evidence of similar agitation; they
                    are often to be considered as aggregations of particles of carbonate of lime,
                    slowly collected from chemical precipitation in water.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">organic remains in the strata.</hi></p><p>The contents of many of the stratified rocks leave no doubt of their watery
                    origin, and inform us besides of many circumstances concerning the condition of
                    the waters. We find almost all the tertiary and secondary strata, and some (the
                    upper portions) of the primary strata, rich in organic fossils of the animal and
                    vegetable kinds; some, as zoophyta, Crustacea, and mollusea, abound in
                    particular rocks, so as to form a large part of their substance. Examined with
                    care and all the advantages of modern science, marine, freshwater, and
                    terrestrial plants and animals are found disposed with great regularity in the
                    different strata, just as at the present day we find in the sandy bed of the sea
                    and in lakes, the shelly remains of the marine and freshwater mollusea, and
                    other creatures; and, scattered amongst them or lying distinct, some of the
                    vegetable spoils of the land.</p><p>If we had witnessed the elevation of a part of the bed of the sea or a lake, by
                    the force of an earthquake, and wished to remove any doubt in the minds of those
                    who had not seen it, should we not triumphantly appeal to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821601" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1601-0184"/> presence of
                    marine exuviae in the one, and lacustrine shells in the other, for confirmation
                    of the statement? Would not the argument be equally strong, the fact of the
                    former submersion of one part under the sea, and of the other under fresh water,
                    equally certain, from this circumstantial evidence alone, a hundred years after
                    the occurrence?</p><p>This is the reasoning employed in modern geology: we find the greater part of the
                    strata composing the known portion of the crust of the globe, full of the
                    remains of marine exuviae, exactly as we should find the stratified bed of the
                    sea at this day filled with the exuviae of now existing or lately perished
                    animals, and we conclude, without hesitation, that the strata were deposited in
                    the sea when the earth was in some different condition; that in fact the whole
                    terrestrial surface of the globe was formed under water, and has since been laid
                    dry by some natural process. Upon this clear and impregnable basis rests the
                    whole of geological science—this is the first of its grand and impressive
                    truths. Derived from observations over all the globe, it has been fully
                    established in modern times, yet was not wholly overlooked in remote
                    antiquity.</p><p>Notions of the displacement of the ocean from lands of great extent which it once
                    covered, occur in Ovid and Strabo; the perception of its importance became
                    general on the revival of learning in Europe, and gave rise to many hypotheses
                    in Italy, France, England, and Germany. It is the great truth which supports the
                    Wernerian and Huttonian theories, as well as the otherwise baseless fabrics of
                    fancy proposed by Burnet, and Woodward, and others of oür countrymen.</p><p>Besides the proof thus offered that our continents were formed under the ocean,
                    and only recovered from it after the deposition of many strata, enclosing the
                    remains of many races of beings, we find more limited indications of the
                    existence of fresh water and dry land contemporaneously with the production of
                    some of the marine strata. How is this known? By the alternation of strata
                    containing freshwater shells and other products, or land plants, with those
                    containing marine exuviae. Thus it is certain that while the whole or greater
                    part of the terrestrial surface we now behold lay unborn on the bed of the
                    primeval deep, some land did exist, some lakes or rivers held fresh water, and
                    the air nourished vegetables and animals as well as the sea.</p><p>But the greater proportion of organic remains found in the earth is clearly of
                    marine origin. They are incredibly numerous, often perfectly preserved, and can
                    be directly compared with existing species of mollusea, Crustacea, zoophyta,
                    &amp;c. so as perfectly to determine their affinity and diversity. The progress
                    of philosophical zoology and botany is here of the highest importance: these
                    sciences enable us in many instances to state the degree of the analogy or
                    difference observed, and to draw some important inferences not otherwise
                    attainable. The comparison of recent and fossil species has now gone far enough
                    to justify some remarkable deductions.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">extinct genera and species.</hi></p><p>Of many thousand species of marine zoophyta, mollusea, crustacea, fishes, &amp;c.
                    very few can be exactly paralleled in the system of living nature, most of them
                    are extinct, and only to be understood by the application of laws derived from
                    the study of the most similar existing races.</p><p>The amount of resemblance between the fossil and the recent tribes is extremely
                    variable; a few are perfectly identical; a considerable proportion so far
                    similar as to be referred to the same genera; a still greater proportion can be
                    included in the same great families; almost all can be referred to the same
                    great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. The differences of form and
                    structure are thus known to be of the same order as those which at the present
                    day belong to the productions of different climates and different local
                    conditions. Thus, while some very large groups of fossils have only a very faint
                    resemblance to existing forms of life, strike us with surprise and awaken a
                    curiosity which can only be partially gratified,—the general effect of the whole
                    investigation is to prove a unity of design pervading the fossil and living
                    creations,—one general system is discerned,—and the variations are referred to
                    <hi rend="italic">differences of circumstances.</hi> To reduce these differences
                    of condition to some general law, let us next attend to the distribution of
                    organic remains in the earth.</p><p>DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANIC REMAINS IN THE EARTH.</p><p>The stratified masses of the earth containing organic remains are of different
                    antiquity, as indicated by their relative position, of different chemical and
                    mineralogical nature, and the situations in which they occur upon the globe are
                    various; these three circumstances influence the distribution of organic
                    remains. In the existing economy of nature we know that marine life varies with
                    geographical situation, and changes with the nature of the oceanic bed. But the
                    present races of beings which become engaged among the sediments of the ocean
                    characterize only one period: the organic remains belong to many different
                    successive ages of the world. Thus we must examine their distribution in the
                    earth with reference to three points,—</p><p>1. The different periods when they lived.</p><p>2. The geographical situation of the locality.</p><p>3. The different rocks which enclose them—(other things being similar).</p><p>The bare proposal of such problems for discussion is enough to prove what real
                    progress has been made in investigating the structure of the earth; and it is
                    scarcely beyond truth to say, that as much is already known of the laws which
                    govern the distribution of organic remains in the earth as of those which define
                    the limits of life in the sea. Nevertheless, we must not imagine this subject so
                    fully examinéd as to confer more than a provisional character upon the
                    conclusions which follow; for <hi rend="italic">accurate results</hi> on the
                    subject are. yet collected from a very small part of the surface of the
                    globe.</p><p>1 ∙ The relative antiquity of the stratified rocks is found to be, throughout
                    most parts of the world, the circumstance of principal influence in limiting the
                    occurrence of organic reliquiae. In every restricted tract of country, as the
                    north or south of England, the fossil zoophyta, shells, and crustacea are
                    different in the different systems of formations, and sometimes even in all the
                    successive stratified rocks. Thus in the north of England the Silurian system,
                    the carboniferous system, the red sandstone system, the oolitic system, and the
                    cretaceous system, all contain organic remains, and mostly in great plenty. Two
                    things are here observed, first, that <hi rend="smallcaps">all</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">fossil</hi> shells, &amp;c. are clearly and completely <hi rend="smallcaps">distinct</hi> from any known recent species; secondly, that
                    with hardly one exception, all those of one system are distinct from all those
                    of another.</p><p>2. In each system of strata lie entombed the exuviae of entirely different races
                    of beings, all successively buried in marine sediments on the same geographical
                    area; a series of monuments which mark the numerous changes of organic and
                    inorganic nature. Each stratum is thus proved to have been in its turn the bed
                    of the sea. After the deposition of a certain number constituting a formation or
                    system of strata, all the phenomena were changed, sediments of a different
                    nature were deposited, enclosing the remains of different races of living
                    beings. Thp same things are true of equal districts in the south of England, in
                    France, Germany, and America. It is therefore adopted as an axiom sufficiently
                    demonstrated to be of general application, that in a limited district particular
                    species of organic remains arc distributed in certain assemblages of strata
                    ac∙</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193821614" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1614-0185"/><p>cording to their relative antiquity. Certain races of organic remains are of
                    higher antiquity than others.</p><p>To the discovery of these sure truths Mr W. Smith has a just and recognised
                    claim. His labours date from 1790; yet we must not omit to observe that not only
                    Werner, but Whitehurst, Mitchell, and Lister, and others, had some knowledge of
                    a similar kind, more, perhaps, than can be inferred from the short notices left
                    in their works, or in the memory of their pupils.</p><p>3. But these are local truths. The attention of modern geologists, resolved to
                    follow out the masterly researches of Mr Smith, are directed to ascertain their
                    generality. The law just expressed may be universally true, and prove every
                    where changes of organic life proportioned to the time elapsed, and yet not
                    permit us to infer that these changes were contemporaneously similar over all or
                    even a great part of the globe, <hi rend="italic">unless</hi> the organic
                    contents are every where similar in the same or contemporaneous formations or
                    systems of strata. The facts yet collected on this subject are too few to allow
                    of very precise inferences; yet it is too important to be lightly passed over.
                    It is found that particular species of fossils have rarely, even in the same
                    stratum, an universal diffusion. Not even over the continent of Europe can many
                    particular species be traced at all the points of a particular rock. One <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> belemnite <hi rend="italic">{B.</hi><hi rend="italic">mucronatus)</hi> is almost never absent from the European chalk,
                    and is found in no other rock; a particular trilobite <hi rend="italic">{Calymene Blumenbachiï),</hi> and a certain coral <hi rend="italic">(Catenipora
                    Lam.)</hi> has been found not only in most localities of the Silurian limestones
                    in Europe, but also in America; but these are rare cases. Particular genera and
                    families are more widely distributed along the strata to which they belong; for
                    example, belenmites and gryphaeae occur every where in the cretaceous and
                    oolitic systems, and rarely or not at all in any other systems. Orthoceratites
                    and goniatites occur every where in the silurian and carboniferous systems, and
                    in none which lie above. Finally, each system of strata, as far as is yet known,
                    appears, wherever it occurs, to exhibit in its organic contents identity,
                    affinity, or analogy with those found with it at other points nearly in the
                    ratio of the proximity of the situations. Hence, as a general rule, it is found
                    that the marine organic contents of each system of strata are the remains of
                    successively created and destroyed races of animals, each of which lived through
                    particular periods of time, and no longer; that the families and genera living
                    at one epoch were very widely diffused, but that each species existed only in a
                    definite and mostly very narrow geographical area.</p><p>4. Nature of the rocks In the modern ocean we know that the distribution of many
                    mollusea and crustacea is influenced by the nature of the bed or shore of the
                    sea. Oysters love a muddy bank, cockles delight in sandy shores, lobsters seek
                    subaqueous rocks. The same dependence appears amongst organic remains; for it is
                    too remarkable to escape ordinary attention, that the ostrea deltoidea is
                    collected in immense oyster beds in the Kimmeridge clay; that an analogous
                    genus, the gryphaea, lies in excessive abundance in the Oxford clay, and the
                    argillaceous has shales and limestones.</p><p>But zoophytes, as lamelliferous corals, echinida, and crinoidea, generally, are
                    almost unknown in argillaceous rocks, unless when they are associated with
                    calcareous portions, while they abound in many, if not all, the fossiliferous
                    limestones.</p><p>This kind of dependence of certain races of fossil shells, &amp;c. on the nature
                    of the enveloping rocks, can be well studied in the oolitic and carboniferous
                    limestone formations, where limestone, sandstone, and shales continually
                    alternate. There is a general accordance between the different oolitic
                    limestones in the number and general charac ∙ ter, and often peculiar species of
                    fossils which they contain. In respect of the fossils, the limestones differ
                    more from the sandstones and argillaceous strata than from each other. The same
                    things are true in the mountain limestone series, with this addition, that the
                    fossils are principally confined to the limestone portions of the strata.</p><p>It would appear, therefore, that the conditions of existence of certain species
                    of fossils occurred periodically, and coincided with the deposition of
                    particular strata, as if the dictum of Cuvier were true,—as if the oceanic fluid
                    had changed its nature, and its depositions and inhabitants changed in
                    proportion. But before we adopt this conclusion, we must assure ourselves of the
                    truth of what has indeed been long taken for granted by geologists, that the
                    marine animals lived on or near the spot where their remains lie imbedded. This
                    does not require long discussion. The general perfection of the delicate
                    ornaments on the surfaces of shells, echini, &amp;c., the complete state of
                    conservation of fishes, crustacea, &amp;c., proves them to have undergone little
                    or no violence, such as transporting from a distance in oceanic currents would
                    necessarily occasion. In some cases the fossil shells, &amp;c. have experienced
                    the usual agitation of the shores of the sea, as in the forest marble group near
                    Bath, the top of the oolite at Stamford, &amp;c.; and this is of great
                    importance in reasoning; but generally we may conclude that the doctrine is
                    sufficiently exact which fixes the local residences of the animals near the
                    place of sepulture of their shelly or osseous remains.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">comparison</hi> OF THE STRATIFIED AND UNSTRATIFIED</p><p>ROCKS.</p><p>The arguments on which we rely for the proof of the subaqueous origin of all the
                    stratified rocks may be thus summed up.</p><p>The stratified structure is that which is always assumed by successive
                    depositions of sediments in water.</p><p>The materials (clay, sand, limestone, &amp;c.) composing the strata of the crust
                    of the globe, arc exactly similar and in the same condition, or else very
                    analogous, to deposits now forming under water in various parts of the globe,
                    and similarly associated.</p><p>The organic contents of the rocks are such as admit of, no other explanation, for
                    they are mostly of marine or fresh water origin, and the few terrestrial
                    reliquiae which occur in them shew, by various circumstances, that they were
                    drifted from the land or overwhelmed by the sea. By combining all these
                    considerations, we arrive at the positive conclusion <hi rend="italic">that all
                    the really stratified rocks</hi> are of aqueous origin.</p><p>But when we turn to the unstratified rocks the same conclusion does not apply.
                    Independent of the universal want of this unequivocal mark of watery action
                    (except under particular cases not really exceptional, as will appear
                    hereafter), the following circumstances are decisive.</p><p>The materials of which the rocks are composed are neither similar to those now
                    deposited by water nor in a similar condition. They are not composed of sands,
                    clays, or limestone, but of a variety of crystallized minerals, many of them the
                    same or very similar to those produced by volcanic agency, or the artificial
                    heat of a furnace.</p><p>The association of these minerals into rocks is the same or very similar to the
                    grouping of similar minerals in volcanic rocks. In several instances the
                    products of volcanos and ancient unstratified rocks are identical. The
                    variations of the different groups of rocks follow similar laws, and they occur
                    under similar relations to the stratified rocks.</p><p>In these unstratified rocks organic remains do not occur (sometimes, indeed,
                    portions of strata containing such remains are enveloped in unstratified rocks);
                    and from the whole evidence no doubt remains of the igneous origin of the
                    crystallized and other unstratified rocks.</p><p>It is very conceivable that, in particular circumstances, the effect of watery
                    and igneous agency may be evident in the same rock. These agencies may have been
                    contemporaneously or successively exerted; and thus combined, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821627" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1627-0186"/> successive or
                    confused results of two entirely different agencies may occasionally lead even
                    the experienced geologist into error. But this does not affect the principle;
                    inaccuracies of detail must often occur in descriptions and reasonings on
                    natural phenomena, which involve various conditions and measures of force.
                    Already, indeed, the clew is probably obtained for elucidating the <hi rend="italic">differences</hi> as well as the <hi rend="italic">agreements</hi>
                    of geological phenomena, and it is not necessary to say that no natural science
                    can pretend to have made greater progress than this; for to know the causes of
                    general agreement, and to discover the causes of partial diversity, is the whole
                    problem of physical science.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Original Position of Strata.</hi> —.The leading and fundamental
                    fact of geology is the submarine origin of the stratified rocks; and the partial
                    desiccation of the bed of the ancient sea is the general truth upon which all
                    geological theory must be based; for in fact our examination of the structure of
                    the existing land is nothing more than the examination of the successive
                    deposits in the ancient ocean, varied by the effects of subterranean movements.
                    One of the first questions which presents itself to the mind on considering this
                    subject is this, Do we see these stratified rocks in their original state and
                    place, or have any displacements and derangements happened to confuse their
                    order and symmetry? The theoretical considerations connected with this question
                    will come before us hereafter, but, for the sake of the descriptions of rocks
                    which are to follow, it is necessary to settle the facts.</p><p>In this, fortunately, there is no great difficulty. By an investigation of the
                    circumstances under which modem deposits happen in water, we find as a very
                    general result, admitting of few, and those local exceptions, that these
                    deposits ever tend to assume horizontal surfaces. Wherever the lateral influence
                    of waves and currents agitates broad surfaces of water to a considerable portion
                    of its depth, the earthy sediments (sand, clay, &amp;c.), and chemical
                    precipitates (carbonate of lime) are diffused by the movements with so much
                    uniformity as to produce very regular strata, with a decided tendency to
                    horizontal surfaces. Thus, all round the British islands, the very moderate
                    slope of the bed of the sea is extremely characteristic; between the Humber and
                    the Elbe, a distance of 4° longitude, the greatest depth is about 200 feet.
                    (Whewell on Tides, Phil. Trans.) And, as Mr de la Beche has shewn, if the
                    British islands and the bed of the sea around them were raised only 600 feet
                    above their actual level (as compared with the ocean), they would be joined to
                    the continent of Europe, and surrounded on all hands by a vast area of flat, or
                    rather gently inclined, land; for the fall from the coast to the new sea-line
                    would be generally so gradual as to present to the eye one great plain, uniting
                    the western coasts of Spain, Ireland, the Hebrides, and Scandinavia.</p><p>The same horizontality of stratified deposits is observed in the dried beds of
                    ancient and modern lakes; it is seen in every delta and along all riversides,
                    and even if, like the stormy Arve, the rivers sweep along large masses of stone
                    through irregular valleys, and accumulate heaps of detritus, with much local
                    irregularity, the general result is a plane surface.</p><p>There are indeed exceptions to this general truth. One of the most interesting is
                    that brought forward by Mr Yates in his description of the sedimentary deposits
                    in the lakes of Switzerland. Where a river discharges sediment into deep and
                    tranquil water, the particles, when released from the lateral impulse, are in
                    some degree in the same circumstances as materials thrown from a loaded waggon;
                    the coarser matters accumulate into conical heaps round the point of entrance of
                    the river, while the finer sorts pass through greater breadths of the water and
                    form more extensive and less inclined deposits. (Jameson’s Journal, 1830.)
                    Another case of stratified deposits deviating considerably from the horizontal,
                    may happen when carbonate of lime is precipitated from solution, and suffered to
                    fall in very tranquil water on a sloping or undulated bed. The thickness of the
                    strata produced would be greatest in the deepest parts, and the whole deposit
                    would grow thinner towards die edges.</p><p>Now, in fact, among the stratified rocks which compose the crust of the globe,
                    examples of these exceptional casés do occur; instances are really known where
                    coarse materials to a limited extent have been deposited in inclined positions,
                    and carbonate of lime collected in particular forms and not generally diffused;
                    but just as in the present economy of nature we find unequivocal evidence of the
                    generality of the law of horizontal deposition of strata, so it certainly was in
                    the older times. We are fully convinced, that for broad and extensive formations
                    of strata composed of various successions of sands, clays and limestones
                    variously stored with organic remains, there can be no risk of error in
                    assuming, as a fact sufficiently proved, that they were deposited nearly
                    level.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Position of Strata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Assured of
                    this fact, as a basis of reasoning, we may proceed to inquire into the actual
                    position of strata, as they are seen in the desiccated parts of the old oceanic
                    bed which now compose our solid land. The most general condition of the
                    stratified rocks of all ages is to be not quite level, but inclined to the
                    hórizon in some one direction, and at some certain angle, in each locality.</p><p>Over immense tracts of the earth’s surface, the angle of inclination is extremely
                    moderate; more than ∣ of the surface of Europe (and probably of the other
                    continents) is occupied by strata which in common language may be said to be
                    nearly horizontal. This character of horizontality is indeed almost exactly
                    merited by the strata around Paris, in the Great Plains of Northern Germany and
                    Russia, the Basin of the Danube, Hungary, &amp;c.; but as we proceed in any
                    direction from such centres and lines of horizontal stratification, we find the
                    rocks to assume more and more of some prevalent inclination, so as to permit the
                    subjacent strata to come to the surface and present escarpments in particular
                    directions.</p><p>These escarpments commonly look toward the nearest range of mountains; in that
                    direction the inclination of the strata augments continually, and at length on
                    the slopes, or in the midst of such mountain range, we find them very steeply
                    inclined, absolutely vertical, partially retroflexed, or bent into strange
                    contortions.</p><p>Among the Alps and Pyrenees, the strata which, in every part of their surface,
                    were originally very little inclined, and which, at a distance from the
                    mountains, retain nearly their original position, are thrown into various
                    disturbed positions; the local effect of violent convulsions. By a careful study
                    of the circumstances, we observe that these indications of disturbance augment
                    continually toward the axis or centre of the mountain group; and that the
                    direction of the movements has there been upwards. There has, in fact, been a
                    real and violent <hi rend="italic">elevation</hi> of the stratified crust of the
                    globe, corresponding to the centre or axis of each mountain group.</p><p>This truth, sufficiently attested by observation in all parts of the globe, leads
                    directly to another very important law of the phenomena of disturbed
                    stratification. The centre or axis of the mountain group, and consequently of
                    the disturbing movement, is generally <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> to be a mass
                    of “n- <hi rend="italic">stratijied rock,</hi> such as granite, sienite,
                    &amp;c., which shews, by a variety of circumstances, that it was not deposited
                    in water<pb break="no" facs="nls:193821640" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1640-0187"/>, but rather crystallized from igneous fusion.
                    Very often, indeed generally, proofs of its having been in a state of fusion at
                    the time of the elevation of the strata, are found in the extension of veins of
                    the crystallized into the sedimentary rocks, accompanied by characteristic
                    effects of heat.</p><p>We are thus led to associate the phenomenon of the disturbance of strata, with
                    the eruption of crystallized rock from beneath; and though the latter is indeed
                    not exactly the <hi rend="italic">cause</hi> of the former, but rather a
                    concomitant effect of some general dynamical agency, geologists are not greatly
                    to be censured who describe the phenomena'as they appear, and speak of the
                    disturbed positions of the strata, as <hi rend="italic">effects</hi> of the
                    elevation of unstratified rocks.</p><p>Once acquainted with this relation of the two classes of <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> rocks, we are in possession of a clew to guide us through all the mazes
                    of local geology; for it is equally true of small elevations of strata, as of
                    all mountain chains, that the most general condition observable is the mutual
                    dependence of these disturbances and irruptions of nnstratified rocks.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Particular Positions of Strata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    One of the most common of the many forms in which the subterraneous movements
                    alluded to have left the strata, is that of a longitudinal ridge, from which the
                    strata decline on both sides, usually at very high angles; this is called an <hi rend="italic">anticlinal axis.</hi></p><p>In some cases (Diagram, No. 4.) the strata are continuous over the axis, as in
                    the Ribblesdale system offaults in Yorkshire; in others (Diagram, No. 5.) they
                    are removed along the axis so as to constitute what is called a valley of
                    elevation. The southern Cordilleras are in this state.</p><p>The longitudinal depression or trough (Diagram, No. 6,)</p><p>towards which strata decline, is called a <hi rend="italic">synclinal</hi><hi rend="italic">axis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> this is frequently placed

                    sometimes actually rendered vertical (as in the Isle of Wight), or even
                    retroflexed (as in the Malvern Hills). Even a more remarkable case is common
                    among the Alps, as in the Lake of the Four Cantons, and in the Valley of
                    Lauterbrun, where the limestones are bent into the utmost conceivable variety of
                    curvatures, evidently caused by great lateral and vertical pressure upon
                    yielding materials. (Diagram, No. 10.)</p><p><hi rend="italic">Areas of Deposition.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The study of
                    the various circumstances under which disturbances of the strata are manifested,
                    has assumed a very high degree of importance since the speculations of Μ. de
                    Beaumont recalled attention to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821653" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1653-0188"/> their connexion with general theory. It had been
                    long known that the dislocations of the strata were of unequal antiquity. Even
                    as early as 1791, Mr Smith found proof of the faults in the coal strata of
                    Gloucestershire and Somersetshire, being anterior to the new red marl, for the
                    horizontal beds of that formation lie level over the inclined and broken planes
                    of the coal system. In the north of England, the coal-works from Nottingham to
                    Aberford as well as those in Durham and Newcastle, indicate the same truth; but
                    yet it is to Μ. de Beaumont that we owe the impulse which has given the
                    investigation of the ages of disturbances a distinct station in geological
                    science.</p><p>The data required for determining the geological age of a convulsion or
                    disturbance of strata are simple, yet they cannot always be had with sufficient
                    exactness. We must know what strata <hi rend="italic">are,</hi> and what <hi rend="italic">are not,</hi> displaced by the disturbance in question. If, for
                    example, it be found that along any axis of elevation, the set of rocks included
                    in the gneiss, mica-slate, clay-slate, and greywacke slate systems, are
                    dislocated, but that none of the strata belonging to the carboniferous or other
                    more recent systems have participated in the movement, the conclusion is plain,
                    that the disturbance happened <hi rend="italic">before</hi> the deposition of
                    the latter rocks, but <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the production of the former.
                    If the undisturbed strata D, E, F be consecutive with the disturbed rocks A, B,
                    C, the geological data of the occurrence is <hi rend="italic">accurately
                    fixed</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but if there be any chasm in this respect as
                    A B—*—* E F, the <hi rend="italic">limits of error</hi> are known, but the age
                    of the fault is only <hi rend="italic">approximately fixed.</hi> See Diagram No.
                    11.</p><p>The principal difficulty, however, lies in the procurement of any really
                    satisfactory data. If the disturbed strata be covered <hi rend="italic">along
                    the axis</hi> of movement by undisturbed deposits, the data must be correct,
                    though incomplete, and the conclusion must be admitted; but this is a rare case;
                    most frequently the observations are individually indecisive. Certain <hi rend="italic">older</hi> strata are seen to be dislocated with reference to a
                    certain axis; other newer beds <hi rend="italic">occurring in the vicinity</hi>
                    are not seen to be disturbed; if the observations can be repeated at many
                    localities, not far removed from the axis, the negative may sometimes be
                    sufficiently established.^ In such a case it generally happens that the
                    disturbed strata are somewhere or other found unconformed in dip or in direction
                    on the surface to those which are presumed to be undisturbed; on such evidence
                    of unconformity, we might safely infer the geological dates of several great
                    disturbances which have affected the Cumbrian slate district and other tracts in
                    the north of England.</p><p>DESCRIPTIVE GEOLOGY.</p><p>LEADING DiviSIONS.</p><p>The history of the successive formation of the crust of the globe is so far like
                    a narration of human events, that it admits of being placed in chronological
                    order, and classed in periods more or less characteristic. Those periods are not
                    at present reducible to the scale of historical time which is measured by the
                    earth’s rotation and revolution; yet the sequence of events is in many cases
                    perfectly ascertainable, and something like a scale of relative time may be
                    composed.</p><p>The basis of geological chronology is the succession of stratified rocks; the
                    lowest are the oldest, and the uppermost are the most recent. Unstratified rocks
                    present no such series; yet, by their connexion with the others, these also may
                    frequently be referred to their true dates. On this account, the section of
                    strata in any country is the foundation of all true and philosophical knowledge
                    of its geological history.</p><p>Sufficient time has elapsed since the promulgation of the views of Werner and
                    Smith on this subject to allow of a just estimate of their respective merits;
                    both are amongst the brightest names in geology. The principle of <hi rend="italic">geological time</hi> was very firmly adopted by both of these
                    eminent men; both produced sections of strata to form the scale of geological
                    time; Smith analyzed the English strata with masterly accuracy,—Werner grouped
                    the rocks of Germany into large and comprehensive systems: the one established
                    the practice of local and exact research, the other encouraged a hope of
                    arriving at general truths. Both of these are included in modern geology.</p><p>The series of strata in Germany was grouped by "Werner, who in this was guided by
                    earlier writers, under the heads of Primitive, Transition, and Floetz or
                    Secondary rocks, terms which have been immeasurably censured, without sufficient
                    reason.</p><p>The primitive, or most ancient of the known strata, were supposed to be of
                    crystalline origin, and to contain no organic remains; the secondary rocks to be
                    mostly of sedimentary origin, and to abound in organic exuviae; the transition
                    rocks were defined by intermediate characters.</p><p>At a later period, Cuvier and Brongniart⅛ researches round Paris, shewed the
                    necessity of adding an upper term to this series of systems, viz. the Tertiary
                    strata, which Werner had little opportunity of knowing.</p><p>The Wernerian hypothesis of the <hi rend="italic">origin</hi> of the strata may,
                    without hesitation, be rejected as entirely useless; but his views of the
                    leading groups of strata has had, and will long have, a decided and permanent
                    influence in geology, The term Primitive rocks, as implying more than we know,
                    is replaced by Primary; and Du Halloy and others have united with these the
                    cognate Transition rocks of Werner. Thus we have at present three well
                    understood divisions,— primary, secondary, and tertiary strata,—between which
                    are many <hi rend="italic">transition strata,</hi> linking the whole into one
                    comprehensive succession, which contains all the monuments of mechanical,
                    chemical, and vital phenomena open to the scrutiny of man.</p><p>In the following pages we shall attempt to exhibit the progress made in
                    decyphering these monuments in the order of their inscription: this, indeed, is
                    not the progress of <hi rend="italic">investigation,</hi> which rather begins
                    with the things best known, proceeds from the recognised facts and laws of
                    diurnal geology, and gradually encounters the increasing difficulties which
                    beset the inquiry into the ancient révolu· tions of nature; but our object is to
                    state results in the smallest compass and most convenient order; and this is
                    only to be attained by following the stream of time.</p><p>PRIMARY STRATA.</p><p>Primitive and great part of the Transition rocks of <hi rend="italic">Werner.</hi> Inferior order of strata, <hi rend="italic">Conybear¢.</hi>

                    rocks,—appeal’s in many instances (Glen Tilt in the Highlands, Skiddaw in
                    Cumberland, Land’s <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821666" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1666-0189"/> End iri Cornwall, &amp;c.) to have undergone
                    fusion since the deposition of strata upon it, for veins pass from it into the
                    fissures of these rocks; this may even be considered one of the most general
                    truths yet ascertained in geology. Some theorists have proposed the hypothesis,
                    that granite is only a fused mass of stratified rocks. To this we shall again
                    advert, and at present shall only observe, that, whether that notion be true or
                    false, it is enough for our present purpose that it recognises the general truth
                    of the stratified rocks which are the products of water, resting universally on
                    unstratified crystalline rocks, which, through whatever previous conditions
                    their particles may have passed, have assumed their present characters from the
                    agency of heat.</p><p>Igneous rocks, then, rest below all the aqueous deposits.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nature of the Primary Strata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    rocks included in this division may be referred to three principal types:
                    Siliceous, Argillaceous, and Calcareous rocks. The most important siliceous
                    rocks are gneiss, composed of the minerals called quartz, felspar, and mica
                    (with or without hornblende, garnets, &amp;c.); mica-slate, consisting of quartz
                    and mica (with or without felspar, garnets, hornblende, &amp;c.); quartz-rock,
                    composed chiefly of grains of quartz agglutinated in various degrees (with or
                    without mica, &amp;c.); chlorite-slate, which, when highly quartzose, may be
                    referred to this division, but, when passing to clay-slate, more naturally ranks
                    with the next. Hornblende-slate has the same double relation. Sandstones occur
                    in the upper parts.</p><p>The argillaceous rocks are less varied: Clay-slate, a fine grained, apparently
                    simple, mass; greywacke-slate, of a nature intermediate between this and common
                    sandstone; greywacke, a conglomerate of quartzose and other fragments in a basis
                    of clay-slate; various shales.</p><p>The calcareous portions are somewhat remarkable among limestones, for their
                    generally crystalline character; even the fossiliferous rocks have much of this
                    feature, and all the older beds are really crystallized. (Gamet, mica, talc,
                    hornblende, augite, quartz, &amp;c., sometimes occur in those portions.)</p><p>Induration or consolidation to a high degree, is a general property of these
                    strata. There is, in fact, no sand, no clay, no marl, in the whole series.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Succession of the Primary Strata.</hi> The different rocks
                    named are naturally associated in particular groups, according to geological
                    time, and consequently admit of being usefully combined in artificial
                    arrangements which proceed on the same basis. Thus, amid many local variations,
                    it is certainly true that rocks of the general type of gneiss and mica-slate lie
                    most frequently and abundantly at the base of the whole series, and contain no
                    organic remains; that the coarser argillaceous, sandy, and calcareous rocks,
                    become more abundant in the upper parts of the series, and yield stores of
                    organic exuviae, both of plants and animals. Between these extremes are found
                    the deposits of clay-slate, chlorite-slate, &amp;c. In consequence we have the
                    following series of systems, or great assemblages of strata, in the primary
                    division <hi rend="italic">(numbered</hi> according to their <hi rend="italic">geological date,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">placed</hi> so as to represent

                    fossils.</p><p>2. Clay-slate, and greywacke-slate system, with some limestones and a few

                    ranges on the face of the globe are entirely devoid of rocks of this system,
                    uplifted upon an axis of unstratified granitic masses, so as to be inclined at
                    high angles to the horizon. The great European basin is defined by irregular
                    elevations of this kind from the Frozen Sea to the Atlantic; by the Uralian and
                    Caucasian chains, the ranges of Asia Minor, Greece, South Italy, and the Atlas;
                    the irregular western border of Spain, Ireland, the north of Scotland, and
                    Scandinavia, is of similar structure. Within this area, the Sierras of Spain,
                    the Pyrenees, the Alps, and many minor mountains, shew the extremely wide
                    expansion of this oldest known system of stratified rocks.</p><p>In the British Isles it is little known in England and Wales (about Snowdon and
                    Skiddaw); but, in the Isle of Man, in all the very mountainous parts of Ireland
                    (Derry, Donegal, Galway, the south-western and south-eastern districts), in the
                    Western Isles, Zetland, and all the Highlands of Scotland, it is the predominant
                    class of rocks.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Succession and Thickness of the Strata</hi> In the Highlands of
                    Scotland the expansion of the gneiss and micaslate system is extremely great,
                    and the following general formula may be stated of the succession of the
                    component rocks, it being always remembered that local variations occur, which
                    cannot always be reduced to a regular scale in a country where no organic
                    remains can be employed to verify the inferences from mineral character. The
                    thickness of these rocks is very great, even to miles, but cannot be accurately
                    stated.</p><p>Upper series. Chlorite-slates, apparently uniting the clay slate and mica-slate
                    deposits. No organic remains. It ranges on the whole south-east border of the
                    Grampians, from near Aberdeen to Argyleshire.</p><p>Middle series. Mica-slates, primary limestone, quartz-rock, in various
                    combinations, the former by far the most predominant, the others only locally
                    important; the limestone occurs in different parts of the series. That of Loch
                    Earn, Inverary, and Balahulish, is in the upper part, approaching to
                    chlorite-slate; that of Glen Tilt, and the vale of Loch Tay, is in the lower
                    part. No organic remains. This occupies a great part of the eastern and southern
                    Highlands, north-west of Ireland.</p><p>Lower series. Gneiss, with primary limestone, quartz rock, hornblende-slate,
                    &amp;c. Gneiss is the predominant rock, and varies much in all respects; the
                    others are of local occurrence. Mica-slate alternates with Gneiss. No organic
                    remains. The gneiss series occupies nearly all the Hebrides, and very large
                    tracts of the northern and north-western Highlands.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Primary Stratification.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    stratification of primary rocks is sometimes very evident and indubitable, as in
                    the gneiss beds about Loch Sunart in Argyleshire, the limestones of Loch Earn
                    and Balahulish, the mica-slate of Glen Croe, the chlorite-slatè of Loch Lomond:
                    but, in many cases, it is extremely difficult to pronounce a candid and just
                    opinion whether a particular mass of such rocks is stratified or not. This
                    arises from the causes which are found to produce partial embarrassment even
                    among rocks of the secondary age. These are original <hi rend="italic">peculiarities of stratification,</hi> and subsequent <hi rend="italic">change
                    of structure</hi> by molecular aggregation (under the influence of heat or other
                    general agency).</p><p>The laminar and bedded structure of gneiss, mica-slate, chlorite-slate, and
                    primary limestone, is always more or less proportioned to the admixture of
                    ingredients, just as in common sandstones, which are changed to flagstone by
                    abundance of mica, but aggregated into masses of great thickness where this is
                    absent. Besides this cause of variation, common to all siliceous and
                    argillaceous rocks, there is a singularity in the lamination of gneiss, and the
                    schistose <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821679" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1679-0190"/> rocks analogous to it, which seems to indicate
                    that some peculiar agency different from the ordinary diffusive influence of
                    water was concerned in producing it. Contortions in the laminae of these rocks
                    are so prevalent, as even almost to be exclusively characteristic of them. It is
                    easy to see how such peculiar arrangements of the surface of lamination, and the
                    occasional entire extinction of those surfaces, may, in fact, render it
                    extremely doubtful whether the rock is in any respect stratified, because, in
                    many instances, where <hi rend="italic">the beds or strata are very thick,</hi>
                    no other clew is to be found than that afforded by the <hi rend="italic">laminae,</hi> which generally <hi rend="italic">are,</hi> but yet (as in common
                    sandstone) often <hi rend="italic">are not</hi> parallel to the planes of
                    stratification.</p><p>There are, however, yet other causes which tend to confuse the evidence of
                    stratification. In the neighbourhood of igneous rocks (granite, porphyry,
                    &amp;c.) the gneiss, and other similar rocks, seem to have undergone some
                    alterations. MacCulloch assures us, that the contortion of the laminae of the
                    rocks augments near the granite veins, quartz veins, &amp;c., and our own
                    observations in Argyleshire lead to a partial adoption of this view. Another
                    thing of importance has been noticed by Mr Weaver (Geol. Trans.) concerning <hi rend="italic">alternation</hi> of really granitic beds with ordinary gneiss in
                    Ireland. Whether these be <hi rend="italic">altered gneiss,</hi> or interposed
                    granite, is not material to the present discussion, if there be, from whatever
                    cause, such alternations of really crystallized and sedimentary rocks, the
                    result must be a blending of the characters of the two classes of rocks, and the
                    stratified structure may wholly vanish in particular tracts, through the local
                    influence of heat.</p><p>Another very general cause of difficulty in determining the stratification of
                    primary rocks arises from the changes of structure introduced among them since
                    their deposition. The contraction of these, as well as of other rocks, has
                    occasioned the production of a multitude of divisional planes or joints
                    variously related to the surfaces of stratification, and often, especially in
                    the finer grained and laminated rocks, assuming an admirable symmetry of
                    direction and inclination. Thus tabular and other regular structures appear in
                    the stratified primary rocks, which arrest the attention, and add a new cause of
                    embarrassment.</p><p>What, then, is the fruit of all this discussion? It is the conviction that the
                    gneiss, mica-slate, primary limestone, quartz-rock, &amp;c. are stratified
                    rocks; the most important evidence being the alternation of these different
                    rocks, and the lamination of different substances in them, but that the causes
                    which tend among all rocks to complicate the stratification with new structures,
                    have gone to the maximum in these the oldest of all; the principal of these
                    causes being heat, either locally exhibited in the neighbourhood of igneous
                    crystallized rocks, or generally pervading the whole mass of deposits.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Composition of Gneiss, Mica-Slate, Quartz-Rock, fye</hi></p><p>The views just advanced of the changes of structure superinduced on these rocks,
                    lead us to an explanation of what seems at first an extremely perplexing
                    circumstance in the history of primary strata,—their crystalline or
                    pseudocrystalline texture. Primary limestone is both stratified and
                    crystallized. Gneiss and mica-slate arc stratified, and yet they often closely
                    resemble granite, which, because it is crystallized and not stratified, is
                    ranked among rocks of igneous origin.</p><p>The case of limestone is soon settled. It is known, that, in contact with igneous
                    rocks, the chalk of Ireland, and the limestone of Teesdale are turned to
                    crystallized carbonate of lime; and experiments in the laboratory have left no
                    doubt of the propriety of referring this crystallization of the limestone to the
                    mere agency of <hi rend="italic">heat and pressure.</hi></p><p>The primary limestone is therefore crystallized, because it has been subject to
                    high temperature, pervading, of course, all the rock with which it is
                    associated. But it oc curs with nearly all members of the mica-slate and gneiss
                    systems. All those rocks then have suffered the influence of heat.</p><p>In like manner, experimental proof has been offered by the chemist, that
                    quartz-rock is merely sandstone altered by heat, as had been inferred from
                    phenomena at the contact of such rocks, with the basalt and greenstone in
                    Salisbury Craigs, Teesdale, and Shropshire; and thus we find reason to believe
                    that some of the characters by which gneiss and mica-slate approach to granite,
                    are owing to their having experienced considerable influence of heat. It is not,
                    however, necessary to attribute to this heat more than the cementation of the
                    grains of mica, quartz, felspar, &amp;C., just as happens in quartz-rock. Some
                    minerals may, perhaps, have been really <hi rend="italic">generated</hi> by the
                    heat (as happens to garnèt near trap-dykes); but, in general, examination of the
                    ingredients of gneiss, mica-slate, &amp;c., shews the minerals to be really worn
                    and fragmented crystals not very different from those in common sandstones,
                    which have indeed regular internal structure, but not a regular external
                    geometrical form. Six-sided tables of mica can seldom be seen in gneiss or
                    mica-slate; the pyramids of quartz have lost their angles, and the prisms of
                    felspar their edges. Sometimes, it is true, the degree of wearing which the
                    particles have suffered is very slight, and many considerations render it
                    probable that the circumstances under which they were accumulated, differed
                    materially from those which produced the sediments of the secondary geological
                    era. According to these views, then, gneiss, mica-slate, &amp;c. &amp;c., though
                    really stratified rocks, present greater resemblance than others to the granite
                    rocks, because they are composed of granitic detritus, which has been only
                    partially water-worn, and aggregated under the influence of high temperature,
                    which has given a peculiarity to the molecular constitution, generated new
                    minerals, and introduced symmetrical structures, which complicate Or predominate
                    over the traces of laminar and stratified aggregation.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Absence of Organic Remains</hi> The opinion, early intro duced
                    into geology, that the lowest stratified rocks are deficient in organic remains
                    still holds its ground, and still appears to support the rather questionable
                    separation of the gneiss and mica-slate system from the superior slate deposits,
                    under the name of primitive rocks.</p><p>MacCulloch, indeed, states that organic remains (<hi rend="italic">Orthο-</hi><hi rend="italic">cerata)</hi> occur in limestone lying in the gneiss tract of
                    Loch Eribol, in Sutherland; and in the German translation of De la Beche’s
                    Manual (by Von Dechen), we find examples quoted from Hoffman of fossils
                    occurring among gneiss and mica-slate in the Erzgebirge and Fichtelgebirge.</p><p>The fossils lie, indeed, in greywacke; but this is stated to be really and
                    clearly inclosed between beds of gneiss, mica-slate, &amp;c.</p><p>A particular view on this subject has been gradually introduced into geological
                    hypothesis, viz. that the mineral and structural character of gneiss,
                    mica-slate, &amp;c. is producible by long continued action of heat upon
                    siliceous and argillaceous strata of any age. Thus in the Col de Balme the has
                    is supposed to have been metamorphosed into chloritic and micaceous rocks,
                    analogous to those of the mica-slate. Those who adopt such views find it easy to
                    escape from the difficulty presented by MacCulloch’s and Hoffman’s observations;
                    but without entering on the subject at present, it is right to mention that the
                    researches of Sedgwick and Murchison on the spot indicated by MacCulloch failed
                    to confirm his testimony, and that in the mountainous border of the basin of
                    Bohemia, as in every such range, <hi rend="italic">apparent enclosures of
                    fossiliferous greywacke, between</hi> gneiss and mica-slate, is hardly a case of
                    sufficient importance to negative the universal result of direct researches,
                    which all go to establish as a fact the total absence of organic remains from
                    the whole of the gneiss and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821692" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1692-0191"/> . mica-slate systems. Is this absence of all
                    traces of organic life to be admitted as proof that the globe was at that period
                    unfurnished with the beautiful and wonderful variety of plants and animals
                    adapted to the land, the air, and the sea, or may we suppose such did exist, but
                    that their reliquiae were never entombed in the rocks, of if there deposited,
                    have been destroyed by subsequent alterations of their molecular

                    veins or interspersed beds pass up into these strata, many other masses of
                    pyrogenous rock have been forced among the gneiss and mica-slate, so as to
                    constitute dykes or irregular masses of large extent. Thus porphyry, greenstone,
                    basalt, and other crystallized rocks are found mixed with the gneiss and
                    mica-slate in various parts of the Highlands, Hebrides, and Zetlands. Of these
                    the most frequent is porphyry, which indeed forms a very large region in the
                    vicinity of Ben Nevis and Glen Coe, and is also abundant in Ben Cruachan, both
                    in great masses and in dykes variously associated with granitic veins. It is
                    perhaps not proper to describe the serpentine of Portsoy as forming dykes, for
                    its vertical masses appear conformable to those of the mica-slate, quartz-rock,
                    limestone, &amp;c. so as rather to correspond with the notion of an interposed

                    At Strontian the lead veins have been long celebrated; they range cast and west
                    and north and south: copper also occurs in the vicinity. Such veins appear still
                    less common in the mica-slate.</p><p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">clay-slate system.</hi><hi rend="italic">Geographical

                    devoid of argillaceous primary rocks; but these deposits are not at all to be
                    compared in extent with the older mica-slate and gneiss formations. If we look
                    to the continent and islands of Europe we shall find a singular reciprocity in
                    the distribution of these members of the family of primary rocks. The gneiss and
                    mica-slates of the Alps, Pyrenees, and mountain borders of Bohemia, are not
                    indeed entirely unaccompanied by such argillaceous deposits, any more than the
                    Scandinavian and Highland chains, and the north-western primary tract of
                    Ireland; but the principal masses of the clay-slate system lie apart in the Harz
                    and the Ardennes, in Brittany and Cornwall, the Welsh and the Cumbrian
                    mountains, and the ranges of the Lammermuir and Donegal; yet under all these
                    slate tracts lies the fundamental granite, and similar veins pass from it into
                    the argillaceous covering. In some parts, as in Cumberland (Skiddaw), and in the
                    Isle of Anglesea, slight traces of older rocks separate the clay-slate from the
                    granites, but the general fact appears to be that the deposition of the two
                    systems was influenced by different physical conditions related to different

                    Cumberland it would be a difficult thing to say what were the planes of
                    stratification in the Skiddaw slates, but for the assistance of the chiastolite
                    slates beneath, and the red argillaceous rocks of Derwentwater above. The planes
                    of stratification thus judged of appear to rise to the north-west toward an axis
                    passing from Caldbeck Fells south-west to Egremont. The same direction and dip
                    of strata is to be inferred from the interposed limestone beds of Coniston Water
                    Head (Bala limestone), and it is confirmed by minute examination of the
                    alternation and gradation, of the different sorts of slate.</p><p>But, certainly, on a <hi rend="italic">general view</hi> of the country, the
                    stratified structure is far from evident; so that many persons, impressed by the
                    remarkable structure called cleavage which traverses nearly in vertical planes
                    the surfaces of stratification, and the symmetrical joints which divide the rock
                    into prismatic masses almost of geometrical regularity, leave the district under
                    the impression that it is not at all stratified.</p><p>The same remarks apply to the slaty tracts of Cornwall and Wales, in which,
                    especially the latter, both cleavage planes and symmetrical joints predominate
                    over the stratification. That these structures are of later date than the
                    stratified structure, is evident when we compare primary and secondary
                    districts, for in the latter symmetrical joints pass through imbedded organic
                    remains, and through many alternating sedimentary strata.</p><p>They arc in fact superposed structures, and from what is known of the
                    introduction of similar structures into ordi nary clays and shales by the side
                    and in the vicinity of igneous rocks, independent of general considerations,
                    such as the high degree of induration of these rocks, there is little doubt that
                    the agency of heat is the general cause of these phenomena of structure.

                    porphyritic beds have been subjected to the same disturbances as the slates in
                    which they are interpolated.</p><p>The mineral veins of the Cumberland district pass generally east and west (rarely
                    north and south), and yield sulphurct, carbonate, phosphate, arseniate, &amp;c.
                    of lead; sulphurct, carbonate, arsen iate, &amp;c. of copper; ores of iron,
                    zinc, manganese, &amp;c.</p><p>Those of Cornwall and Brittany have generally east and west courses, and north
                    and south cross courses, with intermediate or quarter point veins. Ores of
                    copper, tin, lead, silver, cobalt, antimony, bismuth, &amp;c. abound in the rich
                    tract of Cornwall. Similar statements apply to Brittany. The Snowdon and
                    Cardiganshire chains yield lead and copper ores, also in east and west veins
                    principally. The Harz is also a very metalliferous range.</p><p>It appears to be true as a general rule, that it is the Snowdon series or lower
                    division of the Cambrian group which in Wales and Cumberland is the most highly
                    metalliferous. In Cornwall, the lower portions are the richest, but nowhere, we
                    believe, is the uppermost series of Plynlymmon rocks remarkably rich in metallic
                    veins; for example, the Lammermuir. the south-east of Westmoreland, Charnwood
                    Forest, the middle of Wales, part of the upper slates of Cornwall and Devon.</p><p>3. SILURIAN SYSTEM.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Geographical Extent</hi> —It is to the labours of Mr Murchison,
                    in South Wales and the bordering counties, that we are indebted for a clear
                    knowledge of the relations of this great mass of rocks, which were but partially
                    noticed, and never consistently arranged by preceding writers. It is still to
                    the district which he has worked, and specially to the counties of Hereford,
                    Radnor, Brecon, Carmarthen, and Pembroke, that we must look for the most
                    complete development of it yet made known. It does occur in Westmoreland and the
                    Craven district of Yorkshire, and probably also in the southern primary tract of
                    Ireland, between Waterford and Bantry Bay. There appears good reason to believe
                    that part of the slaty rocks and limestones of the Harz and Norway, as well as
                    the Eifel limestones, belong to it. Judging from organic remains which we have
                    seen, it appears not unlikely that large tracts in the northern parts of the
                    United States and Canada belong to this system.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Succession of Deposits and Thickness</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Mr Murchison’s views on this subject, after mature reflection, appear
                    finally to have settled into the following intelligible classification, which,
                    however, can only be considered as <hi rend="italic">locally</hi> applica∙ ble

                    are very plentiful in the Welsh, Salopian, and Dudley limestone, the same
                    species occurring also in the Eifel and partially in the Harz, Norway, Russia,

                    the west, it is found that the limestones lose their thickness and importance,
                    and the distinctions of the several groups becomes, from that and other causes,
                    less easily followed. This variation of numerical division is common to all the
                    systems of stratified rocks: it leads us to doubt the applicability of minute
                    subdivisions, however well conceived and locally exact, except for small
                    geographical areas. In searching for the continuity of such systems we may
                    conveniently follow rather such leading divisions as upper and lower Silurians,
                    though it is very probable that these will be often undistinguishable,
                    especially as the development of the limestones (which in this, as in all other
                    stratified systems, offer the most decided characters) is unequal and
                    irregular.</p><p>STRATIFICATION AND ORGANIC REMAINS.</p><p>At this stage in the series of deposited rocks, all doubts and difficulties as to
                    the fact of their complete stratification vanish entirely. In the alternation of
                    sandstones, shales, and limestones, many of them fossiliferous, the fossil
                    shells <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821718" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1718-0193"/> and Crustacea, &amp;c. differing in the different
                    groups, what do we recognise but the very same principle as that which was
                    detected by Mr Smith’s researches among the oolites of Bath? <hi rend="italic">It is this close analogy</hi> between deposits so far distant in geological
                    date as the superior primary and middle secondary rocks, which constitutes the
                    great interest of Mr Murchison’s researches. We, who have known, step by step,
                    the whole progress of his researches, claim the results as being peculiarly
                    illustrative of the modern school of geology, which in all its investigations
                    strives to detect, by a close inquiry into certain classes of phenomena among
                    rocks of different ages, the unchangeable influences of nature. But there is
                    another point of view in which the silurian system demands our especial
                    attention.</p><p>It appears highly probable that the organic remains of this ancient system are
                    sufficiently numerous to justify satisfactory inferences on points of the
                    greatest importance in the philosophy of geology.</p><p>In the first place, we must observe that these reliquiae, though perhaps
                    specifically different from those in the older limestones and other
                    fossiliferous rocks of the clay-slate system, are mostly congeneric, of
                    analogous structure, and similarly distinct lrom existing forms of life. There
                    is evidently such an agreement of mineral and organic characters between the
                    silurian and clay-slate systems, that both must be admitted to have been
                    deposited under circumstances depending on the same or very similar physical
                    conditions. That system is so linked with the mica-slate and gneiss, that the
                    whole mass of primary strata may be conceived to be the result of physical
                    conditions, gradually or periodically variable, but not suddenly interrupted. It
                    appears that, in the deposition of the subsc ystalline gneiss and mica-slate
                    rocks, mechanical agitation of the ocean was rare and slight; and that, on the
                    contrary, in the highest group of the primary strata, the sandstones and
                    conglomerates indicate frequent and considerable watery disturbance.</p><p>Nearly in the same ratio, the monuments of organic life appear and grow numerous,
                    the limestone bands become more regular and continuous, the stratification less
                    complicated by superimposed structures, and the <hi rend="italic">characters of
                    secondary strata appear.</hi></p><p>It was therefore not unphilosophical in Werner to propose for these formations,
                    and some of those already ranked in the clay-slate system, the term <hi rend="italic">Transition rocks:</hi> such in truth they are; yet the term will
                    probably fall into disuse, because the enlarged views of modern geologists have
                    led them to recognise in all the varied mass of stratified rocks, only one long,
                    though locally interrupted, series, every term of which is really <hi rend="italic">transitive,</hi> connecting the earlier and later formations. Of
                    this abundant proof will be found by every inquiring geologist.</p><p>The organic remains of the silurian system are most abundant in the limestones
                    <hi rend="italic">(e. g.</hi> Wenlock and Aymestry limestone); in
                    calcareo-argillaceous layers (&lt;?. <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Builth and
                    Llandeilo flags); or in layers of shale and sandstone associated with such
                    calcareous deposits. The same is true (in a general sense) in the secondary
                    strata, and, as far as examples can be quoted, it is also true in the lowest
                    primary strata. The remains of polypiferous zoophyta, occur almost exclusively
                    in the limestones; this is true for all the primary strata. The corals of the
                    Wenlock and Dudley limestone, and those of the contemporaneous limestone of the
                    Eifel, are aggregated in such forms as to suggest, though perhaps not to
                    establish, the notion of these rocks being in fact ancient coral reefs.
                    Crinoidea are less plentiful in these limestones than in some of later date: the
                    brachiopoda and other mollusea, and also the trilobites, occur in the
                    calcareous, argillaceous, and arenaceous rocks. Remains of fishes have been
                    observed, even abundantly, but no traces of reptiles.</p><p>The character of induration or consolidation is less remarkable in these strata,
                    than in all the rest of the primary rocks.</p><p>The sandstones are, however, seldom soft; the argillaceous beds are shaly or
                    slaty, and the limestones still subcrystalline.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Igneous rocks</hi> are associated with different parts of the
                    silurian system, under circumstances of great interest, though the geological
                    date of their irruption can seldom be determined exactly. Mr Murchison, in
                    describing them, adopts the convenient plan of referring them to their several
                    parallel anticlinal or disruptive axes, and characterizing the nature of the
                    igneous rocks and their effects upon the neighbouring strata. North of the
                    Severn, Lilleshall Hill, the Wrekin, Charlton Hill, &amp;c. mark parallel axes
                    ranging from N.E. to S.W. and piercing through beds chiefly of the Caradoc
                    rocks, the sandstones of which are converted to quartz-rocks at the point of
                    junction of the trap. The ridge of Caer Caradoc contains many varieties of
                    felspar rock, granite, and greenstone, and actynolitic amygdaloid.</p><p>On the flank of this axis of violent elevation, sandstones arc converted to
                    quartz-rocks, and particular strata occur composed of the materials of igneous
                    rocks, the origin of which the author ascribes to subsidence of volcanic matter
                    in water, and calls <hi rend="italic">volcanic sandstone.</hi></p><p>The mining district of Shelve, is an isolated tract separated from the Linley and
                    Longmynd Hills by the remarkable ridge of quartz-rock, called the Stiperstones.
                    It is made up of parallel ridges of trap and alternating depressions in the
                    lower silurian rocks. Some of these trappean rocks alternate conformably with
                    the stratified deposits, and are supposed to be of contemporaneous origin, and
                    partly of the nature of the volcanic sandstone previously noticed; others are of
                    the ordinary character of irrupted trap. Veins of lead-ore occur in the
                    greywacke, near the junction with the trap.</p><p>The Breiddin Hills are formed in ridges running from E.N∙E. to W.S.W. The
                    eastern, or chief ridge, contains compact felspar rocks, slates, porphyries,
                    greenstone, &amp;c. they burst through upper silurian rocks. The other main
                    ridge contains chiefly columnar greenstone.</p><p>The Old Radnor group contains abundance of hypersthene, and passes from this to a
                    fine grained greenstone. Near Old Radnor church, the upper silurian rocks are
                    dislocated, and bands of imperfect serpentine occur between the trap and the
                    limestone, which near the contact is wholly unstratified, crystalline, and hard;
                    the shale is also hardened to a slaty substance: coatings and nests of
                    anthracite, with minute metallic veins, appear near the junction. Other groups
                    of trap, near Builth, range from N.E. to S.W., and resemble in many respects the
                    rocks of the Shelve district. Other occurrences are noticed in Brecknockshire
                    and Caermarthenshire, and from the whole investigation, we find in the rocks
                    which have been irrupted into these silurian strata, in their effects on the
                    surrounding strata, in the alternation of pseudo-volcanic sandstones, and in the
                    mineral springs which accompany the ridges of trap, not only the usual analogies
                    to the effects of heat, but special resemblances to that form of the igneous
                    action which is exemplified in volcanos. The facts are generally of the same
                    order as those noticed among the older slates of the Lammermuir, Cumbria,
                    Snowdonia, but more exactly and definitely traceable.</p><p>The circumstance of the dependence of the metallic veins on the axis of igneous
                    rocks, in the Shelve district, is an example on a small and distinct scale of
                    what is seen in Cumberland, Snowdonia, and most of the great mountain chains of
                    Europe (of all geological ages). For it is a general truth, that metallic veins
                    abound in proportion to the proximity of the situation to axes of dislocation,
                    and irruptions of pyrogenous rock—a view first positively advanced by Μ.
                    Necker.</p><p>GENERAL VIEWS CONCERNING PRIMARY STRATA.</p><p>The primary formations have so much of parallelism to each other, so much
                    conformity of position, as to indicate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821731" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1731-0194"/> long periods
                    undisturbed by great convulsions. It is true, that among the old slates of
                    Cumberland, between the Skiddaw and Snowdon series, a red conglomerate rock
                    occurs, and seems to prove local disturbance; but this solitary exception rather
                    suggests the commencement of that volcanic agency which in the period of the
                    deposition of the Borrowdale and Langdale slates was very frequently exerted.
                    Among the silurian rocks, conglomerates also occur, and seem to imply that part
                    of the older Snowdonian and other slaty rocks were previously raised up to be
                    exposed to atmospheric action; but yet the conformity of the Silurian and
                    Plynlimmon rocks, seems to forbid the notion of any <hi rend="italic">great
                    convulsions,</hi> though it may not at all 'affect the question <hi rend="italic">of gradual elevation</hi> of part of the older rocks.</p><p>However, it is certain, that in the later part of the primary period, or perhaps
                    after its close, great and general disturbances happened, which in many parts
                    altered the aspect of the globe, by raising up large tracts of land, and
                    dividing the expanded ocean by a multitude of mountainous islands. Without
                    entering into a wide field of inexact discussion, we may dwell on some facts of
                    this nature which have come to light concerning the ancient hydrography of the
                    British islands.</p><p>It is remarked of the Grampians, that their elevated ranges no where include any
                    masses of secondary strata, though round their flanks these rocks spread very
                    widely and on all sides; they rest on die gneiss of Sutherland, mica-slate of
                    Argyleshire, chlorite slates of Perthshire, &amp;c. and in general appear in
                    such relations to the ancient rocks as to indicate that these had stood up above
                    the ocean in which the carboniferous system was afterwards formed.</p><p>In studying the Lammermuir ranges, which are composed of slaty rocks less ancient
                    than any in the Highland chains, the same old red sandstone border is found as
                    that which encircles the Grampians, and under the same relations. These
                    mountains, then, were also raised, though not to their present elevations,
                    before the commencement of the carboniferous era. Now, it is very remarkable,
                    that the Grampians and Lammermuirs are nearly parallel, both ranging nearly
                    north-east: both are prolonged (across the channeD into Ireland, the former
                    reaching Donegal, and the north-western projection of Ireland, the latter
                    entering by Donaghadee on the eastern coast of Ireland, and proceeding inland to
                    Cavan. In Ireland these prolonged ranges also shew the same independence of the
                    carboniferous deposits; and the same results apply to the southeast border of
                    the island.</p><p>Again, the same north-east range accompanies the slaty rocks of the Isle of Man,
                    and it is recognised in a very distinct manner in the insulated and romantic
                    district of the English Lakes. The axis of these slaty tracts passes northeast
                    and south-west; and the nearly circular mass of primary strata is begirt by a
                    belt of later red standstone, limestone, &amp;c., all evidently unconformed to
                    the axis of the slates. The date of one of the elevations of the Cumbrian slates
                    is thus probably fixed before the commencement of the carboniferous era.</p><p>The slaty ranges of North Wales have the same direction, north-east and
                    south-west; they are also, probably, or rather certainly, anterior in elevation
                    to the commencement of the carboniferous epoch; and, finally, the axis of the
                    Cornish and South Devon slates has the same general direction, and these rocks,
                    probably, were elevated before the deposition of the carboniferous system.</p><p>Most of these mountains have an axis of granite and other pyrogenous rocks. Thus,
                    a great number of parallel mountain ranges were produced by disturbing movements
                    within one geological period, the result being, in each case, one, or a number
                    of anticlinal axes, in each physical region, parallel to each other. It is
                    impossible not to be struck with the probability thus arising, that, in the
                    direc tion of convulsive movements, some regular laws are discoverable. In fact,
                    if we were to be satisfied with one instance, this north-east direction among so
                    many presumed contemporaneous elevations, would establish the truth of Elie du
                    Beaumont’s hypothesis, which would have us recognise, as a principle capable of
                    practical application, that parallel mountain ranges belong to the same era, and
                    the same exertion of disturbing forces. This must be, however, subjected to
                    further and more rigorous trials before it can be adopted among the admitted
                    generalizations of inductive geology.</p><p>Though it thus appears evident that many of the most marking characters of
                    British physical geography have so old a date as disturbances anterior to the
                    carboniferous system, yet, on the continent of Europe, this is by no means the
                    case; for the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathians, and Apennines, are of more recent
                    date, and, at the time when the Grampians sent streams and detritus to straits
                    where now the valleys of the Forth and Clyde meet, the greater part of Europe
                    was a wide ocean.</p><p>The state of the globe during the period of the production of the primary strata
                    may never be fully disclosed by geological inquiries, aided by higher
                    departments of knowledge: yet, as a view of the successive conditions of the
                    globe, however imperfect, constitutes the very essence of philosophical geology,
                    it is necessary to ascertain what progress has been made in this dark research
                    into some of the earliest natural records of creation. It is remarkable that the
                    lowest of all the known systems of stratified deposits should be at once the
                    most extensive, the most nearly universal, the most uniform in mineral
                    character, the only one from which organic life appears to be totally excluded,
                    and in which the character of mechanical aggregation is the most obscure. Most
                    of the circumstances are original, though the latter has been apparently
                    influenced by superposed structures, due to subsequent agencies. Can we hesitate
                    to admit that the globe was then in a condition which has never since occurred
                    to it? Does it not strike the mind as a reasonable hypothesis, that the ocean
                    was, during the period when gneiss and mica-slate were formed, unfitted, by some
                    peculiarity of condition, for the support of living beings? Such peculiarity, to
                    judge from the deposited rocks, was not of a chemical nature; for these are not
                    of a description to countenance such an opinion, on the contrary, the gradual
                    introduction of fossil exuviae in the superior strata, till at length, as we
                    ascend in the scale of rocks, they are unfolded in great abundance, seems to
                    point to some slow change of a pervading physical condition.</p><p>In accordance with the undoubted truth of the general expansion of rocks of
                    igneous origin below all the stratified masses, we naturally inquire if the
                    agency of subterranean heat is of a kind to account for the phenomena observed.
                    It is obvious that, when and wherever the supposed high subterranean temperature
                    was applied most directly to the base of the ocean, so high a temperature would
                    be maintained therein, as to be incompatible with the existence of organic
                    beings; changes would be produced upon the igneous rocks in an expanded thermal
                    (agitated) ocean, quite different from those occasioned by lateral movements in
                    later times through narrower channels of cooler water.</p><p>It does not appear improbable that a hydrothermic action, of the nature
                    suggested, may be found sufficient to account for the remarkable resemblance
                    between the (primitive) granitic, and the (derivative) gneiss rocks,—their
                    almost universal diffusion,—the singular undulated lamination, rather than
                    stratification, which belongs to so many of the older primary rocks,—and the
                    absence of organic life; while, as the form of the globe was changed by
                    subterranean disturbances, and mechanical agencies arose to importance, the sea
                    received partial. deposits from emerging lands into its contracted and variously
                    ramified basins, and the communication of heat from below was sufficiently
                    retarded<pb break="no" facs="nls:193821744" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1744-0195"/> by the intervention of solid rocks (gneiss,
                    &amp;c.) to allow, at least partially, temperatures suited to particular races
                    of animals. It appears somewhat in favour of this view that the races of animals
                    are, for the most part, very peculiar,— their association with abundance of
                    corals seems to justify a belief that they were suited to a warm climate,—and
                    the disappearance of nearly all these genera and families, after passing through
                    a few more formations and systems of strata, is at least in harmony with the
                    conditions assumed.</p><p>But this hypothesis, suggested by consideration of the phenomena, assumes quite
                    another character, when compared with deductions from the admitted fact of the
                    former igneous fluidity of the mass of the globe. From that important truth, as
                    we deem it, it seems to follow necessarily that the globe should pass through
                    many stages and changes before, in any part of the surface, the conditions could
                    be obtained, within which the Almighty Architect of the universe has seen fit to
                    restrict the exhibition of organic life. One of the most direct and important of
                    these, and the most obviously influential on mechanical, chemical, and vital
                    phenomena, is the diminution of surface temperature: this having arrived,
                    locally or generally, at a certain point, the unchangeable laws of nature
                    relating to organic life, which are but the expression of the will of God, began
                    to operate; and it is not one of the least curious of the adjustments of the
                    terrestrial creation, that the diminution of the surface temperature is limited.
                    A certain point once reached, the prescribed conditions of organic life once
                    attained, they assume a character of stability,—a regularity of effects which
                    enables a finite but intelligent being to trace them back toward their
                    origin.</p><p>SECONDARY STRATA.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Base of the Strata.—In</hi> consequence of the disturbing
                    movements already alluded to, which have broken up the primary rocks into
                    various irregular masses, and in places thrown them off entirely from granitic
                    nuclei and axes, the secondary strata have not always, nor indeed generally,
                    their surfaces parallel to those of the primary age. On the contrary, the two
                    classes of rocks are unconformed to each other; so that the same secondary
                    strata may rest in some part of their range on gneiss, in other parts on
                    clayslate or silurian rocks, or, without any such intervention, on granite,
                    according as these rocks, after the convulsive displacement of the crust of the
                    globe, formed respectively the bed of the sea.</p><p>As a general but not universal fact, it is found that in the vicinity of elevated
                    mountain masses the secondary strata are more nearly horizontal than the
                    primary; hence they were included by Wemer in his class of floetz or flatlying
                    rocks: but this classification, founded on a geological accident, is not
                    satisfactory, though in fact it agrees nearly with the modern divisions.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nature of the Secondary Strata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    They consist of three sorts of rocks, deriving their most prominent characters
                    from three particular substances, viz. Siliceous, Argillaceous, and Calcareous
                    rocks. On comparing them respectively with the corresponding forms of the
                    primary series, little if any chemical difference can be established between the
                    two classes. In the constituent minerals of the siliceous and argillaceous rocks
                    also a great, resemblance prevails. It is still quartz which constitutes the
                    great bulk of the masses. Mica interlaminates many sandstones, and felspar
                    varies the substances of others. Some clays are but a finer and more
                    argillaceous kind of sandstone, just as some clayslates are not obviously
                    distinct from an argillaceous form of mica-slate. But yet, on à close
                    comparison, we find the condition of these mineral ingredients somewhat
                    different: the grains of quartz, mica, and felspar are in fact more worn on the
                    surfaces, more broken and fragmentary in the secondary than in the primary
                    strata. Also the aggregation of them is so far different, that the influence of
                    sedimentary aggregation is extremely evident in all the secondary strata. The
                    degree of consolidation of the mass is generally much less than in the primary
                    groups; soft as well as hard sandstone, clay as well as shale, soft as well as
                    hard limestones, occur continually. And just as in the primary strata the
                    induration and subcrystalline aspect of the rocks was at a maximum in the older
                    systems, so in these the contrary characters, softness and earthiness of
                    texture, become the most conspicuous in the upper or most recent groups. ∙</p><p>Thus it is evident that the consolidation and molecular aggregations of the rock
                    masses of similar chemical and mineral nature arè dependent on general
                    influences, such as pressure and heat, whose effect would naturally be greatest
                    in the oldest rocks, because these have been not only exposed the <hi rend="italic">longest time</hi> to their influences, but also submitted to the
                    highest degrees of their action.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Succession</hi><hi rend="italic">of Secondary Strata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Three characters are employed in establishing the
                    classification of secondary strata; first, their mineral constitution; second,
                    their respective conformity or unconformity; third, the nature of their organic
                    contents; in many instances these coincide remarkably; where they differ the
                    classification is embarrassed. All the classifications, however, are to be
                    supposed only locally true; for it is already ascertained that none of even the
                    larger assemblages of secondary strata are universal or evén very general in
                    their distribution, nor very uniform in any one of their characteristics, except
                    for limited areas. The most convenient classification for the European basin is,
                    however, found to be sufficiently applicable to all the Mediterranean and
                    Transatlantic regions, part of Central Asia, and the basin of the Indus.</p><p>The British series of secondary strata is one of the most complete in Europe, and
                    sufficiently developed, even in the parts where it yields to the German type
                    (red sandstone system), to serve as a general basis of comparison. Tl e

                    Great Britain owes so much of her commercial prosperity, is extended irregularly
                    over the basin of Europe, in North America, Australia, &amp;c. It occupies large
                    breadths in Scotland, Ireland, England and Wales, and lies in patches in various
                    quarters of France, Germany, Poland, and Russia. Commonly it is found at the
                    foot or on the flanks of primary mountains which had been previously uplifted,
                    so that its stratification is not in accordance with theirs. In particular
                    regions, however, there is no such break in the continuity of deposition, but,
                    as in Herefordshire, the passage is gradual from the upper Silurian sandstones
                    and shales and limestones to the limestone, shales, and sandstone, and coal of
                    the carboniferous systems. In such a district it might be quite reasonable
                    (since the organic remains, though minutely different, are often generically
                    similar) to unite the upper primary and lower secondary rocks; but this local
                    practicability must yield to general convenience.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Succession and Thickness of the Strata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The variations in the development of the carboniferous system are
                    considerable, and its occurrence is often in detached portions: it is therefore
                    requisite for obtaining a general section, to combine the results of different
                    and independent observers. The most complete view of the lower part of the
                    system is found on the border of Wales adjoining the Silurian rocks. The middle
                    and upper portions are most fully exhibited in the north of England. There are
                    three great formations included in the carboniferous system.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Upper Formation, or Coal Measures</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    three thousand feet thick in the north of England, consisting of abundance of
                    sandstone and shales, layers of ironstone, and beds of coal. Of these are many
                    alternations, constituting a series of many nearly similar terms, usually
                    containing at least the three substances,—coal, sandstone, and shale. Scarcely
                    any limestone occurs in this upper coal-measure series. One bed is, however,
                    found in the Yorkshire coal-field, containing <hi rend="italic">marine
                    shells,</hi> while in all the restofthestratanothingbutfresh-water and
                    terrestrial exuviae occur. A limestone bed with estuary shells is found in
                    Shropshire, and near Manchester.</p><p>The coal seams, twenty or thirty in number, amount in all to a thickness of about
                    sixty feet, in a mass of shales and sandstones at least 3000 feet. Nearly the
                    same thickness of coal occurs in the coal-fields of Newcastle, South Wales,
                    &amp;c. though the earthy substances enclosing the vegetable products vary in
                    nature and thickness. The thickest coal-seams in Staffordshire and Ayrshire, ten
                    or fifteen yards, are in fact composed of many beds of different qualities
                    aggregated together. The quality of coal is partly dependent on the plants of
                    which it was Originally composed, and partly on subsequent changes produced by
                    subterranean movements, effects of heat, &amp;c. The principal differences arise
                    from the variable quantity of gaseous matter. In the stone coal (blind coal or
                    culm) of South Wales, Kilkenny, and Virginia, which burns like coke, there is
                    little or nothing but carbon and earthy admixtures. The box or cannel coal of
                    Lancashire and Yorkshire, which blazes like a candle, contains nearly half of
                    its weight of gaseous matter. There is but little coal, and that in the lower
                    part of tho,series, in Ireland.</p><p>The ironstones of a coal district lie generally in layers of nodules, each
                    frequently enclosing a leaf or shell, or some other nucleus of molecular
                    attraction.</p><p>The shales are bituminous or sandy; the sandstones laminated or massive,
                    micaceous, argillaceous, subcalcareous, 01 felspathic, very rarely of a red
                    colour, though blue, yel low, brown, white, and other tints prevail. Chalybeate

                    The whole series undergoes great changes, so as to afford northern and southern
                    types applicable to all parts of the mountain limestone formation yet known in
                    Europe.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Southern Type,</hi> complete in Derbyshire and the south of
                    Yorkshire, is composed of three terms, viz.—</p><p>Upper Term.—Millstone grit, a coarse sandstone, in one, two, or three masses,
                    with shales and bad coal.</p><p>Middle Term.—(Limestone shale), a thick mass of bituminous shale, in which
                    locally black limestone bands and nodules of ironstone occur.</p><p>Lower Term—Limestone of Derbyshire (Lower Scar limestone of Sedgwick and
                    Phillips), a great mass of calcareous rocks almost entirely free from arenaceous
                    and argillaceous admixture.</p><p>To this type all the south of England mountain limestones, as well as those of
                    Ireland, Belgium, Dusseldorf, and Silesia are to be referred.</p><p>In the <hi rend="italic">Northern Type</hi> the same three terms are com- '
                    pounded and otherwise varied.</p><p>The upper group is composed of three millstone grit rocks, alternating with
                    shales, laminated sandstones, coal seams, ironstones, chert beds, and thin
                    limestones.</p><p>The middle group consists of shales alternating with sandstones mostly laminated,
                    ironstones, coal seams, chert beds, and five or more limestone rocks, each from
                    ten to eighty feet thick. (The name of Yoredale rocks is given to this group in
                    Yorkshire.)</p><p>The lower group consists of limestone, alternating with shales and some
                    sandstones, coals, &amp;c.</p><p>To this type belong all the Northumberland limestones, and those of the basins of
                    the Forth and Clyde. The limestone of Burdichouse, near Edinburgh, is maintained
                    by Dr Hibbert to be of fresh-water origin.</p><p>The lower part of the group, round the Cumbrian mountains, and along the Penine
                    escarpments, from Brough to Brampton, contains alternating red sandstone beds,
                    thus constituting a real transition to the next or old red sandstone
                    formation.</p><p>The old red sandstone formation varies in its character so as to offer little
                    that is really of general application except its colour, and the absence of cod,
                    and rarity of limestone. Along the flanks of the Grampian, Lammermuir, and
                    Cumbrian mountains, it is chiefly a rude conglomerate of pebbles torn by violent
                    floods from the neighbouring high ground; but on the borders of the Welsh slates
                    it is a complicated mass of arenaceous, calcareous, and argillaceous strata,
                    graduating to the upper Silurian system. Mr Murchison has thus classed the beds
                    10,000 feet in thickness, which he ascribes to the old red sandstone of the
                    Welsh border :—</p><p>Upper part.—Red quartzose conglomerate, overlying thick bedded sandstone.
                    (Without organic remains.)</p><p>Middle part.—Red and green (mottled) concretionary limestones, with spotted
                    argillaceous marls and beds of sandstone. (Singular fishes, Cephalaspis of
                    Agassiz.)</p><p>Lower part—Flaggy, highly micaceous, red and green sandstone. (With shells.)</p><p>In the Geology of Yorkshire, vol. ii. is the following conspectus of the whole
                    carboniferous group :—</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193821770" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1770-0197"/><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="2" role="data" rows="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>North of England and Scotland.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Derbyshire, North and south wales.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Belgium and South of England.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Ireland.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Coal Formation</hi></p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p><hi rend="italic">t</hi></p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Coal, shale, grit, and ( ironstone )</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Coal, shale, grit, and í ironstone .

                    successive deposition; laminae, beds, strata, whole rocks, and groups of rocks,
                    are here seen to be generally parallel. It is, however, very true, that in each
                    kind of rock the phenomena indicative of successive deposition are so far
                    different as to admit of definition. The argillaceous members are universally
                    laminated, but it is rare to see the laminae aggregated into beds. In a
                    thickness of a few hundred feet, are many thousand laminae, but <hi rend="italic">no real beds</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in a mass of limestone,
                    forty to eighty feet, are <hi rend="italic">no laminae,</hi> but many beds; in
                    micaceous sandstone, are both laminae, and beds; and in some block sandstones
                    are oblique laminae and irregular oblique or waving beds. Does not this shew the
                    imperfection of the nomenclature commonly used, which confounds all those
                    various <hi rend="italic">structures of deposition</hi> under one vague term of
                    stratification? Yet, on the other hand, how full of instruction are those
                    different phenomena: are we not clearly informed by them of the different
                    conditions of the aggregation of the different chemical substances? Is it not
                    apparent that the deposition of the argillaceous beds was subject to only minute
                    and short interruptions; that the limestone rocks were formed at intervals; and
                    the sandstones accumulated with much irregularity?</p><p>The deposition of limestone is of an oceanic character; its maximum thickness and
                    purity is in one direction, while that of the arenaceous and argillaceous rocks
                    lies in another, and marks the agitation of the sea along its ancient shores,
                    where rivers and inundations brought sediments to be swept away by the tides and
                    currents.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The organic remains</hi> of the carboniferous system are
                    extremely numerous: upwards of four hundred species of animal exuviae have been
                    figured from the mountain limestone alone; probably 200 species of plants belong
                    to the coal measures, and it is certain that in both these formations
                    considerable additions will yet be made: a few remain to be added from the old
                    sandstone. The following short summary of British species is all that our limits

                    investigated. In the Geology of Yorkshire, vol. ii. it is shown, from
                    eighty-five observations in the carboniferous system, that in the mountain
                    limestone and coal tracts of Yorkshire, the <hi rend="italic">long joints</hi>
                    affect certain principal directions, so that two positive axes in which these
                    divisional planes are most frequent, are traced at right angles to one another;
                    and two negative axes in which <hi rend="italic">no</hi> long joints have been
                    observed, also at right angles to each other. The axes of frequent joints run
                    N.N.W. and S.S.E., and E.N.E. and W.S.W.; the negative axes are N.E. by N., and
                    N.W. by W. This singular result of observation harmonizes with the principal
                    directions of mineral veins in the district bordering on the great Crossfell and
                    Craven faults; it also bears a close analogy with the deductions from mechanical
                    theory of Mr Hopkins, (Cambridge Trans. 1836), as to the production of planes of
                    fissure at right angles to each other, in cases of continuous pressure being
                    applied to large areas of the earth’s lamellar crust.</p><p>The directions above named of the positive axes, obtain in newer strata (oolitic
                    and red sandstone systems), and in situations at great distances from the Penine
                    faults, and it appears probable that the joint planes are due to extremely
                    general agency.</p><p>These researches should be followed up in other districts, and in other systems
                    of strata. The following table is extracted from the work above named, and it

occurrence in the
                    carboniferous system of the British islands, especially in the northern parts bf
                    England and southern parts of Scotland. It is very deserving of attention, that
                    they are principally of the augitic and hornblendic family of igneous rocks.
                    Greenstones and basalts are the prevalent rocks which lie in interposed beds, or
                    fissures in the stratified limestones, shales, and limestones.</p><p>While among the slates of Cumberland and the Lammermuir prophyritic rocks of many
                    kinds abound, the coal-measures and limestone rocks, not far removed, have only
                    basaltic or greenstone masses mixed with them.</p><p>The porphyry of the Cheviot and some other points along the Tweed, may indeed be
                    ranked as exceptions. In Northumberland, Cumberland, and the northern part of
                    Yorkshire, a stratiform mass of greenstone and basalt (whin silD is interposed
                    in the midst of the limestone series, apparently originating in several
                    submarine lava currents. In Derbyshire, a somewhat analogous rock (“toadstone” )
                    interlaminates the limestone; in the Clee Hill, a mass of basalt (“jewstone”)
                    has overflowed the coal. More commonly, through all the coal-field of Durham and
                    Newcastle, and not unfrequently in the coal-basins of Scotland, rocks of the
                    same kind have been injected in the fluid state into open fissures of the
                    sandstones and shales, constituting whindykes. At the point of contact of these
                    crystallized rocks with the coal, the latter is converted to coke (North of
                    England), or to anthracite (Old Cumnock); earthy limestone is converted to
                    crystalline (Teesdale); shale and sandstone are hardened to jasper (Salisbury
                    Crags, &amp;c.); garnets are generated in the shales of Teesdale. It is worthy
                    of remark, that the <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> whin-dykes ’ of the North of
                    England are often <hi rend="italic">unaccompanied by dislocation.</hi></p><p>Mineral veins abound in particular parts of the carboniferous rocks, chiefly in
                    the limestone districts, and near to some considerable dislocations or axes of
                    distinct elevation. Scarcely a single mine in the British islands is worked in
                    the old red sandstone, or true coal-measures; very few are established in
                    districts which, like a large part of the Irish limestone, are removed from axes
                    and centres of disturbance. But the dislocated mountain limestone of Cumberland,
                    Durham, Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Flintshire, Mendip, and South Wales, and
                    partially that of Belgium and Silesia, is characterized by prevalence of veins
                    of lead, copper, calamine, and oxide of iron. There is seldom found in these
                    districts the same great variety of metallic ores as in the older primary
                    tracts; the vein stuff (matrix of the ore) differs according to
                    locality—fluor-spar abounds in the mines of Aldstone Moor, &amp;c.—carbonate of
                    barytes in Derbyshire. It is seldom that the same mining districts, almost never
                    the same veins, yield copper and lead in abundance. One might venture to say,
                    there is a peculiar elective attraction between sulphuret of lead and limestone
                    rock; and this idea, followed too far, leads to the doctrine of the metallic
                    contents being secreted from the bordering rocks. The materials of the veins
                    seem indeed in many instances to have been transferred by (electric) currents
                    through solid substances, but they are really diffused <hi rend="italic">from</hi> the veins into cavities of the neighbouring rocks, not collected from
                    these <hi rend="italic">into</hi> the vein fissures.</p><p>Most of the veins of fissure are accompanied by dislocations (“faults”),
                    sometimes to the extent of several hundred feet, sometimes only a few inches.
                    They pass through the stratiform basalt of Northumberland and Yorkshire, and <hi rend="italic">yield ore in it abundantly</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    though the toadstone of Derbyshire does not, as was once imagined,· “cut the
                    veins off,” they are only feebly traced through it. But this circumstance is not
                    peculiar to the igneous rocks; often, and perhaps generally, the veins in a
                    limestone district are greatly contracted (“nipped”) and unproductive at
                    theplaces where they divide the shales, and grow wider and more prolific in the
                    limestones and thick gritstones. Pipe veins are of less frequent occurrence and
                    inferior interest. Ecton is one of the most remarkable of these.</p><p>The same phenomena of some veins crossing and cutting through others occur in
                    this district as in the older strata, and the same tendencies to peculiar
                    directions are recognised; the bearing veins running generally east north-east,
                    or nearly so, and the cross courses north by west, in the north of England and
                    Flintshire.</p><p>DISTURBANCES OF THE CARBONIFEROUS SYSTEM.</p><p>After the deposition of this system, and before at least any considerable
                    proportion of the superjacent rocks was formed, very extensive displacement
                    happened in most parts of the surface of the globe where the carboniferous rocks
                    had been deposited. Not that such displacements were limited in geographical
                    extent to the area of this system; on the contrary, from there hardly being a
                    known coal tract exempt from this influence, it would appear that convulsive
                    movements took place of a very general description, so as to affect very large
                    tracts of the surface of the globe. In the British islands, every coal district
                    is disturbed and shaken in every square mile of its breadth by faults (“gauls,
                    slips, troubles, and dykes”), passing in many directions, some of them having a
                    great amount of “throw,” and consequently affecting the working of the mines.
                    But these minor effects, though on some accounts very interesting, lose their
                    importance when we contemplate the gigantic disruption of Tynedale, the Penine
                    chain, the Craven fault, the Derbyshire elevation, the fault of the vale of
                    Clwydd, the double synclinal axis of the coal-fields of South Wales, and the
                    parallel one of Namur. The Penine disruptions, ranked by De Beaumont under the
                    title of the System of the North of England, are on a magnificent scale. Three
                    principal lines compose this great system—the northern branch ranges along
                    Tynedale from Brampton to the sea fifty miles, bending more than once <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821796" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1796-0199"/>
                    from its average recticlinal course to the east by north; the southern branch
                    passes in a straight line to the eastsouth-east thirty miles, and the two are
                    connected by a line of fault, whose mean direction is nearly north and south,
                    but it has three several courses in a length of fifty miles. The Craven, or
                    southern branch of the system, is a double fault; the Penine line is partly an
                    anticlinal and partly a fault; the Tynedale branch is one great fault. With
                    reference to a point in the middle of the area, enclosed by their dislocation,
                    their effect is everywhere similar, viz. a mighty depression of all the exterior
                    country. North of the Tynedale fault, is a depression or throw of 1000 to 2000
                    feet; west of the Penine fault, 2000 or 3000, or perhaps 4000 feet under
                    Crossfell; and south of the Craven fault 3000 feet at least under
                    Ingleborough.</p><p>There is no direct connexion between this great Penine system of faults, and the
                    elevation of Derbyshire; between them is a singular system of anticlinal
                    elevations and synclinal depressions, all chiefly ranging north-east, or
                    northeast by east, from the Craven fault, right toward the more ancient but
                    parallel anticlinals of South Wales. Before, however, reaching these lofty
                    chains·, a transverse break, almost exactly similar to the Crossfell fault,
                    ranging north north-west, along the vale of Clwydd (which is a miniature copy of
                    the vale of Eden), stops the Ribblesdale system of anticlinals in the
                    south-west, just as the Craven fault, ranging west north-west, has stopped them
                    on the north-east. It is from nearly the middle of the Ribblesdale faults that
                    an anticlinal ridge, ranging south south-east, passes along the western border
                    of Yorkshire and continues into Derbyshire, on the southern side of which county
                    it is apparently cut off by an east and west faμlt.</p><p>Charnwood Forest is an elevation of slate rocks (on an axis of sienitic rocks),
                    and the date of its elevation is posterior to the limestone and coal-field of
                    Ashby, but anterior to the new red sandstone system, which is seen to lie level
                    over its vertical and broken slates. The other central coal-fields of
                    Warwickshire, Staffordshire, and Shropshire, were dislocated at about the same
                    or perhaps somewhat later period, for the magnesian conglomerate is disturbed by
                    the faults of the Coalbrookdale-field. From this field to the Malvern Hills, a
                    great north and south axis of violent elevation occurs, which in places actually
                    overthrows the strata (Murchison in Geol. Soc. Abstracts), and others proceed
                    south-west, parallel to Wenlock Edge, till they reach the vale of the Towey.</p><p>Here a new axis of dislocation becomes predominant, that of the South Wales
                    coal-field, which runs east and west from St David’s in Pembrokeshire, through
                    the counties of Caermarthen, Glamorgan, and Monmouth, and may be considered to
                    continue into the Mendip Hills and Somersetshire. Parallel to this, and in fact
                    in the line of its prolongation to the east, is the coeval disturbance of the
                    coal from near Boulogne through Belgium and Westphalia, and in the south of
                    Ireland. A parallel but perhaps earlier disturbance ranges along the northern
                    boundary of the greywacke region.</p><p>It would be impossible here to investigate all the bearings of the mass of
                    evidence furnished by these variously directed dislocations, on the dynamical
                    principles of geology, but they are too important to be overlooked. We may,
                    however, observe, that dislocations of different dates are thus shewn to be
                    parallel, while others presumed to be coeval range in different directions.</p><p>STATE OF THE GLOBE DURING THE CARBONIFEROUS</p><p>PERIOD.</p><p>Recollecting the proof already given of the partial elevation of our present dry
                    land, we shall be prepared for considering the nature of the new conditions
                    introduced into the geological formula, by this circumstance, and the variation
                    of surface temperature, already concluded to be admissible as a geological
                    cause. The Grampians and other mountain chains being raised above the sea, and
                    shore and deep sea currents established, we shall not be surprised to find the
                    traces of mechanical movement in the ocean suddenly grow very strong and
                    extensive. We find, in fact, round all the mountain ranges, which for other
                    reasons were presumed to have been uplifted before the carboniferous epoch
                    began, some of the most remarkable conglomerate rocks which occur in the British
                    strata. The character of these conglomerates, too, varies in direct relation to
                    the proximity of the mountains·. The composition of the red conglomerates of the
                    Grampian borders reminds us continually of the rocks of the Highlands; those
                    which surround the Lammermuir Hills are full of pebbles derived from these
                    mountains (Boué); those which border the Cumbrian group contain pebbles of the
                    neighbouring rocks.</p><p>What is the cause of the universal red colour of these ancient sediments, is
                    already felt to be an important problem, for it appears connected with absence
                    of organic exuviae in more than one instance. Shall we say that the local
                    accumulation of the old red conglomerates was a consequence of the local
                    elevation of the primary strata from the bed of the sea?</p><p>During the course of the carboniferous period the sediments of the sea underwent
                    a total change, for red sandstones and clays are scarcely seen (except locally)
                    among the coal-measures, or in the upper parts of the mountain-limestone series.
                    Shall we say that the dark shales and variously coloured grits came from regions
                    in different directions? The great quantities of those sediments imply,
                    probably, some great physical changes of land and water in situations not far
                    removed. The alternation of these deposits marks periods of intermitting action,
                    and the circumstance of the prevalent association of terrestrial exuviae in
                    these, but not in other strata, seems to instruct us that the earthy and
                    vegetable materials were swept down from the land by some such means as a great
                    river or periodical inundation. If so, the origin of coal and that of the
                    accompanying characteristic rocks (or “coal-measures”) is understood, the
                    regular thickness and extension of the strata of coal are ascribable to the
                    watery, agitation, which at once permitted the association of similar earthy
                    particles into shale and sandstone respectively, and collected the vegetable
                    masses into layers. De Luc’s notion of the origin of coal from submerged peat
                    beds is too limited and encumbered with inextricable difficulties to be ever
                    adopted as a general doctrine, nor can the minor analogies observed between the

                    the vertical trees, and (often imaginary) roots and branches, be held at all con

                    as that just named; when we try to apply it to a case like a north of England
                    coal-field, with its numerous parallel seams of coal, ironstone, &amp;c. for
                    every one of which seams the land must first have been dried and covered with
                    soil, then submerged to receive oceanic sediments; no fault, no want of
                    conformity in the stratification, no unusual violence of water being in any case
                    observable to justify the hypothesis of rising and falling land? Again, will it
                    be supported for a moment in a country where limestone, shale, gritstone, coal,
                    are repeated many times (as in the dales of the north of England); yet where the
                    gritsand shales vanish, every trace of coal also disappears? If there be <hi rend="italic">any</hi> truth in the hypothesis, coal should be found in the
                    midst of the limestone as well as enclosed in gritstope or shale; some
                    independent proof should be given of the rising and sinking being limited to
                    certain tracts; or some <hi rend="italic">reason</hi> assigned for the
                    dependence of coal on the occurrence of such sedimentary rocks.</p><p>It is evident that the general arguments must prevail, and the condition of the
                    plants which compose the coal, the general absence of roots, the fragmentary
                    state of the stems and branches, the dispersed condition of the separable<pb break="no" facs="nls:193821809" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1809-0200"/>
                    organs, the splitting and reunion of coal beds, all the phenomena, in fact,
                    really general, confirm the conclusion that the plants whereof coal consists
                    were swept down from the land on which they grew by watery currents, often
                    repeated, and deposited in basins or large estuaries of the sea, or, perhaps
                    rarely, in lakes of fresh water. The alternation of a bed of marine limestone in
                    the Yorkshire coalfield, and perhaps the broad layers of bivalve shells (Unio),
                    which appear sometimes in positions indicating that they lived and died where
                    they are now found, shew an estuary deposit liable to temporary predominance of
                    salt water. In the coal-fields of Shropshire and Manchester, the supposed
                    fresh-water limestone may perhaps be ascribed to the influx of a river, and
                    other coal deposits probably have happened in the deep sea at intervals during
                    the accumulation of limestone.</p><p>What, then, were the circumstances of the dry land favourable to the growth of
                    the enormous mass of vegetable substance which is buried in the coal formation?
                    That the atmosphere was warmer, and, by consequence, moister, may be easily
                    admitted, and in fact what is known of the structure of the plants goes to
                    confirm this opinion; for the most abundant forms are at least analogous to
                    tropical vegetation. But in addition, it has been conjectured that the
                    atmosphere might in those early periods have an unusual dose of carbonic acid
                    gas, and thus be more fit to supply the carbon requisite for the growth of such
                    vast forests as then must have encumbered the limited surface of the land. This
                    speculation of Brongniart appears worthy of attention; nothing known to the
                    chemist or natural philosopher is opposed to the notion that the quantity of
                    carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere may be extremely variable; it would not
                    indeed be favourable to the life of animals, but <hi rend="italic">what proof
                    have we of the globe being then tenanted by terrestrial animals?</hi> Moreover,
                    speculation apart, let any one calculate the quantity of carbon contained in a
                    single English coal-field, once a part of the living structure of plants, and
                    add the equivalent volume of carbonic acid gas to that small quantity which it
                    now holds, the consequence will be an atmosphere charged with this pabulum of
                    vegetable life, to a degree perhaps very favourable to the growth of plants, but
                    certainly detrimental to the life of animals breathing by lungs. Now, surely, it
                    is worthy of attention, that <hi rend="italic">after the coal was
                    deposited,</hi> reptile life began to be manifested, and finally, to
                    predominate; while, on the other hand, vegetable life, though the land was much
                    more extensive and apparently not much lowered in temperature, never yielded
                    again such thick and extensive carbonaceous deposits.</p><p>From the nature of its numerous organic contents, as well as from the texture and
                    composition of its masses, there is no doubt of the mountain limestone being
                    truly an oceanic deposit, diminishing and growing debased toward the shores, but
                    accumulating in masses of greater purity toward the deeper seas. It appears to
                    have been a chemical precipitate, more or less tranquilly produced; and if we
                    may venture here to combine the facts known concerning the primary and secondary
                    limestone, it will appear the most probable inference, that a slow decomposition
                    of the oceanic waters, partly by organic, partly by chemical action, is the true
                    cause of the production of marine limestone.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">new</hi> RED SANDSTONE SYSTEM.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Geographical Extent.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The

                    land, belonging to the uplifted carboniferous rocks, was perhaps not fully
                    filled by the next succeeding deposit of sandstones, clays, and limestone, which
                    receives the name of Red Sandstone, or Saliferous or Poecilitic formation, but
                    it is very extensively diffused in and beyond this area. It occurs in Ireland,
                    but not abundantly, and only in the north eastern part, which may be viewed as a
                    dismemberment from the Lam-</p><p>mermuir district of Scotland. In Arran, and on the west coast of Ayrshire, on the
                    south side of the Lammermuirs, round Dumfries and Longtowh, is a large tract of
                    these rocks, spreading into the plain of Carlisle, the vale of Eden, and against
                    the west face of the Cumbrian mountain limestone. Small detached parts occur
                    farther south on the same side of the Lake district, and still smaller on the
                    east, about Kirby Lonsdale.</p><p>But the greatest expansion of these rocks in England begins in Durham, about the
                    mouth of the Tees, spreads southward in a narrow tract along the vale of York to
                    Nottingham; then opens at once into the wide central plain of England, and
                    occupies the whole breadth from the carboniferous tract of Lancashire, North
                    Staffordshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, to Shrewsbury and Worcester, to
                    Leicester and Shipston; then following the Severn to Bristol, it turns to the
                    west along the south face of the South Wales coal-field, and is, interruptedly,
                    continued south from the Bath Avon to the month of the Exe.</p><p>On the continent of Europe it occupies some space on the left bank of the Rhine
                    in the district south of the Ardennes, and parallel to the Vosges; but on the
                    right bank it is expanded over larger breadths in Wurtemberg, and occupies a
                    great part of that enormous area included between Basle, Amberg, Leipzig, and
                    Minden.</p><p>Almost universally it fills a low or level country, out of which arise insulated
                    groups and short ranges of mountains of older strata or pyrogenous rocks. Such
                    are Charnwoód Forest, and the central coal-fields of England; the Vosges,
                    Schwarzwald, Thuringerwald, Odenwald, Harz, &amp;c., in Germany. Its highest
                    point in England does not much exceed 800 feet above the sea.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Succession of Strata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This system
                    consists of many alternations of arenaceous and argillaceous members, with some
                    less continuous interpositions of limestone, usually impregnated with magnesia.
                    The best types of the system are those of Germany, the south-east of France, and
                    north of England. The most complete in all respects is that of Germany; but it
                    will be convenient to describe the English series, and afterwards to present a
                    general conspectus of the whole. It is to Professor Sedgwick (on Magnesian
                    Limestone, Geol. Trans.) that we owe the most successful classification for
                    England; and the labours of Voltz, Elie de Beaumont, &amp;c., have ascertained
                    all that is required for drawing the lines of geological contemporaneity between
                    England and Germany.</p><p>Upper red sandstone formation.—Consisting of variegated red, white, and other

                    magnesian limestone formation. It is of little importance, however, whether we
                    conceive the whole system to be but one formation, or divide it into two or
                    three. On the western side of the north of England (Plain of Carlisle), the
                    upper red sandstone retains its usual character; the magnesian limestone is
                    represented<pb break="no" facs="nls:193821822" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1822-0201"/> by a calcareous conglomerate. Further south near
                    Manchester, red and greenish marls and concretionary limestones, both
                    fossiliferous, divide the upper from the lower red sandstones. In the centre of
                    England (Cheshire, Worcestershire) salt rocks and springs occur. In all the
                    southern districts (Shropshire, Gloucestershire, Somersetshire), a calcareous
                    conglomerate represents the magnesian limestone, and the lower red sandstone is
                    only locally seen. In the district south of the Ardennes, and along the Vosges,
                    there is no magnesian limestones, but in the midst of the variegated marls, lies
                    a thick limestone rock (muschelkalk), in some respects comparable to the upper
                    laminated limestone of the north of England, but containing many and different
                    organic remains. In the variegated clays above the muschelkalk, is a thin bed of
                    magnesian limestone; with this series of variegated clays is associated a
                    variety of sandstones locally rich in plants, the whole group being in France
                    called <sic>“</sic>marnes irisees,’ in Germany, ‘keuper’.) The red grit of the
                    Vosges (Grès Vosgien, Volz) is rather a local rock peculiar to that district,
                    than a part of the lower red sandstone, which does, however, occur there beneath
                    it. But in the Thuringerwald and north east of Germany, in addition to these, we
                    have limestones corresponding to the upper and lower magnesian limestone,
                    gypseous marl, and marl-slates of England, under the general name of Zechstein.
                    Thus the whole is capable of being represented in one formula, which is well
                    calculated to shew both the agreements and differences usually observed in
                    comparing distant parts of a stratified formation.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>North-east of Germany.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>The Yosges.</p></cell><cell cols="2" role="data" rows="1"><p>South of England.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>North of England.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Keuper sandstones ) and marls. j</p><p>Muschelkalk.</p><p>Bunter

                    Germany, where the muschelkalk is quite as saliferous as* the variegated marls,
                    to which apparently salt is confined in England. Upon the whole, then, this red
                    sandstone system is a vast mass of sandy and argillaceous sediments of a
                    peculiar aspect, accompanied more than any others yet known by salt and
                    gypsum,—generally deficient in organic remains, and only locally inclosing
                    strata of limestone, which commonly are characterised by abundance of
                    magnesia.</p><p>In the north of Germany the lower beds of it seem decidedly related to the coal
                    deposits, (as also happens in the north of England); in fact, the coal is
                    supposed by Hoffman to be only a local product in a vast mass of red rocks,
                    including the whole series of the old red and new red rocks. Nearly the same
                    thing takes place in Arran where the diminished carboniferous system is merely a
                    parting in the enormous thickness of red clays, sandstones, and conglomerates.
                    Thus, it is evident that our best classifications of the series of stratified
                    deposits can only be locally exact, and authors of such arrangements must be
                    prepared to see them rejected, as in many cases inapplicable or very
                    inconvenient.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Stratification.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The same laws of
                    phenomena on this subject obtain in the red sandstone as in the carboniferous
                    system; the argillaceous masses are laminated, often composed of alternating
                    white, greenish, and red layers; the sandstones when very fine arc also, in
                    general, thinly bedded; where very coarse they are in ruder and less regular
                    layers; where pebbles and sand are mixed (Nottingham Castle), the layers are
                    oblique in various directions, like the heaps of detritus left by rapid rivers
                    or other sudden violence of water. The limestone beds, if argillaceous, are
                    thinly bedded; if magnesian, they are often thicker, less regular, full of
                    sparry geodes, and strings and veins of carbonate of lime. These magnesian rocks
                    are also often very concretionary, sometimes oolitic, in particular parts (Mans*
                    field, Nottinghamshire) composed of real crystals of the double carbonate of
                    lime and magnesia. Some beds have a conglomerate character, and in such,
                    generally, stratification is almost imaginary, and the joints which pass through
                    the other beds, lose themselves without penetrating this. (Shields and

                    fishes have been discovered in that of Ireland. (Report of Proceedings of

                    white marl, and calcareous bands near Manchester. On the eastern side of the
                    island the lower magnesian limestone is nowhere entirely destitute of shells and
                    zoophytes, which have often a great analogy to those of the carboniferous rocks:
                    the upper laminated rock has also a few shells, the lower red sandstone many

                    mixture alluded to takes place near Exeter; it appears a natural supposition
                    that, in the confined accumulation of the red conglomerate from the action of
                    violent water-currents, consequent on local displacements of the crust of the
                    globe which followed the deposition of the coal-measures, some of the broken
                    masses of igneous rocks should be retained among the materials then aggregated.
                    In fact, the country was dislocated near the conglomerate of Exeter; and Mr de
                    la Beche notices circumstances tending <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821835" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1835-0202"/> to shew that
                    the porphyritic eruptions did happen, and sometimes overflowed parts of the
                    conglomerate while it was in process of accumulation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proceedings of Geological
                    Society,</hi> 1834.</p></note></p><p>On the east side of the Harz the red sandstones and marls (of the Rotheliegende
                    rest on a porphyritic conglomerate, of which the porphyritic fragments are not
                    always similar to the nearest quartz porphyry of Saal, often being larger in
                    proportion to the distance therefrom. This conglomerate is regular and widely
                    expanded, and none of the other beds of the red formation contain such porphyry
                    pebbles. (Von Dechen).</p><p>Thus, it appears certain that the detritus of igneous rocks (generated, it
                    appears, in Devonshire at the same era) furnished the materials of the lower
                    beds of the Roth cliegen de; and we may perhaps hereafter be able to form a
                    conception as to the extent to which igneous eruptions, and wasted igneous
                    rocks, may have modified the characters of the deposition of the whole system,
                    which, in mineral, structural, and organic characters, offers much that is
                    worthy of notice, and very alluring to imprudent theorists.</p><p>Metallic veins are, in England, very rarely heard of in the rocks, nowhere
                    worked. Lead veins occur in the marlslate near North Shields,—in the
                    magnesian-limestone at Nosterfield, and Warmsworth, Yorkshire, and Barlborough
                    Derbyshire; carbonate of copper is found at Farnhill near Knaresborough, Newton
                    Kyme near Tadcaster, andWarms-worth; cobalt is found in Alderley Edge,
                    Cheshire.</p><p>In Germany the slate-beds, which are the equivalent of the marl-slate, are loaded
                    with copper about the Harz Mountains, and contain fishes. They receive the name
                    of kupferschiefer.</p><p>DISTURBANCES OF THE RED SANDSTONE SYSTEM.</p><p>The most remarkable example is on the eastern face of the Vosges Mountains, where
                    the upper beds of the system lie at the foot of great precipices of the Gres
                    Vosgien. In England almost nothing of this kind is observable. The magnesian
                    limestone is divided and dislocated by some of the faults and basaltic dykes
                    which traverse the coal of the Newcastle district. One of the anticlinal lines
                    west of Shrewsbury, which ranges from west south-west to east north-east,
                    through the Breiddin Hills, has been noticed by Mr Murchison as continuing in a
                    narrow course through the red sandstone of the plain of Shrewsbury, and
                    directing itself toward the elevated coal and gritstone hills near Cheadle. The
                    red sandstone along this line (at points fifteen or thirty miles from the
                    Breiddin), is thrown into angular positions, altered and impregnated with
                    metallic substances; and dykes of trap occur at Acton Reynolds. The most curious
                    inference on the subject is, that the same line has been the locus of the
                    igneous eruption and disturbing movement during the Silurian, carboniferous, and
                    red sandstone eras, a conclusion singularly at variance with the literal
                    statement of De Beaumont’s hypothesis, though, as being a solitary instance, it
                    ought not to be too much insisted on. It appears from the same author and Mr
                    Prestwich, that some of the most considerable dislocations of the border of the
                    coal-fields of Coalbrookdale and Dudley happened after the deposition of a part
                    of the new red sandstone; but it is certain that those of Sommersetshire and
                    Gloucestershire were completed before the date of that rock.</p><p>STATE OF THE GLOBE DURING THE FORMATION OF THE NEW RED SANDSTONES.</p><p>The greater extent of land, as indicated by the uplifting of many portions of the
                    coal deposit, might have been ex pected to have caused greater local varieties
                    in the composition of this system than we find. In fact, as a general rule, the
                    traces of terrestrial admixture in the red sandstone deposits are remarkable,
                    and unusually few. The shells and other organic exuviae are marine; and it is
                    only in a few places round particular mountain ranges (the Black Forest
                    especially), that the remains of land plants and reptiles are at all prevalent.
                    Several reasons might be adduced to justify an opinion, that the time occupied
                    in the production of the whole system was comparatively short,— such as the
                    general uniformity of its composition, the deficiency (except in limited
                    regions) of limestones; the peculiar chemical and mineral character of these
                    limestones; the general paucity of organic remains; the frequency of
                    conglomerates and local admixture of fragments of igneous rocks,—all these
                    circumstances seem to indicate the predominance of an unusual series of
                    agencies.</p><p>A notion has gradually been spreading, though it has perhaps not been distinctly
                    announced, that many of these circumstances are the result of temporary volcanic
                    excitement consequent upon the deposition of the coal-measures; but it is
                    difficult to collect adequate reasons from the vague data at present known, for
                    clothing this suggestion with the substantial character of a probable
                    inference.</p><p>Concerning climate and other circumstances, the evidence from remains is of
                    little value further than their analogy with those of the carboniferous system
                    leads to the impression that no remarkable changes had occurred in this
                    respect.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">oolitic system.</hi><hi rend="italic">Geographical
                    Extent.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In the British islands, and, we may add,
                    in the continent of Europe, this mass of calcareous rocks is very unequally
                    distributed, yet in particular regions its course is very persistent, and the
                    different formations which compose it follow one another with remarkable
                    conformity. Scarcely any traces of it occur in Ireland, except in the
                    north-eastern part, which contains the chalk and red sandstone. It is found on
                    the east coast of Scotland at only a few points about the Moray Frith, and along
                    the Sutherland coast. On the western coast it occurs at Applecross, opposite to
                    the Isle of Skye, and at several points in that island, and some of the smaller
                    islets adjacent In the same manner, it borders Mull, and is found skirting the
                    mainland along the Sound of Mull.</p><p>But in none of the Irish or Scottish localities is the system completely, or even
                    characteristically, exhibited; it is, in fact, more properly an English than a
                    British system of strata, and there are few tracts of Europe where it is more
                    expanded or so fully and variously developed. ∙ From the prominent parts of the
                    Yorkshire coast, between Redcar and Filey, it holds an uninterrupted course,
                    with varying breadth, through Yorkshire,
                    Lincolnshire,Northamptonshire,Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire, Somersetshire, and
                    Dorsetshire, to the southern coast between Exmouth and the Isle of Purbeck,
                    almost everywhere forming a rather high table-land and dry surface, sloping
                    regularly to the east, and dividing the eastern and western drainage of the
                    island. It is nowhere narrower than in a part of Yorkshire near Bishop Wilton,
                    where, in consequence of unconformity of the chalk, only the lower part of the
                    lowest member is seen, and its breadth is only a few yards.</p><p>On the contrary, in the middle of the island, as in the counties of Northampton,
                    Rutland, Gloucester, and Worcester, its breadth is even as much as forty miles.
                    Toward the western edge, which is generally a line of bold escarpement, many
                    outliers, or detached masses,. occur, separated by watery violence or other
                    causes. Of these the most <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821848" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1848-0203"/> singular and far removed is the newly discovered
                    basin of has (the lowest of the oolitic formations) in the centre of the red
                    marls and sandstones of Cheshire—(Geol. Proceedings, 1835). Other extensive
                    outliers follow the southern border of the South Wales’ coal-field far into
                    Glamorganshire.</p><p>On the continent of Europe the oolitic system is largely expanded; in France in a
                    large semicircle round Paris, from the Ardennes to Normandy. It has a long range
                    in Wurtemberg and Franconia; occurs in places along the range of the Carpathians
                    (Poland), and margins, with a broad band, the north and south slopes of the
                    Alps. It is supposed to enter into the composition of the Apennines, and the
                    Dalmatian ridges, and to form a part of the limestone ranges of Spain, perhaps
                    also of Greece.</p><p>The skirts of the Himalaya certainly contain at leaçt its lower members, and
                    perhaps these are not wholly unknown in North America.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Succession of Deposits</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> There are
                    three principal types of the oolitic system in which its developed characters
                    appear considerably unlike; and it seems possible to ascertain the proximate
                    influences or causes of the diversity. The series of oolitic rocks near Bath was
                    the first field of the successful researches of Mr Smith in analyzing the
                    secondary strata and determining the relation of organic forms to the successive
                    stages of geological time. The excellent and exact arrangement which he here
                    disclosed is the true fundamental standard of comparison for all the localities,
                    not so much on the account of its being chosen by Mr Smith, as because it is in
                    fact the most complicated (that is most fully expanded or developed) series of
                    this system yet known. The following classification will be found very

                    by Murchison, agrees nearly with the Yorkshire type: so does that of the whole
                    northern line of Westphalian oolites, from Bramsche, by Minden, to Wolfenbüttel
                    and Helmstadt, but the greater part of the continental oolites form a series
                    analogous to that of the south of England. In Normandy there are almost exactly
                    the same groups (Μ. de Caumont). On the south of the Ardennes (Μ. Boblaye), the
                    clays of the English series grow less conspicuous, but the <hi rend="italic">series</hi> is similar. In Burgundy (Μ. de Beaumont), the calcareous character
                    of the group augments, and the argillaceous members diminish, so that the
                    several oolitic formations become more difficult to define than in England. The
                    same is true in a still more decided degree on the border of Switzerland; in
                    Wurtemberg and Franconia; and generally along the borders of the Alps.</p><p>The general result of all this is, that the type of the oolitic system of the
                    south of Europe is more calcareous; that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821861" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1861-0204"/> of the north
                    of Europe more arenaceo-argillaceous. The former has the air of an oceanic or
                    deep-sea deposit, little disturbed by currents of water; the latter was
                    accumulated under the predominant influence of littoral agitation. In most
                    cases, indeed, but not universally, the specially argillaceous has formation is
                    distinguishable (even among the Alps and around Auvergne) from the specially
                    calcareous upper oolites; the middle part of the system (Bath oolite formation)
                    is the most variable, and the uppermost formation (Wealden rocks) is merely
                    local.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Organic Remains</hi> —It is impossible to say with certainty
                    over what extent in extra-European countries the oolitic system spreads, because
                    of the great alterations which mixed secondary rocks experience near the axes of
                    mountain elevation. Thus the description of the thick limestone overlying red
                    sandstones, on the banks of the Lakes of Como and Lecco (De la Beche, <hi rend="italic">Geol. ManuaD,</hi> would be insufficient to make us recognise the
                    oolitic system, but for the additional evidence afforded by certain fossils. The
                    has of the Swiss and Austrian Alps could not be satisfactorily understood
                    without their aid (Necker and Murchison’s Notices); nor could the singular
                    alternations of granular limestones, micaceous slate, &amp;c. of the Tarentaise
                    (Μ. Brochant), and the problematical rocks of Piedmont (Μ. De Beaumont), be
                    referred to the has, but for the belemnites which occur abundantly among them.
                    It is true, that here a singular anomaly occurs with respect to the organic
                    remains, for the belemnites of the has are found both above and below a great
                    number of plants analogous to those of the ancient coal-measures! But this ought
                    not greatly to surprise us. There is nothing known in geology which should
                    forbid an admission that particular localities <hi rend="italic">of land</hi>
                    might enjoy an immunity from the effect of those causes which wrought periodical
                    changes in the physical conditions and organic inhabitants <hi rend="italic">of
                    the sea.</hi></p><p>The plants of this anomalous series may be viewed as a remainder of the
                    vegetation of the era of coal deposits, transferred to a sea full of organic
                    beings of the earliest oolitic era.</p><p>The importance justly attached to the study of organic exuviae has been overrated
                    by some of the followers of Mr Smith, and wholly misunderstood by some of the
                    opponents of his views. We, who have known intimately the principles really
                    advanced and acted on by that distinguished man, may be permitted to say this,
                    and to shew what is really their nature and meaning, by investigating their
                    application to the geological history of the oolitic rocks, the consideration of
                    which undoubtedly suggested the whole doctrine of the identification and
                    discrimination of strata by their imbedded organic “remains.”</p><p><hi rend="italic">The local truths'</hi> ascertained by Mr Smith with respect to
                    the oolitic rocks in the neighbourhood of Bath, as appears from his works,
                    “Stratigraphical System” and “Strata identified by organized Fossils,” are
                    these, the nomenclature being made to suit the modern arrangements:</p><p>(1.) The fossils of the oolitic system as a group, viz. the plants, zoophyta,
                    shells, Crustacea, and fishes, differ completely from the fossils similarly
                    grouped of the cretaceous system above, and the new red sandstone and coal
                    systems below.</p><p>(2.) The organic remains of the has formation differ, as a group, almost
                    absolutely from those of the Bath oolite formation, and these present points of
                    less general difference from those of the coralline oolite formation. Thus all
                    the formations have characteristic local distinctions in their organic
                    remains.</p><p>(3.) Many of the individual rocks, or masses of analo- ’ gous beds and layers,
                    contain particular characteristic fossils, which never or rarely occur in other
                    rocks.</p><p>(4.) The fossils of strata the most similar in their mineral nature, as the
                    oolite rocks,—the sandstones,—the clays,—are more frequently similar or
                    identical than those of rocks differing in nature. Thus the same, or similar
                    eCiùnida, occur in the Bath oolite and the coralline oolite; similar, if not the
                    same grypheae occur in the has clays, the Oxford clay, and the Kimmeridge
                    clay.</p><p>These <hi rend="italic">local truths</hi> are found to be applicable in all
                    situations where the oolitic series is expanded; they are repeated on the
                    Yorkshire coast (Geol. of Yorkshire), on the west of Scotland (Murchison),
                    (Dorsetshire (De la Beche), in Normandy (De Caumont, &amp;c.), south of the
                    Ardennes (Boblaye), in Central France (Dufrenoy, &amp;c.), in Franconia
                    (Munster), in the south-east of France (De Beaumont, Voltz, &amp;c.).</p><p>In generalizing these local truths Mr Smith found that, for a considerable
                    distance north and south, the fossils of the oolitic system, as a mass (l.),
                    were almost universally similar, and generally the same, but universally
                    distinct from those of older or younger systems.</p><p>(2.) That the distinction of the several oolitic formations was practicable for
                    considerable distances by the same species, or groups of fossils, which
                    characterized them near Bath.</p><p>(3.) That the several rocks contained, at great distances, many of the same
                    fossils which occurred in them near Bath.</p><p>Hence arose the impression that, in England, the oolitic and other strata of the
                    same age contained the same or similar organic bodies. It was not possible for
                    Mr Smith to state his laws as general principles universally applicable,
                    because, originating in observation, generalized by observation, they were in no
                    sense hypothetical ;—they were inductive not deductive,—limited to things known,
                    not extended to things unknown.</p><p>In following out Mr Smith’s views, it has been found, that the proposition (1.)
                    of the entire distinctness of the whole group of oolitic fossils from the older
                    and newer fossils, is almost universally true; the exceptional cases mentioned
                    along the range of tfie Alps, being, in fact, viewed as singular and difficult
                    anomalies. It has also been found, that mineral masses of most contrasted types,
                    as the argillaceous has compared to the calcareous oolites, retain the same
                    general features of distinction in organic remains, wherever they have yet been
                    examined. Whole groups of the same belemnites and ammonites mark the has of
                    Yorkshire, Dorsetshire, and Wurtemberg. It has also been found that the
                    geological place of several of the species selected by Mr Smith as
                    characteristic of Bath rocks, is the same, or nearly so, in very distant
                    situations ( Apiocrinus rotundus, Cidaris florigemma, Avicula echinata,
                    Terebratula digona, Ostrea delta, Gryphaea dilatata, Ammonites calloviensis,
                    &amp;c.); but it is also certain, that the number of these characteristic or <hi rend="italic">monochronic</hi> fossils is continually diminishing; that the
                    influence of geographical position is more important than was at one time
                    imagined; that varying physical conditions exerted corresponding influence over
                    the distribution of organic forms; that each species had a definite range of
                    organic existence; and, finally, that identity of species is not often to be
                    looked for at very great distances, though a remarkable general analogy and
                    similarity of form appears still to be very extensively recognised in the same
                    formation at every point of its range.</p><p>The abstractions used in zoological science,—the combination of species into
                    smaller groups,—and these into larger families, are now so much improved, that
                    the seeming complication of the results of the study of the thousands of fossil
                    species is fast disappearing. Whole sections of fishes, ammonites, and
                    belemnites mark the has, others the oolites, others the challd, while groups of
                    terebratulae, gryphaeae, &amp;c. mark stages more or less definite in the scale
                    of oolitic deposition. Where the rocks come to be aggregated <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821874" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1874-0205"/> together, the
                    characters of division cease. On comparing distant regions, only the broader
                    zoological features of the rocks can be employed with safety. On comparing
                    contemporaneous rocks produced under different conditions, we find the effects
                    of such conditions in the monuments of organic life; in the general conformity
                    of organizations imbedded in contemporaneous deposits, we read the evidence of
                    similar physical conditions over very large tracts of the globe; in the
                    successive diversity of these organic types we see proof of the successive
                    general changes of these conditions. Who will say that such results are
                    unphilosophical, or inconsistent with Mr Smith’s fundamental doctrine, that the
                    successive strata were successively the bed of the sea, and contain the remains
                    of the vegetable and animal creation then existing on the spot or in the
                    vicinity?</p><p>The first column of the following summary of the organic remains in the oolitic

followed upon that of the red
                    sandstone rocks without the intervention of more than local disturbances; and it
                    appears that, in general, few such occurrences broke the long uniformity of the
                    periodical agencies exerted in the oolitic period. Mr Murchison has shewn that
                    the elevation of the granitic mass of the Ord of Caithness·, took place after
                    the deposition of most of the oolitic rocks, for these are thrown into great
                    confusion in the vicinity.</p><p>In the north of England, the only igneous rock found in connection with the
                    oolitic system, is the great dyke which ranges from the mountain limestone near
                    Middleton in Teesdale, through the coal-measures of Cockfield Fell; the
                    magnesian limestone of Bolam, in Durham; across the red sandstone of the Vale of
                    Tees; the has of Cleveland; and the inferior oolite, Bath oolite, and
                    intervening sandstones and clays of Eskdale and the Moorlands, near Robin Hood’s
                    Bay. In this long course of seventy miles, the dyke retains so much of a common
                    character,—its constituent basalt is so similar,—and the line which it describes
                    so direct, that little doubt can be entertained of the contemporaneity of its
                    whole mass. The effects which it has produced on the strata along the whole
                    range are of the usual kind noticed near pyrogenous rocks: coal is charred;
                    sandstone hardened; shale bleached and indurated. Nothing of the kind is known
                    in the south of England.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Disturbances of the Oolitic System.</hi> The disturbed state of
                    the strata, accompanying the elevation of the Ord of Caithness, has been already
                    noticed. In the north of England, the unconformity of the chalk and oolite
                    indicates a low axis of elevation, passing east and west, under the Yorkshire
                    Wolds; and other dislocations parallel to this occur in Eskdale and other part¾
                    of the Yorkshire oolites. A similar unconformity, and nearly equal amount of
                    disturbance is found in the Dorsetshire oolites, where, besides, arc great
                    faults of a later date. In this district, however, phenomena have been observed
                    in the Isle of Portland, leading to the impression that a limited tract of
                    oolites had been raised into dry land, covered with soil and prolific in trees,
                    and again quietly submerged, so that the trees were left standing in attitude of
                    growth, or prostrate in “<hi rend="italic">the dirt-bed.”</hi> This remarkable
                    deposit has been observed by Mr Webster and other geologists; but it is to Dr
                    Buckland and Μ. De la Beche that we owe a full account of the circumstances and
                    suitable reasoning concerning them.</p><p>“We consider a small stratum,” say these geologists, “called by the workman ‘
                    dirt-bed,’ to be by far the most interesting and remarkable deposit in the
                    district. It seems to be made up of black loam, mixed with the exuviae of
                    tropical plants, accumulated on the spot on which they grew, and preserved
                    during a series of years in which the surface of the Portland-stone had for a
                    time become dry land, and accumulated a soil of about a foot in thickness,
                    composed of an admixture of earth and black vegetable matter, interspersed with
                    slightly rounded fragments of stone, which Mr Webster ascertained to be from the
                    lower part of the Portland series. These fragments are found to be almost
                    co-extensive with the <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> dirt-bed,’ and the fact
                    that we have yet found with them no admixture of pebbles derived from the
                    subjacent oolites, or from any other more ancient rocks, shews that no violent
                    rush of water from any distant region took place during the period in which
                    these pebbles of Portland-stone were under the process of becoming slightly
                    rounded.”</p><p>This dirt-bed, as Mr Webster has stated, forms the matrix of the silicified
                    trunks of very large coniferous trees, which are so abundant in the Isle of
                    Portland, and are found there coextensive with the upper surface of the
                    Portlandstone. Wherever the dirt-bed is laid open to extract the subjacent
                    building stone, it is found to contain these silicified trees laid prostrate,
                    partly sunk into the black earth, and partly covered by the subjacent
                    calcareo-siliceous slate; from this slate the silex, to which the trees are now
                    converted, must have been derived. A bed of snow falling on a modern peat-bog,
                    and covering the upper portion of prostrate trees whose lower portion has been
                    sunk by their weight into the substance of the peat, would represent the
                    position of the calcareous slate which immediately covers these fossil trees in
                    Portland.</p><p>Some of them extend to a length exceeding thirty feet, and bifurcate at their
                    upper end; but the branches are not continuous to their extremities, and we find
                    no trace of leaves. The leaves and small branches, and exterior parts of the
                    trunks, had probably decayed whilst they lay exposed to air on the surface of
                    the peat.</p><p>Amid the prostrate trees, many of which attain three or four feet in diameter, we
                    find silicified stems of plants closely resembling the modern Cycas and Zamia;
                    they have been <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821887" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1887-0206"/> described by Professor Buckland under the name of
                    Cyca-dioideae, and are important as indicating that the temperature in which
                    they grew was much higher than that of our present climate. We find also, at
                    nearly the same intervals at which trees are found growing in a modern forest,
                    an assemblage of silicified stumps or stools of large trees, <hi rend="italic">with their roots attached to the earth in which they grew.</hi> These stumps
                    are from one to three feet long; they are mostly erect, while a few are slightly
                    inclined. The black earth which contains their roots seldom exceeds one foot in
                    thickness; the upper portions of the stumps, as 'represented by Mr Webster,
                    project upwards into the substance of the superjacent stone (called “soft burr”
                    and “aish”), which gives indication of their presence by hemispherical
                    concretions accumulated around the top of each stump of wood.</p><p>The dirt-bed is found in several places near Weymouth, and is slightly traceable
                    in the Vale of Aylesbury, at Swindon and Tisbury.</p><p>“We consider the dirt-bed as quite decisive in forming the barrier between the
                    Portland (marine) and Purbeck (freshwater) deposits. Its accumulation must have
                    proceeded during a considerable portion of time, antecedently to which the
                    districts it occupies were entirely submerged beneath the sea, and subsequently
                    to which the water again returned to overwhelm them, first with a deposit of
                    about 1000 feet of the semilacustrine sediments of a great estuary (including
                    the united thickness of the Purbeck series, and the Wealden sands and clays),
                    and afterwards with a series of marine deposits, amounting to more than 1000
                    feet of greensand and chalk.</p><p>Throughout the entire succession of all these changes, there is no evidence of
                    any sudden and violent disturbance causing either elevation or depression of the
                    Portland-stone or of the subjacent oolites. The present high inclination of all
                    the beds is uniformly parallel to that of the beds of Purbeck-stone, greensand,
                    and chalk, and these all seem to have been raised simultaneously by the same
                    convulsion which elevated the axis of the Weymouth district, together with all
                    the inclined strata in Purbeck and the Isle of Wight.</p><p>We have a measure of the duration of the period during which the surface of the
                    Portland-stone continued in the state of dry land covered with forest, in the
                    thickness of the dirt-bed, which has accumulated more than a foot of black
                    earth, loaded with the wreck of its vegetation. The regular and uniform
                    preservation of this thin bed of black earth over a distance of so many miles,
                    shews that the change from dry land to the state of freshwater lake or estuary
                    was not accompanied by any violent inundation or rush of water, since the loose
                    black earth, together with the trees which lay prostrate on its surface, must
                    inevitably have been swept away had any such violent catastrophe then taken
                    place.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Geological Transactions,</hi> second series, vol.

                    argillo-carbonaceous layers lower in the rock: in one of the lower of these Dr
                    Fitton has recently found stumps of trees of the same kind as those in the
                    dirt-bed, apparently in the position and attitude of growth.</p><p>GENERAL VIEW OF CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE DEPOSITION OF THE OOLITIC SYSTEM.</p><p>‘ t</p><p>With this example in our minds of the progress toward definite knowledge of the
                    local conditions of land and sea during the oolitiferous era, we may turn to a
                    general contemplation of the subject. It is apparent from the plants found in
                    the has of Dorsetshire, the Bath oolite coralline oolite formations of
                    Yorkshire, and the Portland and Wealden formations in the south of England, that
                    land, to some extent, existed in several points about the region of the
                    oolitiferous sea of Europe. The analogy of some of these plants to the tropical
                    tribes of Zamia and Cycas, is sufficiently exact to warrant our belief in the
                    analogy of the climate in which they grew; the case of the dirt-bed seems
                    inexplicable except on the supposition of alternation of land and water without
                    violence; a given large area was subject to gradual vertical rise and fall to
                    the extent of 1000 feet or more, so that certainly once (perhaps thrice or more
                    frequently), there was time allowed for the elevated bed of the sea to be
                    covered with heaps of decaying vegetation, and the stumps of numerous large
                    trees which it had nourished into dense forests. Can any thing more plainly
                    teach the human intellect not to set narrow bounds to the <hi rend="smallcaps">time</hi> which elapsed in those numerous physical conditions which preceded
                    the era of the creation of man and the present adaptation of the surface of the
                    globe?</p><p>If <hi rend="italic">between</hi> the aggregation of marine and fluviatile
                    sediments of the Portland and Wealden formations, <hi rend="italic">the whole
                    life of large and stately coniferous trees has elapsed,</hi> who will revive the
                    unworthy folly of ascribing the curious proofs of regular and orderly
                    structure,—the rich monuments of physical changes which the earth offers to the
                    eye of intelligent man,—to a sudden deluge or any other violent catastrophe? It
                    is time that the blind opposition to the progress of inductive geology, based on
                    an erroneous view of the true meaning of the Scriptures, derived from days of
                    ignorance, should be wholly abandoned; and perhaps the consideration of <hi rend="italic">the proof</hi> furnished in the Isle of Portland may be sufficient
                    to relieve at least some of the unreasonable pressure which geology feels from
                    sources where it should meet with hearty encouragement.</p><p>We do not at present concede that the equisetiform plants which stand erect in
                    the sandstones bètweèn Whitby and Scarborough grew on the spot where they are
                    now found; nor is it at all required to suppose that, in the Weald of Sussex,
                    the vegetable reliquiae were the produce of that very region; on the contrary,
                    the manner of the occurrence of the plants in both these districts appears to
                    prove that considerable tracts of land <hi rend="italic">in some other
                    situations</hi> were raised above the sea, and that rivers and inundations from
                    this laud transported materials of different kinds with a certain periodicity of
                    action from more ancient strata. In what direction, from what ranges of uplifted
                    land these rivers flowed, cannot perhaps be said; perhaps no land <hi rend="italic">now</hi> above the waters yielded the sands and clays and
                    calcareous layers to the Weald of Sussex, the moors of Yorkshire, the borders of
                    Sutherland and Argyle, or the northern oolites of Westphalia. Yet some arguments
                    might be adduced, especially the analogy of mineral composition, to shew the
                    probability of anciently elevated coal strata having been the source of these
                    sandy interpolations. At all events, they are composed of matter swept by fresh
                    water from the land into lakes, estuaries, or the sea, for the plants and shells
                    found with them permit no other inference. These, then, if marine, are littoral
                    deposits; but the series of oolitic limestones, in which they form anomalous
                    local and irregular terms, were certainly for the most part deposited in
                    situations considerably removed from the agitation of coasts and the
                    intermixture of fresh water. This their arrangement, freedom from conglomerates,
                    perfection of organic contents, and simplicity of composition, fully <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821900" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1900-0207"/>
                    prove. Particular beds undoubtedly (especially the top of the rocks) have
                    suffered agitation.</p><p>The concretionary structure of these limestones is imitated in modern times only
                    in situations where carbonate of lime is separated from chemical solution in
                    water (Carlsbad). If we ascribe this origin to the oolitic sediment, the
                    concretionary aggregation of the particles may be understood as arising from
                    molecular attraction in the mass, and, in fact, many of the spherules of oolite
                    contain an internal nucleus of previously solidified matter, a small shell, a
                    grain of sand, or somewhat else, capable of determining the condensation of the
                    particles to particular centres, just as the matter of ironstone has collected
                    into nodules round a fishscale, a piece of fern branch, or a shell.</p><p>The periodical occurrence of clays, sands, and limestones is not less remarkable
                    in some parts of the oolitic system than in those of older date; the Bath oolite
                    formation is sandy at the base and sandy at the top; the coralline oolite has
                    superior and inferior sandstones, and the same is the case with the Portland
                    oolite where the series is complete, (Vale of Aylesbury). The clays of this
                    series appear to be in a considerable degree independent of the compound terms
                    (of limestone and sandstone), and thus furnish means for an easy and natural
                    division of the English oolites, which fail in various parts of southern
                    Europe.</p><p>»</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">cretaceous system.</hi><hi rend="italic">Geographical
                    Extent.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In general we may perceive, as the several
                    systems of strata pass under review, that the areas which they respectively
                    occupy are defined by narrower boundaries, and that these approximate more and
                    more to the present distribution of the basins of the sea. The north-eastward
                    ranges of the oolitic strata of England, sloping gently to the east and
                    south-east, are covered on their declining surfaces by ranges of chalk and
                    greensand, which nowhere ascend to so great heights as the oolites which rise
                    from beneath them. The cretaceous system is unconformed to the oolites at only
                    two points in England, viz. in Yorkshire and Dorsetshire, and round the basin of
                    Paris and in the south of France the same conformity of the two systems is found
                    to prevail.</p><p>It thus becomes easy to trace the boundary of the cretaceous rocks by referring
                    to the outline of the oolites. The chalk and its associated beds pass from
                    Yorkshire through Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire,
                    Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Wiltshire, to Dorsetshire, always presenting a
                    noble front of rounded hills to the west and north-west. Thence they return to
                    the east through the isle of Purbeck and the Isle of Wight, offering a front to
                    the south, while the broad inland surfaces, which are included between the Isle
                    of Wight and the Hertfordshire Hills, are formed into two parallel synclinal
                    troughs (the vales of London and of Hampshire), separated by one great
                    anticlinal axis passing from Wiltshire to the coast of Kent, and continued into
                    France in the district of Boulogne. The anticlinal axis alluded to changes
                    through Sussex into a great denudation, or valley of elevation, exposing the
                    Wealden formation in the centre, with escarpments of the cretaceous system on
                    the north, south, and west in England, and on the east in France.</p><p>Hence, in general terms, we may say the chalk of England is distinctly related in
                    escarpments and slopes to the present German Ocean and the eastern part of the
                    English Channel. Were the level of the sea raised three hundred feet, its coast
                    line would in all the eastern and south-eastern parts of England be parallel to
                    escarpments of chalk.</p><p>The long range of chalk escarpment is too obvious a feature, in the physical
                    geography of England to have escaped notice; and in the infancy of geology we
                    find Lister observing on its great extent and continuation with similar
                    characters into France. It does not occur in Scotland, and in Ireland is
                    confined to the north-eastern portion, where it rests on greensand, has, red
                    sandstone, and coal-measures.</p><p>In France, the cretaceous system, commencing at Calais, opposite the Kentish
                    margin of the great anticlinal denudation of the Weald, sweeps in a vast circle
                    round Paris by Lille, Chalons, Troyes, Saumur, and Le Mans, to the embouchure of
                    the Seine; thus appearing as a great southward branch of the English chalk
                    system, formed in a bay of the then ocean, which was defined between the
                    mountains of Brittany, La Vendee, Auvergne, the French Jura, and the
                    Ardennes.</p><p>From this great area (principally chalk) a broad expanded but mostly subterranean
                    mass of cretaceous strata extends along the north side of the Ardennes arid the
                    valley of the Meuse, and continues (seen only at intervals at the surface) along
                    the northern border of high ground in Germany, from Essen to Paderborn, turning
                    as that border turns to Osnaburg, and then returning through Hanover and
                    Brunswick. It reappears along the range of the Carpathians, and in some parts of
                    the interior of the great tertiary plains which stretch to the north into
                    Russia, and to the east to the Black Sea. In Denmark and Scania and along the
                    Baltic (Isle of Rugen) chalk occurs in its usual character.</p><p>Along the northern and southern flanks of the Alps some beds of the cretaceous
                    system range extensively, but not so clearly distinguished from the subjacent or
                    superior strata as usual. Along the Pyrenees, however, the chalk system is very
                    fully developed, and has been uplifted to great elevations by disturbances of
                    comparatively recent date. In the south of Spain also chalk with flint occurs.
                    In America rocks of the cretaceous period are abundant along the eastern side of
                    the United States, particularly in New Jersey, along the coasts of the
                    Carolinas, in Georgia, Florida, and Alabama,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Rogers in <hi rend="italic">Report of British Association
                    for</hi> 1834.</p></note> but true chalk is either wholly unknown or at least
                    very rare.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Succession of Deposits</hi> —In different parts of the
                    geographical area above noticed, the cretaceous system differs considerably;
                    yet, as in the case of the oolitic rocks, extreme differences from a common type
                    are very limited, and evidently caused by local conditions, which insulated to a
                    certain degree particular parts of the sea from the influence of the general

                    green or iron sand also vanishing north of Lincolnshire, and the golt and chalk
                    constituting a binary instead of quinary system. The most constant of all the
                    terms in this system in England are the upper portions of the chalk.</p><p>The section of this system in the north of Ireland (neighbourhood of Belfast)
                    yields chalk, greensand, and golt. In the north of France generally the same
                    five terms arq found as in the south of England, though the golt is less
                    distinct than in England, and the two sandy beds not so well defined. In the
                    country north of the Ardennes and bordering on the Meuse, the chalky system,
                    though less complete in the lower part (except about Aix la Chapelle), is much
                    more developed in the upper part. In fact, a considerable mass of coarse, sandy,
                    calcareous rocks, which is not really chalk, forming the hill of St Peter, near
                    Maestricht, lies upon the ordinary cretaceous rocks of Belgium, and, both by its
                    mineral and organic contents, offers a real though incomplete transition to the
                    tertiary series of strata.</p><p>In the north of Germany both the chalky rocks above and the greensands below
                    (Quadersandstein of Pirna, and other parts of Saxony adjoining the Erzgebirge)
                    conform in many particulars to the English type. In the Carpathians the
                    greensands predominate so as to constitute nearly the whole system. In the Alps,
                    likewise, this is the case to a great extent, and it appears worthy of remark,
                    1st, that in the Saleve and parts of the Jura there is a real alternation of
                    greensands of the cretaceous type with the upper limestones of the oolite
                    formation; 2d, that in particular parts of the north flanks of the Alps there
                    appears to be a blending of the characters of the cretaceous and tertiary rocks
                    (no chalk being found), so that it is hard to say where the line should be
                    drawn.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Murchison, Boué,

                    physical changes which elsewhere happened at the close of the secondary period,
                    while the Maestricht transition may be viewed as one of the few monuments left
                    to declare the nature of those changes.</p><p>In North America the most characteristic deposit, as along the Alps, is
                    greensand, associated with limestones, compared to oolites'in New Jersey, having
                    a more chalky aspect in Florida and Alabama, where it assumes important
                    features, but without real chalk or true flints. Some of the deposits in New
                    Jersey resemble the lower green or iron sands of England.</p><p>It is thus rendered evident that the English type is more or less applicable to
                    the greater portions of the earth’s surface where the cretaceous system has been
                    recognised; that the lower parts of the system are generally sandy, the upper
                    parts often calcareous, but that the development of these two groups is not
                    proportional nor depending on the same centres of influence. In the north of
                    Europe the upper group seems generally to predominate, but in the middle of
                    Europe the greensand system is more expanded and regular; in the northern parts
                    of the United States the greensand abounds, in the southern calcareous rocks are
                    more important. Yet upon the whole it must be granted that the agencies
                    concerned in producing the cretaceous system were more extensive and uniform
                    than those by which the oolites were accumulated.</p><p>Two formations are almost universally admitted as constituting the cretaceous
                    system.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Chalk Formations</hi> named from the most characteristic
                    mineral substance: thickness 600 feet. It includes the following groups
                    :—Maestricht beds, upper or flinty chalk, middle or hard chalk, lower chalk or
                    chalk marl.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Greensand Formation,</hi> commonly abounding in a green
                    silicate of iron: thickness 600 feet. It includes upper greensand, &amp;c. golt
                    or blue marly clay, lower green or ironsand, with beds of sandy or chalky
                    limestone.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Stratification</hi> —In this system of strata, so evidently of
                    watery origin, stratification, if Playfair’s definition were adopted (“strata
                    can only be formed by seams which are parallel throughout the entire mass”)
                    almost never occurs! In very many instances the chalk and greensand masses shew
                    no more of stratification such as this definition requires than the primary
                    rocks; but the cause is very different. Chalk differs remarkably in its
                    composition and structure from most other calcareous deposits. It is generally
                    an earthy, that is, feebly aggregated mass; it is seldom laminated like
                    argillaceous limestones, unless where it is harder than usual, as for example on
                    the Yorkshire coast and in some parts of the Isle of Wight. It contains evidence
                    of consecutive deposition from a watery liquid as complete as any other rock. In
                    general we find through a great mass of chalk a number of nodules of flint,
                    variously shaped, but disposed in certain layers which are almost exactly
                    parallel to one another, and to the bounding surface of the rock, and at equal
                    distances, three to six feet. These serve to mark the successive deposits of the
                    calcareous mass; and from the frequent occurrence of zoophytic remains in these
                    nodules, especially in the south of England, it appears probable that the
                    siliceous matter was’ separated from the calcareous, and collected round these
                    bodies, by that molecular attraction which has been previously noticed in
                    nodules of ironstone and spherules of oolite. M <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> e
                    may suppose, therefore, with Dr Buckland, an intermitting but abundant
                    deposition of mingled carbonate of lime and silica, nearly equal quantities in
                    each successive deposition, and that the silica was specially attracted to local
                    centres by organic and other solidified masses. This of course applies only to
                    the flinty chalk, which in the south of England is generally at the upper part,
                    but in Yorkshire and at Havre flints are rather characteristic of the middle and
                    lower parts of the mass.</p><p>The greensand formation shews the most complete stratification parallel to its
                    bounding surfaces in those parts where the argillaceous golt and calcareous
                    layers (e. <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> in the vicinity of Folkstone and at the
                    back of the Isle of Wight) vary the series of arenaceous aggregates. More
                    regular stratification is nowhere to be seen than under such conditions. But
                    where these divisions vanish, as in the western part of the great Wealden
                    denudation (about Hazlemere, Leith Hill, Ryegate) the case is wholly different.
                    The great mass of sand then exhibits little reg <hi rend="underline">ular</hi>
                    ity of lamination, and besides is traversed by abundance of irony plates and
                    shells in various directions, which render it nearly impossible to find any
                    seams passing through the mass parallel to the bounding surfaces. In such a
                    case, then, the nomenclature of Mr Smith coincides with the definition of
                    Playfair, and several hundred feet of irregularly laminated sand constitute but
                    one stratum.</p><p>Yet even in this extreme case the interrupted layers and nodules of chert
                    (analogous to the flints in chalk) indicate the succession of deposits, and shew
                    us that with respect to rocks of watery origin the adherence to the definition
                    of stratification commonly received is likely to close the eyes of the observer
                    on many more important matters.</p><p>The golt beds are generally laminated as other argillaceous deposits.</p><p>Organic remains occur in all the beds of the cretaceous<pb break="no" facs="nls:193821926" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1926-0209"/> system, and
                    there is a considerable conformity in the lists which have been composed of the
                    contents of the greensand and chalk formations. It is also observed that a
                    considerable proportion of the organic remains which are found in a certain
                    member of the system in England, also occurs in the same in France and Germany;
                    that a small number of fossils may even be esteemed characteristic of the chalk,
                    and others of the greensand formation. Locally, the several minor groups, and
                    even particular layers, are distinguishable by their organic contents. But if we
                    seek to apply this rule beyond the continent of Europe, nothing but
                    disappointment ensues. In Egypt the chalky rocks contain different fossils from
                    those which are known in England. Even the Scaglia of the southern faces of the
                    Alps could not be identified by fossils with the chalk of England, much less
                    could the greensand and chalky rocks of America, in the absence of other
                    evidence, be referred to the cretaceous system by comparing the catalogue of <hi rend="italic">species</hi> of organic remains.</p><p>What would be the feelings of a geologist accustomed to believe in the occurrence

                    physical differences; and instead of feeling dismay at the loss of an
                    (imaginary) infallible guide, we ought to be alive to the investigation of the

                    ammonites, occur in America, as well as in the European greensand and chalky
                    limestones; and it is possible that the specific differences of the organic

                    of igneous origin is associated with the chalk or greensand. Such occurrences
                    are less rare on the continent of Europe, among the Pyrenees and the Alps: at
                    Weinbohla, on the Danube, it is covered by sienitic rock. But the most
                    remarkable occurrence is in the north-east of Ireland, where the chalk is almost

                    there is little or no proof of any considerable disturbing movements following
                    upon the deposition of the chalk; yet, from the character of the lower tertiary
                    strata of England which rest upon the chalk, it appears undoubted that
                    considerable agitation of water occurred, for the surface of the chalk was
                    wasted, and conglomerate or pebble beds formed of the detrital flints. The mass
                    of igneous rocks poured out on the chalk of Ireland, is of too indefinite an age
                    to be appealed to as proof of convulsions in that quarter. But on the continent
                    of Europe, De Beaumont assigns to this period his Pyreneo<pb break="no" facs="nls:193821939" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1939-0210"/>-apennine
                    system of convulsion,—the elevation of the Pyrenees, Carpathians, Northern
                    Apennines, Dalmatia, and the Morea, in lines ranging parallel to a great circle
                    on the sphere through Natchez and the Persian Gulf. It appears also that some
                    disturbances which happened <hi rend="italic">during</hi> the cretaceous era,
                    are traceable in Mont Viso and the Western Alps. Supposing the Pyreneo-apennine
                    system to be principally, if not wholly referrible to this period, we seem to
                    behold a reason for the agitation of the shores of the English chalk basin; the
                    distant convulsion might sufficiently explain this local and transient
                    agitation, but, in fact, it is very probable that the English chalk underwent a
                    gradual local elevation, which contracted the area of the bordering seas, and
                    formed shores and dry land slopes of chalk, to be wasted by the waves, the
                    rivers, and the rains. The pebble-beds of the tertiaries which rest on the chalk
                    of England, do indeed more exactly correspond to such an origin than to the
                    effect of sudden and violent disturbance.</p><p>TERTIARY STRATA.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Base of the Strata</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> We have seen
                    that during the long and yet unmeasured period which elapsed during the
                    accumulation of the secondary strata, elevation of the land continually happened
                    by gradual forces, and sometimes by violent disturbance. The most striking case
                    of the latter is the general disruption of the coal system, at least before the
                    completion of the red sandstone deposition. Of the gradual elevation of strata,
                    almost the whole series furnishes continual proof. Hence it is, that the oolitic
                    rocks follow one another so exactly in their geographical boundaries, retiring
                    continually into smaller and narrower areas, as the elevation of the old land
                    proceeded. In the continuation of the process, the greensand and chalk form, at
                    least in England and France, a still interior band of deposits, which mark the
                    gradual contraction of the seas, that is, the gradual uprising of the land.</p><p>The tertiary strata have, in general, to the chalk the same geographical
                    relations as that to the oolites. Throughout England, the chalk is the base of
                    all the tertiary strata. In France this is generally the case, and almost
                    universally so for the marine tertiaries. In the north of Germany, along the
                    north and south slopes of the Alps, and in the basin of the Danube, this is at
                    least very extensively true. In North America, the general basis of the
                    tertiaries is the cretaceous formation. On more close inquiry, it appears,
                    however, that the tertiary strata are seldom exactly conformed to the
                    stratification of the chalk; that any thing like a gradation or alternation of
                    the cretaceous into tertiary deposits, is rarely known; that the organic remains
                    of the one group differ almost wholly and absolutely, except in the south of
                    France, at Maestricht, &amp;c., and constitute two distinct groups of created
                    life. Hence it has become a popular opinion, that with the secondary strata
                    ended a certain general condition of the globe, and with the tertiaries
                    commenced a totally new arrangement. Moreover, because we find the marine
                    tertiary strata distinctly related, in geographical expansion, to the present
                    basins and arms of the ocean; as the organic remains which they contain are
                    similar, and, in rocks of later date, identical to those of the existing races
                    in the sea and on the land; and as the tertiary sediments are of a nature very
                    analogous to the daily products of the sea, estuaries, tide-rivers, and
                    lakes,—there is but a step farther to unite the tertiary era with the historical
                    period of the globe, and to place the commencement of the actual creation or
                    arrangement of organic nature at the epoch immediately following the chalk. For
                    these and other reasons, the tertiary strata are of great interest. They admit
                    of a clear comparison, in all respects, with the effects which daily occur
                    before our eyes; and thus facilitate our inquiry into the conditions of nature
                    in earlier periods. They furnish the principal arguments on which Mr Lyell rests
                    his doctrines of the continual uniformity of the measure of terrestrial
                    agencies, as the older strata have long done to those who maintain that, in the
                    construction of the crust of the globe, periods of ordinary action have been
                    broken by crises of unusual violence.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nature of the Tertiary Strata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In
                    very few instances, during our survey of the products of earlier nature, have we
                    found reason to admit the deposition of strata in any other waters than those of
                    the sea, in its depths and along its shores. The coal deposits of the north of
                    England generally, belong to the class of estuary formations, in which the
                    influence of the sea was often less and never more sensible than in the bed of a
                    tide-river, where the water is only brackish. At intervals, indeed (Yorkshire
                    coal-field), when great distant disturbance or local change of the circumstances
                    occurred, the influence of the sea has returned and produced its usual effects,
                    leaving, as monuments of its short dominion, peculiar kinds of animal
                    exuviae.</p><p>The oolitic formation on the Yorkshire coast and in Sutherland proves plainly
                    enough the local addition of fresh waters and spoils from the land; the Wealden
                    formation indicates, in like manner, a wide estuary fed by some river, on whose
                    banks gigantic reptiles or tropical plants abounded; but nothing has yet been
                    shewn with respect to any carboniferous or oolitic deposit, which renders
                    necessary the supposition <hi rend="italic">of lacustrine or purely fresh-τvater
                    deposits.</hi> Communication with the sea from the basins of the coal deposits,
                    and from the Wealden beds, is apparently indispensable in explaining the
                    occurrence of particular sorts of fishes in these strata, and not in any respect
                    inconsistent with the evidence of the molluscous exuviae. The most plausible
                    arguments for fresh-water deposits among the older strata, are advanced by Dr
                    Hibbert in his description of the Burdichouse fossils, and by Mr Murchison in
                    his notices of Shropshire coal-fields. Without in the least wishing to intimate
                    that the influence of fresh-water in accumulating the materials of the strata is
                    most conspicuous in the newer strata,—-an inference not justifiable by the
                    facts, —it is to be remarked, that the deposition of stratified rocks in limited
                    basins of fresh-water is a phenomenon almost characteristic of the tertiary
                    period.</p><p>The same tracts of watery surface beneath which the coalfield of Yorkshire was
                    formed suffered alternate influence of the sea and river water. The estuary of
                    the Wealden, and the coal deposit of the oolitic hills, were alike formed upon
                    the bed of formerly deep seas, and at a later period deep sea again covered the
                    same area: in a certain sense, the deposits of fresh and salt water alternate in
                    several secondary formations. But in the tertiary strata, this phenomenon of
                    alternating marine and fresh-water products is more decided and remarkable. In
                    the basin of Paris, at least two freshwater and two marine deposits alternate in
                    the tertiary series. Alternations of really fresh-water and really marine
                    products happen in the south of France, the valley of the Rhine, in Hungary, and
                    the Isle of Wight. In these cases the explanation is possible, without supposing
                    repeated upliftings and submersions of the land—of which, from other phenomena,
                    there is no evidence—by merely conceiving estuaries or expansions of water, such
                    that the influence of rivers and the sea might alternately predominate, just as,
                    in fact, we know to have happened, even in historical times, in the marshes of
                    East Norfolk,—and as must have often occurred in similar tracts at the mouths of
                    rivers where variable sand-banks abound, and alter the direction of littoral
                    currents. At some later epoch, the whole bed of the estuary has been uplifted to
                    its present elevation above the sea.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nature of the Marine and Fresh-water Deposits</hi> It is a
                    remarkable confirmation of the views of modern geologists, that a great portion
                    of the substance of sedimentary strata <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821952" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1952-0211"/> was swept down
                    to the sea by inundations and other watery forces operating on the surface of
                    the dry land,—that the marine and fresh-water sediments of the tertiary
                    era&lt;ιave so much general analogy. In each we have calcareous, argillaceous,
                    and arenaceous deposits, alternating,—stratified, laminated, in a similar
                    manner; the organic exuviae are similarly disposed in the beds, and, but from
                    the character of these, we could not in general venture to pronounce upon the
                    nature of the water in which the beds were deposited. Some distinction is,
                    however, to be traced; the marine arenaceous sediments are thicker and more
                    confused than those of fresh-water; the marine clays are less minutely
                    laminated. It may be remarked, in general, that limestones and fine
                    light-coloured clays constitute the principal mass of the fresh-water sediments;
                    while sands, and blue and variously-coloured clays more particularly mark the
                    marine depositions. The latter appear like the products of littoral agitation,
                    as if the wearing of cliffs of older strata had furnished the materials of these
                    newer rocks; while the former resemble the accumulations from the wasting
                    surface of chalky and argillaceous countries. This is more particularly the case
                    in the Isle of Wight, where the coloured sands of the marine tertiaries might
                    seem really to have drifted only a few miles from the equally-coloured sands of
                    the greensand and Wealden formations; while the fresh-water marls and limestone
                    may be imagined to have been added from a wasting surface of chalk hills.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">scale of geological time.</hi></p><p>In all our former inquiries, the successive geological periods have been arranged
                    by the marine deposits and marine fossils; and the same plan must be followed in
                    these tertiary rocks if we wish to preserve consistency. The true plan of
                    comparing the tertiary and earlier strata, in reference to chronology, is to
                    reject the lacustrine and estuary deposits, and the remains of land and
                    fresh-water animals and plants, and confine ourselves to the marine productions
                    merely. Had this prudence been duly observed in geological reasoning, much
                    inconsistency and contradiction might have been avoided; the fresh-water
                    depositions (which are merely local terms in the series of strata), would not
                    have been appealed to in proof of the relative ages of marine deposits, nor
                    should we have been led, by the occurrence of a few exuviae of land mammalia,
                    into conclusions at variance with the evidence of marine invertebrata, which are
                    the true indices of past geological time.</p><p>Succession of time, as determined by marine productions, is the true scale of
                    geological classification; and it is clear that the fresh-water strata of any
                    series can only be determined in age by their relations to the marine; also, as
                    the laws of changes of organic life, which are gradually unfolded by geology,
                    are founded, in the first instance at least, on the facts known with reference
                    to marine fossils, it is to this standard that the independent series of
                    analogous changes on the land must be referred. The <hi rend="italic">rate</hi>
                    of such changes on the land, however real and regular, may have been wholly
                    different from that in the sea, and must be studied apart. This reasoning leads
                    directly to a classification of the phenomena of tertiary deposits under three
                    heads,—</p><p>The Marine deposits,</p><p>The Fluviatile deposits, alternating with marine deposits,</p><p>The Lacustrine deposits; a classification, however, which is better suited to a
                    philosophical review of the results of investigation than to a description of
                    the phenomena, for these are often intimately associated.</p><p>BRITISH MARINE TERTIARY DEPOSITS.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Geographical Extent.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In Europe,
                    the area covered by marine tertiaries is scarcely inferior to that occupied by
                    either the primary or secondary series. Ireland and Scotland, and all their
                    dependent islands, are wholly deficient in these strata, unless we choose to
                    make exceptions in favour of uplifted beaches whose date is yet uncertain, like
                    the terraces on the sides of the Forth, and the shelly beds on the coast of
                    Wexford. No tertiaries occur in Wales, unless the shelly gravel on the north
                    face of Snowdonia be of this date; neither do any traces of these deposits occur
                    on the coast of England further north than Bridlington in Yorkshire, nor to the
                    west of the Isle of Purbeck. Raised beaches, however, are met with beyond these
                    boundaries. Inland, the tertiaries follow a line parallel to the chalk
                    escarpment in all its great flexures, and along the east and west axes of
                    dislocation. There are, consequently, two great troughs or basins of tertiary
                    strata, viz. those of London and Hampshire, both ranging east and west.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Succession of Strata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> It is
                    remarkable that in these two basins principally, though not exclusively, he the
                    lower members of the tertiary series of England, while other members have mostly
                    a local distribution, depending on different circumstances. No complete type of
                    the English series can be had at any one locality, not even in the Isle of
                    Wight, where alone the fresh-water formations are distinctly seen. To compose a
                    complete section, we must add together the strata of Norfolk and Suffolk, the
                    beds of the London basin, and the varied deposits of the Isle of Wight. We thus
                    find that the marine deposits of England range themselves in three groups,
                    viz.</p><p>Upper group or Crag, Generally arenaceous.</p><p>Middle group or London Clay, ...Mostly argillaceous.</p><p>Lower group, or plastic clay, &amp;c...Clays and sands.</p><p>Of these the upper group occurs only in Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex (unless the

                    to the basins of London and Hampshire. The following is a sketch of the state of
                    knowledge concerning each of these groups.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Lower Group of Plastic Clays and Sands</hi> is best seen in
                    the Isle of Wight, where its characters are easily examined at Alum Bay, at the
                    west of the island. Mr Webster, who first described this interesting spot, gives
                    the following succession of the beds lying next to chalk, all vertical or nearly
                    so. The chalk is covered by a calcareous marly bed, probably not related to the
                    tertiary deposit. Then follow 60 feet of green, red, and yellow sand; 200 feet
                    of dark blue clay, with greensand and septaria, and a few shells; 321 feet of
                    variously-coloured sands; 543 feet of pipe-clays and sands of various colours,
                    which, by crumbling and exposing fresh faces, shew very bright and splendid
                    tints of white, yellow, orange, red, green, grey, and black. Near the middle,
                    lignite is found in these beds (with remains of fruit); and in the higher part
                    toward the north, five other beds of lignite occur, each about a foot thick;
                    rolled black flints in yellow sand. (Dark coloured clay 250 feet thick, with
                    greensand and septaria, and abundance of shells of the London clay closes the
                    series.) Reduced in thickness, these sandy and argillaceous layers continue both
                    east and west. At Poole they yield valuable pipe-clay and sands.</p><p>In the basin of London the plastic clays and sands vary in thickness and quality,
                    but present general analogies with those of the Isle of Wight, in the
                    variously-coloured sands and clays of Reading, layers of worn flint pebbles
                    (Blackheath), mostly very small, and a few beds of slielly clay (Woolwich.) It
                    is in most places somewhat confused in lamination, full of indications of
                    littoral agitation, and apparently accumulated with considerable rapidity by
                    very limited agencies. Whence have come the masses of sandy materials which
                    compose this deposit in the two basins in question? We have already said that in
                    the Isle of Wight <pb break="no" facs="nls:193821965" xml:id="kp-eb0715-1965-0212"/> it appeared as if the tertiary sands had been
                    derived from the ruins of the very similar subcretaceous rocks of the vicinity.
                    Perhaps the hypothesis may be extended to the basin of London, (once certainly
                    united with that of Hampshire.) Mr Lyell, indeed, in reasoning on the basin of
                    London, has proposed the ingenious hypothesis of the accumulation of all the
                    materials of these basins from the waste of the Wealden district, assumed to be
                    then rising gradually to encounter the ravages of the atmosphere. The evidence
                    is not satisfactory, and the supposition involves a point of some importance not
                    yet conceded, viz. the gradual elevation of the Wealden district. At all events,
                    the probability is great that some uplifted greensand ranges contributed
                    materials to the plastic clay formation.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Middle Group of London Clay</hi> is most fully developed in
                    the vale of the Thames, and best known in the vicinity of London. The numerous
                    wells established here have shewn the inferiority of the plastic clays and sands
                    to the London day, and contributed to make known the characters of this great
                    argillaceous deposit, which, in some places, is above 500 or 600 feet thick, and
                    in Essex, at High Beach, 700 feet, according to Conybeare and Phillips.</p><p>In this great thickness of blue and brown clay is little variety, except what is
                    caused by a few layers of nodular septaria, and toward the bottom greensands or
                    sandstones, (which are more fully developed at Bognor on the coast of Sussex.)
                    Laminated shelly beds also occur (Knightsbridge WelD, and in the Harwich Cliff
                    are layers of stratified limestone, (Grcenough.)</p><p>Organic remains are nowhere rare in this deposit, and, in particular localities,
                    extremely abundant; 239 species are mentioned by Μ. Deshayes from the London
                    clay, principally of Hampshire and Highgate; and of these only twelve, or five
                    per cent., have been found living in the present seas.</p><p>What is the origin of this mass of clay? Mr Lyell supposes the uplifted Weald of
                    Kent and Sussex to have yielded the materials of the whole of the marine
                    tertiaries to the north and south; that waste of the sandy tracts of the Weald
                    furnished the plastic clays and sands, and the Weald clays contributed the
                    argillaceous sediments. But this speculation can neither be advocated nor
                    opposed except by trains of argument involving too many assumptions to be
                    admissible in inductive geology. .</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Upper Group, or Crag Formation,</hi> is a local deposit of
                    a character very different from all the older strata. It consists of two parts,
                    which, according to recent researches of Mr Charlesworth, are placed in
                    superposition at some points on the eastern coast, particularly Ramsholt near
                    Woodbridge. The lower part is either a loose, partially calcareous sandy mass
                    (Ramsholt), very full of shells, and containing a considerable quantity of
                    corals, not at all agreeing with the zoophyta of the German Ocean, or else a
                    coarse sandy zoophytic limestone (Aldborough and Orford), in which some of the
                    same shells occur. The thickness of the lower, or coralline crag, is not
                    certainly known; from seven to twelve feet arc exposed; it is scarcely
                    ferruginous; shews no considerable marks of watery agitation; pebbles and rolled
                    shells are not seen in it.</p><p>In these particulars it differs much from the upper or red crag, which shews, by
                    its very confused, often curved, and obliquely-intersecting lamination, by its
                    abundance of rolled pebbles, bones, and shells, proofs of having been
                    accumulated under the influence of agitated waters. No trace of land plants
                    occurs; in general no alternation of clay deposits is seen; and though a few
                    bones of mammalia have been found (as in the older and quietly deposited
                    tertiaries of Italy), there can be no doubt that the whole is a littoral marine
                    accumulation. The whole is very ferruginous. Shells are excessively plentiful;
                    and in fact constitute, in some places near Woodbridge, the principal part of
                    the mass. Corals are very rare (though not absolutely unknown); and
                    solenostomatons gasteropoda, (including reversed whelks), very plentiful.</p><p>From the composition and character of the upper or red crag we may venture to
                    adopt the opinion, that it is little else than an elevated beach of the German
                    Ocean, parallel to the shore of which it is extended from north to south through
                    the eastern parts of Norfolk and Suffolk. The coralline crag below it may be
                    viewed as a less disturbed product of the same ocean farther toward the deep
                    sea.</p><p>What relation does this shelly deposit bear to the actual beach and littoral bed
                    of the German Ocean? This question brings us to a more close consideration of
                    the organic remains of the crag, which, according to Mr Charlesworth, amount, in
                    the collection of Mr Wood of Hasketon near Woodbridge, to 470 species, viz.—</p><p>Annulosa, . . . . 13 Conchifera, . . . 189</p><p>Cirripeda, . . . . 11 Mollusea, . . . 257</p><p>Of these 111 have been examined by Deshayes, and he assigns 45 of these (40.1 per
                    cent.) to recent types mostly found in European seas. In the coralline crag Mr
                    Charlesworth finds 350 species of testacea, and in the red crag 230; 150 are
                    common to both the deposits; 80 are peculiar to the red crag; 200 to the
                    coralline crag.</p><p>Μ. Deshayes’ result, quoted above, was principally founded on an examination of
                    the red crag. Lately he has also examined a portion of the shells of the
                    coralline crag, and finds in these the same, or rather greater, proportion of
                    recent species.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Proceedings of British Association at Dublin.</p></note> According to this
                    evidence, the lower or coralline crag is to be classed with the red crag; as a
                    somewhat anterior deposit, produced under different local conditions, but
                    including organic exuviae which bear the same numerical relations to the present

                    and several bones and teeth of fishes. Of the shells, four specics are also
                    found in the crag—five or six arc identical with living species—a considerable

                    and lower fresh-water beds, by an intermediate set of strata containing estuary

                    numerous in particular layers. Below is white sand without fossils.</p><p>FOREIGN TERTIARY STRATA.</p><p>Though the English tertiary strata occupy but a very small space, compared to the
                    wide extent of these strata on the continent, they are not inferior in interest
                    to those of any district in Europe. There is a very remarkable analogy between
                    the tertiaries of the basin of Paris and those of the basin of Hampshire,
                    extending even to the number and circumstances of the fresh-water beds,
                    accompanied, however, by as remarkable a difference in the composition and
                    character of one part of the series. The following is the arrangement of the
                    tertiary strata near Paris adopted by Cuvier and Brongniart, (Tableaux des
                    Terrains).</p><p><hi rend="italic">Upper Fresh-water or Epilimnic Group,</hi> consists of two
                    sorts of rocks, separate or in combination, viz. marly limestones with
                    calcareous or argillaceous marls, and siliceous rocks. The former always shew
                    tubular cavities proceeding upwards, <hi rend="italic">as if gas had passed
                    through the sediment</hi> while soft. The latter consist principally of the
                    cavernous siliceous substance called French burr, in some portions of which are
                    shells.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Upper Marine Group,</hi> consisting of sands and sandstones of
                    various colours, and some conglomerates with a few shells and marly beds.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Lower Fresh-water, or Palaeotherian Group,</hi> consisting of
                    siliceous limestone, marls, clays, and gypsum, with a considerable number of
                    lacustrine shells and bones of extinct pachydermata, and a few land and
                    fresh-water plants.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Lower Marine Formation, or</hi><hi rend="italic">Calcaire

                    marine zoophyta, shells, and fishes, some cetacea, &amp;c. Some sandy beds
                    accompany it, and grains of green silicate of iron.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Plastic Clays and Sands of different colours,</hi> as green,
                    reddish; beds of lignite in the upper part; some limited layers of detrital
                    pebbles in the lower part; few organic remains.</p><p>It will be seen from this brief notice of the tertiaries of the basin of Paris,
                    that they present a marked general agreement with those of Hampshire; similar
                    plastic clays and sands below; similar alternations of fresh-water and marine
                    strata above. Yet the particular differences are even more striking. If the
                    general agreements indicate some predominant analogies of physical conditions,
                    spreading each way from the English channel, these particular differences are no
                    less instructive in shewing the essential diversity of phenomena arising from
                    local circumstances. The lower marine formation of the Paris basin corresponds
                    in geological age with the London clay, and contains the same organic fossils,
                    with many others; but it is a calcareous, and not argillaceous, deposit. The
                    fresh-water formations differ considerably from those of the Isle of Wight, by
                    the prevalence of siliceous concretions and beds, the local production of gypsum
                    and other circumstances.</p><p>It appears by no means unlikely that the lower freshwater beds of the Paris basin
                    are really the equivalent of both the fresh-water deposits of the Isle of Wight,
                    while the upper Parisian deposit from fresh water has more the air of a really
                    lacustrine accumulation, and is the most recent deposit in the district.</p><p>The tertiary series in the south of France has a general analogy to that of the
                    vicinity of Paris; but the differences are great, and, upon the whole, tend to
                    produce a correspondence with that of Italy. The following is the arrangement of

                    with land and river shells; marls, silex, and slaty magnesite with gypsum,
                    containing land and fresh-water exuviae.</p><p>Lower Marine Formation. Calcaire grossier; greensands, &amp;c.; inferior clays,

                    the superficial gravel and detritus, we have three principal terms:</p><p>Upper Snbapennine, or Sicilian deposits. In the Val di Noto is the most complete
                    section of these comparatively recent beds. The uppermost group, which rises in

                    feet thick, stratified, and locally solid. The organic remains are almost
                    exclusively of recent marine species. The middle group is a white calcareous
                    sand or yellow sand, like what is found covering the sub-apennine marls in
                    Italy. The lowest group is a blue argillaceous marl, with numerous fossils,
                    mostly of recent species (Dr Daubeny and Mr LyelD.</p><p>Middle Subapennine deposits. Several thousand feet thick, composed of fine

                    plains which extend from them to the north, we may proceed to offer a short view
                    of the general analogies and distinctions which appear to prevail among the
                    tertiary strata of Europe with reference to <hi rend="italic">geological

                    evident, from comparing the sections given, that no special resemblance of the
                    strata in thickness or mineral composition can be traced, such as we have found
                    to be frequently observable while examining the older strata. All are composed
                    principally of calcareous, arenaceous, and argillaceous matter; but so are all
                    the secondary strata. We do not find in the different regions compared any
                    settled order of succession among the rocks of different nature. The English
                    series has no marine limestone; the Parisian no thick marine clays; the
                    subapennine deposits have little arenaceous matter. It is apparent, in fact,
                    that the tertiary deposits vary as to their mineral composition very much more
                    in relation to locality than to geological time,—a fact which at once sub verts
                    all hope of arranging them in geological chronology by comparison of their
                    mineral constitution. It also leads us to infer that the deposition of tertiary
                    strata took place in arms and gulfs of the sea, which ramified among the masses
                    of land then raised in Europe, and derived sediments of different nature from
                    these different lands. Hence the subalpine tertiaries have one character; those
                    of the subapennines another; the subpyrenean a third; the Parisian a fourth; the
                    English a fifth.</p><p>By prosecuting this research, we find, in fact, that the tertiary formation was
                    sometimes produced in insulated seas, like the Adriatic, and the valleys of the
                    Rhine and Danube; at other times under the influence of the general ocean, as
                    those in the plains of the Garonne; often in basins, like the Parisian series.
                    Thus a principle of classification is indicated, not entirely inapplicable, it
                    is true, to the older strata, because these were also dependent on local
                    conditions, but yet in a peculiar sense appropriate to this comparatively modern
                    system of deposits.</p><p>It is easy, in fact, to perceive, that, by the united effect of so many systems
                    of disturbing movements, the expanded seas, in which the older strata were
                    deposited, had been either completely divided into separate portions, united by
                    narrow straits, or placed under very different relations to oceanic currents and
                    inundations from the land. In consequence, the causes of local diversity, always
                    operating from the very commencement of geological time, approached their
                    maximum of effect in the tertiary periods, and left among contemporaneous marine
                    deposits very slight analogies.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Organic Remains</hi> But the phenomena of organic life offer us
                    another and independent scale of comparison, which the principles of Smith,
                    developed by the researches of Deshayes, and the reasoning of Lyell, have
                    encouraged us to apply to the tertiary strata, for the purpose of determining
                    <hi rend="italic">in each district,</hi> those lines of contemporaneity, with
                    out which geological history has no principle of combination,—no clue to general
                    laws.</p><p>For the sake of precision in our inquiries, let us suppose, in conformity with
                    the general bearing of all the results arrived at by investigations among the
                    earlier strata, that the <hi rend="italic">changes of marine organic life</hi>
                    were, in the region of Europe, during all the tertiary periods, <hi rend="italic">proportional to the time elapsed;</hi> and since the tertiary
                    strata contain forms identical with living species, let us agree to form our
                    scale of geological time, as indicated by the change of organic life, by
                    reference to the present catalogues of invertebral animals living in the sea and
                    fresh-waters.</p><p>According to the proportionate number (or per-centage) of fossil forms identical
                    with living species which are found in any tertiary stratum, its date will be
                    nearer to or further from the epoch of the commencement of the present order and
                    arrangement of living nature. That this principle is strictly and generally
                    true, can neither be proved nor granted; because it is neither proved nor
                    probable that the influential circumstances according to which the changes of
                    organic life proceeded, varied in any place, much less in all places, exactly in
                    proportion to the time elapsed. Yet the change of organic forms is probably the
                    most general and strict measure of time <hi rend="italic">which can be
                    found,</hi> among the tertiary strata; and in adopting it Mr Lyell has certainly
                    entered upon a very interesting train of inquiry, capable perhaps of even more
                    exact application among die strata of older date, when the contemporaneous
                    conditions of different parts of the globe were certainly more uniform than
                    during any part of the tertiary period.</p><p>It is indeed this very diversity of local conditions that makes it extremely
                    doubtful how far we may venture to apply to individual cases the law which
                    perhaps may be true only of the assemblage; just as a mathematical expression
                    for terrestrial temperature of the surface may be quite exact for the mean of a
                    whole zone of latitude, yet not correct in any one point of the whole surface,
                    because of different circumstances.</p><p>For example, the shores of Italy are margined by tertiary deposits, which have
                    been raised out of the existing Mediterranean Sea, and contain many species of
                    marine exuviae still living in that sea, and nowhere else. The vale of the
                    Danube is also full of tertiaries, which contain many shells; but this once
                    tertiary sea has been <hi rend="italic">wholly laid dry,</hi> and all its <hi rend="italic">peculiar</hi> testacea are imbedded in the earth. It is apparent
                    that the fossils of Italian tertiaries will shew numerically greater resemblance
                    to existing species, than those which lie in the contemporaneous deposits of the
                    Danube, the numerical difference being in proportion to the (unknown) number of
                    shells which in a former condition of the globe <hi rend="italic">were peculiar
                    to that now dried tertiary sea.</hi></p><p>Some difficulties connected with the application of the principle to thd
                    comparison of different basins, no time can remove; others will be diminished by
                    further research; and in almost every instance important results will arise from
                    exact researches to test its truth in every separate basin or branch of the old
                    tertiary sea.</p><p>We may now proceed to shew the results of the inquiry conducted by Μ. Deshayes,
                    upon the supposition of the relative antiquity of tertiary beds being inversely
                    proportioned to the per-centage of recent species among its imbedded

                    35 are still living; = 28.2 per cent.</p><p>From these and some other investigations, Μ. Deshayes was led to group the
                    tertiary deposits in three assemblages, viz.—The most ancient, including the
                    Parisian and London and Hampshire beds; those of Valognes, near Cherbourg, and
                    Belgium; Ronca and Castel Gomberto. From this series 1238 species of shells have
                    been examined by Μ. Deshayes, who finds 42 of them, or 3.5 per cent, still
                    living. To these Mr Lyell gives the name of Eocene deposites (⅛j, the dawn; <hi rend="italic">χat,ινt&gt;i,</hi> recent.)</p><p>The middle assemblage includes the beds of Bordeaux, Dax, Touraine, Angers,
                    Baden, Vienna, Hungary, Transylvania, Moravia, and the country north of the
                    Carpathians. Ronca is also provisionally included by Μ. Deshayes, but, as he
                    conjectures, it would be more properly transferred to the older division: 1155
                    species of shells are mentioned, of which 176 are still living, being 15.2 per
                    cent. These are called Meiocene by Mr Lyell <hi rend="italic">(μειων,</hi> less;

                    and the English Crag, 770 species, of which 350 are recent, or 45.4 per cent. To
                    these Mr Lyell gives the name of Pleiocene <hi rend="italic">(τλuaν,</hi> more,
                    and <hi rend="italic">ιttuvoς)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> buthe distinguishes
                    them into two divisions—older pleiocene, including the English crag and middle
                    subapennines of Italy; and newer pleiocene, composed solely of the Sicilian
                    deposits.</p><p>Mr Rogers has lately applied to the tertiaries of North America the results of
                    Deshayes and the nomenclature of Lyell. The species are generally different on
                    the two sides of the Atlantic, both among the tertiary fossils and living
                    shells. The oldest American tertiaries are more analogous in their fossil
                    contents to the secondary rocks than is found to be the case in Europe; they
                    contain 210 species, of which hardly one is recent. The middle tertiary
                    formations (supposed to include meiocene and older pleiocene), contain 195
                    species, of which 40, or 21 per cent., are recent; the most recent (newer
                    pleiocene) are very limited in extent.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Fresh-water Organic Remains of the Tertiary Era.</hi> —In the
                    preceding account of Μ. Deshayes’ tables and Mr Lyell’s nomenclature, we have
                    retained the numerical statements of these authors, though liable to one slight
                    objection, the introduction of the remains of fresh-water and land mollusea.
                    These amount to 259 species, a number too small to influence materially the
                    resulting classification. There are of fresh-water bivalves in the fossil state,
                    30 species; of univalves, 151 species; and of land shells (univalves), 78 ;—in
                    all 259.</p><p>Though the far greater part of these belong to species no longer in existence,
                    all are included in the same genera, and there is no particular reason to be
                    gathered from them for admitting that the climate or local conditions of the
                    land of Europe during the tertiary era was very different from what is now
                    experienced.</p><p>Any one who knows the variation of the forms of existing Limneae and Unionidae in
                    fresh waters of different nature and degrees of agitation, may be forgiven if he
                    does not at once perceive and acknowledge the minute distine tions which really
                    exist between the tertiary and existing fresh-water shells. A small number of
                    fresh-water plants (Characeae, Equisetaceae), occurs in the calcareous deposits
                    of the basin of Paris, and great masses of lignite, derived from land plants in
                    the sands and sandstones of Switzerland, France, and England, and they all shew
                    great analogy to existing plants.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Terrestrial Organic Remains of the Tertiary Era.</hi> These
                    consist of a few land plants and mollusea, with a considerable number of the
                    remains of mammalia. In the fresh-water deposits of Hampshire, Paris, &amp;c.
                    belonging to the eocene period, the bones of certain extinct races of quadrupeds
                    occur, as thcpalaeotherium, anoplotherium,lophiodon,dicho-bune, &amp;c.; with
                    living genera, as vespertilio, canis, seiurus. In the lignite beds of Styria and
                    Switzerland, anthracothe-ria, beavers, &amp;c. abound; in the superficial
                    lacustrine beds of central France, Oeningen, &amp;c. the bones of rhinoceros,
                    felis, ursus, fox, and other modern genera are imbedded. In some cases, as at
                    Georgesgmünd, the bones of extinct genera (palaeotherium, anoplotherium,
                    mastodon); and existing genera, as hippopotamus, horse, ox, mustela, fox, are
                    found together, but this is not generally the case.</p><p>Several instances are known of remains of land mammalia in marine tertiaries, as
                    might easily be imagined from considering how large a proportion of the
                    materials of these strata has been derived from the waste and detritus of the
                    land, swept into the sea by inundations and rivers.</p><p>Bones of the mastodon have been observed in the subapennines of Italy; mastodon,
                    hippopotamus, rhinoceros, lophiodon, horse, deer, hare, &amp;c. in the shelly
                    beds of Touraine; hyaena, rhinoceros, elephant, sus, antelope, in the molasse of
                    Estavayer; castor in the crag of Essex; chloromys, canis, in Volhynia;
                    dichobeve, palaeotherium, in calcaire grossier of Nanterre and Provens.</p><p>From all this it is evident that the history of the terrestrial animals of the
                    tertiary era is embarrassing, and not without great difficulty separated from
                    that of the races of later date.</p><p>Their remains are chiefly preserved to us in lakes which may have existed through
                    a long series of geological changes, and received and mixed together the exuviae
                    of animals living at widely different periods. Auvergne, for example, appears to
                    have been dry land before the commencement of the tertiary period, and the
                    various lakes of central France may be expected to contain traces of all the
                    races ofquadru-peds, which from the commencement of the tertiary even to
                    historical periods lived on that ancient land. The geological date of many of
                    the purely lacustrine tertiaries is entirely unknown; we may perhaps admit that
                    the ossiferous deposit of Oeningen, from which Mr Murchison’s fox was unearthed,
                    is of date somewhat corresponding to the lacustrine beds of Weimar and Gmünd,
                    and the post-tertiary deposit of Market Weighton, and may be sure that they are
                    less removed from our own era than the fresh-water beds of the Parisian basin;
                    we may perceive that palaeo-theria and other extinct genera of pachydermata
                    belong to the older of the tertiary periods, while the elephant, hippopotamus,
                    and felis were more numerous in later days. But, as far as can be at present
                    known, there is no certain criterion of age to be found in the comparison of the
                    fossil reliquiae of land animals.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Igneous Rocks of the Tertiary Era</hi> In England and the
                    Parisian deposits, there is no trace of any irruptive igneous rocks of the date
                    of the tertiary strata, though there are many great disruptions. The south of
                    France is equally free from such admixtures among the marine strata between the
                    Cevennes and the Pyrenees; but amid the ancient lacustrine beds of Auvergne
                    volcanic rocks are abundantly effused. In Catalonia, volcanic phenomena on a
                    smaller scale are noticed; the Euganean Hills, near Venice, are a more
                    considerable example of igneous irrup<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822017" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2017-0216"/>tions among
                    marine tertiaries; the vicinity of Rome and Naples and the Val di Noto, shew
                    abundant proof of volcanic action during this period. Hungary is also full of
                    such monuments, and most of the trap-rocks of the Rhine, and various parts of
                    Germany, probably belong to this era. It is not at all certain that the basaltic
                    rocks of Ireland and Staffa and other parts of Scotland are not referrible to
                    the tertiary period; certainly they are later than the chalk, which they have
                    divided and overflowed.</p><p>The rocks which are thus referred to the tertiary era are principally trachyte
                    and basalt; augitic and fclspathic rocks greatly analogous to, or identical
                    with, products of active volcanos. The appearance presented at the points where
                    the igneous rocks have burst up are such as to leave no doubt that, in all the
                    localities above named, the action was of the same kind as that exerted by an
                    active volcano; the forms and grouping of the hills strengthen the analogy, and
                    we finally must conclude that the igneous action developed over a great part of
                    Europe late in the tertiary period, was in fact volcanic. In some cases, indeed,
                    it is not possible clearly and certainly to separate the products of a modern
                    volcano from those of the eruptions which took place in tertiary periods; as,
                    for example, in Sicily and central France. There is evidence that some of these
                    tertiary volcanos burst forth in the sea, as the Euganean Hills, and spread lava
                    over and amongst the strata then forming; in other cases, as in Velay, the
                    eruptions happened amidst freshwater lakes while the lacustrine sediments were
                    accumulating. ì?he volcanos of the Cantal appear to have followed the deposition
                    of fresh -water limestones comparable to those of Paris and the Isle of Wight.
                    It is perhaps doubtful whether any of the volcanos of this date broke forth in
                    the midst of large tracts of land where no freshwater lakes existed; the
                    Siebengebirge and other Rheinish hills of igneous rocks are no exception, for
                    the Rheinthal has evidently been once filled with water many hundred feet above
                    its present level, as the loss, the trass, and brown coal of the Eifel
                    sufficiently prove.</p><p>The result of the researches of Daubeny and others on the subject of the tertiary
                    igneous products, is to connect them, in a very particular manner, with the
                    history of extinct and active volcanos of later date. In some instances it may
                    be admitted that igneous action, which existed in the tertiary area, has been
                    continued almost to historical times (Auvergne), or even to this day (Etna).</p><p>DISTURBANCES OF STRATA DURING AND AFTER THE TERTIARY PERIOD.</p><p>No more remarkable dislocations are known in the Bri-, tish islands than those
                    two parallel anticlinal axes which broke up the tertiaries of the south of
                    England. These have been already briefly noticed while speaking of the chalk
                    formation. The northern axis, passing east and west from the Vale of Pewsey to
                    near Folkstone, divides the basins of London and Hampshire, which arc, in fact,
                    depressions parallel to this axis, from which the northward slope of the strata
                    under the vales of Thames and the Kennct is extremely rapid, and affects equally
                    the secondary and tertiary strata. It is therefore of posterior date to the last
                    mentioned deposits. The southern axis passes east and west through the middle of
                    the Isle of Wight, and is continued nearly in the same direction through the
                    Isle of Purbeck toward Weymouth, where several great dislocations have been
                    traced by Mr de la Beche and Dr Buckland. The northern slope from this axis is
                    everywhere excessively steep, and, in the western part of the Isle of Wight, the
                    chalk, plastic clays, and sands, and London clay, are absolutely vertical. What
                    adds to the interest of this occurrence in Alum Bay, is the circumstance of the
                    frequent lamination of loose variegated sands and interstratification of beds of
                    lignite and layers of rounded pebbles. At a short distance northward, the
                    depressed beds recover their horizontality, and the same is the case with the
                    elevated strata on the south. Thus, it appears that two hollows and two ridges
                    alternate, their axes being parallel; the northward slope being in both cases
                    violent, and the southern moderate. These ridges are, in fact, scarcely to be
                    called anticlinal axes produced by vertical elevation; they resemble more the
                    effect of oblique movement of flexible masses. A singular effect is produced by
                    the southern dislocation in the flints imbedded in the chalk. They arc
                    penetrated by secret fissures, and fall to pieces on being removed from their
                    situations, an effect probably resulting from violent pressure on these elastic
                    masses.</p><p>The geographical features of the south-eastern parts of England depend almost
                    entirely on these great lines of disturbed strata, and we may from this learn to
                    view, without surprise, the greater phenomena of the same kind which have been
                    brought to light by the labours of continental geologists. It appears certain
                    that the Pyrenean chain has undergone clevatory movements since the deposition
                    of some of the tertiary strata; the whole chain of the Alps has certainly been
                    raised since the formation of most or all of the tertiary strata, for it bears
                    upon several of its high crests, and in its mountain valleys, not only
                    secondary, but also tertiary beds, as on the Righi and on the Diablerets
                    according to Brongniart, and in the Valley of Gosau, according to Murchison.
                    Parts of Sicily have also been uplifted, even since the deposition of rocks
                    holding 95 per cent of existing species, to an elevation of 3000 feet</p><p>Besides those local and violent elevations, it cannot be doubted that the whole
                    surface of Europe has been raised to varions degrees by more gradual action,
                    since the time of the formation of the marine tertiaries which fill the valleys
                    of the Danube and the Rhine, the secluded basins of Bohemia and Hungary, and the
                    great plains of northern Germany, Poland, and Russia.</p><p>The precise (geologicaD date of these elevations, whether violent or gradual, is
                    one of the most difficult of geological problems; but it is certain that some
                    happened during, and most of them subsequently to, the accumulation of the
                    marine strata of the tertiary period. The general effect was therefore clearly
                    to augment continually the dry land surface of Europe; to establish the various
                    relations of fresh-water drainage at successive times; to permit the
                    accumulation of fresh-water lakes; to allow of the conditions whereto the life
                    of terrestrial and fluviatile animals is adjusted, and thus to offer analogies
                    in all respects to the present order of natural causes and events.</p><p>RELATION OF TERTIARY TO HISTORICAL PERIODS.</p><p>Of all the classes or assemblages of aqueous deposits, that which is the nearest
                    to our own days in point of date is the least exact in its boundaries and
                    characters. While, concerning the older periods, the problem of the condition of
                    the globe was principally confined to considerations relating to the sea, and
                    thus the phenomena could be investigated according to fixed principles,
                    applicable to at least the greater number of strata; the tertiary deposits
                    compel us to enter also upon more complicated researches connected with the
                    land: and, in discussing the history of still later phenomena, all the
                    variations of physical geography assume still higher degrees of importance. The
                    consequence is an amount of local diversity so great as to nearly annihilate all
                    generality of result.</p><p>Moreover, the difficulties of this subject are augmented by a circumstance which
                    is likely to become daily more and more influential on geological reasoning
                    ;—the want of a principle upon which to define the limit of least antiquity of
                    this group of strata. What, in fact, is meant by supra<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822030" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2030-0217"/>tertiary
                    deposits? If we substitute for this term modern aqueous products, do we
                    understand it the better? Or, attempting analysis, if we adopt as an equivalent
                    expression the diluvial and alluvial accumulations, how are these to be defined?
                    It is evident that here is a serious embarrassment</p><p>What is meant by tertiary strata? If we should venture to include in this title
                    all really marine deposits posterior to the chalk, even such as were only
                    yesterday raised from the bed of the sea, it would be more intelligible than the
                    methods now followed by geologists. For with the tertiary strata of Europe
                    begins that extreme <hi rend="italic">analogy</hi> of the specific forms of
                    organic life, that <hi rend="italic">identity</hi> of generic conformation,
                    which at once announces great and general differences of physical condition
                    between them and the older strata, and equally great resemblances to the present
                    order of things. Such results apply to marine, fresh-water, and terrestrial
                    life; and, as far as yet appears, (but the evidence is very incomplete), nearly
                    in an equal proportion to each.</p><p>Moreover, the changes, to judge either by marine or terrestrial animals, which
                    brought the extinction of old, and the creation of new races, were gradual. From
                    the Parisian formations, containing 96 per cent, of extinct marine mollusea, and
                    something like the same proportion of extinct land quadrupeds, to the Sicilian
                    strata, which contain 95 per cent, of existing species of marine shells, and*the
                    lacustrine deposits of Oeningen and Weighton, in which the molluscous remains
                    are wholly, and the quadrupedal rcli-quiae partially, undistinguishable from
                    living types, every intermediate term may be interpolated so asto constitute a
                    real and complete series of monuments of the gradual substitution of one race
                    for another.</p><p>Assuming, for the moment, this conclusion of the gradual change from the oldest
                    tertiary to the actual phenomena of nature, supposing that all the organic and
                    inorganic phenomena produced in the interval from the date of the cretaceous
                    deposits to the present era, may be ranked in one great system, like those
                    adopted for earlier periods, where shall we place the point of union between the
                    modem or historical and the ancient or geological scales of time? In other
                    words, To what part of the supracretaceous period shall we refer the creation of
                    man?</p><p>To this important question impartiality must allow that geology gives no clear
                    and certain answer. Geology has no evidence on the subject that is at all of a
                    positive character. We believe that the older stratified rocks were preadamitic
                    for four reasons; because no trace of man or his works have ever been seen in
                    them; because no remains of animals and plants occur in them which can be
                    considered the same or very similar to the existing forms of life; because land
                    quadrupeds generally are almost utterly unknown in them; because the physical
                    conditions of the globe were entirely different from what we now behold.</p><p>Let us apply these tests to the supracretaceous deposits. In none of those which
                    have been formed in the sea have we yet found the remains of man or his works;
                    but remains of animals and plants, identical or very similar to existing kinds,
                    are found even in the oldest of them; land quadrupeds occur both in fresh-water
                    and marine strata which are among the earliest <hi rend="italic">eocene</hi>
                    tertiary deposits; and, finally, the physical conditions of the globe were, at
                    the beginning of the period, very similar to the present, and this similarity
                    continually augmented.</p><p>It is evident that all the probabilities point to the conclusion, that the
                    creation of man, and all the new arrangements connected with that event, are to
                    be placed in some part of the supracretaceous period; but in what part, is to be
                    determined by further and cautious research. We cannot undertake to decide so
                    important a problem upon the mere negative evidence of <hi rend="italic">the
                    absence of human remains</hi> from tertiary deposits, because such negative
                    applies only to the European and North American tertiaries, none other being
                    explored. Moreover, the deposition of human remains in marine tertiaries must be
                    supposed to have been extremely rare and exceptional cases; nor could they be
                    expected to occur often even in lacustrine or fluviatile deposits. But, as
                    before observed, this negation, however important, is yet only a local truth;
                    human remains may yet be found in tertiary strata in other parts of the globe;
                    nor would it excite surprise if, among 95 per cent, of existing species of
                    marine mollusea in the Sicilian tertiaries, human bones should once be met with.
                    Or if never in European regions this result should arrive, who is to assure us
                    that, in countries more early peopled than these “far western isles,” neither
                    lakes nor estuaries of the tertiary era received and preserved some remains of
                    man, or traces of his works?</p><p>As far as direct observation or satisfactory inference goes, every honest
                    geologist will allow that he is ignorant of the point of union between the
                    historical and geological scales of time: that the era of human existence, if
                    recorded in geological monuments, has not yet been discovered among the small
                    number which have been fully decyphered.</p><p>But, where certainty cannot be had, it is right to enquire into probabilities. It
                    seems fair to admit, both with reference to historical testimony and sound views
                    of the economy of creation, that the existence, in any country, of a
                    considerable number of the animals which now contribute to the comforts and
                    necessities of the human race, is evidence of the establishment, in that
                    country, of the conditions within which Providence has restricted the existence
                    of man. No created terrestrial being is capable, by natural constitution, of
                    sustaining such variety of external physical conditions as man can brave through
                    the exertion of those divine faculties which lift him above the inferior tribes
                    of creation; if, then, the bones of the horse, the ox, the deer, the dog,—of
                    hares, rabbits, beavers, foxes, and other characteristic animals of the present
                    creation,. are found in lacustrine tertiaries, what is to prevent our receiving,
                    as the <hi rend="italic">most probable indirect inference,</hi> that the era of
                    the creation of man had arrived when these strata were accumulated?</p><p>Let us adopt this inference though it be indirect, and, without further
                    refinement, which the state of ignorance in which we really are forbids, let us
                    admit that many of the lacustrine tertiaries are of date posterior to the
                    formation of man and the present general arrangement of the terrestrial
                    creation. We shall then class these and a variety of later marine and fluviatile
                    deposits which have many characters in common, as <hi rend="smallcaps">Superficial</hi> aqueous <hi rend="smallcaps">Deposits</hi> of the most <hi rend="italic">modern</hi> geological <hi rend="italic">period,</hi> and consider
                    them in relation to many contemporaneous products of subterranean heat.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">superficial aqueous deposits.</hi></p><p>Resolved to conform, as much as truth permits, to the present views of
                    geologists, from a conviction that they need rather a cautious limitation, than
                    any essential change, —we shall adopt the following simple classification,
                    suited to the condition of the land and sea in the modern geological period.</p><p>1. Marine deposits, . . (a) raised from the sea, or (5) yet in progress;</p><p>2.

Fluviatile and lacustrine deposits, terminated, or yet in progress ;—and in
                    each case endeavour to bring forward the history of the phenomena to the present

                    of testacea, should be ranked in this period, may perhaps be doubtful; but they
                    furnish at least a point of departure, and shew us, on a great scale, the
                    magnitude of effects produced by elevatory volcanic action. Just as these, and,
                    in older times, the other tertiaries of the Mediterranean shores, were uplifted,
                    and thus the ancient seabed was laid dry for man’s examination; so we find,
                    along the shores of the Baltic, the west coast of Scandinavia, the east and west
                    coasts of Scotland and England, the south coast of England, the west coast of
                    France, and the east coast of Ireland, as well as on the coasts of North and
                    South America, proof of the partial rising of the land and neighbouring bed of

                    1829) has the merit of calling the attention of geologists to this phenomenon of
                    local elevation of the bed of the sea. He gives a clear summary of the facts
                    noticed at a great number of interesting points; and attributes the effects
                    observed to a general lowering of the oceanic waters, which he supposes to have
                    been the last of the great geological phenomena which have modified generally
                    the relations of the outline and height of the lands to the area and level of
                    the sea. In conformity with this conclusion, he carries back the date of such
                    elevations beyond the historical era,—remarking that no trace of human reliquiae
                    occur among the gravel and shells of those elevated tracts.</p><p>The real date of many or most of these elevations must be allowed to be unknown;
                    but the cause assigned by Μ. Brongniart is inadmissible, being contrary to
                    physical probabilities, and inadequate to the explanation of the particular
                    phenomena.</p><p><hi rend="italic">English Shores.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> One of the most
                    remarkable examples is that observed by Mr William Gilbertson of Preston, on the
                    coast of Lancashire, of which Mr Murchison gave the following notice at the York
                    Meeting of the British Association. “The deposit consists, near the surface, of
                    clay with bouldered rocks, covering great thickness of marl, gravel, and sand,
                    the sand being usually the lowest. These accumulations are not only spread over
                    the broad delta extending from the coast at Blackpool to Preston in the
                    interior; but they rise at the latter place into considerable eminences,
                    extending in plateaus on the banks of the Ribble and the Derwent for several
                    miles inland. In certain places the marls, sands, and gravels contain shells of
                    existing species (Mr Gilbertson enumerates above twenty species), not differing
                    from those of the adjacent sea, above which they were found at various heights
                    from 80 to 300 feet. The accumulations seldom offer proofs of regular bedding or
                    tranquil deposit, but rather resemble the detritus found upon an agitated shore;
                    although, in their diversity of structure, they present distinct evidence of
                    having been heaped up during a long protracted period.” (Among the shells we
                    have seen Turritella terebra, Cardium edule, &amp;c.)</p><p>Sir Philip Egerton has lately found a bed of gravel containing marine shells of
                    recent species, at the Willington, in Cheshire, at the base of the “Forest
                    Hills,” seventy or eighty feet above the Mersey. This bed of ferruginous gravel
                    and pebbles, <hi rend="italic">unlike the usual gravel of Cheshire,</hi> was
                    found to contain Turritella terebra, Cardium edule, Murex erinaceus, and others.
                    <hi rend="italic">Over this shelly bed</hi> was the ordinary sandy diluvium of
                    Cheshire, full of boulders of many rocks.</p><p>Mr Trimmer found marine shells (Cardium, Turritella, and Buccinum) in the sand
                    and clay at Runcorn, several feet above the level of the tide, and under a
                    deposit of peat, which was covered by sand and gravel.</p><p>Near Shrewsbury, Mr Trimmer has noticed marine shells of existing species
                    (Turritella terebra, Cardium edule, Tellina solidula, &amp;c.) in transported
                    gravel and sand, resting on a peat-bog, which contains imbedded trees (oak,

                    Shrewsbury, he found fragments of marine shells.</p><p>From these and other data, Mr Murchison has been led to entertain the opinion of

                    fragmentary, h'ad lost their gelatine, and consisted of Bucci· num, Venus,
                    Natica, and Turbo. The subjacent rocks are worn and scratched by friction of the
                    transported pebbles.</p><p>On the east coast of the island, we have, in the valley of the Forth (according
                    to Boué, Maclaren, &amp;c.), terraces: at some height above the water,
                    containing Ostrea edulis, Mytilus edulis, Cardium edule. Turbo littoreus,
                    Patella vulgaris, Donax truncatulus, and other littoral shells. Similar facts
                    are noticed on the Clyde by Captain Laskey; on Loch Lomond by Adamson. On the
                    Yorkshire coast, an excellent example of this kind of elevation of the bed of
                    the sea has been found on the lower part of the clay cliffs of Speeton. <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> The yellow sandy beds here occurring have much the

                    violent agitation, either on the shells or on the deposit.</p><p>Farther south, the shelly gravel described in the <hi rend="italic">Geology of

                    difference of origin—to diluvial currents, rather than a mere elevation of a
                    beach,—will complete our view of the subject. These sandy and gravelly beds rise
                    to twenty or forty feet above the tide, and in their contorted and violently
                    confused layers, among pebbles of all the northern and western rocks of
                    Yorkshire and Cumberland, he the strong shells of Turbolittoreus, Purpura

                    them is an extinct shell. This shelly gravel passes under a deposit of peat and
                    alluvial sediment.</p><p>Marine shells also occur in the gravel of Holme, on Spalding Moor, far inland,
                    and a hundred feet above the sea.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Norway and Sweden</hi> offer considerable examples of these
                    uplifted shelly littoral deposits. At Figa-elv, in the northern part of Norway,
                    according to Ström, broken shells occur more than 150 metres (490 feet) above
                    the sea. At Suroë and Tromsoë, further south, they occur a few metres above the
                    sea: also near Drontheim.</p><p>Μ. Brongniart describes minutely the shelly deposits of Uddevalla, in the
                    province of Gotheburg, on the west coast of Sweden. Here, in a little bay
                    bordered with rocks of gneiss, great quantities of shells occur nearly in a
                    perfect condition, 70 metres above the sea (230 feet). The shells are those of
                    the neighbouring sea. And to shew how truly the phenomenon indicates a relative
                    change of level of land and water, Μ. Bχongniart found <hi rend="italic">Balani</hi><hi rend="italic">still adhering to the gneiss rock;</hi> proving
                    the spot on which the testaceous animals are found to have been really the
                    littoral bed of the sea.</p><p>The whole subject of the elevated beds of marine shells in Scandinavia has lately
                    been investigated by Mr Lyell, who finds them near Stockholm, 30 feet, 70 feet,
                    and 100 feet above the sea, in sand and gravel, or in marl resting on gneiss. In
                    one place <hi rend="italic">a fishing hut</hi> was found under 64 feet of shelly
                    violet-coloured marls. The shells observed in the different localities were all
                    residents of the Baltic, viz. Cardium edule, Tellina baltica, Mytilus edulis,
                    Littorina<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822056" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2056-0219"/> crassior, Littorina littorea, Paludina ulvae,
                    Neritina fluviatilis (which lives in the Baltic). A land-shell, Bulimus
                    lubricus; was also found. Near Upsala, thick clays, which lie over the gneiss
                    and granite, contain Tellina baltica, Mytilus edulis, a small flustra and fuci,
                    60 to 80 feet above the sea. In a ridge of sand and gravel, a violet-coloured
                    marl-bed, 80 feet above the sea, yielded Mytilus edulis, Cardium edule, Tellina
                    baltica, Littorina littorea, Paludina ulvae?</p><p>On visiting Uddevalla, the'adherence of Balani was noticed in a new situation,
                    with cellepora ;—the quantity of shells lying in stratified clays, sand, and
                    gravel, reminded Mr Lyell of Parisian tertiaries. Twenty-seven species of
                    mollusea, and one echinus, were collected in a day. Among these are four
                    zoophagous mollusea, not met with on the Swedish side, nor now existing in the
                    Baltic, but found in the open sea. At several other ports on the western coast
                    near Gothenburg, marine shells, in beds of clay, and sand, and gravel, were
                    found at different heights above the sea. They also occur fifty miles from the
                    coast, west of Lake Wener. Thus it is evident that the bounds of the ocean have
                    here been greatly contracted since the present species of testacea began to
                    inhabit the Baltic and the neighbouring parts of the German Ocean. <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.)</hi><hi rend="italic">Near St Michel</hi><hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">Lhermes</hi> (Charente inferieure et La

                    highest tides. These hills are wholly composed of marine shells, solid in
                    texture, with their colour preserved, and valves generally united, so as to
                    indicate tranquil residence in the sea.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Near Nice,</hi> Risso has noticed perfectly preserved marine

                    seen near False Bay, Cape of Good Hope, 66 metres above the sea.</p><p>At Guadaloupe, St Domingo, on the coast of North America, on the western coast of
                    South America, in the Red Sea, in Timor, and on the north-east coast of Iceland,
                    the same phenomena occur,—the shells in all cases resembling those of the
                    adjacent seas.</p><p>As far as regards the elevation of these shelly beds above the sea, either a
                    gradual rising, or a sudden uplifting, will equally explain the greater number
                    of cases; some may suit with the one, and some with the other explanation. But
                    the most important thing to remark is, that the shells have not been laid in
                    their present situation by any sudden violence of water. Generally the great
                    masses of diluvium, and the large and far-travelled boulders, which are supposed
                    to indicate cataclysmal movements, <hi rend="italic">lie upon such shelly
                    beds.</hi></p><p>In a few instances it may be reasonable to attribute the accumulation of the
                    shells to currents set in motion by local convulsions. We should prefer this
                    view for the phenomena of the southern part of Yorkshire, near Hedon, but are
                    <hi rend="italic">sure,</hi> on the contrary, that the Speeton sand-bed was
                    formed under the sea; and adopt the same view for the phenomena in Sweden and
                    Norway, the coast of Lancashire, the interior of Cheshire, the valleys of the
                    Forth and Clyde, and indeed generally.</p><p>Who would have imagined, before Von Buch’s and Brongniart’s researches in
                    Uddevalla, and Lyell’s journey to other parts of Scandinavia, that so
                    considerable a part of the coasts of the present islands and continents should
                    be proved to have been the gift of subterranean movements, since the present
                    race of marine animals were called into being? Yet, now that it is known, who
                    does not perceive, in these modern phenomena, the consequence of the same causes
                    as those to which geologists have long appealed for explaining the elevation of
                    older sea-beaches,—like the English crag or submarine sediments, like the
                    subapennine or Sicilian strata? Further, the inquiries of Mr Lyell in
                    Scandinavia, as to the elevation of the coasts of that peninsula <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.</hi> 1835), go far to prove that the elevatory
                    process is there still, however slowly, in action. However the yet disputed
                    point of the uprising of the Chilian coast in 1822 may be settled, it is
                    undoubted that many such risings, to a greater extent, have happened in those
                    parts. The retient personal investigations of Mr Darwin have shewn that large
                    tracts in Patagonia are nothing else than a sea-bed, raised in modern times,
                    that is, since the creation of the present races of marine mollusea; and that
                    strata of corresponding age form part of the double Cordilleras of the southern
                    part of America. Thus, we are entitled to admit, among the effects of existing
                    causes, <hi rend="italic">partial vertical movements</hi> of the land.</p><p><hi rend="italic">b. Submarine Deposits still in progress.</hi></p><p>Much of what goes on in the sea is entirely unknown to us. In fact it is only
                    along the shores, at the mouths of rivers, and in shallow gulfs and seas, that
                    we have any positive measures of the changes which take place in the bed of the
                    mysterious deep. Nor have we yet obtained from the sounding line so much, or so
                    exact instruction as nautical experience might furnish. How far into the sea
                    currents of given velocity may transport sedimentary grains of given magnitude
                    and specific gravity, is matter of calculation (Babbage); how far, in fact, the
                    supernatant fresh waters can carry their earthy admixture, has been, in one
                    instance, ascertained (River Amazons, Captain Sabine); thus we learn that
                    sedimentary strata are really forming, with great regularity, over great spaces
                    of the ocean bed; and this knowledge is of high theoretical value. But still it
                    is to the shores that we must ever turn for data to serve as bases for
                    comparison between modern and ancient marine deposits.</p><p>Here we see that the materials which the sea obtains from the wasting cliffs,
                    rivers, and floods, are partly transported away by currents, and especially
                    during storms, to considerable distances, but principally drifted coastways, and
                    deposited in times of tranquillity, or in retired situations, especially where
                    the land is low and protected by far sloping banks, so as to augment incessantly
                    the area of the low marshy tracts at the expense of the higher ground. In
                    distributing the materials which fall from the cliffs, the agitation of the sea
                    produces an effect of the same kind as the operation of washing a mixture of
                    metallic ores and various spars; it separates the ingredients according to
                    magnitude and specific weight,—the heavy and large masses are left on the beach
                    for slow distribution over the sloping surface or gradual descent into the
                    deep,—the coarse sand is urged onward by the tide, as a river pushes forward its
                    bed, but the finer clays mix with the water, remain long suspended, and are
                    carried to great distances, to be deposited wherever the sea stagnates, either
                    by expansion over level surfaces, or opposition of the freshes.</p><p>It is evident that the modern deposits of the sea are pebbly where the agitation
                    is great, sandy where it. is moderate, and argillaceous where it is little.</p><p>In general, the deep sea deposits (exceptions may be necessary where currents of
                    great force prevail in shallow seas like the German Ocean) must be of finer
                    grain than those near the shore. The surfaces of contemporaneous deposition are
                    slopes rising every where toward the shore, where alone they become, for a very
                    short distance, steep.</p><p>What becomes of the calcareous matter swept down to the sea is not fully known.
                    The formation of durable coralline and molluscous exuviae from the sea will
                    account for the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822069" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2069-0220"/> consumption of much of this earth; and, in
                    particular cases, Mr Lyell’s remark of the formation of calcareous beds at the
                    mouth of the Rhone will apply. But chemistry has not yet determined the <hi rend="italic">statical</hi> composition of the sea, and, of course, it is
                    utterly unknown what <hi rend="italic">variations</hi> volcanic eruptions,
                    gaseous emanations, changing temperature, unequal pressure, and other causes,
                    may occasion. Dredgings, soundings, and the experience of fishermen and divers
                    in the German Ocean, Adriatic, and English Channel, inform us of the
                    distribution of living zoophyta, mollusea, fishes, and crustacea, and of the
                    parts of their decayed bodies. Certain tribes of mollusea, like the oyster, the
                    coral, the mussel, inhabit limited breadths of the argillaceous, sandy, or rocky
                    shores and shallows. Crustacea, pleuronectida, and other fishes, have their
                    certain localities. The teeth of some fishes are noticed as being loose in the
                    bed of the sea. The growth of the Coral Islands, if it be generally like that of
                    the Bermudas, as described by Lieutenant Neilson (<hi rend="italic">Geological
                    Proceedings),</hi> offers greater analogies than might have been expected to the
                    ancient zoophytic limestones, not only in the mass of matter, but in the
                    irregular and partial distribution of the polyparia, the admixture of earthy and
                    compact carbonate of lime, inclusion of shells, and partial stratification.</p><p>Could we raise, for inspection, the shallow German Ocean, the unequal depths of
                    the Mediterranean, the Gulf of Mexico or the base of some volcanic group of the
                    southern ocean, what variety would meet our eyes! shelly deposits, coralloidal
                    limestones, volcanic sediments, submarine lavas, strata of red and variously
                    coloured clays and lignites,—almost nothing in common; contemporaneous
                    difference carried to extreme; local diversity, overcoming all general
                    agreement. Yet all the parts of this picture can be paralleled in the older
                    marine deposits,—the only difference being a greater analogy of the
                    contemporaneous effects,—a more decided and real relation of the phenomena to
                    time; proof of the sequence of effects being due to successive general changes
                    of physical condition,—these changes continually altering the original aspect of
                    nature, continually tending to diversify the uniformity and complicate the
                    simplicity of the primeval state of the globe. Thus irregularity of surface,
                    diversity of local phenomena, deviations of temperature, had always gone on
                    augmenting till the globe assumed that inexhaustible variety of external
                    conditions which harmonizes with its present rich adornment of vegetable and
                    animal life, and continually excites and rewards the curiosity of the wonderful
                    being who was placed by his Maker at the head of his last living creation.</p><p>2. DETRITAL DEPOSITS.</p><p><hi rend="italic">a. Erratic Block Group.</hi></p><p>Since the time when the whole stratified crust of the globe was supposed to have
                    subsided from a universal flood of water, the geological effects ascribed to the
                    historical deluge, and other violent agitations of water, have continually
                    diminished. It is not many years since we were familiar with the doctrine of the
                    excavation of valleys and the accumulation of detritus over large surfaces of
                    the globe being due to diluvial action; and now a large class of geologists,
                    with Mr Greenough at their head, declare themselves “incapable of distinguishing
                    between the effects of such a deluge or deluges, and subsequent phenomena
                    produced by the ordinary agency of running water.” There are geologists who
                    would gladly expunge the word diluvial from our nomenclature, and instead of
                    appealing to one or several general convulsions for the explanation of some
                    striking fact, are willing to believe that small and local forces, operating
                    through long time, are sufficient for the purpose of geological speculation.</p><p>In many instances, we concede to these writers, that streams wandering in any
                    required direction, over ground indefinitely variable in level, might, in the
                    course of unlimited time, transport detritus in directions not possible during
                    the present or any prior <hi rend="italic">statical</hi> condition of the
                    earth’s surface. But who will grant these postulates for the purpose of avoiding
                    the appeal to sudden and energetic disturbances of the relative level of land
                    and water, that has seen the enormous dislocations of the carboniferous system
                    of South Wales and the north of England, the prodigious and extended faults in
                    the south of England chalk, imagined to himself the uprising of a chain of
                    mountains like the Alps, or witnessed the enormous conglomerates on their
                    flanks? And if a ease can be adduced so circumstanced that those postulates must
                    be rejected, on good geological evidence, what is to be done but to allow the
                    alternative, viz. the occurrence of great and violent movements of large bodies
                    of water, partial, though not general, deluges? <hi rend="subscript"> b</hi></p><p>Such a case, it has been long supposed, was furnished by the examination of the
                    dispersion of great blocks of the high Alps over Switzerland, and through the
                    passages of the Jura into France; another example was found in the drifted
                    sienites and limestones of Sweden, which lie in Northern Germany; a third in the
                    transported masses from the Cumbrian mountains; a fourth in Canada.</p><p>The erratic blocks, as the larger boulders are called, which have been
                    transported from the Alps, are most remarkable on the eastern face of the Jura,
                    which looks towards the Alps, over the vale of the Arve and the Lake of Geneva.
                    On the Jura, 1500 to 2000 feet above the Lake of Geneva, crowning the hills and
                    filling the valleys and rocky glens; in and around the Lake of Geneva and the
                    valley of the Arve, as well as along the valleys which descend from the Alps,
                    these blocks abound. It is observed that the blocks abound opposite to the
                    embouchures of these valleys, and that distinct sets of blocks, derived from
                    different mountains, have followed the lines of the different valleys. The
                    blocks in the valley of the Rhine have come from the Grisons; those by the Lake
                    of Zurich and the course of the Limmat were drifted from Glaris; blocks from the
                    source of the Reuss have followed this river; the blocks of the Aar, and the
                    slopes of the neighbouring Jura, have come from the ranges of the Oberland of
                    Berne. From these facts, and the circumstance that the height to which the
                    blocks have ascended the Jura is greatest opposite the valleys which descend
                    from the Alps, no doubt can be entertained that the currents flowed from these
                    mountains in many directions, and followed the line of the present valleys.</p><p>It appears the most probable view of these phenomena, that a general and violent
                    convulsion of the Alps, while they were surrounded by water (whether fresh or
                    salt we cannot decide), caused powerful currents to rush away from the axis of
                    movement, bearing ice-rafts loaded with the loosened rocks. Thus might large
                    boulders of particular rocks be accumulated in groups, as we find them on the
                    Salève near Geneva, and in various parts of the Jura, or distributed in single
                    masses over the vale of the Aar and the Lake of Geneva, then full of water, by
                    the damming of the Rhine at Basle, and the Rhone at Fort d’Ecluse. Thus it seems
                    conceivable that, in the agitation of the movement of water, some rocks might
                    find their way through the openings of the Jura into the plains of France.</p><p>This explanation appeared satisfactory to Venturi, reasoning on the phenomena of
                    the south side of the Alps. It has been suggested from the case of the blocks on
                    the drainage of the St Lawrence, and is proposed as the most probable view of
                    the facts observed concerning the multitudes of rock masses which have crossed
                    the Baltic, and dropped in heaps on the plains of Northern Germany, Poland<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822082" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2082-0221"/>,
                    and Russia, from the Ems and the Weser, to the Dwina and even the Neva. These
                    blocks are grouped in narrow elliptical areas, with the longer axis pointing
                    north and south, or toward the Baltic; they often lie on the surface, especially
                    the larger blocks, hardly ever at great depths. They consist principally of
                    granite, sienite, porphyry, and transition limestones, with characteristic
                    fossils which can be exactly paralleled in the southern parts of Sweden, and
                    nowhere else. On crossing from Zealand to Scania, the traces of blocks reappear.
                    The surface of Scania is covered with them; and farther north they abound in
                    elongated hills called “Oasar” (analogous to the word “escar” in Ireland),
                    ranging north-north-east to south-south-west. The blocks are more numerous on
                    the Swedish side of the Baltic, nearer their origin, but not larger. Worn and
                    polished surfaces among the primary rocks of Sweden are attributed to the
                    transport of heavy bodies.</p><p>The dispersion of blocks from the Cumbrian group of mountains is extremely
                    remarkable; and the example is more valuable to geology than most others of this
                    nature, from the exactness with which the circumstances are ascertained. There
                    are also peculiar relations of the tracks followed by the blocks to the ancient
                    physical features of the country.</p><p>In the Cumbrian mountain group, the granites, sienites, porphyries, and
                    metamorphic slates, are more or less peculiar in character, and easily
                    recognisable. , The granite of Ravenglass, on the western border of this region,
                    has been drifted to the south, across the sea, along the flat or hollow of
                    Lancashire west of the Penine chain, and over the plains of Cheshire and
                    Shropshire, toward the vale of the Severn. In this long course, the quantity of
                    pebbles and boulders of the Cumbrian rocks is considerable; and it is evident,
                    that the currents, whatever they were, which carried the boulders, respected the
                    present levels of the country, so far as never once to cross the Penine chain to
                    the eastward, nor to penetrate far into the principality or the border
                    districts, where, Mr Murchison assures us, the gravelly deposits are all derived
                    from the neighbouring hills. From the eastern side of the Cumbrian mountains the
                    porphyritic granite of Shap Fell, and the sienite of Carrock Fell, have been
                    transported northward to Carlisle, southward by Kendal and Kirby Lonsdale, to
                    beyond Lancaster, eastward over the vale of’Eden, and up the Penine escarpment
                    at Stainmoor, above Brough. Having here mounted the summit, the boulders diverge
                    to the east by north, east and south-east, cross many lower ridges, traverse and
                    descend the vales of York and Cleveland, and sweep over the oolitic moors and
                    the chalk wolds to the sea-side at Scarborough and Flamborough-Head, a distance
                    of 110 miles. In this passage three ridges of anciently elevated land, and two
                    deep geologically ancient vales, were crossed: yet the water so far respected
                    the elevations of ground now existing, as not to cross the Penine chain at more
                    than one, and that <hi rend="italic">the lowest point opening directly to the
                    west,</hi> and to avoid the highest part of the oolitic moors. What renders this
                    more curious and complete is the circumstance, that one of the valleys crossed
                    (the vale of Eden), 1000 feet below the origin of the granite, and 1000 feet
                    below Stainmoor, is a valley caused by dislocation of the carboniferous system
                    <hi rend="italic">prior to the new red sandstone era,</hi> and the date of the
                    dispersion of the blocks is since the newest tertiaries in the north of
                    England.</p><p>If, however, following the indications of the phenomena, we refer, in every case,
                    the dispersion of the blocks to the uplifting of particular mountain groups, and
                    this is almost a certain inference, we may perhaps admit, in the neighbourhood
                    of such groups, temporary variations, or <hi rend="italic">undulations</hi> of
                    the land, like those which accompany earthquakes, sufficiently extensive, when
                    combined with the agitation of the sea, to permit the water to take, for a short
                    period, directions previously and subsequently impossible. That the whole was
                    the effect of a very short period, is the universal impression of all
                    observers.</p><p>It is evident from all that has been proved, inferred, and admitted on the
                    subject of the <hi rend="italic">erratic blocks,</hi> that they were derived
                    from particular mountain groups, drifted thence to limited, though considerable
                    distances, along lines which respect the present levels of the country, both as
                    to height and direction. They lie generally at the surface of the superficial
                    marine diluvium, and speak plainly of great and violent convulsions. Yet it is
                    already certain that they are monuments of merely local however violent
                    disturbance, not proofs of universal or even very great or general floods.</p><p>From each mountain group, the blocks have gone in directions corresponding with
                    its slopes and the configuration of the neighbouring country. Many local centres
                    of subterranean movement may thus have simultaneously or successively thrown off
                    their rocky fragments; some of these, with other materials, were washed by the
                    waves over surfaces momentarily changed in level by the concussion, others
                    drifted on icebergs to great distances and quietly dropped on the surface. The
                    phenomena, then, are merely a continuation of those which have been proved to
                    occur in older times, with this difference, that <hi rend="italic">they</hi>
                    were for the most part performed in the sea, which reduced the products to a
                    stratified form; <hi rend="italic">these</hi> irregularly accumulated on the
                    land.</p><p>Nothing in modern times so nearly approaches these effects, as the iceberg
                    detached from glacier-covered shores in Arctic regions, floated hundreds of
                    miles by oceanic currents, and dropping its load of rocks and detritus in
                    distant regions. Could we witness the elevation of the bed of the northern
                    ocean, would it not shew a group of detritus somewhat analogous to that of the
                    erratic blocks; might we farther suppose the ice-borne detritus to be forcibly
                    thrown over the land, would not the resemblance be perfect?</p><p><hi rend="italic">b. Ossiferous Gravel, Clay, §c.</hi></p><p>Since the publication of Dr Buckland’s valuable work, the “Reliquiae Diluvianae,”
                    and Cuvier’s magnificent volumes, entitled “Ossemens Fossils,” the attention of
                    zoologists and geologists has been in an especial degree attracted to the
                    superficial deposits containing bones of quadrupeds mostly extinct, and
                    belonging to genera often no longer met with but in far distant regions.</p><p>These quadrupedal remains are found in gravel and clay, in caverns, and fissures,
                    under various circumstances indicating different mechanical and vital
                    conditions, though still, by many geologists, ranked with erratic blocks under
                    the one general and vague title of “diluvial deposits.” This is certainly
                    inexact, yet it is not to be thought that the arrangement has been founded on no
                    real analogy; on the contrary, all that is yet known appears to shew that what
                    have been called diluvial deposits, however different in origin, have all the
                    common bond which in geology is most important, viz. time. For throughout all
                    these deposits, the quadrupedal remains have a general uniformity of character,
                    and a common degree of difference from the existing races of animals, which
                    points to high antiquity, but not to the remote eras of the early tertiary
                    deposits. Even a brief history of the discoveries in this field of research
                    would fill a volume-even a mere selection of remarkable phenomena would occupy
                    great space. The following notices are confined as much as possible to a short
                    view of the principal results already obtained.</p><p>Ossiferous superficial deposits abound in Europe, Asia, and America; even far
                    toward the polar circles (both in Asia and America). They consist of clay,
                    gravel, sand, peat, marl, &amp;c. sometimes accompanied by marine or fresh-water
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822095" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2095-0222"/>
                    shells. Some of these are of comparatively modern date, and contain bones of
                    existing races of animals; others belong to ancient times, and contain the
                    remains of extinct tribes. It is to these latter that the name of diluvial
                    deposits properly belongs; and though it is to be supposed that there are
                    ossiferous accumulations of every age intermediate between the diluvial and
                    modern periods, yet in many cases the following considerations will enable a
                    geologist to pronounce whether a particular deposit falls within the proper
                    meaning of the term diluvial.</p><p>There is no sufficient reason to class an ossiferous deposit of Europe as of the
                    diluvial era, if its accumulation can be explained by the action of existing
                    streams. But if amidst the mass of materials which it contains are fragments of
                    rocks brought from other regions, in directions irreconcilable with the actual
                    courses, of streams, or any other courses of streams consistent with geological
                    probability; if the quantity and mode of aggregation of these materials imply
                    the violent and tumultuous movement of considerable bodies of water; and if the
                    bones belong wholly or principally to extinct species of animals; more
                    particularly, if bones of extinct species of elephant, rhinoceros, and
                    hippopotamus occur, then it is most probable that the deposit may be rightly
                    classed with diluvial accumulations.</p><p>In some cases, it is true, no certainty can be obtained whether the accumulation
                    took place in the sea or on the land; whether the deposit is a raised beach, or
                    a tumultuous accumulation on the land. Occasionally there is no distinction
                    between gravel beds and erratic blocks; sometimes alluvial and diluvial
                    formations are inseparably mixed; yet in many instances all these uncertainties
                    vanish, and we are sure that we behold the accumulations from great floods which
                    passed over limited ranges of the dried and inhabited land.</p><p>In the valleys of the Tyne, Wear, and Tees, the vales of York and Cleveland, the
                    district of Holderness, the eastern counties, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex, the vale
                    of the Thames·, the valley of the Trent, and the counties of Lincoln,
                    Huntingdon, Cambridge, Northampton, Warwick, Stafford, Chester, Lancashire, not
                    to mention many others, gravel of the diluvial character, often containing bones
                    of extinct mammalia·, abounds. In Ireland, in various parts of France,
                    Switzerland, Italy, and Germany, similar facts have been observed. In North and
                    South America geologists have recorded the same experience.</p><p>In many instances the same districts yield lacustrine sediments, and peat
                    deposits, so related to the ossiferous clays and gravel by position and organic
                    contents, that they must be ranked as of the same age; frequently, also, we find
                    in the limestones of the same regions, caves and fissures full of bones of the
                    same extinct animals, and so circumstanced as to permit of their being added to
                    the others as animals of a particular era. The most frequent of all these
                    remains in England, and several parts of Europe and Asia, are the bones of
                    fossil elephants; and from this circumstance we may name the geological period
                    of their existence, in polar regions, the elephantoidal period, in
                    contradistinction to the older or palaeotherian period; it being always
                    understood that these terms apply only to the land, and that we have good reason
                    for doubt as to the practicability of referring the period which they designate
                    to the general geological scale, depending on the succession of marine
                    strata.</p><p>In consequence of the variety and celebrity of the ossiferous districts
                    surrounding Kirkdale Cave in Yorkshire, we shall take this as an example of the
                    deposits of the elephantoidal period in England.</p><p>The diluvial accumulations of Holderness, like all those of the eastern side of
                    the north of England, consist partly of clay, partly of gravel and sand, all
                    more or less mixed with fragments of rocks from different quarters. The clay in
                    particular, usually of a brown or blue colour, is uncommonly full of pebbles and
                    large boulders (from a hundredweight to a ton and upwards) of sandstones,
                    limestones, and greenstones, derived from western Yorkshire; slates, porphyries,
                    and granite from Cumberland; diallage rocks, mica-slate, with garnets, gneiss,
                    &amp;c. and referrible either to Scotland or Norway, and many stones of whose
                    origin no satisfactory account can be given. The aggregation of the mass is such
                    as utterly to forbid belief that it was heaped together by any thing short of a
                    mighty mechanical agency, which in its tempestuous violence permitted none of
                    that distinction of specific gravity, form, or magnitude of the masses to appear
                    in the deposit, which is invariably seen in every case of gradual or
                    intermitting effect of ordinary streams and tides. In this clay lie bones of the
                    elephant, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus, but not plentifully.</p><p>Above it and also below it, are gravels and sands far less replete with those
                    proofs of wide and devastating waters, but sometimes more productive of bones
                    and marine shells. Thus there is proof in this country of successive and
                    different actions of unequally violent water flowing in various directions, with
                    no regard to the lines of existing valleys or rivers, but with so much of a
                    general reference to physical geography, as to have accumulated detritus in the
                    great plains and broad vales more plentifully than on the hills.</p><p>This may be taken as a type of such phenomena in England and Ireland, where the
                    detrital deposits are very extensive, and Scotland, which exhibits less of
                    them.</p><p>Without attempting to trace the details of detrital deposits on the continent of
                    Europe, we may observe that they are very extensive, yet not so general as was
                    imagined (See <hi rend="italic">Peliquiae Diluvianae).</hi> Certain districts,
                    as for example the volcanic tracts of central France, shew nothing of the kind;
                    others, as Normandy, the basin of Paris, the hills on the borders of the Rhine
                    valley, the valley of the Rhine, large tracts in northern Germany, in Italy,
                    display similar phenomena to those in England. In every region it is found more
                    or less easy to point out the direction of the diluvial waters concerned, and
                    the result is a growing conviction that not one general, but many partial
                    deluges rushing from particular centres, have occasioned the complicated
                    accumulations.</p><p>In the eastern part of North America, Professor Rogers and Dr Bigsby agree in
                    ascribing to the floods which have caused the boulders and gravel beds, a
                    northward and northwestward origin. This is the most general result— combining,
                    however, many different directions from different local centres—for Ireland,
                    Scotland, and England. The Scandinavian rocks have gone south, south-east, and
                    south-west; the Alpine boulders in all directions from the central axis.</p><p>In the north of Asia, and perhaps also the north-west of America, if we were to
                    judge from the vast quantity of elephantine bones on the banks of the northern
                    seas, the diluvial currents were towards the north; and it may hereafter appear
                    possible to unite all these facts into one general conception—of the effects of
                    an oceanic current, which may have been the resultant of many local
                    disturbances, directed along opposite meridians and passing over the north pole;
                    northward, up the Pacific and over eastern Asia; southward down the Atlantic,
                    and over the west of Europe, and the eastern part of North America.</p><p>c. <hi rend="italic">Ossiferous Caves and Fissures.</hi></p><p>The preceding observations have established the facts of the land now existing as
                    such in the northern zone of the globe, being inhabited by extinct races of
                    quadrupeds, during the detrital, diluvial, or clysmic periods of geological
                    time. It is therefore in no degree singular that we should find in caves and
                    fissures of the rocks in these same districts, additional proofs of such
                    occupation, and additional<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822108" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2108-0223"/> facts to complete our views of the then condition
                    of the surface of the land. Through the researches ably prosecuted by Dr
                    Buckland, and continued to the present day, the history of these remarkable
                    repositories of the bones of the early land inhabitants of the northern zones is
                    in a great degree known. It is certain, from these inquiries, that a great
                    change has taken place in the quadrupedal inhabitants of Europe, northern Asia,
                    North and South America, and Australia, apparently coinciding with the era or
                    close of the period of detrital land deposits; for it is remarkable that the
                    bones of extinct mammalia are almost unknown, while those of existing races are
                    frequent, in deposits of more recent date.</p><p>The number of species of animals found enclosed in these natural rocky sepulchres
                    is often greater than in the most prolific gravel deposits. It appears that the
                    same cave has been resorted to both by extinct and existing races of quadrupeds,
                    their bones being often situated so as to demonstrate that the former were
                    entombed before or during the detrital era, the latter introduced at later
                    periods. But often this distinction is imaginary, and no doubt can reasonably be
                    entertained of the contemporaneous sepulture of certain extinct races, and some
                    living species of quadrupeds. In fact, ossiferous caves are of various ages, and
                    some were filled with bones in very modern times.</p><p>The bones of man, and traces of his ingenuity and labour, have been in several
                    instances observed; generally under such circumstances as to indicate clearly
                    their introduction since the elephantoidal era; but in a few instances it
                    requires something more than the direct evidence of the senses to be satisfied
                    of this difference of date.</p><p>The distinction of ossiferous caves and fissures is sometimes real, often
                    imaginary, and never of great importance in reasoning on the phenomena. Fissures
                    are often denuded caves; caves are often but enclosed fissures. They are almost
                    absolutely confined to calcareous rocks, vary wonderfully in size, shape, and
                    detailed circumstances, and contain the same or different groups of animals,
                    even in a small district. The condition of the bones in them is extremely
                    various, and the inferences from all the known facts point to great diversity in
                    the circumstances by which they have been introduced. The formation of the caves
                    is generally not to be explained except by supposing original cavities, or
                    superinduced fissures, to have undergone enlargement by the chemical action of
                    acidulated water. In many cases water still flows through similar caves; in
                    several ossiferous caverns and fissures, sediments and deposits are found which
                    prove <hi rend="italic">the former</hi> passage or percolation of water, though
                    at present the subterranean drainage takes another course.</p><p>A very considerable proportion of the ossiferous caves yet known has been
                    discovered on the banks of streams, or in cliffs against the sea; in some
                    instances (Franconia, Kírkdale), the openings of caves known to have served as
                    dens appear in situations so difficult of access, as to render it probable that
                    the surface of the ground has been considerably worn away since the cave was
                    occupied.</p><p>These ossiferous repositories have been found in the north and south of England,
                    in limestone of different antiquity, as oolite and mountain limestone; in
                    Belgium, the south and south-east of France, in Franconia, Westphalia, Camiola,
                    Hungary, along the margin of the Mediterranean, in North and South America, and
                    Australia.</p><p>It is to be inferred from the various investigations of the condition and
                    circumstances of these deposits, that the bones have been received into the
                    caves and fissures in one of three modes.</p><p>1st, Some of the caves were occupied as dens during long periods, by ferocious
                    and predacious beasts; as hyaenas in England, bears in Germany.</p><p>2d, Into other caves and fissures quadrupedal reliquiae were drifted by
                    water.</p><p>3d, Some caves, communicating to the surface, appear to have received merely the
                    bodies of quadrupeds which fell into them, or their bones moved from slight
                    distances.</p><p>It will be sufficient to notice a characteristic example of each, and refer to
                    Cuvier and Buckland for further and full details.</p><p>Kirkdale cave, described by Dr Buckland, contained on its long narrow level floor
                    a bed of mud glazed over by stalagmite, and in this mud and in the stalagmite
                    lay multitudes of bones of quadrupeds, especially of ox and hyaena, under such
                    circumstances as left no doubt in the mind of its explorers that it was a den of
                    hyaenas, which for a long term of years roamed in the adjacent valleys, and
                    dragged into this hiding-place the bodies of oxen, deer, and many other animals
                    then living in the neighbourhood. The evidence for this opinion is very
                    convincing, but it must be seen in the museums where the remains are preserved,
                    not judged of from descriptions or figures. The broken and mangled state of the
                    bones from this cave is exactly like what was seen in the similar hyaena cave of
                    Kent’s Hole, Torquay, but directly contrary to the aspect of those from Banwell
                    in the Mendip Hills, which was not tenanted by these destroyers.</p><p>As far as can be known, the bones of this famous cave— those of the marl beds of
                    Weighton, and the diluvial clays of Holdern ess, are identical. The number of
                    kinds of animals whose remains were found in the cave was twenty-four.</p><p>The remarkable cave of Gailenreuth, in Franconia, is a bear cavern, consisting
                    principally of two large chambers varying in breadth from ten to thirty feet,
                    and in height from three to twenty; the roof is hung with stalactite, and in the
                    first chamber the floor nearly covered with magnificent pillars, mammillary
                    masses, and sheets of stalagmite. Under this stalagmite lies a bed of brown loam
                    and pebbles, mixed with angular fragments of rock, and teeth and bones. These
                    latter were far more numerous in the next large cavern, which is on a lower
                    level where the floor has been much broken up. In some lateral ramifications
                    from this chamber, the number of bones imbedded in loam, or encrusted in
                    stalagmite, is wonderful. “The upper part of the existing cave, and probably
                    others which have been out away by denudation, seem to have been the lodging
                    places of bears that lived and died in them during the period immediately
                    preceding the introduction of the mud and pebbles. The diluvial waters rushing
                    into them, and the other similar caverns of Franconia, would introduce pebbles
                    and mud, and would also drift downwards to their lowest recesses the bones that
                    lay perhaps more equally distributed than at present.” Stalagmite has since
                    covered the mingled deposit. <hi rend="italic">(Feliquiae Diluvianae,</hi> p.

                    Nice, Corsica, Sardinia, Dalmatia, &amp;c., abound in caves and fissures, and
                    many of these are filled with a mingled mass of red loam, fragments of rock and
                    bones of land mammalia,—frequently holding land shells,—rarely marine shells and
                    zoophyta (at Villefranche.) Some of the caves have apparently been subjected to
                    the action of the sea before and for some time after the introduction of the
                    bones. (Christie and Pratt on the Cave of San Ciro near Palermo). Dr Christie
                    supposes the breccia of San Ciro to have been deposited in water, and that the
                    whole of the coast has since been uplifted from the sea.</p><p>As an example of a cave into which animals appear to have fallen, we may notice
                    that of Banwell in the Mendip Hills <hi rend="italic">(Ann. des Sc. Nat.</hi>
                    ιχ.) The descent is made by steps ten feet deep into a small chamber about ten
                    feet wide; from this a passage leads to a second chamber thirty feet broad,
                    forty-five long, ten high. From the entrance into this large cavern, runs a
                    cleft or fissure in a vertical direction to the surface. At the other end of
                    this cavern is an inclined passage forty-five or fifty feet long, and at the
                    entrance<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822121" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2121-0224"/> ten feet high, and very narrow, so that it is
                    necessary to crawl on hands and knees; beyond the little chamber, which
                    terminates this passage, it is impossible to proceed. The red loam containing
                    bones of ox, deer, &amp;c. seems to have fallen from the surface, through the
                    fissures and the smaller anti-chamber. The bones are generally entire (or merely
                    fractured) not at all worn or gnawed, nor do they otherwise give indication of
                    having been accumulated by other causes than mere falling into an open
                    fissure.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Valley, Fluviatile, and Lacustrine Deposits.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A certain class of fluviatile, or rather as we should wish
                    to call them ‘ valley* deposits, have attracted less attention than they merit.
                    In some cases, as in Glen Roy, and certain valleys of Canada, terraces at
                    particular and very elevated levels, range round the sides of the valleys, and
                    mark, apparently, the ancient shores of an inland lake which has since burst its
                    barriers. More frequently, as at the lower end of Glen Roy, and many other
                    Highland valleys, on the Lune and other Cambrian streams, the Tyne, the Tees,
                    the Yore, and almost all the other waters of the north of England, gravel
                    terraces in the lower parts of the valleys, indicate the flowing of voluminous
                    streams at higher levels in the direction of the actual river. This phenomenon,
                    though little noticed, is really one of the most general we are acquainted with,
                    and always bears in a very important degree upon the question of the origin of
                    valleys, and often on the question of relative level of land and sea.</p><p>A different set of phenomena has been observed on the <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> Rhine. That long valley in former geological periods had been dammed up
                    at different points (Hibbert), and deposits (called Löss) of alluvial sediment
                    have been formed along the margin of the elevated waters of the lakes thereby
                    occasioned. The loss beds of the Rhine valley contain sand and fresh-water
                    shells, and bones of elephants and rhinoceros (Horner, LyelD. What is called
                    loss in Austria seems to be a similar deposit, and contains elephantine remains,
                    (Murchison).</p><p>All the deposits above mentioned are of great antiquity; the loss of the Rhine
                    valley rests, indeed, on the detrital gravel, but it is far removed from the
                    date of the phenomena produced by the actual river Rhine.</p><p>The effects of actual rivers in the past and present economy of nature, admit of
                    clear enunciation.</p><p>These effects are principally mechanical. In the early part of their course some
                    streams drop carbonate of lime, others acquire it, but these effects are not
                    important. The mechanical action of rivers, whether corroding or transporting,
                    is proportioned to their velocity and volume; these are seldom combined except
                    in particular great rivers like the Indus, the Mississippi, and the Rhine. The
                    velocity is, for short distances, greatest in the upper parts of rivers; but
                    their volume of waters augments toward the sea. Near their origin, rivers are
                    both corroding and transporting agents; as they proceed, the former influence is
                    often lost or compensated by the contrary process of deposition, the latter is
                    weakened in most rivers, destroyed in some, but in a few maintained to the very
                    conflict of the tides and freshes. (Captain Sabine’s <hi rend="italic">Observations on the Sea Current of the Amazons.)</hi> Rivers then, soon after
                    their springs issue from the rock, begin to gather and transport sediment; but
                    it is less by friction on their own beds than by the aid of atmospheric
                    disintegration of rocks, and waste of the surface by rains, frost and glaciers,
                    that they derive the matter which they bear along. According to the velocity of
                    the stream, and the inclination of its bed, is the magnitude of the masses which
                    it can drive forward. Few of the rivers of England, unless their waters be
                    augmented by temporary floods, are swift enough to transport even moderate-sized
                    gravel: sand, clay, and vegetable matters, constitute their principal sediments.
                    But the torrents which rush down from the high Alps, roll along large quantities
                    of detritus thrown into them by glaciers, water-spouts, avalanches, and
                    eboulemens. »</p><p>But the most stormy .stream has intervals of comparative repose, and even the
                    Arve and Rhone deposit most of their spoils within a few leagues of the
                    mountains from which they were torn. Frequently lakes interpose their
                    tranquillizing waters, and receive and distribute the sediment of the river.
                    These lacustrine sediments differ from the ordinary valley deposits of a river
                    in their lamination, which radiates round the point where the river entered, and
                    in deep lakes assumes a conical character. (Yates, <hi rend="italic">Ed. Phil.
                    Journal^)</hi> The dried beds of such lakes have a level surface, but not all
                    plane surfaces in a valley have had this origin; on the contrary both the gentle
                    rivers of England, and the rapid streams of more alpine countries, ever tend, by
                    the shifting of ‘their channels, and the equalizing effect of inundations, to
                    distribute their sediments in planes, which fill the whole valley, and decline
                    toward ‘the sea with a slope corresponding to that of the river. Arrived near
                    die sea, short torrents from alpine regions may throw rocks, pebbles, gravel,
                    sand, and clay, in one confused mass, into the sea. But almost all the rivers
                    whose path is long have left their coarser materials far behind; they have
                    generally dropped much of their sandy admixture, and bring to the shore only
                    fine earthy particles which could remain suspended in their less rapid waters.
                    This is the contribution (principally) which the Po delivers to the Adriatic,
                    the Ganges to the Bay of Bengal, the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico the Nile
                    and the Rhone to the Mediterranean; the Rhine, the Elbe, the Thames, and the
                    Humber, to the German Ocean.</p><p>The mass of sediment thus brought to the sea is great; if delivered to the wide
                    ocean and general currents (as in the case of the river Amazons, noticed by
                    Captain Sabine) it may be carried hundreds of miles; but in still, landlocked
                    seas, like the Baltic, Adriatic, and Bay of Bengal, the greater part is quietly
                    dropped along the bottom and shores of the sea. Thus the extent of such gulfs
                    and basins is gradually and rapidly contracted, their depth reduced, and
                    preparation made for a new series of stratified rucks, perhaps hereafter, in the
                    manifold changes of the globe, to be raised for the contemplation of future
                    geologists.</p><p>Thus we have the whole history of river formations; gravelly deposits near the
                    mountains; sandy and argillaceous beds toward the sea; fine silt lands where the
                    tides and freshes meet, in the estuary, and along the coast line. Thus the river
                    mouths arc incessantly advanced into the sea, the whole coast moves forward, and
                    a large breadth of continually enlarging flat lands borders the tidal part of
                    the river, and constitutes those rich and noble deltas, through which the
                    changeful stream takes its winding way, and which require, in many instances,
                    all the care and vigilance of man to preserve from the river and the sea, which
                    made and may again easily overwhelm them.</p><p>The extent of some of these deltas is enormous. That of the Nile is small
                    compared to some others; but, in fact, the gift of this river to the grateful
                    Egyptians is much more than the delta; all the valley is full of its rich and
                    far descended sediments.</p><p>The Delta of the Ganges commences 220 miles from the sea, and its base is 200
                    miles (Rennell.) This would be thought a considerable deposit, even among the
                    old sedimentary rocks. The delta of the Niger is 25,000 square miles, (Dr

                    decay of the timber on the banks of the Mississippi.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193822134" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2134-0225"/><p><hi rend="smallcaps">lacustrine deposits.</hi></p><p>These, like the caves, may be of almost any geological date; and it is, in faet,
                    very difficult to decide on the claims of the different examples. It is probable
                    that future geologists will choose to class together all the supracretaceous
                    lacustrine deposits, and, by a general contemplation of them, arrive at valuable
                    generalizations, which can now only dimly be foreseen. We shall offer four eases
                    of lacustrine deposits in England and Scotland: the two oldest, of the
                    elephantoidal era in England, and the mastodontic era in America; the next
                    indicative of some different local condition of drainage, coeval with the
                    existence of the Irish elk; the last descriptive of a deposit still in
                    progress.</p><p>A remarkable occurrence of bones, in lacustrine marl, interstratified with the
                    ossiferous diluvium of the vale of York, was fully explored by Mr Harcourt, and
                    other members of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society. Resting upon gravel, and
                    covered by gravel, near Market Weighton, was found a mass of fresh-water marls,
                    to the depth of twenty-two feet, and in these lay bones of elephant, rhinoceros,
                    horse, bison, deer, felis, wolf, birds, all, or nearly all, of extinct species.
                    But with them lay thirteen species of land and fresh-water shells, exactly
                    identical with types now living in the vicinity. No wearing, no unusual
                    fractures, the teeth still in the jaws of the lion and the wolf, the bones of
                    the leg of the horse nearly in their right situation, the horns on the skull of
                    the ox, all the circumstances, in short, indicated a quiet deposition of the
                    remains near the spot where the animals died. The north of England was then
                    inhabited by elephants and lions. This part of Yorkshire was dry land in that
                    era; and, as far as can be known, no change of level has since occurred.</p><p>The largest collections of bones of the mastodon, and other mammalia of the
                    United States, occur in boggy grounds, called Licks, affording salt, in quest of
                    which the herbivorous animals, wild and domestic, enter the marshy spots, and
                    are sometimes mired. The most noted of these deposits is Big-Bone Lick, in
                    Kentucky, occupying the bottom of a boggy valley, kept wet by a number of salt
                    springs, which rise over a surface of several acres» The spot is thus described
                    by Mr Cooper. “The substratum of the country is a fossiliferous limestone. At
                    the Lick the valley is filled up to the depth of not less than thirty feet with
                    unconsolidated beds of earth of various kinds. The uppermost of these is a light
                    yellow clay, which, apparently, is no more than the soil brought down from the
                    high ground by rains and land-floods. In this yellow earth are found, along the
                    water courses, at various depths, the bones of buffaloes (bison), and other
                    modern animals, many broken, but others quite entire. Beneath this is another
                    thinner layer of a different soil, bearing the appearance of having been
                    formerly the bottom of a marsh. It is more gravelly, darker coloured, softer,
                    and contains remains of reedy plants, smaller than the cane so abundant in some
                    parts of Kentucky, with shells of fresh-water mollusea. In this layer, and
                    sometimes partially imbedded in a stratum of blue clay, very compact and
                    tenacious, are deposited the bones of extinct species.”— <hi rend="italic">{Reports of Brit. Assoc.)</hi></p><p>Mr Cooper has been at the pains to compute, from the teeth and other parts known
                    to have been removed from Big-Bone Liek, the number of individuals requisite to
                    furnish the specimens already carried off.</p><p>Mastodon maximus, . . . 100 individuals.</p><p>Elephas primigenius, . . 20</p><p>Megalonyx Jeffersonii, . . 1</p><p>Bos bombifrons, . . . . 2</p><p>Bos Pallasii, 1</p><p>Cervus Americanus, . . . 2</p><p><hi rend="italic">Subterranean Forests,</hi> as they are termed, abound on many

                    in all of them. Some of them shew signs of having been prostrated in particular
                    directions, and covered by river sediment (Tees Mouth, Lancashire, near the
                    Humber); others are composed of drifted hazels, yews, oaks, pines, alder,
                    &amp;c., and covered by pinestumps in attitude of growth (Waghen near HulD; many
                    are extensive accumulations below the level of the sea (Frith of Tay, Swansea,
                    Humber Banks); some are slight aggregations in old lakes (Holderness). Very
                    often layers of blue clay, with shells of existing fresh-water mollusea, he with
                    peat and timber in old lakes (Holderness). Sand underlies the woody deposits of
                    Mount’s Bay; clay, of unknown depth, is the base of that on the Frith of Tay;
                    river sediments support that of the Cambridgeshire fens; and “diluvial” clay
                    that of Holderness. Bones of the Irish elk lie in old lakes, partly full of peat
                    and shelly clay, in Ireland, the Isle of Man, Lancashire, and Holderness; but
                    the more common characteristic osseous reliquiae are those of the <hi rend="italic">stag or red deer,</hi> fallow deer, beaver, and other existing
                    quadrupeds, birds, insects, &amp;c. Movements of the land are commonly thought
                    necessary to explain the position, and particularly the <hi rend="italic">level,</hi> of these “forests.”</p><p><hi rend="italic">Shell-Marl.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The best example was
                    furnished by Mr Lyell’s description of Bakie Loch, Forfarshire, which agrees
                    remarkably with some marl deposits in Tweeddale. Here, under peat with trees,
                    shell-marl of variable thickness and consistence occurs, resting on a loose or
                    partially cemented sand. Under this is another bed of shell-marl, of an earthy
                    consistence; then fine sand and detritus. Near the springs which enter the loch,
                    and supply the calcareous matter, the marl assumes greater consistence, and,
                    from its compact or crystalline substance, deserves the name of
                    “Rock-marl.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Lyell

                    animals noticed above, but almost never without sufficient proof of their later
                    existence. In some cases distinct proof of inhumation at subsequent periods, in
                    other cases different state of conservation, or different situation in the
                    ossiferous deposit, have removed all doubt of this important fact. The only
                    cases which can be considered at all doubtful, are those mentioned by MM.
                    Tournal, Teissier, &amp;c. in caves of Bize, &amp;c. in the vicinity of
                    Narbonne. In these instances, the <hi rend="italic">proof</hi> of the posterior

                    the view which has so long been adopted by geologists, viz. that these northern
                    regions were not inhabited by men during the period when elephants and
                    hippopotami roamed in the damp forests of Germany, France, England, and
                    Siberia.</p><p>What is the exact <hi rend="italic">geological date</hi> of the existence of man,
                    in other words, what is the exact point of union of historical and geological
                    time—a most important problem —is therefore as yet wholly undetermined. Its
                    solution must, probably, be looked for in countries nearer to the tropical
                    regions of the Old World, where many concurring circumstances unite with the
                    authority of Scripture in fixing the local origin of our species.</p><p>IGNEOUS KOCKS AND DISTURBANCES OF THE MODERN PERIOD.</p><p>The effects of subterranean heat have been exhibited at intervals in all the
                    periods of geological time, measured by the deposition of stratified rocks; the
                    resulting phenomena have been noticed at so many points on the earth’s surface,
                    as to leave no doubt that the action of heat, below the surface of the solid
                    crust of the globe, has been, either contemporaneously or successively, as
                    extensive as that of water above it Certain phenomena, such as the general
                    character of composition and the absence of organic remains, in the lowest
                    primary strata, lead to the impression, that in the most ancient known
                    geological period the effects of heat were at one and the same time coextensive
                    with these strata, which is nearly the same thing as saying they were
                    contemporaneously universal. But as we ascend in the order of strata, and come
                    nearer, though by an unknown progression, to the modern era, the evidence of
                    this contemporaneous great extent of the subterranean caloric influence
                    diminishes; the effects are still striking and of the same general description
                    and equal in violence, but more local and limited. In the older period, we found
                    occasional interstratification of igneous rocks and marine sedimentary rocks,
                    and other proofs of the submarine situation of the igneous agency; but in the
                    tertiary periods new phenomena were observed, which proved the igneous agency to
                    have burst forth on the dry land, or amidst fresh-water lakes, and to have
                    assumed in consequence much of that peculiar character which belongs to actual
                    volcanoes.</p><p>It is very evident that the study of volcanic action affords the only clew to a
                    correct appreciation of the circumstances under which igneous agency exerted
                    itself in ancient times. The exhibition of modern volcanic action takes place
                    under a sufficient variety of circumstances to furnish an adequate basis of
                    reasoning upon the conditions which influenced the different effects of similar
                    agencies in earlier periods.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">volcanoes.</hi></p><p>The antiquity of volcanic phenomena is very great. Most of the districts in which
                    volcanic phenomena take place, or have left evidence of their former activity,
                    appear to have been vents for subterranean fires from the era when the district
                    first rose above the sea. This appears certainly to be the case with Sicily,
                    Auvergne, Naples, the Rhenish volcanoes, and many others, though perhaps the
                    present volcanic cones of Etna and Vesuvius may not be of such high antiquity.
                    Many truly volcanic regions no longer contain burning mountains, and never yield
                    streams of lava; yet by the nature of the rocks, by the phenomena of mineral
                    springs, by the mere form of the surface, they yield evidence that volcanic
                    forces once were active there, though now extinct, dormant, or called off to
                    some other focus of energy. From what we learn by comparison of volcanic regions
                    in different conditions, it appears that each volcanic vent has a definite date
                    of origin, lives through a period of activity, and decays by gradual or
                    intermitting stages, till nothing is left but the marks of what has been.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Continuity of Volcanic Action.</hi> This decay and extinction
                    of volcanic vents is a phenomenon of the highest importance in reasoning on the
                    condition and causes of the subterranean temperature. If volcanoes die away for
                    lack of their chemical fuel, a presumption arises that the conditions of their
                    excitement are local, limited, and exhaustible; but if this be not the case, if
                    volcanic action only sleeps below a certain point, because it is awakened to
                    greater and more easy manifestations elsewhere, there is no reason <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">priori</hi> to prevent our admitting for
                    all volcanoes one general physical condition or cause.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Extent and Connection of Volcanic Action.</hi> Now it is
                    certain, that in several instances volcanic phenomena have happened
                    simultaneously, or rather after a short interval, at very distant points or foci
                    of volcanic energy. Dr Daubeny observes <hi rend="italic">(Treatise on
                    Volcanoes),</hi> “The connexion of the volcano near the town of Pasto with those
                    of the province of Quito, was shewn in a striking manner in 1797∙ A thick volume
                    of smoke had proceeded, ever since the month of November 1796, from the volcano
                    of Pasto, but, to the great surprise of the inhabitants of the city of that
                    name, the smoke suddenly disappeared on the 4th February 1797. This was
                    precisely the moment at which, 65 leagues further south, the city of Riobamba,
                    near Tunguragua, was destroyed by a tremendous earthquake.”</p><p>Humboldt <hi rend="italic">(Personal Narrative)</hi> appears to view the higher
                    part of the kingdom of Quito and the neighbouring Cordilleras, not as a group of
                    distinct volcanoes, but as an immense volcanic mass, stretching from north to
                    south, and occupying a surface of more than 600 square leagues; the lofty
                    mountains of Cotopaxi, Tunguragua, Antisana, and Pichincha, affording so many
                    apertures from which the fire finds vent, sometimes in one and sometimes in
                    another.</p><p>No doubt exists of the connection of earthquakes and volcanoes. Mr Lyell
                    observes, that from the commencement of the thirteenth to the latter half of the
                    seventeenth century, no earthquakes are recorded in Syria and Judea; and during
                    this interval of quiescence, the Grecian Archipelago and the coasts of Lesser
                    Asia, Southern Italy, and Sicily, were shaken by earthquakes and alarmed by
                    eruptions.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Geographical Distribution of Volcanoes.</hi> But much stronger
                    proof of the great extent and connexion of the conditions of volcanic
                    excitement, is to be found in the view of their positions orf the globe. Von
                    Buch was the first to propose a classification of volcanoes in two groups, viz.
                    <hi rend="italic">central volcanoes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">volcanoes in
                    line.</hi> Those of the Italian shores and islands, Iceland, the Azores, Canary
                    Isles, Cape de Verd Islands, Gallapagos, Sandwich Islands, Marquesas, Society
                    Islands, Island of Bourbon, as well as the mountains of Demavend, Ararat,
                    &amp;c. belong to the former class. The Greek Archipelago, the west of Aus
                    tralia, the Isles of Sun da, the Moluccas and Philippines, Japan, the Kurilian
                    and Kamschatkan chains, the Aleutian Isles, the Marian Isles, the Antilles, as
                    well as the Cordilleras of Chili, Quito, Guatimala, and Mexico are ranked with

                    adopted in works on volcanoes separates the known volcanic districts into
                    extinct and active volcanoes,—a distinction which seems clearer than it is; for
                    between the burning mountain with its formidable realities, and the long silent
                    volcanic mound, surrounded by mineral springs, and other residuary phenomena,
                    almost every gradation can be traced. Viewing the subject generally, it is
                    difficult to resist the idea that the exhibition of volcanic excitement is in
                    proportion to the proximity of the sea, or other repository of water; for almost
                    every one of the active volcanoes of the globe is situated in an island, or near
                    the sea-coast of a continent, and many of the extinct volcanoes are on the site
                    or in the neighbourhood of ancient lakes now dried up. The following short

                    new volcano has seldom been witnessed by competent observers. The phenomenon is,
                    in fact, extremely rare; for though we read of new cones and craters being
                    formed on Etna, and new islands occasionally raised from the sea, the fact in
                    general is, that these are merely new vents to an old volcano, whose former and
                    accustomed channels to the surface have by some circumstances been rendered
                    incapable of giving passage to the vapours and lava of the teeming mountain. It
                    is probable, from considering the lines of craters which belong to one of Von
                    Buch’s classes, that some great fissure or line of subterranean movement has
                    determined the local situation of volcanic vents. Even the central volcanoes of
                    Von Buch appear to be often related to particular centres and axes of
                    subterranean movement; as Auvergne, the Eifel, Sicily, and others.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Origin of Volcanic Cones and Craters.</hi> Von Buch supposes in
                    addition, that many volcanic mountains have been formed by uplifting of
                    stratified and igneous masses into a conical or elliptical mass depressed in the
                    centre, and to such he gives the name of Erhebungs Cratère (craters of
                    elevation).</p><p>Mr Lyell controverts this view, and attempts to prove that, like many of the new
                    cones of Etna, Monte Nuovo, &amp;c., near Naples, volcanic mountains generally
                    are craters of eruption, that is, nothing but heaps of scoriae and ashes, and
                    streams of lava, collected into a conical mass in consequence of issuing from a
                    central orifice. Many volcanic mountains, probably all of a very decidedly
                    conical shape, are formed in this manner; but certain dome-shaped hills in
                    Auvergne are held by Dr Daubeny to be strictly referrible to elevation in mass.
                    It is supposed that the formation of the Mexican volcano of Jorullo (1759),
                    when, according to Humboldt, the ground rose up like a bladder for a surface of
                    three or four square miles, to a central elevation of 324 feet, is a modern
                    example of the truth of the hypothesis of Von Buch; and at all events, the
                    possibility of such an origin cannot consistently be denied, if we pay attention
                    to the many instances of elliptical elevation of stratified rocks of different
                    ages, as at Woolhope in Herefordshire, Greenhow Hill in Yorkshire, &amp;c. which
                    have been brought forward of late years.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Volcanic Phases.</hi> By whatever means a volcanic vent,
                    whether it be a cone with a crater-shaped top or any other aperture, has been
                    formed, its augmentation can only take place by the process of eruption.
                    Scoriae, ashes, &amp;c. blown from the mouth fall round and augment the cone;
                    streams of liquid rock flowing over the edge of the crater, may, by many
                    successive currents in different directions, produce an equal conical mouth of
                    concrete lava, or, rushing out from the side of the cone, spread or accumulate
                    according to the shape of the surface. These effects must differ according as
                    the phenomenon happens in the sea or on the land. Hence Mr Scrope’s distinction
                    of subaqueous and subaërial volcanoes. Subaqueous ejections of scoriae, &amp;c.
                    are subject, in the first place, to partial suspension in water, and in the
                    next, to agitations of the liquid produced by the eruption and other causes.
                    These act in the same direction, and tend to <hi rend="italic">diffuse</hi> the
                    disintegrated accumulations far and wide from the volcanic vent. Hence strata of
                    very small inclination are produced round the crater, or, if any thing
                    comparable to a volcanic cone is occasioned, the heap of large scoriae must
                    yield to the lateral influence of the waves, and be at length dispersed over the
                    bed of the sea. Of the truth of this view, the modern island of Sciacca, its
                    rapid growth, and rapid degradation, offered good illustration.</p><p>Subaqueous eruptions of lava must also for the most part flow under the pressure
                    of the liquid columns to various breadths on the bed of the sea, so as to form
                    irregular stratiform masses, embossed here and there by mounds of lava, too
                    quickly congealed to spread into the tabular form.</p><p>Thus it appears a necessary consequence of the conditions of a subaqueous
                    volcano, that its accumulations, whether liquid or disintegrated, should be
                    formed into broad expanded masses, having a stratiform arrangement; and this is
                    what is always observed among the igneous rocks of ancient geological periods,
                    unless where fissures in the rocks are filled by the irruptive lava. Thus the
                    basalt of Teesdale and of Antrim, the porphyritic masses of Snowdonia, Cumbria,
                    &amp;c. have been formed.</p><p>Subaërial ejections of loose materials must of necessity be collected round the
                    point of exit into conical layers, determined in their angle of inclination <hi rend="italic">by the angle of rest of the particles,</hi> under the influence of
                    the forces of projection and gravitation. The lavas poured out from the crater,
                    or bursting from the flanks of the cone, must accommodate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822173" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2173-0228"/> themselves to
                    the form of the surface, so as to mantle round the original mountain, swell into
                    knolls at its foot,, or flow away into valleys and hollows of the land, or enter
                    the sea. All these variations are visible at Etna and Vesuvius.</p><p>Subaërial volcanic ejections may alternate with freshwater productions fCantaD,
                    with detritus holding bones of mammalia (Auvergne), or cover cities, as Pompeii
                    and Herculaneum; and submarine volcanic accumulations may alternate with shelly
                    sediments and limestones.</p><p>But there is yet another form of modern volcanic aggregates which it is of great
                    importance to distinguish from the preceding, because of its bearing upon points
                    of great importance in old geology. There are <hi rend="italic">subterranean
                    volcanic products</hi> which neither are poured into the sea nor thrown into the
                    air, but secretly elaborated under the pressure of a solid covering, and effused
                    into the fissures of the rocks.</p><p>Although it may reasonably be allowed that the great variety of productions
                    ejected by subaërial volcanoes affords a good indication of the principal
                    mineral substances generated by volcanic action, we must be cautious not to
                    limit our notions of their combinations in the deep parts of the earth to those
                    which are suggested by the compounds which are determined at the surface.</p><p>The degree of pressure^ rate of cooling, and mass of ingredients, which are known
                    to be important modifying conditions of molecular aggregation, are wholly
                    different at the roots and about the surface of the immense volcanic chimneys
                    which, like Etna and the Peak of Teneriffe, become 'filled with' the liquid
                    rocks whenever the subterranean pressure amounts to a particular degree.</p><p>At the base of a volcanic vent, deep in the earth or under the sea, particular
                    mineral aggregates, slowly cooled, under great pressure, and in great masses,
                    may, and probably do, at this day assume the largely crystalline texture and
                    distinctness of ingredients of granite; on the bed of the sea they may flow in
                    the state of porphyry or basalt; on the surface of the land appear as porous
                    lava, and be blown into the air in disintegrated scoriae, ashes, and dust.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">volcanic products.</hi></p><p>The number of mineral substances found in volcanic ejections is very great.
                    Nearly 100 distinct minerals have been recognised among the products of
                    Vesuvius. But of these only very few occur in such abundance as to constitute
                    .any great portion of the lava or scoriae.</p><p>It is almost correct to say that the principal portion of the masses of all the
                    known volcanoes is constituted of two minerals,—felspar and augite.</p><p>According to the predominance of one or other of these ingredients, the lava
                    currents may generally be classed as felspathic lava, or augitic lava, but the
                    permutations of ingredients is so frequent, that no definite mode of specific
                    nomenclature has more than a local value. Mr Scrope forms the groups Trachyte,
                    Graystone, Basalt, and in each proposes many subdivisions. Trachyte is divided
                    by Beu dant upon different principles. Perhaps it is useless to attempt the
                    drawing of lines where nature has permitted none to appear. Trachytic rocks, as
                    in the Siebengebirge, Hungary, Auvergne, are composed of crystals of glassy
                    felspar alone, or mixed with mica, hornblende, titaniferous iron, &amp;c. and
                    confusedly aggregated or cemented by compact felspar. Porphyritic trachyte, like
                    porphyritic granite, holds large crystals of felspar ^Siebengebirge.) On the
                    other hand, in the graystone of Mr Scrope augite or hornblende, or both,
                    predominate over the felspar. In many cases the felspar is partially or entirely
                    replaced by other minerals, as leucite, melilite, hailyne, olivine, &amp;c.</p><p>According to the rate of cooling and other circumstances, the aggregation of
                    these ingredients varies much. Lava which has flowed down into water, and been
                    consolidated under even slight pressure, is found more condensed than that which
                    has hardened in air, and become cellular by the free extrication of gaseous
                    bubbles in the hot mass. Sudden cooling of lava gives it a glassy character, as
                    obsidian, pearlstone, &amp;c.; slow cooling developes its crystalline, granular,
                    and earthy texture. Gaseous expansion in a fluid mass of lava may convert it to
                    cellular pumice, or scatter it into dust or scoriae, which are thrown out of the
                    crater.</p><p>Again, the scoriae and dust are often collected by water into sedimentary
                    deposits, called volcanic tuff, conglomerate, puzzolana, and trap. It is this
                    kind of accumulation which covers Herculaneum, while Pompeii seems to have been
                    buried in dry ashes.</p><p>Besides the solidifying mineral aggregates which flow over their summits or burst
                    out from their flanks, and the disintegrated showers of scoriae and ashes which
                    fall round them, many volcanoes pour out floods of water, variously impregnated
                    with salts, and mixed with earthy sediments; and all discharge volumes of
                    gaseous matter and steam, and sublimed mineral substances.</p><p>The gases are chlorine, sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphuric acid, carbonic acid,
                    nitrogen, (Daubeny). Sir H. Davy found the sublimations of Vesuvius to be
                    chloride of sodium, chloride of iron, sulphate of soda, chloride of potassium,
                    sulphate of potash, oxide of copper, chloride of cobalt.</p><p>PHENOMENA OF EXTINCT VOLCANOES.</p><p>Long after volcanic fires have ceased to be visible externally, the regions which
                    they once desolated are the theatre of residuary phenomena of considerable
                    importance. In the neighbourhood of Vesuvius the ancient trachytic crater called
                    the Solfatara, is still the channel through which come to the surface abundant
                    vapours of sulphuretted hydrogen. Hot waters still gush out from the Monte Nuovo
                    and the Lago Agnano. Carbonic acid gas still fills the Grotto del Cane, and
                    rises with the springs of water in Auvergne and the Eifel. Earthquakes have
                    often ravaged the districts of Asia Minor, where, in very ancient times,
                    volcanic fires were lighted: and, by combining these and other indications, we
                    find that it is rather from want of communication to the surface than from any
                    real stifling of their energies, that volcanoes appear to become extinct.</p><p>If we were to admit, with Dr Daubeny, that the pheno ∙ mena of hot-springs
                    indicated a slow volcanic action still going on below the point of efflux, (and
                    the arguments he has brought from the gases which they evolve<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Report to
                    the British Association.</hi></p></note> appear important}, it would follow that
                    few districts of the globe are exempt from such slow action of volcanic forces
                    below them. But, on considering the cases where the same gases are evolved from
                    cold springs, Harrowgate, Tunbridge, &amp;c. we find ourselves conducted to a
                    more general result, viz. that in places where <hi rend="italic">disturbed
                    stratification</hi> occurs, or vertical movements have happened, such as to
                    render it certain, or very probable, that a communication, arising from solution
                    of continuity of the strata, exists from the surface to great depths, the
                    springs which issue have generally a saline muriatiferous or mineral
                    impregnation, and evolve gases, (sulphuretted hydrogen, azote, carbonic acid,)
                    which correspond to those of volcanic regions, and indicate that, at the present
                    day, at some depths from the surface, the chemical agencies consequent on
                    volcanic action or high temperature are continually going on, or momentarily
                    excitable. The temperature of such springs may perhaps be a good indication of
                    the nearness of the source of heat, provided allowance be made for the quantity
                    of water issuing.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193822186" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2186-0229"/><p><hi rend="smallcaps">connexion of earthquakes and volcanoes.</hi></p><p>That such a connexion exists is perhaps universally allowed; but it is also
                    capable of sufficient proof that earthquakes generally precede volcanic
                    eruptions, and this sometimes for a considerable period, increasing in violence
                    until the eruption happens and relieves the subterranean pressure.</p><p>On the 26th of March 1812 Caraccas was utterly destroyed by an earthquake, and a
                    mountain near it subsided. On the 27th April the eruptions of the Souffrier, in
                    St Vincent’s, began.</p><p>In the year 63 of our era earthquakes began to disturb the vicinity of Pompeii,
                    and in 79, after a succession of these phenomena, the fires of Vesuvius were
                    rekindled.</p><p>The extraordinary eruption of Jorullo in 1/59, followed upon extraordinary
                    earthquakes; and the unparalleled excitements of Skaptar Jokul in 1783, were

                    which drains off the gases, &amp;c. and so frees the surrounding islands from

                    indications of subterranean disturbances are far more extensively felt than in
                    the mere vicinity of the volcanic cones, whose renewed activity they often
                    betoken. The numerous concussions which were experienced in England in the llth,
                    12th, 13th, 17th, and 18th centuries, seem as much dependent on the Icelandic as
                    on the Italian volcanoes. Those which have affected all the countries north of
                    the Mediterranean; the convulsive movements of Asia Minor in the early Christian
                    eras; those of India, are far removed from any centres of volcanic excitement.
                    We also find that, in some instances, earthquakes have prevailed for years, and
                    done great mischief, (as before the earliest recorded eruptions of Vesuvius)
                    before the throes of nature have been relieved by the birth of volcanic fires.
                    Hence, it appears that the earthquake is really the greater and more general,
                    and the volcano the lesser and more limited, effect of a cause more general than
                    either.</p><p>The characteristic effect of earthquakes is the displacement of the solid mass of
                    the ground, and the violent agitation of the liquid parts. A passing earthquake
                    is known by a peculiar vibration, or rather undulation of the solid ground,
                    which tends to throw down unstable bodies, and to communicate vertical or
                    oblique impulses to all. It is not properly a vibration, but a forcible <hi rend="italic">rolling</hi> of the solid crust of the globe once, twice, or
                    several times. In some instances the effects are permanently indicated by opened
                    fissures, subsided grounds, drained wells, elevated lines of epuntry; but more
                    frequently the yawning ground closes again, and the convulsion passes on. It has
                    been observed that the apparent direction of the disturbance is the same in the
                    same earthquake; that the celerity of the movement is very great, but not
                    instantaneous, and, in some instances, particular lines of country are found to
                    be more commonly affected than others.</p><p>It has been found that perhaps the greatest effects of earthquakes happen on the
                    sea-coast (Lisbon, 1755; Port-Royal, 1692; Catania, 1693); that the shock is
                    felt in the sea as well as upon the land, vessels being struck upward by a heavy
                    blow, which could not be by <hi rend="italic">vibrations</hi> and waves retiring
                    and reflowing at immense distances of coast from the places of principal
                    disturbance.</p><p>From all the circumstances, it is apparent that earthquakes are the effect of a
                    powerful mechanical force, accumulated to a maximum at particular points, and
                    along certain lines, at a considerable depth below the surface. The rolling
                    motion of the ground is a real undulation of the flexible crust of the globe,
                    consequent upon fluctuations of an interior fluid, liquid or gaseous, which is
                    very extensively spread below the solid rocks, and liable to irregular
                    disturbances, which are, at least partially, relieved by volcanic eruptions.</p><p>On looking carefully at the recorded permanent effects of earthquakes, we find
                    reason to believe that the most considerable displacements of parts of the land
                    have been productive of local depression,—that, as the most frequent result, the
                    land has sunk. It was so at Port-Royal in 1692; at Lisbon in 1755; at Caraccas
                    in 1812. We read ofMount Acraus falling into the sea in 876; of Pompeiopolis
                    being half swallowed up in 541; of Grecian cities overwhelmed in the deep; at
                    Darlington ground fell in 1179; at West Ham in Kent in 1596; near Bordeaux in
                    1660.</p><p>But cases of at least temporary rise of the land also occur. In 1556, on the west
                    coast of South America vessels were left dry far from their ancient place of
                    mooring. In 1110, the Trent was dry at Nottingham for a whole day; in 1158, the
                    Thames was dry at London. According to Mrs Graham, the coast of Chili, for the
                    distance of 100 miles, rose to a height of three or four feet above its ordinary
                    level, indications appearing that many such accidents had happened before: this
                    case has been the subject of much discussion. Permanent subsidences and
                    elevations happened in the valley of the Indus in 1809.</p><p>Upon the whole, the frightful devastations ascribed to earthquakes are confined
                    to particular regions of the globe, not far removed from the sites where
                    volcanoes now are, or formerly were, in extreme activity. The permanent changes
                    of level which they have produced in the last 1800 years, are very slight and
                    difficult to substantiate. From 1048 to 1800 (752 years), no less than
                    forty-five earthquakes were recorded in England alone; and no doubt many were
                    unobserved; yet what remarkable permanent effects were ascribed to them even by
                    the credulous chroniclers of the middle ages? After exploring all the
                    exaggerated descriptions of the phenomena, written in the midst of fear and
                    alarm, we rise from the ’perusal, satisfied that the effects of earthquakes are
                    of the same kind as those performed by ancient convulsive movements of the
                    globe, and similarly connected with variations of interior heat, but
                    immeasurably inferior in amount. If modern earthquakes and volcanic fires be
                    proportioned to the modern rate of variation of interior temperature, how much
                    greater must have been the variations of heat corresponding to the incomparably
                    greater convulsions of ancient date? It may be said, perhaps, that our period of
                    2000 years’ experience is nothing to the long series of geological ages consumed
                    in the production of these greater effects; it may be said, that such extensive
                    displacements, whether effected by few convulsive movements, or many smaller
                    disturbances, are equally a function of the time elapsed; but, surely, if we
                    find the modern feeble earthquake and volcanic fire, adequate to restore
                    momentarily the equilibrium of the disturbed interior forces, they are the
                    measure of such disturbances.</p><p>There may indeed be a residual phenomenon; the equilibrium may be only partially
                    restored, and the uncompensated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822199" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2199-0230"/> portions may be terms of a series continually
                    augmenting, till it be satisfied by a great convulsion; this may be: but if so,
                    the point is at once conceded; the inefficacy of earthquakes in producing such
                    effects as the permanent uplifting of a mountain chain is granted, and for such
                    an effect we must look to some other and more adequate cause than mere volcanic
                    excitement. What, then, is volcanic excitement?</p><p>hypotheses of volcanic action.</p><p>Discarding the antiquated notion of volcanic phenomena depending on the
                    combustion of coal-beds, the decomposition of sulphuretted metals, &amp;c., we
                    have only two hypotheses of volcanic action to consider. The authors of these
                    speculations call them <hi rend="italic">theories</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    but if we recollect how very insufficiently the laws of volcanic action have
                    been developed, we shall not readily grant that any great progress has been made
                    in developing the laws of causation; till this is done there is no true
                    theory.</p><p>The hypothesis proposed by Cordier, of a heated interior mass mechanically
                    disturbed, has been improved by the additional postulate, that the heated
                    interior of the globe is chemically disturbed by access of water and other
                    causes, and in this state is in harmony with the general view of Leibnitz
                    concerning the changing conditions of the globe, and with the course of partial
                    inferences contained in the preceding pages. But these views and inferences must
                    be further examined and more fully admitted before any hypothesis grounded on
                    them can be adopted by more than a party in geology. This examination we shall
                    briefly attempt hereafter, but, at present, the truth of the doctrine of
                    volcanic action being dependent on local thermal disturbances, must rest upon
                    its power of explaining phenomena under the disadvantages of the want of knowing
                    the laws of these phenomena.</p><p>Another hypothesis was proposed by Davy, and, for a time, partially adopted by
                    several chemists. Seeing the remarkable ignition and other effects of strong
                    chemical action consequent on the excessive attraction of the metallic bases of
                    the alkalis for oxygen, it was easy to suppose these substances existing
                    uncombined in the interior of the globe, to imagine the local addition of water,
                    or other substances containing oxygen, and thus to account for the violent
                    ignition, alkaline products, steam, convulsive movements, and other phenomena of
                    volcanoes. Dr Daubeny, the most strenuous supporter of this view in our days,
                    places it on its true basis, viz. the power which it possesses of explaining
                    phenomena. Thus both the hypotheses refer themselves to one and the same
                    test.</p><p>It is, perhaps, commonly imagined that these hypotheses exclude one another, but
                    this is unnecessary. Though the globe be hot within, it may contain uncombined
                    the metallic bases of the earths and alkalis. Though it be to them that volcanic
                    phenomena are owing, their action would not be impeded by a high temperature of
                    the subterranean region, but, on the contrary, exalted.</p><p>It is further remarkable, that the points of agreement are great. It is
                    requisite, upon either view, that water be admitted to a hot mass, or to one
                    capable of becoming so; that chemical processes happen, in which oxygen is
                    absorbed, and hydrogen and other gases released. The sublimation of sulphur,
                    salts, metals, &amp;c. is just as intelligible one way as the other. The
                    situation of volcanoes in islands, on sea-coasts, and generally near water, is a
                    consequence of either hypothesis; the long duration of volcanic foci,— the
                    intermission of their action,—the gradual extinction of some of them, are quite
                    as easily understood the one way as the other. Wherein, then, do they really
                    differ? Principally in the development under the bias of the respective
                    partizans. The hypothesis of Dr Daubeny is chiefly directed to the explanation
                    of the chemical products in the order of their succession, and, so far as the
                    chemical questions are concerned, it appears to answer the conditions required.
                    The other speculation has been found more powerful in explaining the great
                    extent of the subterranean movements to which volcanic fires are but a local
                    appendage; it is more satisfactory, when viewed in connexion with older
                    pyrogenous rocks and older tremors of the globe. Thus the Mechanical theory, as
                    Cordier’s hypothesis has been termed, explains better the mechanical effects;
                    the Chemical theory, as Dr Daubeny⅛ speculation has been named, fits better to
                    the chemical phenomena.</p><p>But as they do not exclude one another, as both <hi rend="italic">may be
                    true,</hi> why are they put in such determinate opposition? What the substances
                    are which occur at the base of volcanoes, is to be found by chemical researches;
                    in what state they are as to temperature, fluidity, density, &amp;c. is the
                    province of general physics to ascertain.</p><p>We may, therefore, very consistently agree with Cordier, Von Buch, and De
                    Beaumont, in viewing the origin of volcanic fissures as a case of violent
                    displacement of the crust of the globe, arising from change of the thermal state
                    of an interior fluid nucleus, and in ascribing to this mechanical condition the
                    great extent of earthquakes from the bases of volcanic regions, and yet adopt at
                    least the principle of Dr Daubeny’s hypothesis. If we were to adopt completely
                    the opinions of this writer, we should have the following view of the series of
                    chemical processes.</p><p>The interior parts of the globe, whether hot or cold, fluid or concrete, consist,
                    at least in part, of the metallic bases of the alkalis and earths, and of some
                    metals; to this water, generally sea-water, and atmospheric air find access
                    through irregular and variable channels in the rocks. The consequence is
                    oxidation of the alkaline metals, potassium and sodium, the earthy metals
                    silicium, aluminum, &amp;c., and iron and other ordinary metals; a large volume
                    of hydrogen will thus be liberated from its aqueous combination with oxygen; the
                    atmospheric air will also be decomposed, and its nitrogen set free; chlorine
                    will be liberated from its combination with sodium; sulphur will be disengaged
                    from various mineral combinations in the superior rocks. Then the oxygen will
                    combine with sulphur to constitute sulphureous acid gas, and with hydrogen to
                    form steam; the oxygen being consumed, hydrogen will unite with sulphur, and
                    form sulphuretted hydrogen, and with nitrogen to form ammonia, which,
                    neutralized by chlorine, becomes sal ammoniac.</p><p>Besides these, which may be called the primary chemical phenomena, there may be
                    noticed secondary phenomena depending on the mere communication of heat to the
                    rocks above. Such are the extrication of carbonic acid gas from calcareous
                    rocks, the sublimation of sulphur so as to permit its combination with oxygen,
                    to form sulphurous acid gas, and with hydrogen to constitute sulphuretted
                    hydrogen. These and other effects are equally necessary on either hypothesis,
                    and must be supposed to continue long after the primary chemical phenomena have
                    ceased; as indeed, in old volcanic tracts, we know to be the case. In fact,
                    along lines of dislocation of far higher antiquity than any merely volcanic
                    mountains, we find the same phenomena of hot springs, carbonic acid, nitrogen,
                    sulphuretted hydrogen, &amp;c., and it thus appears almost a necessary
                    consequence, that the heat, below a given point of the earth’s surface, though
                    no proper volcanic phenomena be there visible, is almost inexhaustible. Should
                    not these considerations have weight in determining geologists not to refuse
                    either the general thermal, or the local chemical hypothesis of volcanoes? Both
                    are perhaps true, though we may not have the power of explaining by them all the
                    yet imperfectly known phenomena, depending on the changing temperature and
                    chemical conditions of the subterranean regions.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193822212" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2212-0231"/><p>The caution which has been infused into every branch of natural science has been
                    productive of excellent fruits in geology. Within a hundred years its whole
                    aspect has been changed; from a mass of crude speculations fitted to inaccurate
                    observations, it has gradually grown up to a system of sound, though limited,
                    inferences, connected by some very probable generalizations, and supported by
                    independent mathematical reasoning. The <hi rend="italic">Laws</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Phenomena</hi> are unfolded to a considerable extent, and, in the
                    opinion of eminent men of science, the time is at hand for effectual researches
                    into the <hi rend="italic">law’s of causation.</hi> Not that the labours of
                    observation should, for an instant, be suspended; <hi rend="italic">they</hi>
                    are the most important of all the means of advancing geology: on the contrary,
                    they ought to be continually excited by new impulses, and turned into more
                    profitable directions by the first, however rude, indications of theory. The
                    state of geology is so prosperous, that its numerous cultivators may well agree
                    to divide their forces so as to accomplish combined movements; to advance on the
                    one hand the mass of generalized phenomena, and on the other to multiply the
                    points of contact between dynamical, chemical, and vital laws, and the results
                    of geological inquiry.</p><p>In the exhibition of this subject, it is almost singular how useless and even
                    trifling a thing it is to refer to the ancient opinions on the constitution and
                    changes of the globe, which modern sceptics concerning the progress of geology
                    seem to have ever before their eyes as spectra, warning them of the danger of
                    listening to the reasoning of the mathematician, the astronomer, the chemist, or
                    the zoologist, when applied to the history of the globe. Were it not for this
                    salutary terror which they inspire even in bold minds, the reveries of Whiston,
                    Catcott, and Whitehurst, perhaps we may add of Werner and Hutton, as to the
                    origin and changes of the globe, would be speedily forgotten. Even the beautiful
                    work of Playfair loses its importance when fairly poised against the growing
                    mass of partial geological truths; and perhaps we ought to look upon the
                    hypotheses of Von Buch, De Beaumont, and Lyell, as <hi rend="italic">over
                    generaliza-tiοηs,</hi> proper to excite and direct inquiry on particular points,
                    and thus likely to have a temporary use rather than a permanent influence.
                    However this may be, it is certain that the researches of the last fifty years
                    have justified the words of Herschel: they have brought the grand problem of the
                    history of the globe fairly within the circle of inductive science, linked it
                    inseparably with the progress of physical science and natural history, so that
                    its progress or retardation can only be proportioned to that of the general mass
                    of human knowledge.</p><p>From this an important conclusion results: the close union and strict dependence
                    of geological reasoning on the advancement of other sciences, must place a
                    strong restraint on the presumption and confidence with which crude hypotheses
                    have been often advanced by men of mere observation; in future it will be
                    trusted to minds of a higher order, habitually exercised in the combination of
                    natural laws, to propose leading views in geology. It is already known that a
                    mathematical basis exists for geology as well as for astronomy, and the search
                    for this cannot long be unsuccessful in the accurate hands of the analysts of
                    France, Germany, and Cambridge.</p><p>So rapid is their progress that, even while we write, a large accession of
                    knowledge is brought by Mr Hopkins, in a memoir on Physical Geology, presented
                    to the Cambridge Philosophical Society, on the hitherto obscure subject of
                    subterranean movements, and other investigations concerning the interior of the
                    globe are opening upon us. The following view of the state of theory on several
                    funda mental points cannot therefore be complete, perhaps not even free from
                    inaccuracy.</p><p>Though inferences from geological phenomena, and deductions from assumed first
                    principles in theory, may be almost infinitely varied, according to the extent
                    of the data or the generality of the principles; yet, in fact, all theoretical
                    views in geology, which can be considered general, are reduced to two types; the
                    deductive speculations of Leibnitz, and the inductive hypotheses of Hutton.
                    These are really and necessarily different, and whoever ventures to choose one
                    or other of these great leaders, must in effect decide for himself the following
                    important question :—</p><p>Are the disturbances of the statical condition of the terrestrial forces of
                    organic and inorganic nature of a periodical character merely, so that in any
                    sufficiently long period embracing all the cycles of their variations, the sum
                    of their effects is equal to the sum of a corresponding earlier or later period,
                    which is Dr Hutton’s view put to extreme; or, are these disturbances of the
                    nature of a series whose successive terms, (whether a single disturbance or
                    cycles of periodical disturbances), differ from one another in any regular
                    progression? (as Leibnitz supposes.)</p><p>This question cannot be answered upon analogy merely. Though the planetary system
                    exhibits in all its perturbations a character of variation, such that the sum of
                    the movements taken in any sufficiently long period is found to be constant, and
                    the whole system permanent, unless the extraneous influence of the ether tend to
                    slowly alter its condition, we cannot deduce that the parts of this system
                    shall, <hi rend="italic">in matters of another kind,</hi> have the like
                    character of circular perpetuity. Nor, on the other hand, be ∙ cause of the many
                    proofs of great convulsions in ancient periods, and of the rarity or even
                    absence of such phenomena in historical times, may we conclude that such
                    convulsions will never be repeated. There may be a periodicity of these great
                    disturbances of the solid globe, as we know there is of the lesser
                    irregularities of the atmosphere surrounding it.</p><p>This great question is then to be tried by the applicability of one or other of
                    the leading principles which it involves to the explanation of the phenomena of
                    all geological periods, and the only thing remaining to be settled is the degree
                    of preparation in which we find ourselves for such a trial of principles.</p><p>Have we data, or laws of phenomena, sufficiently certain and known in all their
                    relations to allow of ascending by inferences to one of the rival principles, or
                    of testing deductions from the other?</p><p>It is probable that we have not such knowledge. For neither do we know fully the
                    present state of operation of terrestrial forces, including, of course, their
                    submarine effects, nor their condition at any one former period; and it is only
                    by a rigorous and careful scrutiny, and comparison of many different periods,
                    that any just determination can be formed as to the laws which regulate the
                    variation of the forces. The utmost, then, which can be expected is a
                    presumption in favour of one or the other theoretical principle, according to
                    its observed correspondence with the succession of phenomena which are best
                    known.</p><p>Even this task we shall not attempt. Instead of it we shall employ a particular
                    consideration really common to both of them, though in their development under
                    the hands of partizans, it has come to be almost exclusively associated with the
                    Leibnitzian speculation. Either of the principles previously contrasted admits
                    of being developed in two modes; according to both of them the changes now going
                    on upon the globe may be part of a long series of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822225" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2225-0232"/> similar or
                    gradually changing phenomena, never interrupted in their operations by
                    extraordinary exertions of the same or different forces. This is Mr Lyell’s
                    doctrine; or the present may be viewed as a period of ordinary action of
                    terrestrial forces, similar to many which have gone before, and which have been
                    preceded and terminated by greater and more violent effects of intermitting
                    agencies. (This is the view of Μ. De Beaumont.)</p><p>It is certain that unless this limited question can be disposed of the general
                    principles cannot be properly examined, and in the discussion of even this
                    really practicable problem all the knowledge yet gathered in geology may perhaps
                    be found inadequate. It will, however, be useful to make the attempt, if only
                    for the purpose of pointing out the lines of research on which geological
                    observation may be profitably directed.</p><p>In the system of continual compensation among the agencies of terrestrial nature,
                    deluges and convulsions, greater than those of the modern period, have, strictly
                    speaking, no place; or if we relax a little the rigidness of the dogma, and
                    allow that, by a fortuitous combination of circumstances, greater movements and
                    inundations may have happened than have been recorded in the last thousand years
                    or so, at least these must be shewn to be perfectly consistent with the ordinary
                    diurnal measure of the influential agencies. For example, a lake may be slowly
                    emptied by erosion or suddenly by an earthquake; the effects are very different;
                    but the agencies equally belong to the present system of nature. Great effects
                    may thus be performed, in consequence of particular combinations, by very
                    moderate measures of force; but in applying this system to older phenomena, we
                    must examine the <hi rend="italic">direct effects</hi>: convulsionary movements
                    must be the measure of disturbing forces, and diluvial effects the guide to
                    inferences concerning cataclymal agencies.</p><p>ORIGIN OF THE MATERIALS IN THE CRUST OF THE</p><p>GLOBE.</p><p>The compound nature of these materials is a subject of great interest in any
                    theory of the changes of the globe. When we consider the various minerals
                    included in one rock, as granite; the definite chemical formula which represents
                    the attractive forces of each of these; the molecular and elementary
                    constitution of the different parts of each; and recollect that any one of these
                    molecules and elements has various physical properties, how improbable does it
                    appear that we shall ever arrive at a knowledge of the changes of condition
                    through which these unchanging particles have passed! Yet it is almost
                    impossible to avoid the endeavour, useless though it be, to separate these
                    particles in imagination, and to represent them to the mind in a state of
                    individual, though associated existence.</p><p>This is what Laplace and Herschel have expressed when they presented, as the
                    result of their profound reflections, the speculation of this globe originating
                    from the condensation of a gaseous expansion in space—a notion often extended to
                    the other planets, and supposed to be in harmony with the common direction of
                    their motion round the sun, the nearly coincident planes of their orbits, and
                    other less striking circumstances. That such gaseous or vaporous expansions
                    exist in space is known both by observation of comets, and of nebulae.</p><p>Perhaps this view, as it is certainly the most elevated, is also the most correct
                    hypothesis of the early formation of the globe; but it would be unfair to employ
                    so speculative an argument against the doctrine of continual compensation among
                    the agencies of Nature, because this was proposed only for the terraqueous
                    globe. Given, then, the globe reduced from its gaseous expansion, we may proceed
                    to inquire into the proximate origin of its ancient rocks Here a real
                    discordance arises between the two systems compared. While describing the
                    primary strata, we have shewn the grounds for believing them to be derivative
                    aqueous from primitive igneous rocks; but Mr Lyell, in his ingenious development
                    of the Huttonian philosophy adds to this a reverse proceeding. According to his
                    view the sedimentary aggregates from water at the surface of the globe, are
                    derived from other such rocks, or from pyrogenous products; but whatever was
                    their proximate origin, they change again in the deeper parts of the earth, by
                    gradual transformation into crystalline or igneous rocks. So that the mechanical
                    agency of water above, and the transforming agency of heat below, are, in this
                    hypothesis, antagonist forces, separated by a zone of rocks (the crust of the
                    earth, as it is technically called) which above are of the aqueous, but below of
                    the igneous kingdom.</p><p>Between these two polarities, so to speak, the particles of the exterior parts of
                    the earth continually circulate. Fire raises matter from below: water wears away
                    the high parts of the surface, and adds to that load of strata which in the
                    lower part is hourly changing to granitic and other crystalline rocks, “equal
                    quantities in equal times.”</p><p>In support of this view, only local and limited facts can be adduced; but these,
                    as far as they go, are important. It is found that earthy limestones, such as
                    commonly occur in secondary strata, are converted, by heat and proximity to
                    pyrogenous rocks, into crystalline marble, such as occurs in primary strata
                    (Kaiserstuhl, Teesdale, Antrim); that has shales assume the aspect of clay-slate
                    (Vale of Chamouni) near the primary rocks; that common sandstone becomes
                    quartz-rock under the influence of heat (Caer Caradoc). Hence, as a consequence,
                    we infer the consolidation, and many other characters of primary strata, to be
                    the effect of heat. But this falls short of the proof required, which must be to
                    the extent of shewing, not the changes of secondary to primary strata, but the
                    changes of these into granite, and other crystalline rocks generally.
                    Satisfactory proof of this nature and to this extent, is, we believe, nowhere
                    afforded.</p><p>Moreover, what has been said before of the character and origin of the primary
                    strata, their relation to the development of organic life, and other
                    circumstances, appears sufficient to shew that their formation is, in some
                    important respects, of a different kind from that of secondary sedimentary
                    rocks; that the influencing conditions as to heat and watery agency were
                    dissimilar; that the globe was then really in a different state generally. If
                    so, we must certainly reject the doctrine of continual uniformity of natural
                    operations, and admit alternating periods of different modes and measures of
                    mechanical and chemical action. It is probable, then, that the successive
                    systems of strata which have been described, are all that have been formed above
                    the original crystalline rocks by the operations of water.</p><p>ORIGIN OF CONVULSIVE MOVEMENTS OF THE CRUST OF THE GLOBE.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Periods of Occurrence</hi> —The proofs of the occurrence of
                    such have already been given. Many examples have also been presented. It remains
                    to ascertain what progress has been made towards discovering the cause.</p><p>It is certain that convulsive movements have happened at various periods during
                    the deposition of the strata; and, notwithstanding the difficulties noticed in
                    an earlier part of this essay, as to the determining of their exact geological
                    date, there is already collected a great mass of information on the subject. One
                    of the most important results yet arrived at, is the conviction that the time
                    occupied in these convulsions was very short, compared to that which was
                    consumed in the deposition of the strata; short periods of convulsion alternated
                    with long periods of ordinary action. This at once decides the question as to
                    the uniformity of the effects of natur”.! agencies in the negative. It is also
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822238" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2238-0233"/>
                    found that the effects of these convulsions were very extensive. The exact
                    contemporaneity of those which followed the Plynlymmon rocks of Cumberland, and
                    the slaty rocks of North Wales and Cornwall, may not be proved, and is not, for
                    this part of the subject, very important. They happened within a comparatively
                    short period, so as to shew that the spasmodic action was extensively felt
                    within certain limits of geological chronology, in quarters where it had not
                    been experienced before; and the general unconformity of stratification between
                    the primary and secondary strata, shews that an almost universal disturbance or
                    series of disturbances happened within these limits.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Magnitude of Disturbance</hi> The extent of the disloca tions
                    effected by particular convulsions is really enormous, and puts to shame the
                    utmost exertion of a succession of modern earthquakes for many thousands of
                    years. The Penine region of the north of England, elevated posterior to the era
                    of coal-measures, is defined on three sides by dislocations of 1000, 2000, 3000,
                    and more feet; and there is, perhaps, as little reason to suppose that more than
                    one effort was employed on any one of these sides, as in the case of an ordinary
                    fault. Such faults, indeed, sometimes occasion depression of several hundred
                    feet; but seldom for such great lengths as the Penine and Craven
                    disturbances.</p><p>It is not easy, nor perhaps possible, to prove that single efforts have raised
                    the Grampian or Snowdonian chains to their present elevations; yet, in many
                    cases, it is hardly to be supposed that more than one exertion of force has been
                    applied to straight anticlinal axes like those of the Malvern Hills, the Caradoc
                    Hills, the Ribblesdalc Ridges, and others of considerable extent.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Systems of Disturbance.^—From</hi> careful inquiries it is
                    found possible to range the disturbances into systems related to geological
                    time, so as to present proofs of a definite number of considerable convulsions
                    having visited a particular region. Thus, in the British Isles, the following
                    systems of disturbance occur in the particular periods mentioned.</p><p>First Great System.—After the deposition of the Cambrian slates. The Grampians
                    and Lammermuir; the ranges of Donegal and Cavan; the Cumbrian Mountains;
                    Snowdonia; the Ocrynian Chain of Devon and Cornwall; are supposed to have been
                    uplifted at this time.</p><p>Second Great System—After the deposition of the coal-measures. The greater number
                    of dislocations in the coal-fields of Great Britain; the great Penine Fault,
                    Craven Fault, and Ribblesdale Anticlinals; the Derbyshire Faults; those of
                    Mendip, South Wales, were then produced.</p><p>Third System—After the deposition of some parts of the New Red Sandstone strata.
                    The Tynedale Fault; Faults in the coal-fields of Shropshire and Dudley; on the
                    northern border of Derbyshire; the ridge prolonged from the Breiddin Hills.</p><p>Fourth System—After the Oolitic period. In Yorkshire and Dorsetshire.</p><p>Fifth System—After the Marine Tertiaries of the South of England, Isle of Wight,
                    &amp;c.</p><p>On turning to the continent of Europe, we find that Μ. De Beaumont, besides
                    recognising these five systems, proposes several others, amounting in all to
                    twelve; but we shall only add the two which have affected the Alps in periods
                    probably later than any of those of the British convulsions.</p><p>The System of the Western Alps, which appears to have followed upon the
                    deposition of tertiary strata of the age of the Touraine beds (Meiocene,
                    LyelD.</p><p>The System of the Eastern Alps, parallel to the vale of the Danube. Some
                    supratertiary or diluvial beds are stated to be disturbed by this
                    convulsion.</p><p>Μ. De Beaumont suggests that the elevation of the Andes may have been posterior
                    to all these; and a curious though inexact corroboration of this opinion has
                    been lately furnished by Mr Darwin, who finds, in the southern parts of the
                    chain, strata of extremely modem date uplifted to the height of several thousand
                    feet.</p><p>In North America there appears, according to Professor Rogers, reason to suppose
                    that, since the disturbances of the primary and carboniferous strata, the whole
                    secondary and tertiary periods of geology have left few traces of any important
                    convulsive movements.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Direction of Convulsive Movements.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The first notions on this subject were formed by miners, who in the
                    course of their experience observed, as a fact of great practical importance to
                    their art, that the mineral veins which were most generally and uniformly
                    productive ranged east and west, or nearly; and that these <hi rend="italic">right running</hi> veins were divided by <hi rend="italic">cross-courses,</hi>
                    passing north and south, or nearly. Not that there are no other directions of
                    veins and cross-courses, but, amidst many directions, these prevail. Cornwall,
                    Wales, Cumberland, the Penine limestone region, Brittany, the Harz, the
                    Hungarian mines, and even Mexico appear to confirm this law suggested by
                    practical men. It is very difficult, or rather impossible, to explain it; but we
                    may remark, that, in many cases, the direction of mineral veins follows that of
                    the natural joints and fissures produced by consolidation of the rocks; and that
                    it is very conceivable that electrical currents, or other polarizing agents,
                    might communicate to such fissures one or more definite directions. In fact, it
                    is proved that in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and other large tracts, these fissures
                    have definite directions, mostly rectangular to one another.</p><p>But it is to Μ. De Beaumont that we owe the proposal of the direction of
                    convulsive movements, as a new and important problem in geology. He supposes
                    that disturbances of the same system or geological era are parallel to a certain
                    great circle of the sphere; that those of different periods are related to
                    different circles, the poles of these circular systems being very irregularly
                    posited on the globe. There are facts which make for and against this
                    hypothesis, but it is difficult, in the present state of our knowledge, to come
                    to a right conclusion on the matter. It is very difficult to know the relative
                    ages of <hi rend="italic">distant</hi> convulsions, because the lines of
                    contemporaneous stratification are often entirely unknown. Adjacent convulsions,
                    even if parallel, cannot prove a rule which is to apply to a whole circle;
                    moreover, local variations of a line of convulsion sometimes derange all the
                    reasoning.</p><p>Instances in favour of the view of Μ. de Beaumont may be found in the British
                    islands,—none more remarkable than the north-east and south-west axes of
                    anticlinal elevation, which compose the first great British system of disturbed
                    strata. Less extensive analogy obtains among the many anticlina!s of
                    Ribblesdale, which belongs to the second system; but this also ranges north-east
                    and southwest, or east-north-east and west-south-west; while of other lines of
                    the same date in the same region, one, the Penine Fault, ranges
                    north-north-cast, and north-northwest; another, the Craven Fault, ranges
                    west-north-west. If the South Wales system be contemporaneous (and it has not
                    been proved to be otherwise), east and west directions must be added to these
                    various lines; and what makes the whole more perplexing, is the recurrence of
                    east and west directions in the post-tertiary, or fifth English system, between
                    the basins of Hampshire and London.</p><p>Under these circumstances, it is clearly impossible to adopt De Beaumont’s
                    hypothesis, for want of evidence either exact or extensive enough to
                    substantiate it. But <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822251" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2251-0234"/> yet entirely to reject the principle which it
                    involves, would be not only rash, but positively contradictory∙to important
                    facts. That some symmetrical accordance does really exist, and is traceable
                    between the dislocations of a particular age in a particular region, is certain.
                    Some cases are known of this symmetry being more extensively recognised. We may
                    therefore continue our inquiries, not to test the hypothesis of De Beaumont, but
                    to find out what is the truth.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Results of Observation</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In Mr
                    Murchison’s notices of the Silurian system, and the igneous rocks associated
                    therewith, are many proofs of the local parallelism of ridges of trap, and
                    anticlinal axes in these ancient rocks, combined with some general directions of
                    dislocation. The prevailing strike of all these deposits is north-east and
                    south-west, or parallel to the Snowdonian chain, from Shropshire to the mouth of
                    the Towey, a range of 100 miles. Within this space are numerous minor axes of
                    dislocation, short, but parallel to the same great strike of the beds; the beds
                    dipping north-west and south-east, from ridges of trap. This general line of
                    dislocation is broken through by transverse rents and fissures. A north-eastern
                    strike belongs to the Ludlow rocks and the old red sandstone. On the eastern
                    side of the red sandstone of Herefordshire, the ridges of Abberley and Malvern
                    point north and south, but are complicated by minor ridges running in different
                    directions. They are posterior to the coal formation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Geological Proceedings.</p></note></p><p>In the mountain limestone tracts of Yorkshire, the dislocations present the
                    following general characters :—The faults and mineral veins have a tendency to
                    range at right angles to one another; the lesser faults and veins terminate in
                    the greater to which they are rectangular. Where the great or Penine fault
                    changes its direction, the veins also change. The intersection of the branches
                    of the Penine fault with the main stem, though one of these branches is not of
                    the same age, is nearly perpendicular. In the Ribblesdale system of anticlinals,
                    many parallel ridges east-north-east and west-south-west occur, and these are
                    subject to very frequent cross-rolls or undulations, which break them into oval
                    quaquaversal elevations. Mineral veins tend to cross these axes (one goes along
                    an axis.) The Ribblesdale anticlinals are directed at right angles toward the
                    Craven fault, and near this fault some of them bend and turn to coincide in its
                    direction. “If we conceive all the country south of that fault to have undergone
                    a vast relative depression, and that at right angles to the line of the fault
                    many parallel undulations sprung out, which arrived at their maximum of
                    curvature a short distance from the fault, we shall have a right notion of the
                    case.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Geology of

                    with the experience of miners and many other circumstances, point to some common
                    principle, which must recognise as one of its results, a tendency to local
                    parallelism and rectangulation among the lines of dislocation in a given region.
                    A valuable contribution for this object has lately been added to geology by Mr
                    Hopkins <hi rend="italic">(Camb. Trans.),</hi> who, from very simple and
                    probable assumed conditions of the crust of the globe, has deduced
                    mathematically a series of dynamical results for comparison with the observed
                    laws of phenomena. The following extract will explain his views and methods of
                    inquiry :—“The hypotheses from which I set out, with respect to the action of
                    the elevatory force, are, I conceive, as simple as the nature of the subject can
                    admit of. I assume this force to act under portions of the earth’s crust of
                    considerable extent, at any assignable depth, either with uniform intensity at
                    every point, or in some cases with a somewhat greater intensity at particular
                    points; as for in stance, at points along the line of maximum elevation of an
                    elevated range, or at other points where the actual phenomena seem to indicate a
                    more than ordinary energy of this subterranean action. I suppose this elevatory
                    force, whatever may be its origin, to act upon the lower surface of the uplifted
                    mass, through the medium of some fluid, which may be conceived to be an elastic
                    vapour, or, in other cases, a mass of matter in a state of fusion from heat.
                    Every geologist, I conceive, who admits the action of elevatory forces at all,
                    will be disposed to admit the legitimacy of these assumptions.</p><p>“The first effect of an elevatory force, will of course be to raise the mass
                    under which it acts, and to place it in a state of extension, and consequently
                    of tension. The increase of intensity in the elevatory force, might be so rapid
                    as to give it the character of an impulsive force, in which case it would be
                    impossible to calculate the dislocating effects of it. This intensity and that
                    of the consequent tension, will therefore be always assumed to increase
                    continuously, till the tension becomes sufficient to rupture the mass, thus
                    producing fissures and dislocations, the nature and position of which it will be
                    the first object of our investigation to determine. These will depend partly on
                    the elevatory forces, and partly on the resistance opposed to its action by the
                    cohesive power of the mass. Our hypotheses respecting the constitution of the
                    elevated masses, are by no means restricted to that of perfect homogeneity; on
                    the contrary, it will be seen that its cohesive power may vary, in general,
                    according to any continuous law; and moreover, that this power, in descending
                    along any vertical line, may vary according to any discontinuous law; so that
                    the truth of our general results will be independent, for example, of any want
                    of cohesion between contiguous horizontal beds of a stratified portion of the
                    mass. Vertical or nearly vertical planes, however, along which the cohesion is
                    much less than in the mass immediately on either side of them, may produce
                    considerable modifications in the phenomena resulting from the action of an
                    elevatory force. The existence of joints, for instance, or planes of cleavage,
                    in the elevated mass, supposing the regularly jointed or slaty structure to
                    prevail in it previously to its elevation, might affect in a most important
                    degree the character of these phenomena. To a mass thus constituted, these
                    investigations must not be considered as generally applicable.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cambridge Trans.

                    results to the actual case of a portion of the earth’s crust, under the
                    hypotheses respecting the action of the elevatory forces, and the cohesive power
                    of the mass, which have been already stated.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Longitudinal Fissures.</hi> In the case of a mass of
                    indefinite length, bounded laterally by two parallel lines, with the elevatory
                    force uniform, the extension, and therefore the tension, will be entirely in a
                    direction perpendicular to the length, so that its whole tendency will be to
                    produce <hi rend="italic">longitudinal</hi> fissures, or such as are <hi rend="italic">parallel to the axis of elevation.</hi> These fissures will not
                    commence at the surface, but at some lower part of the mass. The whole series of
                    stratified rocks existing above an originating line of fissure, will be affected
                    by the tension producing it; but under certain cases the fissures may not reach
                    the surface. The width of the fissure will be nearly the same at all depths of
                    disturbed strata (varying, however, with their elasticity). Any number of these
                    fissures might be formed simultaneously, more, it is probable, in the deeper
                    parts.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193822264" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2264-0235"/><p>Thus there are complete and incomplete fissures, all parallel to the axis of the

                    to act with greater intensity at particular points along the general line of
                    elevation, or an additional force <hi rend="italic">superimposed</hi> on a

                    may be produced, circumstanced like the longitudinal fissures previously
                    mentioned, as to completeness, width, &amp;c. but ranging across <hi rend="italic">the axis of elevation</hi> and approximately perpendicular to the
                    longitudinal fissures. This result is almost independent of time: the transverse
                    fissures may be ihstantaneously following, or very long subsequent to the
                    longitudinal fissures.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These deductions from theory are supported by many well established
                    tacts.</p></note></p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Fissures of a Conical Elevation,</hi> if produced solely by
                    forces of great intensity and limited area, will commence along or very near to
                    the axis of the cone, and be continued in a vertical plane, passing through the
                    axis. If such forces were exerted <hi rend="italic">simultaneously</hi> with
                    those determining a general axis of elevation and fissures parallel thereto, the
                    result would be a local convergence of such longitudinal fissures towards the
                    axis of the conical elevation, beyond which they would resume their parallels. A
                    contrary deviation of these fissures would follow upon a spherical
                    elevation.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Faults.</hi> By the decrease of the expansive forces which
                    produced the tensions occasioning the fissures, the equilibrium of the divided
                    parts would be destroyed, and they might rest in unequal elevation above their
                    original level, thus producing longitudinal and transverse faults. Anticlinal,
                    synclinal, and simple faults are thus easily understood to be all consequences
                    of the new positions taken by the divided rocks upon the cessation of the
                    sustaining forces.</p><p>Without prosecuting further our abstract from Mr Hopkins’ ingenious paper (which
                    embraces, however, many other remarkable coincidences with observations), we may
                    quote his important conclusion.</p><p>“If the approximate accuracy of our assumptions be allowed, as applied to the
                    crust of the globe, it appears from our investigations that an elevated range
                    characterized by continuous systems of longitudinal and transverse fissures,
                    referrible to the causes to which we have been assigning such phenomena, could
                    not be produced by successive elevations of different points, by the partial
                    action of an elevatory force. In such elevations, fissures would necessarily
                    diverge in all directions from the central points, so that parallel systems,
                    such as have been mentioned above, could not possibly be thus produced. Every
                    system of parallel fissures in which no two consecutive fissures are remote from
                    each other, must necessarily have had one simultaneous origin.”</p><p>origin of mineral veins.</p><p>This has long been, and will for some time continue, a disputable question in
                    geology; but considerable progress has been made in it since the days of Werner
                    and Playfair. <hi rend="italic">The origin of the fissures</hi> in which a great
                    proportion of mineral veins occur, is certainly proved to be either by molecular
                    attraction, causing contraction of the mass of rock, and thus generating joints
                    or divisional planes, or by the tension of elevatory forces, as explained in the
                    last section. <hi rend="italic">The relative antiquity</hi> of the fissures
                    constituting rake veins, (in Cornwall called lodes), is become a practicable
                    problem, since Mr Hopkins has given mathematical deductions to aid the
                    observation of facts. When, as is universally found in a mining district, some
                    veins as A B cross others as CD, (Diagram No. 15.) and interrupt them, the
                    conclusions of the miners have generally been in accordance with the Wernerian
                    dictum, viz. that the continuous vein is of less antiquity than that which it
                    divides; but Mr Hopkins thinks this conclusion untenable. For if the
                    displacements of the veins be only apparent, that is, if either of the fissures
                    has been originally formed with the irregularity in question, in consequence of
                    any line of least resistance affecting the direction, it must he the newer C D,
                    which has deviated along the fissure AB, and then resumed its bearing.</p><p>But if the displacement be real (whether vertically or horizontally), then, as
                    far as relates to the fissures, they may be contemporaneous. It may, however, be
                    possible from other considerations, to determine the relative epochs of the
                    introduction of mineral matter into fissures, if not the geological dates of
                    their production.</p><p>The differences of the contents of veins in a given mining region, <hi rend="italic">e g.</hi> Cornwall, appear certainly in a considerable degree
                    related to their directions. Werner long since proposed a classification of
                    veins founded on their directions and contents, and supposed it possible to
                    refer even English mineral veins to their place in his Saxon Mining System from
                    such considerations. (Werner on Veins, translated by Anderson.) Mr Carne gives
                    no less than eight principal systems and ages of mineral veins in Cornwall. The
                    criteria of age are founded on the displacements of the veins; east and west is
                    the most prevalent line of productive veins; north and south of the cross
                    courses, which are generally unproductive.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Repletion, of Mineral Veins</hi> The opinion of the Cor nish
                    miners and geologists generally appears to be, that most or all of these veins
                    are to be regarded as contemporaneous with the rocks which enclose them; but the
                    arguments for this contemporaneity are not so satisfactory as those employed by
                    Professor Jameson in the case of contemporaneous veins in igneous rocks.— <hi rend="italic">Wern. Trans.</hi> Dr Boase and others, however, mention the change
                    of metallic contents with change of rock,—the favourable or unfavourable
                    character of certain rocks for yielding ore, &amp;c.</p><p>Whatever force may be thought due to the facts and the opinions brought forward
                    on the subject of veins in Cornwall, it is perfectly certain that, in distinctly
                    stratified countries, the mineral matter has been introduced into open fissures
                    long after the deposition and consolidation of the strata. <hi rend="italic">The
                    proof is unanswerable.</hi> Joints and fissures filled with metallic and sparry
                    matters (mineral veins), pass through rocks which are not contemporaneous but
                    successively deposited, and <hi rend="italic">divide corals, fishes,</hi>
                    &lt;c.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Report British Associatiοη,</hi> Edinburgh Meeting.</p></note> It is evident
                    that this must close the discussion as far as regards these rocks.</p><p>But, though it cannot be reasonably doubted, as a general truth, that the
                    vein-stuff has been transferred into open fissures of the rocks, it is not so
                    easy to determine how this was effected. Have the materials been injected from
                    below as lavas into the fissures of a mountain (Hutton), or sublimed from a hot
                    region to a cold fissure (Buckland), or segregated by some peculiar influence
                    from the neighbouring rocks (Sedgwick), or poured into them in aqueous
                    solution<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822277" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2277-0236"/> (Werner), or transferred by electrical currents
                    (Fox), as in some instances we have good reason to believe?</p><p>In the present state of our knowledge neither of these results can be admitted
                    exclusively, yet perhaps none ought to be absolutely rejected as a cause of the
                    repletion of metalliferous fissures. Many veins appear as much the result of a
                    real injection of sparry and metallic matters from a subterranean source as any
                    rock-dykes or granite-veins. But when, as in Derbyshire, we find mineral veins
                    divided horizontally by a particular stratiform mass, as toadstone, and in other
                    parts by a. gillaceous beds, so that the vein, being, a full fissure above and
                    below, is only represented in the toadstone or shale by one or a few strings of
                    calcareous spar, it becomes evident that injection is not the only cause of the
                    repletion of mineral veins. See Diagram No. 16.</p><p>Sublimation from the heated subterranean laboratory of nature through the
                    fissures of rocks is a very probable, but not universal, cause of the repletion
                    of veins. It is probable because of the agreement between the successive
                    vertical lamination of the materials of a vein and the supposed successive
                    introduction of them to the fissures; but this is not conclusive, inasmuch as
                    the processes of crystallization from a general fluid mass may as well be
                    appealed to for producing the same phenomenon. It is not universal, because of
                    the frequent occurrence of perfectly insulated nests of metallic and sparry
                    matter in shells and in the substance of rocks. These, indeed, afford a very
                    strong <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> argument in
                    favour of the collection by molecular segregation or electrical transfer of the
                    different particles. If we consult general probability, it will appear most
                    reasonable to admit these separate aggregations of metallic and sparry matter,
                    as being laterally transferred <hi rend="italic">from the vein</hi> rather than
                    examples of <hi rend="italic">segregation from the rock.</hi> Nearly every case
                    of peculiar apparent relation between the sparry and metallic contents of a vein
                    to the nature of the enclosing rock, vanishes on a careful scrutiny. It is not
                    because of any peculiar chemical quality that limestone yields most lead-ore in
                    Aldstone Moor, but because of its being a rock which has retained openness of
                    fissure. Gritstones, in many mining fields near Aldstone Moor, are equally
                    productive; but shales, as being soft extensible layers, have closed up the
                    fissures, and their crumbling faces appear to have rejected the crystallizations
                    which attached to the harder limestone, gritstone, and chert.</p><p>If any doubt could remain on this point, it is removed by the observations of
                    Necker, Dufrenoy, Murchison, and others, as to the real and evident dependence
                    of mineral districts, that is, districts where the rock fissures are full of
                    valuable minerals, upon axes of disturbance and upliftings of igneous rocks. In
                    the Pyrenees, in Brittany, in Cornwall, the Shelve district of Shropshire,
                    Flintshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire, Aldstone Moor, this important law is certain.
                    Whatever be the chemical nature of the rock adjoining the dislocation or igneous
                    rock, the productiveness of the veins is chiefly regulated by its condition as
                    to fissures. Limestone in Derbyshire, millstone-grit in Nidderdale, chert in
                    Swaledale, basalt in Teesdale, coal near Bradford, and Richmond, all yield
                    sulphuret of lead and various associated sparry substances.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Prevalence of Mineral Veins in Pocks.of different Age.</hi> —As
                    a general result, we cannot doubt of the far greater prevalence of mineral veins
                    in the older than in the newer rocks. Not one case is known of a mineral vein
                    being at any time worked in any part of the British islands above the new red
                    sandstone. In the new red sandstone and magnesian limestone hardly more than
                    slight traces of such products occur; they are rare in our coal-tracts, but they
                    become abundant in the mountain limestone and older strata. But yet it is
                    probable that this relation of mineral veins to the age of deposits is merely a
                    consequence of the more general truth, that their origin is from below, that the
                    fissures which they occupy, and the metallic and sparry matters which compose
                    them, are more numerous near the igneous rocks which in so many instances form
                    the axes of movement. It is not merely because of the antiquity of the Killas of
                    Cornwall, but of its proximity to granite rocks, that it is so very
                    metalliferous; the limestone of Ireland, undisturbed by great axes of movement,
                    is very little metalliferous; while the same rocks dislocated in Mendip,
                    Flintshire, Derbyshire, &amp;c. yield many sorts of metals and spars, in veins
                    of different kinds.</p><p>Thus, the most general point of view in which mineral veins present themselves,
                    is that of dependence on proximity to the sources of subterranean heat. In the
                    rocks nearest these sources they are most numerous and varied; they abound near
                    the disturbances which are consequences of variation of internal heat; and, in
                    certain cases, fPyre-nees, &amp;c.), they are not rare even among newer strata
                    where the subterranean igneous rocks have exerted a remarkable influence.</p><p>DESICCATION OF THE ANCIENT BED OF THE SEA.</p><p>The strata, with their organic contents, having been already proved to have
                    formed in succession the bed of the sea, and the far greater part of the surface
                    of the globe even to great heights in .the Andes and Himalaya, the Alps,
                    Pyrenees, Caucasus, and other mountains, it follows that nearly the whole
                    terrestrial surface of the globe was formerly submerged, and has since been laid
                    dry. The desiccation of the land is a problem of fundamental importance in
                    geology, influencing a multitude of secondary inquiries. If we might venture to
                    suppose the quantity of water upon the globe variable, the land might be
                    imagined to have risen above the ocean in consequence of the great abstraction
                    of the latter; but, in the first place, there appears no proba' bility that such
                    a supposition is admissible, even by bringing a comet in contact with the earth;
                    nor does it agree with the observed condition of the strata. For these by no
                    means appear in such arrangements as to correspond with what we know of the
                    character of a large part of the stra tified bed of the sea.</p><p>Dismissing, then, this notion, and restricting ourselves to the conditions of
                    sensible constancy in the quantity of water upon the globe, we find the próblem
                    of the desiccation of the bed of the sea reduce itself to the determination of
                    the causes of the change of relative level of land and water.</p><p>Such a change of relative level might happen in many ways, some with, others
                    without, local changes in the form of the solid parts of the crust of the globe.
                    To the last class may be referred variations of level arising from change of
                    temperature or alteration of the earth’s axis of rotation. The former includes a
                    variety of cases of subterranean movements.</p><p>EFFECTS OF VARYING TEMPERATURE NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE.</p><p>W hatever be the constitution of the interior of the globe, a general change of
                    temperature of the whole mass of land and water must of necessity alter the
                    relative level of land and sea, because the ratios of expansion and contraction
                    of the solid and liquid parts are unequal. Water changes its dim.*n⅛ions in a
                    higher ratio to the difference of temperature<pb break="no" facs="nls:193822290" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2290-0237"/> than the rocks
                    of the crust of the globe; hence a ge ∙ neral cooling of the mass of the globe,
                    or to a considerable depth from the surface, ought to cause the <hi rend="italic">ocean to sink</hi> relatively to the land; on the contrary, with
                    any augmentation of temperature the <hi rend="italic">ocean would rise</hi> upon
                    the land. As sea-water contracts continually down to its freezing point, and the
                    greater part of the ocean never freezes, we may, by assuming a probable mean
                    depth, arrive at some useful results. If the mean depth of the ocean be taken at
                    ten miles, which is probably too much, though nothing is positively known, and
                    it be supposed to have cooled from a boiling heat to a mean temperature of 40°
                    F., its change of volume would be about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛gθ. The
                    corresponding cubical contraction of the land, supposing it to have the rate of
                    expansion in glass, would be about <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ∕ <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi> θ∙ I <hi rend="superscript"> f tlrc areas</hi> of the
                    surfaces of land and sea were supposed nearly to continue in the same
                    proportion, the whole cubical contraction of the land and water would operate in
                    lowering their level 10 × lo§ō — τ∕σ&lt;5 = 0&gt;395 miles, relative lowering of
                    waterlevel. But this cannot be admitted; for the slopes of the land into the
                    sea, over a great part of the globe, are very moderate. If the linear
                    contraction of the water alone be taken, and compared with that of the land, we
                    have the lowering of the ocean = 10 <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ⅛gθ — <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ι = 0∙132 mile = 697 feet.</p><p>When we consider the gently sloping surfaces of a large part of the land, we
                    shall see that the contraction of the area of the ocean would diminish its
                    linear depression, and upon the whole we cannot doubt that a fall of 697 feet is
                    much beyond the amount that could possibly happen if the whole ocean had cooled
                    from a boiling temperature to 40° Fahr. But this difference of level is too
                    small to account for the desiccation of more than a small portion of the surface
                    of the land; the hypothesis must therefore be abandoned as a general
                    explanation, though hereafter it may be found of great importance in a more
                    comprehensive theory.</p><p>GENERAL CHANGE OF DIMENSIONS OF THE GLOBE.</p><p>Let us now trace the effects of a general change of the dimensions of the globe
                    on the relative level of land and water.</p><p>If we suppose the whole globe to undergo change of dimensions by variation of
                    heat, the effects already ascribed to variation of temperature in the exterior
                    part would still take place; but, in addition, would be complicated with an
                    effect depending on the change of spherical area of the surface. In the case of
                    augmenting temperature of the whole globe, the water would rise upon the land,
                    as explained in the last section, but its rise would be less in that case, in
                    consequence of its expansion over a larger area. If the expansion of the whole
                    globe should go to such an extent as to change the diameter (D) into D ×
                    (√l∙039), or from 7900 to 8055 miles, the fall of the ocean would equal the rise
                    of it due to the unequal expansion of land and water from 40° to 212°.</p><p>It appears, then, that the desiccation of land is not an effect of the general
                    cooling of the globe, <hi rend="italic">without change of form,</hi> for the
                    effect due to that is of a contrary description; nor of the unequal contraction
                    by cooling of the superficial parts of the globe, for that effect, even through
                    the whole range from boiling heat (212°) to 40° F. would be totally inadequate
                    to account for the phenomenon, even if the depth of the ocean be supposed far
                    greater than it is admitted by astronomers to be.</p><p>Of the great physical events to which such a change of level may be ascribed,
                    sound reasoning excludes all that are exterior to our globe; none of its
                    relations to the sun and planets, none of the changes of these relations, are of
                    importance in the matter. The only leading event really influential on the
                    point, which we may <hi rend="italic">imagine</hi> possible, though astronomers
                    give no encouragement whatever to the admission of it as a basis of speculation,
                    is a change of the position of the earth’s axis.</p><p>Upon the occurrence of such an event, there would evidently be a new disposition
                    of the ocean; its waters would flow from the new poles towards the new equator,
                    and some ancient lands might thus be submerged, and extensive surfaces laid
                    dry.</p><p>The actual polar circles ought to be land; the equatorial zone should be deep
                    sea. This want of agreement is remarkable; and, when we add to it the
                    consideration that the absolute fixity of the pole of rotation, in a spheroid of
                    revolution such as the earth is known to be, is a point supposed to be proved,
                    we shall feel the necessity of abandoning altogether the attempt to explain the
                    desiccation of the land, by imagining general depression, or partial
                    abstractions of the ocean, without local <hi rend="italic">changes of form of
                    the surface of the globe.</hi></p><p>CHANGES OF FORM OF THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE.</p><p>Admitting such changes, the partial abstraction of the ocean may be viewed as a
                    natural consequence, and the surface of the land may be studied, for the purpose
                    of discovering the points of depression and elevation. We are thus brought back
                    again to the observation of local phenomena, and may proceed by induction.</p><p>It is undoubtedly certain, by a large induction of examples derived from various
                    geological periods, that mountain ranges and tracts of plain country have been
                    raised by local elcvatory forces. Anticlinal axes, parallel and réctangu-lated
                    faults, are of a nature to prove the truth of this view. By such means, large
                    breadths of land have been influenced, near and at considerable breadths from
                    the axis of elevation. It further appears that still larger tracts of land,
                    where no such evidence of violent and convulsive disruption of the strata
                    occurs, must be supposed to have been gently and gradually lifted by an
                    intumescence or expansion of the surface, depending on a continuous and very
                    extensive subterranean agency. Thus, after the elevation of the Snowdonian
                    chain, and the ridges of the Silurian system,—after the Malvern and Abbcrley
                    elevations,—the whole plain of the midland counties has experienced one general
                    upward movement of a few hundred feet. Thus, the ancient vale of Eden has been
                    raised since the rising of the Penine chain; and with it the whole area of the
                    red sandstone round the Solway Frith, after the relative uplifting of the
                    Lammermuir Hills. Instances of this double movement in the same physical region
                    arc almost universal.</p><p>That the elevation of the crust of the globe in one part was accompanied by
                    depression in other parts, is extremely probable; but we cannot offer
                    satisfactory proof from observation of more than local subsidences, and these
                    generally complicated with subsequent elevations. The best case of such
                    fluctuations known, is perhaps that of the emersion, submersion, and re-cmersion
                    of the Portland oolites, as indicated by the dirt-beds.</p><p>It is, of course, in the sea that we are to look for effects of subsidences, as
                    the land gives those of elevation. To whatever extent we suppose such
                    subsidences to have happened, and the level of the sea to have been thereby
                    lowered, the phenomena indicative of a real elevation of the land are not less
                    conclusive. This is a matter of calculation.</p><p>From Mr Hopkins’s researches, it appears that the elevatory agency was of the
                    nature of a gradually augmenting force, very extensive compared to the areas
                    simultaneously disturbed. No example of modern earthquakes can be brought to
                    render it probable, that mere volcanic agency could upraise the continents which
                    it is capable of shaking.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193822303" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2303-0238"/><p>Yet, as far as we see, a more powerful exertion of the same kind of agency might
                    perform the effects; the principle of this and every other explanation being the
                    necessity of a new adjustment of the exterior form and dimensions of the globe,
                    in consequence of accumulating tension upon it.</p><p>But if, for a moment, we abstract our attention from these limited developments
                    of the energies of heat, and consider the elevatory action below continents and
                    islands as the local resultant of diffused subterranean forces, it appears
                    possible to arrive at a more general and equally applicable theory. If, as
                    observations appear to indicate, the ocean once covered all or a large part of
                    the globe, its mean depth must formerly have been less than at present: since
                    the inequalities of the land arise from subterranean convulsions, and the bed of
                    the sea is very irregular, we may admit that the whole or nearly the whole of
                    the terraqueous area has been affected by local displacements. It is the
                    resistance offered by the consolidated crust of the globe to a gradually
                    augmenting <hi rend="italic">change of internal</hi><hi rend="italic">dimensions,</hi> which caused the disturbing movements. We may therefore allow,
                    that, before the production of a consolidated crust of the globe, the ocean (if
                    it existed in a liquid form) was spread with considerable uniformity over the
                    spherical surface.</p><p>From these postulates it must follow, that the actual bed of the sea has been
                    formed by displacements, which, upon the whole, have caused a real subsidence;
                    as the displacements of the land have, upon the whole, caused a real elevation
                    of jt. And our confidence in the assumed condition is augmented by observing,
                    first, that they are all implied in the inferences from phenomena already
                    adopted, and that they agree with the sentiment of astronomers as to the
                    relation of the depths of the sea to the heights of the land.</p><p>REFRIGERATION OF THE GLOBE.</p><p>In endeavouring to embrace the phenomena of elevation and subsidence in one point
                    of view, it appears almost immaterial whether we suppose the tension of the
                    consolidated crust of the globe, which preceded its fracture and displacement,
                    to have arisen from inward or from outward pressure, —from expansion of, or
                    contraction upon, the interior nucleus,—because, in each case, the pressure
                    would be of the general and gradually accumulating description required; but it
                    seems an unavoidable condition <hi rend="italic">that the inter rior nucleus
                    should be of a yielding nature,</hi> to permit the subsidence of large portions
                    of the surface, and accommodate itself permanently to the elevations. This
                    condition leads us to the supposition of great interior heat, which, from
                    general physical considerations, had before appeared very probable, and, from
                    experimental researches, almost a matter of certainty.</p><p>If then, finally, we regard this heat as variable,—and, placed as the hot globe
                    is in the vast cold regions of space, through which it radiates its
                    uncompensated rays, it must be so—the globe must be growing cooler—we have at
                    once the general physical cause of the phenomena of disruption and displacement
                    on the crust of the globe, viz. <hi rend="italic">a collapse of this crust upon
                    the internal nucleus slowly contracted by refrigeration.</hi></p><p>That this is the just inference from the principal laws of phenomena known in
                    geology, we have no doubt; and we think it is free from any considerable
                    objection. An obvious and plausible one is this: If the diameter of the globe be
                    contracting through refrigeration, the length of the day, as compared to the
                    length of the year, should vary and grow less continually (the particles, which
                    have a certain rotatory velocity, subsiding to describe circles of shorter
                    radius). To which the answer is immediate and satisfactory, viz. that it is
                    true, that, since the days of Hipparchus, the space of two thousand years has
                    shewn no such variation; but that the conduction of heat through the
                    consolidated crust of the globe is known to be so slow as to render that a very
                    short period for the experiment; and further, that the crust does necessarily
                    <hi rend="italic">not follow</hi> in its contraction <hi rend="italic">uniformly</hi> on that of the nucleus, but is for a long time in a state of
                    tension, and is at last forced to accommodate itself to new dimensions by <hi rend="italic">a collapse.</hi></p><p>In corroboration of the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">a cooling globe,</hi> we
                    might here quote the phenomena of ancient organic life, which certainly agree
                    with it, so far as to shew that vegetation of a tropical character, corals, and
                    other zoophyta, crocodiles, and other reptiles analogous to the animals of hot
                    climates, formerly inhabited the land and sea near the polar circles; and
                    indicate that the surface of these now cold zones was then of a temperature
                    explicable only by a greater heating influence communicated from within the
                    earth.</p><p>The most complete test of this theory would doubtless be the deduction of
                    phenomena from it: but this, in the present state of knowledge of the disturbed
                    stratification of the globe, and other associated circumstances, cannot be
                    usefully attempted, unless in the very general expressions of Leibnitz, who,
                    after enumerating the leading features of the changes supposed to be effected in
                    and on the cooling globe by fire and water, states its present condition as one
                    of less unstable equilibrium,—“Donce, quiescentibus causis atque acquilibratis,
                    consistention emergeret rerum status.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Cony beare, Report on Geology to British Association,

                    created on the globe, finds innumerable monuments of more ancient systems of
                    being, fitted to earlier conditions of the planet he inhabits. Guided by the
                    principle of adaptation of organic life to physical conditions, which, at every
                    point of the earth and sea, is found now to obtain, and which, were it not
                    discoverable by observation, might be surely inferred from the wisdom and
                    general beneficence of creation, human reason is capable, to a considerable
                    degree, of penetrating within the mysterious veil of antiquity, and restoring
                    the terraqueous conditions of many former periods. Yet, as the perspective of
                    long past time lengthens, the clearness of the picture fades away, and the dim
                    and doubtful light disappoints our further scrutiny. Among the subjects which it
                    is possible partially to illustrate by this investigation, are the relation of
                    former systems of organization to that which is contemporaneous with the human
                    race,—the relations of these one to another,—the creation of the several classes
                    of animals, with reference to their place in the economy of creation.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The relation of former systems of organic life</hi> to that
                    which is in activity around us, is of a peculiar description, full of general
                    agreement and innumerable differences. The system of organic life, is perhaps,
                    properly speaking, <hi rend="italic">one</hi> from the earliest epoch to the
                    present hour; for all fossil Organization is reducible to the leading divisions
                    of modern nature: and it is this only which allows us to include the existing
                    animals and plants of distant regions as parts of one general arrangement.
                    Fossil, as well as recent, plants are agamous, cryptogamous, or phanerogamous;
                    the same <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822316" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2316-0239"/> leading divisions of zoophyta, mollusea,
                    crustacea,—many of the same sections of fishes and reptiles, as those which we
                    now behold,—occur in various ancient series of stratified rocks; and this is as
                    much as can be said for the unity of the existing creation, dismembered as it is
                    in different and distant lands and seas.</p><p>But when we come to examine minutely the degree of similitude among the
                    correlative parts of those systems, great discrepancies appear. Groups and
                    families of animals now hardly known, or very limited in number, appear
                    predominant in several ancient strata; as, for instance, the brachiopodous and
                    cephalopodous mollusea, large sections of radiaria, particular tribes of
                    crustacea, polyparia, &amp;c. Others, which contain but a few small species in
                    the present economy of nature, are found to have numbered many and gigantic
                    forms in older nature (as the saurian races, salamanders, &amp;c.): the same is
                    true with respect to the vegetable world.</p><p>The general result of the whole investigation may be thus expressed and
                    paralleled. The organic forms imbedded in the earth exhibit less and still less
                    agreement with those of existing races, in proportion as they belong to periods
                    further removed from the present: just as, in modern nature, the differences
                    between the productions of one country and another are, in several instances,
                    distinctly proportioned to the distance between them; and just as, in the
                    present system of nature, we see a mixture of agreements and differences between
                    the productions of even remote regions; so, on comparing fossil and living
                    tribes, the differences are found modified by various agreements. Extinct
                    genera, as producta and spirifera, he buried with existing genera, as lingula
                    and terebratula, in the ancient mountain limestone. Ammonites, hamites, and
                    belemnites, and other perished forms of life, are mingled, in the chalk, with
                    nautili, pectens, and echinodermata, congenerous with those now in the sea. So
                    with regard to plants. Extinct lepi-dodendra and stigmariae lie confused with
                    forms extremely analogous to existing tribes; and crocodiles, like the modem
                    gavial, lived in waters the same or neighbouring to those which nourished the
                    ichthyosaurus, plesiosaurus, and the other almost fabulous monsters of the
                    reptile class.</p><p>From these, and a thousand other concurring facts, we venture to present the
                    following conclusion. The organic remain^ of the different stratified rocks are
                    those of creatures suited to the then conditions of the land and sea
                    respectively; and because those conditions had some general features of
                    agreement with what we now behold, a resemblance to this extent obtains between
                    the fossil and recent creations; but, because of the numerous differences in
                    physical condition, all the details of the organizations differ; and this
                    disagreement is unequal in the different races, because of original
                    inequalities, or their capability of accommodating themselves to new
                    circumstances. This law appears also to be true in the present economy of
                    creation.</p><p><hi rend="italic">On comparing the different systems of strata</hi> one with
                    another, and with the present scheme of creation, the same law holds; and we
                    find, in addition, the differences between the organic contents of one system
                    and another, to be in proportion to the interval of geological time elapsed
                    between them. Thus the fossils of the Silurian system may be said to differ from
                    those of the mountain limestone specifically,—from the oolitic system
                    generically,—from the tertiary system, even by whole groups and sections of
                    animal forms. This dependence on time, however, is a coincidence merely, as the
                    analogy of fossils in rocks of analogous composition though different age, is
                    sufficient to prove; the real dependence is on the <hi rend="italic">change of
                    physical conditions, produced during the lapse of time.</hi></p><p>The present creation, and all the former effects of the Divine will, exhibits a
                    series of beings destined to perform unequal parts in the economy of n⅞ture.
                    Some, as plants, are almost passive; others, as animals, perform the functions
                    of active life. Man reasons,—inferior animals obey their instincts. Thus arises
                    a peculiar scale of organization, in which the places of the different living
                    tribes may be marked, with reference to their supposed degree of importance or
                    excellence; and the races of the animal kingdom, in particular, are said to be
                    of higher or lower grade, in proportion to the complexity of their organization,
                    and the variety of their sensations and actions. What is the order of succession
                    of these beings thus reckoned to be inferior and superior? Is the earliest
                    organization known to us, remarkably inferior in complexity to that we now
                    behold? These questions have been frequently proposed, and sometimes answered by
                    an erroneous assertion instead of candid and impartial investigation. The most
                    popular notion appears to be, that as man is undoubtedly the highest type of the
                    last creation of animal life, all the former ones should be viewed as gradually
                    ascending step by step from the inferior tribes towards the point of ultimate
                    perfection; that the several classes of animals, in the ratio of their rank in
                    creation, should successively appear; the inferior order of forms being found in
                    the lowest and most ancient order of strata.</p><p>There is some truth in this. Mollusea occur in the lowest of all the systems of
                    fossiliferous strata (Snowdon); zooph y ta, mollusea, crustacea, abound in all
                    those above the lower series. Fishes appear in the silurian rocks; reptiles in
                    the red sandstone; birds in the oolites; cetacea, mammalia, &amp;c., in the
                    supracretaceous beds. But on looking carefully into the matter, it is found
                    capable of a different construction. The fossils are mostly of marine origin;
                    hence the rarity of insects, birds, and mammalia. On the bed of a modern lake,
                    how few bones remain to inform us of the ancient finny inhabitants. The rarity
                    of such remains is remarkable among all the strata, not excepting even the has;
                    and yet we find, in the Silurian rocks near Ludlow, a whole bed of fish-bones
                    and scales, just as. in the has of Westbury. (Mr Lewis of Aymestry.) The order
                    of occurrence of vertebral reliquiae is generally fishes, reptiles, birds <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> and mammalia; yet the occurrence of one genus of
                    didelphoid quadrupeds in the oolite of Stonesfield, is a formidable exception;
                    and the general absence of all land animals from the marine strata, offers an
                    escape to those who totally deny this successive production of the classes of
                    animals, according to their grade of organization.</p><p>Neither is the order of occurrence of marine reliquiae such as to afford much
                    countenance to the notion of gradual improvement in organic life. The classes of
                    mollusea are more ancient than those of zoophyta, if we trust our present
                    knowledge, and both older than marine or land plants, —a seeming paradox, since
                    the pre-existence of vegetables seems capable of being sustained by strong
                    arguments drawn from the relations of animal and vegetable life.</p><p>But we may contemplate the question as to the gradual improvement of animal
                    organization in another point of view. Instead of comparing class to class, let
                    us compare those of one group but different geological age. The bivalve mollusea
                    of the oldest Snowdonian rocks were certainly as complicated, nay, more highly
                    organized than the greater number of conchifera of the present ocean, since they
                    belong to the brachiopoda. The crustacea of the Silurian system were at least as
                    curiously organized as the limuli of the North American coasts. The goniatites
                    of the mountain limestone are far more curiously constructed than the nautili
                    which lie with them, and also inhabit modern oceans. The belemnites and
                    ammonites, turrilites and other extinct genera of the oolite and chalk, reveal
                    to us an extinct order of cephalopoda, larger, more pow erful, and more
                    curiously organized, than existing'loligines and sepiae.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193822329" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2329-0240"/><p>It is evident, therefore,’ that the whole notion of a gradual amelioration or
                    enrichment of the animal organization may be dismissed as a mere illusion of the
                    fancy of a finite being, who vainly transfers to the work of the Almighty the
                    pattern of his own limited labours.</p><p>The systems of organic life have always been adjusted to the actual conditions of
                    the land and sea. When water covered the globe, life was marine; as land arose,
                    and new conditions supervened, terrestrial life was created; old races died
                    away; with new circumstances, new creations were called into being to supply
                    their place; and at length the physical revolutions of the globe brought that
                    wonderful variety of external circumstances to which organic life is at this day
                    adjusted.</p><p>Thus a perpetual stimulus is afforded to man, the last great creation of Divine
                    power, to study the works of his Maker, and through them to receive proofs
                    “strong as Holy Writ” of the long-enduring providence of the Almighty, whose
                    appointed plans the permitted violence of the physical agencies of nature,
                    amidst all their irregularities, exactly fulfil; and whose care, now so manifest
                    for his human creatures, has never been withheld from the meaner forms of every
                    age since the time when the earth became tenanted by beings capable of enjoying
                    their own existence.</p><p>GEOLOGICAL TIME.</p><p>The chronology adopted by geologists is liable to an inherent uncertainty or
                    indefiniteness, quite different in its nature from the sources of error in
                    ancient history. In the history of human affairs, the whole period which elapsed
                    between the two epochs chosen as limits is known or supposed to be so; but the
                    intervening occurrences cannot often be correctly placed in their true
                    succession. In geology, <hi rend="superscript"> 0n</hi> the contrary, the whole
                    period included between the limits is, and perhaps must ever be, absolutely
                    unknown; yet the succession of occurrences is, in general, clearly ascertained.
                    Again, it frequently happens, that the histories of different nations have no
                    common features for very long periods, but remain insulated. This defect is less
                    sensible in geology; for some of the monuments of contemporaneous physical
                    conditions of the globe are very widely diffused.</p><p>The true scale of geological chronology is that of the stratified rocks.
                    According to the view previously advocated, the several systems of strata mark
                    periods more or less exactly definable; the last, or supratcrtiary period, which
                    descends to the present era of the globe, being, as yet, one of the least
                    defined in its limits.</p><p>It has been already explained that historical time, commencing with the human
                    race, is not yet united to geological time. Whenever the exact place of the
                    creation of man, on the scale of geological phenomena, can be fixed, and the two
                    scales continuously united, we may be able to advance, without certainty of
                    utter failure, to the consideration of the problem lately proposed for a prize
                    essay by the Royal Society of London, viz. the translation of geological into
                    astronomical periods.</p><p>At present the chronology of the globe, starting from the origin of the
                    stratified rocks, and including the whole series of successions of organic
                    beings, and all the convulsive disturbances of the cooled and consolidated
                    crust, recognises many successive periods of unknown duration. * Neither does it
                    appear possible to know their duration, or even the limits of error within which
                    they fall. How, then, it may be asked, do geologists justify their confident
                    assertions of the very great antiquity of particular rocks as compared with the
                    few thousand years of history? To this the reply is simple. Many of the ancient
                    stratified rocks were formed in the sea by processes perfectly similar to those
                    which go on at this day; and, <hi rend="italic">in some cases,</hi> we may
                    believe not at all more rapid in their effects. The laminated sandstones often
                    mark what appears to be the ripple of a gentle tide, and the successive deposits
                    of agitated water; the shelly limestones sometimes prove very slow deposition of
                    even a single layer of calcareous rock; the alternation of igneous and
                    sedimentary rocks gives us the similitude of volcanic submarine eruptions. Now,
                    if we compare with the sedimentary strata of any particular period the most
                    similar products of the present day,—the new land on the Adriatic,—the filling
                    up of the Niìe Valley,—the shallowing of the Bay of Bengal,—we shall be
                    impressed with the necessity of allowing a long period for the production of a
                    single stratified formation.</p><p>Again, if we recollect, that during these periods many creations of new and
                    destructions of old races of animals and plants happened,—and that, ever since
                    the records of human art, the embalmed body or sculptured effigies, have given
                    the means of judgment, no change has happened to modern races; that two or three
                    thousand years have not changed the forms of animals known to the early
                    Egyptians; we shall see the impropriety of imagining such changes to have been
                    of quick succession in the earlier eras of nature.</p><p>And when we behold conglomerate rocks which hold fragments of other earlier
                    deposits, and, in these fragments, the organic remains of still earlier periods
                    which had already undergone their peculiar mineral changes; when we collect the
                    history of such an organic form,—its existence in the sea,—its sepulture in a
                    vast oceanic deposit of limestone, or in a littoral aggregation of
                    sandstone,—the induration of this rock,—its uplifting by subterranean forces,—
                    the rolling of it to pebbles,—the reunion of them in a totally different kind of
                    substance,—it is evident that no greater folly can be committed than to think to
                    serve the cause of truth by contracting the long periods of geology into the
                    compass of a few thousand years.</p><p>The task of reducing these long periods to any definite scale, is at present
                    entirely hopeless. Three possible modes seem open to us; but we cannot advance a
                    step in any one of these, without immediate aid from visionary and delusive
                    guides.</p><p>1. Could we know the rate of secular refrigeration of the globe, either from
                    general physical considerations, ora summation of the effects of convulsive
                    movements, a basis of inquiry would be established. But who will dare to attempt
                    the solution of such a problem?</p><p>2. Could we know the mean or extreme rate of production of stratified deposits at
                    the present day, this would enable us to conjecture the lengths of some
                    geological periods, and with double hazard refer others to this conjectural
                    scale; but even this unsatisfactory estimate would be liable to the further and
                    fatal error of not knowing the ratio of the forces in the different periods. To
                    assume this ratio is only to augment in a still higher degree the amount of
                    improbability.</p><p>3. Perhaps the safest, certainly the most alluring, of the three methods which
                    geology may follow in this dark research, is that which is founded on a strict
                    scrutiny of the history of organic remains. The life of animals and plants is a
                    phenomenon distinctly related to annual periods; and, for some systems of
                    strata, as for example the tertiary, the resemblance of specific forms is
                    enough, the great number of coincidences being considered, to authorize
                    deductions as to the length of life of fossil and recent species of marine
                    mollusea. But here the want of knowledge is utterly fatal. Who can tell us the
                    average term of life of marine molluscous animals, sufficiently comparable with
                    tertiary shells, to form a basis of good reasoning?</p><p>It is evident that we have no knowledge capable of being employed, in the
                    magnificent problem of the age of the crust of the globe, at all equal to the
                    difficulty which meets <pb break="no" facs="nls:193822342" xml:id="kp-eb0715-2342-0241"/> us on the very threshold. Until the constants of
                    nature which relate to the dependence of organic or inorganic phenomena on
                    annual periods be known, the determination of the antiquity of any of the marine
                    stratified rocks must be despaired of.</p><p>GENERAL RESULT.</p><p>We have thus briefly presented some fundamental inferences which must be embodied
                    in any rational theory of geology.</p><p>To combine these and other sound inferences is the true business of theory: it
                    ought not yet to be attempted; for though the notion of a slow decrease of the
                    heat of the globe being the primary law of causation, is perhaps continually
                    forcing itself on the attention of geologists, as well calculated to account for
                    the consolidation, disruption, and irregularity of elevation of the crust of the
                    globe, and almost necessary to explain its actual condition of sensible
                    equilibrium; though it is inconsistent with no astronomical, mechanical, or
                    chemical truth, and meets without difficulty the problems suggested to zoology
                    and botany by the monuments of ancient organic life; still the development of
                    this truly general theory requires a far more exact survey of the structure of
                    the globe, and <hi rend="italic">a far more</hi> intimate acquaintance with the
                    effects of modern terraqueous agencies, than we now possess. (<hi rend="subscript"> h</hi>.)</p></div></body></text></TEI>
