                <p><label type="entry">MIDDLESEX</label>, an English county, and, though in extent
                    one of the least, yet, as containing within it the metropolis of the British
                    empire, with its numerous population, its extensive wealth, and its repositories
                    of art and science, and being the theatre of the most interesting historical and
                    political transactions, naturally attracts to it the attention of all who are
                    connected with the united kingdoms.</p>
                <p>This county is bounded on the north by Hertfordshire; on the west by
                    Buckinghamshire; on the south by Surrey, and at the eastern point by a small
                    portion of Kent; and on the east by Essex. Its general figure is quadrangular,
                    but rendered very irregular by the course of the rivers Thames, Coln, and Lea,
                    which bound it on three sides, and by a considerable projection into
                    Hertfordshire on the north. Its greatest length is twenty-three and its greatest
                    breadth seventeen miles. Its square contents are estimated at 285 miles, or
                    182,400 statute acres.</p>
                <p>According to the census of 1831, the whole number of inhabitants was 1,358,330,
                    of whom 631,410 were males and 726,920 were females. These composed 314,039
                    families, of whom 9882 were chiefly occupied in agriculture; 173,822 were
                    chiefly occupied in trade, manufactures, and handicraft; and the remainder,
                    130,335, were not comprehended in either of these two classes.</p>
                <p>A more minute classification is as follows :—</p>
                <p>Males under twenty years of age 358,521</p>
                <p>Occupiers of land, employing labourers 1,050</p>
                <p>Occupiers of land, not employing labourers 490</p>
                <p>Labourers employed in agriculture 11,376</p>
                <p>Employed in manufacture, or in making manufac turing machinery 11,064</p>
                <p>Employed in retail trade, or in handicraft, as mas ters or workmen , 163,220</p>
                <p>Capitalists, bankers, professional and other educat ed men 49,457</p>
                <p>Labourers employed in labour other than agricultural 79,735</p>
                <p>Other males, twenty years of age, not servants.... 22,549 Male servants, twenty
                    years of age 19,578</p>
                <p>Male servants under twenty years of age 5,923</p>
                <p>Female servants 87,554</p>
                <p>The baptisms of 1830 were, males 167,444, of females 165,683; the burials in the
                    same were, of males 148,390, and of females 141,529. The marriages were 13,295.
                    The illegitimate children born in the same year were, of males 526, of females
                    380.</p>
                <p>The proportion of burials to the whole population, which in 1801 was one in
                    thirty-one, was in 1830 one in forty-two. The amount expended for the relief of
                    the poor had varied but little during the ten years from 1820 to 1830. In the
                    first of these years it amounted to L.625,665, and in the last to L.68l,567.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819976" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9976-0059"/>
                <p>The annual value of the real property of the county, as assessed in the year
                    1815, was L.5,595,337. The increase of the population is shown by the several
                    decennial enumerations to have been as follows, viz. in 1801, 818,129; in 1811,
                    953,276, being an increase of seventeen per cent.; in 1821, 1,144,531, being an
                    increase of twenty per cent.; and in 1831, 1,358,200, being an increase of
                    nineteen per cent. The whole increase in the thirty years has been sixty-five
                    per cent. If the same rate of increase should .continue till 1841, which there
                    seems no reason to doubt, the county will then have doubled its inhabitants in
                    about the period of forty or forty-one years.</p>
                <p>The county is divided into six hundreds, and the three cities of London within
                    the.,walls, London without the walls, and Westminster. The most populous of the
                    hundreds, that of Ossulstone, is formed into four divisions.</p>

                <p>The face of this county may be described as a gently sloping tract rising from
                    the banks of the Thames, its southern boundary, to the hills on the north, none
                    of which rises more than 350 feet above the level of that river, and few attain
                    even that height. In receding from the banks of the stream, the surface is
                    gently undulated, with sufficient slope to secure the necessary drainage. The
                    prospects in the southern division of the county, from the level nature of its
                    surface, are not distinguished by extent or variety; and the eye is only
                    relieved from the fatigue of uniformity, by the numerous buildings, plantations,
                    gardens, and the rich verdure of productive grass fields. Even in the more hilly
                    parts of the county the prospects are far less impressive than those upon the
                    opposite banks of the Thames, or those which are to be seen upon the borders of
                    that river before it enters Middlesex. The best prospects of a rural kind are
                    from the range of hills stretching from Pinner, Stanmore, Elstree, Totteridge,
                    and Barnet, to the forest scenery of Enfield Chace. The Hill of Harrow, a
                    projection from this ridge, is one of the highest points; and the whole of the
                    richly-cultivated valley of Middlesex is comprehended in the view from it.</p>
                <p>The original soil on the southern side of the county is of a most sterile kind of
                    gravel; but the vast quantities of manure which have been furnished to it from
                    the extensive cities in its vicinity, have been so spread over the surface, that
                    a most luxuriantly-productive soil of garden mould has been created; and from
                    the same cause it is renewed as rapidly as it becomes exhausted by the crops
                    grown upon it. The northern part of the county generally consists of a soil of
                    clayey loam, which, though rather difficult to plough, is, when properly
                    pulverised, very well adapted for the cultivation of wheat, and has been long
                    celebrated for the excellent quality of that grain which is produced upon it.
                    The table of Queen Elizabeth was regularly furnished with white bread from the
                    wheat grown in the vicinity of Hounslow. In several parts of the county the
                    loamy clay, converted by the addition of cinders, technically called breeze,
                    into bricks, becomes the most profitable application of the soil. This is
                    peculiarly the case where such soil is found in the immediate vicinity of the
                    metropolis, or upon the banks of the rivers or canals that communicate with it.
                    “Round the one-mile stone on the Kingsland Road,” says Mr Middleton, “the
                    surface is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819989" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9989-0060"
                    />lowered from four to ten feet, by the earth having been dug up and
                    manufactured into bricks, over an extent of more than 1000 acres; and it has
                    been levelled, ploughed up, and laid down to grass. It is sufficiently dry, and
                    by the help of town manure is restored again to excellent grass land; though it
                    had previously yielded to the community, through the medium of the brickmakers,
                    upwards of L.4000 per acre on an average of the whole level; but there are a few
                    acres of choice marl earth, which have produced through the same medium L.20,000
                    per acre.”</p>
                <p>The greater portion of the land in the county is appropriated to the cultivation
                    of grass, which is converted into hay for the supply of the numerous horses kept
                    in the metropolis. These upland meadows have been gradually extending as the
                    metropolis has increased, so that at present not more than 20,000 acres are
                    under cultivation by the plough. The meadows, however, even those which have
                    been longest laid down in herbage, discover the marks of their having been
                    formerly ploughed. The great consumption of hay in the London markets has
                    induced the most skill to be applied to that particular branch of rural
                    economics which, under the term haymaking, is usually deemed the simplest of all
                    agricultural operations, but which is here managed in so superior a way as to
                    bring to the stack hay of a quality far better than is preserved in the more
                    distant counties. The corn grown in this county is inconsiderable. Upon an
                    average of years, about 10,000 acres are sown with wheat, about 4000 with
                    barley, about 3000 with beans, and about 2000 with pease; some rye is grown, but
                    principally for green food, and scarcely any oats are cultivated. There are
                    fewer sheep and cows kept in Middlesex than in any other county; but of the
                    latter some thousands are maintained solely for the purpose of supplying milk
                    for the consumption of the metropolis. Many pigs are fattened from the offal
                    produced in the vast breweries and malt distilleries of London and its
                    vicinity.</p>
                <p>The horticulture of Middlesex, although it does not extend over quite so great a
                    surface as its arable culture, produces a far greater annual return. Exclusively
                    of the gardens attached to the houses of the nobility and gentry, the extent of
                    land appropriated to the growth of fruit is reckoned by Mr Middleton to be 3000
                    acres, of that devoted to culinary vegetables 10,000, and of that used as
                    nursery grounds and plantations 1500. The same writer estimated the annual value
                    of the productions of horticulture at somewhat more than one million sterling.
                    The gardeners of Middlesex practise a wonderful economy in the raising of crops.
                    The fruit gardeners have what they call an upper and an under crop growing on
                    the same ground at the same time. First, the ground is stocked with apples,
                    pears, cherries, plums, walnuts, &amp;c. like a complete orchard, and Called the
                    upper crop. It is secondly fully planted with raspberries, gooseberries,
                    currants, strawberries, and all such fruits, shrubs, and herbs as are known to
                    sustain the shade and drippings from the trees above them without the least
                    injury; this they term the under crop. Some of these gardens have walls which
                    are completely clothed with fruit-trees, such as peaches, nectarines, apricos,
                    plums, and various others, all adapted to the aspect of the wall. In order to
                    increase the quantity of warmth and shelter in autumn, they raise earthen banks
                    of about three feet in height, laid to a slope of forty-five degrees to the sun.
                    On these slopes they plant endive in the month of September; and near the
                    bottoms of them they drill pease from October to Christmas; by this means the
                    endive is preserved from rotting, and, as well as the pease, reaches maturity at
                    an early period. The common routine of the best kitchen gardeners is the
                    following: Soon after Christmas, when the weather is open, they begin by sowing
                    the borders, and then the quarters, with radishes, spinach, onions, and all the
                    other seed crops. As soon afterwards as the season will permit, which is
                    generally in February, the same ground is planted with cauliflowers from the
                    frames, as thick as if no other crop had then possession of the ground. The
                    radishes, &amp;c. are soon sent to market; and when the cauliflowers are so far
                    advanced as to be earthed up, sugar-loaf cabbages are planted from the
                    before-mentioned seed crops; and daily as these crops are sent to market, the
                    same ground is cropped with celery for winter use. The foregoing rotation is the
                    common practice, but there are many deviations, according to the judgment of the
                    cultivators, the state of the weather, and the demands of the market. Such a
                    system, however, can be pursued only in the vicinity of great cities, the
                    abundant manure of which gives the means of raising vegetable productions in
                    defiance of the inclemency of our northern winters. A species of cultivation of
                    a nondescript kind, partaking of the nature of agriculture and horticulture, is
                    extensively pursued in this county. The ground is ploughed in January and
                    February, and cropped with early pease, which are gathered green in June. The
                    land is then sowed with turnips, which are sold in autumn, when the kind of
                    cabbages called collards are planted, and these three crops are annually raised
                    from the same soil.</p>
                <p>Manufactures of every kind may be ascribed to this county, in so far as the best
                    workmen of every description are employed in London for combining, fitting, and
                    finishing all the commodities requisite for the consumption of the metropolis,
                    which is at the same time the seat of government, the temporary residence of the
                    wealthiest subjects of Great Britain, and the greatest sea-port of the empire ,
                    but workmen of this kind, forming more than 400 classes, cannot be here so
                    appropriately described as under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">London,</hi>
                    to which the reader is referred.</p>
                <p>In the more appropriate application of the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >manufacture,</hi> none of importance can be attributed to Middlesex, other than
                    that of silk, which subsists in Spittaifields, and which employs upwards of 5000
                    males above twenty years of age. In St Mary’s parish, Whitechapel, 440 men of
                    that age are employed in sugar-refining. Ship-building, and the various
                    auxiliaries of that art, such as rope-making, sail-making, block-making,
                    anchor-making, and the fabrication of copper sheathing and bolts for ships, with
                    numerous smaller articles, employ a great number of persons. There are
                    manufactories of chemical preparations at Bow, mustard-mills at Staines,
                    copper-works at Harefield, and mills for throwing silk in many places.</p>
                <p>The rivers of Middlesex are, the Thames, the Coln, the Brent, and the Lea. The
                    former of these is navigable for barges, along almost its whole extent, to
                    Leachlade in Gloucestershire, within a few miles of its source. The tide is felt
                    as high as Teddington, above which the navigation is performed by penning the
                    ∖vater at various locks till a sufficient body is collected, which, by making
                    what is locally called a <hi rend="italic">flash,</hi> permits the passage of
                    the barges over the obstructions and shoals, which, a few hours after, become
                    again impassable. The picturesque beauties on the banks of*this stream are too
                    well known to need a description in this place. The Coin is not navigable. It
                    enters Middlesex from Hertfordshire at the north-western extremity of the
                    county, and falls into the Thames in various channels at considerable distances
                    from each other, having in its course been applied to the working of numerous
                    mills for paper, corn, and other purposes. The Brent, also not navigable, enters
                    the county from Hertfordshire, and joins the Thames at Brentford. The Lea is
                    navigable for barges along its whole course through this county. It enters from
                    Hertfordshire, forms the eastern boundary of Middlesex, and joins the Thames at
                    Limehouse, below London. Besides these natural streams, the artificial one
                    called the New River belongs to this county. The artificial channel in which
                    this stream flows towards London has a very devious<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193820002" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0002-0061"/> course, in order to keep the
                    waters at a due level. It is ultimately received into a spacious reservoir near
                    Islington, whence, by means of pipes, its water is conveyed through the streets
                    of the metropolis to the houses of individuals.</p>
                <p>Amongst the public works of this county, the canals deserve notice. These are,
                    the Grand Junction, the Paddington, and the Regent’s Canal. The first forms a
                    connection with the whole interior of the kingdom, and the second is connected
                    with it. Through them, internal navigation is conducted to the manufacturing
                    counties, and to the distant ports of Liverpool, Bristol, and Hull, and to the
                    potteries, iron-fonnderies, and collieries of Staffordshire and Warwickshire.
                    The Regent’s Canal surrounds the whole of the northern side of the metropolis,
                    around which it describes a semicircle, commencing at the dock of the Paddington
                    Canal, and terminating at the river Thames at Limehouse. Its principal utility
                    is supposed to be derived from forming the means of conveying coals and other
                    heavy commodities from the river to the more distant parts of the capital
                    without expensive land-carriage. We may here notice two works actually in
                    operation, which may become of vast importance. These are, the railroad from
                    London to Birmingham, which has been considerably advanced, and a similar one to
                    Southampton, already commenced. For another to Bristol an act of parliament has
                    been obtained.</p>
                <p>The docks constructed of late years for the facilities of commerce are most
                    extensive and magnificent works, and the warehouses which surround them are
                    wonderful exhibitions of the commercial opulence of this country, having been
                    all completed from the capitals of individuals. The West India Docks contain
                    about sixty acres of water, in which the largest vessels can float. The London
                    or Wapping Docks arc of nearly the same extent. The St Catherine’s Docks,
                    finished in 1828, can accommodate annually 1400 vessels; and, being near the
                    centre of the trading establishments, are found of vast benefit. The East India
                    Docks are more than thirty acres; and near them is a dock belonging to private
                    individuals (Messrs Wigram and Green), of nearly twenty acres, where the
                    business of shipbuilding is carried on upon a scale which exceeds that of most
                    of the establishments of the governments of Europe.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable edifices of this county are more properly described under the
                    articles <hi rend="smallcaps">London</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Westminster</hi> in this work. Beyond the limits of these cities may be noticed
                    the· palaces of Hampton Court and Kensington; the Hospital of Chelsea, for
                    invalid soldiers; the Royal Military Asylum; the bridges of Staines, Vauxhall,
                    and Waterloo; Middlesex Hospital; St George’s Hospital; Jews’ Hospital; and
                    Harrow School. The number of other erections, of a second and third order, are
                    too numerous for recapitulation.</p>
                <p>The changes of property have been so rapid in this county, and the taste for
                    substituting fashionable novelty in the room of venerable antiquity has been so
                    prevalent, that very few first-rate seats are to be found, but a vast number of
                    second and third-rate houses, which, if removed from the vicinity of the
                    metropolis, would attract considerable notice. The most remarkable residences
                    are, Bently Priory, Marquis of Abercorn; Bushy Park, the residence of his
                    present majesty when Duke of Clarence; Caenwood, Earl of Mansfield; Chiswick
                    House, Duke of Devonshire; Fulham Palace, Bishop of London; Holland House, Lord
                    Holland; Littleton, Thomas Wood, Esq.; Osterley House, Earl of Jersey; Sion
                    House, Duke of Northumberland; Strawberry Hill, Countess of Waldegrave; Wrothauι
