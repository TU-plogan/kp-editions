                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"

                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">MONASTERY</label>, a convent or house built for the reception
                    of religious, whether it be abbey, priory, convent, or other. This name is only
                    properly applied to the houses of monks, mendicant friars, and nuns. The rest
                    are more properly called <hi rend="italic">religious houses.</hi></p>
                <p>The houses belonging to the several religious orders which prevailed in England
                    and Wales were, cathedrals, colleges, abbeys, priories, preceptories,
                    commandries, hospitals, friaries, hermitages, chantries, and free chapels. These
                    were under the direction and management of various officers. The dissolution of
                    houses of this kind began as early as the year 1312, when the Templars were
                    suppressed; and in 1323, their lands, churches, advowsons, and liberties, in
                    England, were given, by 17 Edward II. st. 3, to the prior and brethren of the
                    hospital of St John of Jerusalem. In the years 1390, 1437, 1441, 1459, 1497,
                    1505, 1508, and 1515, several other houses were dissolved, and their revenues
                    settled on different colleges in Oxford and Cambridge. Soon after the last
                    period, Cardinal Wolsey, by license of the king and pope, obtained a dissolution
                    of above thirty religious houses, for the founding and endowing of his colleges
                    at Oxford and Ipswich. About the same time a bull was granted by the same pope
                    to Cardinal Wolsey to suppress monasteries where there were not above six monks,
                    to the value of 8000 ducats a year, for endowing Windsor and King’s College in
                    Cambridge; and two other bulls were granted to Cardinals Wolsey and Campeius, to
                    suppress houses where there were less than twelve monks, and to annex them to
                    the greater monasteries; besides another bull to the same cardinals to inquire
                    concerning abbeys to be suppressed in order to be made cathedrals. Although
                    nothing appears to have been done in consequence of these bulls, the motives
                    which induced Wolsey and many others to suppress these houses was the desire of
                    promoting learning; and Archbishop Cranmer engaged in it with a view of carrying
                    on the Reformation. There were other causes which concurred to bring on their
                    ruin. Many of the religious were loose and vicious; the monks were generally
                    thought to be in their hearts attached to the pope’s supremacy; their revenues
                    were not employed according to the intention of the donors; many cheats in
                    images, feigned miracles, and counterfeit relics, had been discovered, which
                    brought the monks into disgrace; the Observant Friars had opposed the king’s
                    divorce from Queen Catharine; and these circumstances operated, in concurrence
                    with the king’s Avant of a supply and the people’s desire to save their money,
                    to forward a motion in parliament, that, in order to support the king’s state,
                    and supply his wants, all the religious houses might be conferred upon the crown
                    which were not able to spend above L.200 a year. For this purpose an act was
                    passed, being the 27th Hen. VIII. c. 28. By this act about three hundred and
                    eighty houses were dissolved, and a revenue of L.30,000 or L.32,000 a year
                    accrued in consequence to the crown; besides about L.100,000 in plate and
                    jewels. The suppression of these houses occasioned discontent, and at length an
                    open rebellion. When this was appeased, the king resolved to suppress the rest
                    of the monasteries, and appointed a new visitation, which caused the greater
                    abbeys to be surrendered apace; and it was enacted by 31 Henry VIII. c. 13, that
                    all monasteries, &amp;c. which have been surrendered since the 4th of February,
                    in the twenty-seventh year of his majesty’s reign, and which shall hereafter be
                    surrendered, shall be vested in the king. The knights of St John of Jerusalem
                    were also suppressed by the 32d Henry VIII. c. 24. The suppression of these
                    greater houses by the two acts in question produced a revenue to the king of
                    above L. 100,000 a year, besides a large sum in plate and jewels. The last act
                    of dissolution in this king’s reign was the act of 37 Henry VIII. c. 4, for
                    dissolving colleges, free chapels, chantries, and the like; which act was
                    further enforced by 1 Edward VI. c. 14. By this act were suppressed ninety
                    colleges, one hundred and ten hospitals, and two thousand three hundred· and
                    seventy-four chantries and free chapels.</p>
