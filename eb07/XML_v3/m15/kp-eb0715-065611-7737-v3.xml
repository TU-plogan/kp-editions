                    situated principally between the eleventh and fifteenth degrees of north
                    latitude, and now-surrounded by the British territories subject to the Madras
                    presidency. Its length is estimated at 210 miles, and its average breadth at
                    140. The country consists of a high table land, enclosed between the Eastern and
                    the Western Ghauts, and elevated 3000 feet above the level of the sea, from
                    which rise numerous lofty hills, containing the sources of many rivers, such as
                    the Cavery, Toombuddra, Vedawati, Bhadri, Penar, and others. The elevation of
                    this inland plain varies at different places. The highest mountain of Mysore,
                    namely, Sivagunga, is 4600 feet; at the Pass of Peddanaik Durgum, the height is
                    1907 feet, according to barometrical observations; at Baitamangalum, 2435; at
                    Bangalore, 2807; at Hurrypur, 1831. The heat of the climate is mitigated by the
                    height of the ground, and the climate throughout the whole of this extensive
                    tract is remarkably temperate and healthy. This country has another peculiar
                    advantage, namely, that it is sheltered by the Ghaut Mountains from the violence
                    of the monsoons, which sweep along the lower plains, and deluge with torrents of
                    rain the coasts of Coromandel and Malabar. The clouds which are driven on the
                    land from the Indian Ocean by the south-west monsoon are opposed by the mountain
                    wall of the Western Ghauts; and although the higher and lighter clouds make
                    their way into the plains, and occasion frequent, and sometimes heavy showers,
                    which refresh the air and the ground, yet they are seldom of long continuance.
                    Occasional showers, however, fall at other seasons, and preserve the verdure of
                    the fields throughout the year.</p><p>Thê country of Mysore, from its elevation and its temperate climate, not only
                    produces all the other grains and vegetables of other parts of India, but also
                    many of the fruits of Europe. ' It appears to have been formerly in a much
                    higher state of cultivation than at present; but has been <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827750" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7750-0657"/>ruined partly
                    by the invasion of armies, partly by the rigorous administration of Hyder, and
                    still more by that of his son Tippoo. It is now rapidly recovering from its
                    depopulation, under the sway of the British. Rice is cultivated on the higher
                    and lower grounds; and the cultivation is much aided by means of reservoirs and
                    wells, whence the farmers irrigate their fields and gardens. The soil also
                    produces the sugar-cane, for which the black clayey lands are best adapted. The
                    crop of raggy, a species of coarse grain which supplies all the lower classes
                    with their common food, is the most important of any raised on the dry field.
                    Wheat is cultivated in gardens, or in the rich soil of the beds of the tanks,
                    which have been exhausted for-the purposes of irrigation. It is only a small
                    quantity, however, that is raised. The palma christi is found here, and produces
                    abundance of castor oil, which is used for the lamp and a variety of other
                    purposes. The betel-leaf tree thrives on the low grounds, where it can obtain a
                    supply of water; and the poppy is cultivated, both for making opium and on
                    account of the seed, which is much used in the sweet cakes that are eaten by the
                    higher ranks of the natives. The cocoa-nut palm begins to produce in this
                    province when it is seven or eight years old. Agriculture is here in a very
                    backward state, and the implements used are very imperfect. The plough has
                    neither coulter nor mould-board to divide and turn over the soil, and it seldom
                    penetrates more than three inches deep. The fields are in consequence very
                    imperfectly cleared; and, after six or eight ploughings in all directions,
                    numerous small bushes remain as erect as before the labour commenced.
                    Considerable attention is however paid to the manuring of the soil; every farmer
                    collecting a heap from the dung and litter of his cattle, intermixed with the
                    ashes and soil of their houses. The cattle reared are cows, buffaloes, sheep,
                    and the long-legged goat; the native breed of horses here, as in most parts of
                    India, is a small, ill-shaped, vicious pony. Above the Ghauts, asses are much
                    used as beasts of burden. The breed is small, and no pains are taken to improve
                    it. Swine were formerly very common in Mysore, but they were banished by Tippoo
                    from the vicinity of the capital. There are three varieties of sheep, red,
                    white, and black. Common salt is fo*und in abundance in many places, and
                    effervesces on the surface during the dry season. Carbonate of soda is also
                    found amongst the Chitteldroog Hills, mixed with common salt. Iron-ore abounds
                    in different parts, though it is worked in a very slovenly manner. At the iron
                    works near Chinnara-yana Durga, the smelters procure from the one about
                    forty-seven per cent, of malleable iron, which is however very impure. The
                    principal rivers are the Cavery, the Toombuddra, theVedawati, theBhadri, the
                    Arkanati, the Penar, Palar, and Panaur. These rivers are, however, all
                    inconsiderable, with the exception of the Cavery, as long as they continue
                    within the limits of this province. There are many large tanks and reservoirs in
                    the higher grounds throughout Mysore, but there are no lakes. The water in these
                    tanks is always sweet, and preferred on this account to that of wells, which is
                    very frequently brackish. This province is divided into three districts, namely,
                    the Patana (or Seringapatam), the Nagara (or Bednore), and the Chatracal (or
                    Chitteldroog) districts. The chief towns are, Seringapatam, Bangalore, Bednore,
                    Chitteldroog, and Sera. Each district is managed by an amildar, who is an
                    officer of justice, police, and revenue, and who is accountable for his conduct
                    to the ministers of the rajah, the latter being kept to their duty by the
                    presence of the British resident. These amildars have under them a number of
                    accountants, in order to manage with accuracy the revenue accounts.</p><p>The present rajah of Mysore, who was raised to the throne after the fall of
                    Tippoo, is the descendant of a pastoral chief, who emigrated, with his tribe and
                    all their flocks and herds, from the province of Gujerat, and were allowed to
                    settle in Mysore. Cham Raj, the representative of this family, took possession
                    of the throne in the year 1507, though he still acknowledged himself the subject
                    of the Maha rajah of Annagoondy, who was a descendant of the ancient Hindu
