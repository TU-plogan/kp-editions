                    translator of the Lusiad, was the son of Mr Alexander Mickle, a Scottish
                    clergyman, who had formerly been a dissenting minister in London, an assistant
                    to Dr Watts, and one of the translators of Bayle’s Dictionary. He was born in
                    London about the year 1735, and educated by his father, after whose death he
                    came to Edinburgh to reside with his uncle, who was a brewer there, and who
                    admitted him into a share of his business; but not being qualified to succeed in
                    this line, he went to London about the time of the conclusion of the war which
                    began in 1755, with a view to procure a commission in the marine service. In
                    this he was disappointed; but he introduced himself to the first Lord Lyttelton,
                    to whom he sent one of his poems. From his lordship, however, he received no
                    other favour than that of being admitted to several interviews, and encouraged
                    to persevere in his poetical plans.</p><p>From the time of Mr Mickle’s arrival in London till the year 1765, it is not
                    known how he employed his time, although it is probable that he was occupied in
                    some branch <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819339" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9339-0010"/>of the printing business; and in that year he
                    engaged himself as corrector to the Clarendon press. From this time till 1770,
                    he published several small pieces in prose and verse, which brought him into
                    some notice; and he was likewise a frequent writer in the <hi rend="italic">Whitehall Evening Post.</hi> When not more than seventeen years of age, he had
                    read Gas-tara’s translation of the Lusiad of Camaens into French, and then
                    projected the design of giving an English ver- .sion of that poem. This,
                    however, he was prevented from executing by various avocations till the year
                    1771, when he published the first book as a specimen; and having prepared
                    himself by acquiring some knowledge of the Portuguese language, he determined to
                    apply himself entirely to the task of translation. With this view he quitted his
                    residence at Oxford, and went to a farm-house at Forest Hill, where he pursued
                    his design with unremitting assiduity till the year 1775, when the work was
                    completed. During the time that Mr Mickle was engaged in this work, he subsisted
                    entirely by his employment as corrector of the press; and on his quitting that
                    employment he had only the subscriptions which he received for his translation
                    to support him. But notwithstanding these difficulties, he adhered steadily to
                    the plan he laid down, and completed his task in about five years.</p><p>When his work had been finished, Mr Mickle applied to a person of high rank, with
                    whom his family had been connected, for permission to dedicate it to him. The
                    permission sought was granted, and his patron honoured him with a very polite
                    letter; but after receiving a copy, the latter did not think prop⅛r to take any
                    notice of the author. The applause with which the work was received, however,
                    soon banished from the author’s mind the disagreeable sensations which had been
                    occasioned by the contemptuous neglect of his patron, as well as some severe
                    criticisms which had been circulated concerning it. A second edition was
                    prepared in 1778; and whilst he was meditating a publication of all his poems,
                    he was appointed secretary to Commodore Johnstone, who had obtained the command
                    of the Romney. In November 1779 he arrived at Lisbon, and was appointed by his
                    patron joint agent for the prizes which were taken.</p><p>In June 1782 Mr Mickle married Miss Tomkins, daughter of the person with whom he
                    had resided at Forest Hill whilst engaged in translating the Lusiad. Having
                    received some fortune with this lady, and made a little money himself when in
                    the service of Commodore Johnstone, he now enjoyed a comfortable independence.
                    He afterwards fixed his residence at Wheatley, in Oxfordshire, where he died
                    after a short illness, on the 25th of October 1788, leaving a son behind him.
                    His poetry possesses considerable beauty, variety, and harmony of numbers. His
                    life was without reproach; his foibles were few and inoffensive, his virtues
                    many, and his genius respectable.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
