                    a soldier, in its original signification, means warfare, the qualification of
                    soldiership, or the military body. In this last signification it became
                    incorporated with the English language. It is now used to distinguish, from the
                    regular forces, the body of citizens who may be annually called out for a
                    limited time, and embodied on occasions of emergency. As the system out of which
                    the present militia has arisen existed previously to the establishment of a
                    mercenary army, and frequently constituted the sole military organization of its
                    time, a historical sketch of the institution will involve to a certain extent a
                    general view of the military state of Britain during the earlier periods of our
                    history.</p><p>Any account of the military system of the Saxons, especially when we approach the
                    era of the Norman conquest, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820093" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0093-0068"/>becomes involved in the great question as to the
                    extent to which feudal practices bad been adopted in England previous to that
                    event. It has, however, been distinctly ascertained, that land, amongst the
                    Anglo-Saxons, became not only the reward of military services performed, but the
                    stipulated wages of their continuation. Thus there came to be a connection
                    between the performance of services to a chief and the holding land under him,
                    the soldier or thane possessing the land on the condition of performing military
                    duties, but not, as by the mature usages of the feudal system, rendering the
                    service as an incident of the tenure of the land. The grants so made were
                    generally for a contingent period, and were revocable from a vassal unfit to
                    perform his military engagements; and we find amongst them a species of
                    transaction so complicated as grants to churchmen, on the condition of their
                    making provision for the performance of the military duties they were personally
                    disqualified from undertaking.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir Francis Palgrave’s Rise and Progress of the English
                    Commonwealth; Proofs and Illustrations, ccxx.</p></note> The oath of the vassal
                    was personal and conditional, and had no reference to the land as a bond of
                    union.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Allen on the Rise
                    and Growth of the Royal Prerogative, Ap. xxii.</p></note> It was the duty of the
                    superior to protect his follower, and when he ceased to do so, the vassal was
                    relieved from obedience; but desertion was viewed as a crime of great magnitude.
                    Those freemen who had not undertaken to perform military service in return for
                    lands were entitled, like the clients of the Romans, to select their own
                    “Hlafords” or patrons ;. but this class of followers seems to have gradually
                    decreased towards the era of the conquest, when it would appear from
                    Domesday-book that all land was, or was presumed to be, held of a superior. It
                    was perhaps for the furtherance of such a principle, without the invasion of
                    existing free rights in property, that an exception sometimes appears in favour
                    of the tenant: “Et poterat ire cum ea (terra) ad quem vellet Dominum ;”
                    intimating that he might hold his land of whatsoever lord he chose.</p><p>Whatever right the patron may have had to the exclusive military services of his
                    dependent, it undoubtedly yielded to the claim of the state to the assistance of
                    every freeman in cases of invasion or rebellion. It is probable that when the
                    national force, denominated the <hi rend="italic">third,</hi> was brought into
                    existence, the right of patronage gave the superior no further power than that
                    of leading his dependents when they joined the general host. The approach to any
                    decision on this point is impeded by many difficulties, arising from the
                    incongruities in the practice of different periods and of different parts of the
                    country, and the absence of any contemporary treatise explanatory of the general
                    rules and the reason of the apparent exceptions. It is thus that on some
                    occasions the right of the Hlaford to command his followers is spoken of without
                    any reference to the paramount claims of the public, whilst elsewhere we find
                    the community arrayed by command of the sovereign, without reference to the
                    circumstance that two distinct classes are to appear in the field, in the
                    respective position of patrons and vassals. “From the earliest period,” says Sir
                    Francis Palgrave, “to which our documents can reach, we find the Fyrd appearing
                    as a general armament of the people, comprehending every rank, though under
                    different obligations and penalties. If the <hi rend="italic">Sithcund-maen,</hi> being a landholder, remained at home, he forfeited all his
                    land; sixty shillings was his fine; whilst thirty shillings was the <hi rend="italic">Fyrdwite</hi> of the churl, and to the last it continued a levy of
                    all the population of the country.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Proofs and Illustrations, <hi rend="italic">ut supra,</hi>
                    ccclxviii.</p></note> Sir William Blackstone and others include the national
                    militia amongst the improvements attributed to the inventive genius of the great
                    Alfred. The Fyrd, however, is of earlier origin. In the laws attributed to
                    Edward the Confessor, the authenticity of which is justly doubted, though they
                    are certainly the work of some one well acquainted with the Anglo-Saxon
                    constitution, there are regulations for the organization and discipline of the
                    Fyrd, probably embodying those improvements of Alfred which procured him the
                    credit of having planned the system. These regulations adapt the arms to be
                    provided by each freeman to a scale of wealth; forbid their being sold or
                    pledged under penalties; provide for their descending to heirs; and appoint
                    annual exhibitions, which, •in order to baffle attempts to display the same
                    weapons in different districts, were to take place simultaneously all over the
                    country.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Leμes Edwardi,</hi> apud Wilkins, sect. 35.</p></note> The command
                    was given to districtleaders called “Heretochs,” who, it is stated, were, like
                    the <hi rend="italic">vice-comités</hi> or sheriffs, elected by their respective
                    districts in full folkmote. Sir W illiam Blackstone observes, that the power
                    thus vested in the people proved dangerous to the community, by erecting a rival
                    to the royal prerogative; and he refers to this source of influence the
                    treachery of Eric Streone, and the usurpation of Harold. Whatever the theory of
                    the Anglo-Saxon constitution may have admitted, however, it does not appear,
                    from the history of the period, that the voice of the people regularly
                    influenced the command of the natural force; and undoubtedly, in the instances
                    cited, the power unduly used had been otherwise obtained.</p><p>The Norman conquest did not produce so much effect, by altering the system so
                    established, as by bringing the new engine of feudalism to act in concert with
                    it. The king was then the commander of two separate forces. His feudal army was
                    furnished by the tenants of his knights’ fees, for each of which he could demand
                    the service of one knight or of two esquires for forty days. These were his
                    personal followers during their period of service, and were liable to be
                    employed either at home or abroad. But the absolute demand on his services was
                    inconvenient to the vassal, and the limitation of the period was often no less
                    so to the king. Hence those who were partial to the occupation of war frequently
                    remained with the army beyond their assigned period for a stipulated
                    remuneration, whilst others got their services commuted into a moneypayment,
                    which afterwards merged into the oppressive exaction of scutage. Whilst this new
                    species of force came into operation, the Fyrd of the Saxons still remained in
                    existence. It afterwards was the source whence arose two distinct institutions;
                    the <hi rend="italic">posse</hi><hi rend="italic">comitatus,</hi> liable to be
                    called out by the sheriff to keep the king’s peace; and the militia force of the
                    present day.</p><p>In the celebrated “assize of arms” of 1181, we find the Fyrd of the Anglo-Saxons
                    in its original purity. All freemen are appointed to have arms in their
                    possession, according to a scale of ranks, which consists, first, of the holders
                    of a knight’s fee; secondly, of the possessors of chattels or rents to the
                    extent of sixteen merks; thirdly, of the holders of similar property to the
                    value of ten merks; and, lastly, of all other burgesses and freemen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wilkins, 296.</p></note> The
                    Fyrd, with its periodical exhibitions of arms, was recognised as late as the
                    year 1285, when, by the statute of Winchester (13 Ed. I. st. 2, c. 6), the scale
                    of arms assigned to the respective ranks was revised. The part of the act which
                    enforces the keeping of arms was adjusted to the progress of the art of war in
                    1558 (4 and 5 Ph. and Μ. c. 2), and finally abolished in 1604 (I Jac. I. c. 25,
                    sect. 46).</p><p>Meanwhile practices commenced which gave rise to much subsequent dispute
                    respecting the question, how far the right of the monarch to demand the military
                    assistance of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820106" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0106-0069"/>his subjects in such wars as he chose to
                    prosecute, was restricted. Many apparent anomalies in the constitution of this
                    early period maybe explained by reflecting that the Anglo-Saxon people continued
                    to cherish certain privileges and customs which the Norman monarchs were often
                    unable openly to abolish, whilst they were frequently powerful enough to
                    infringe them. The annual array was an institution with which they naturally
                    tampered, finding it their interest to amalgamate it with their feudal
                    prerogatives. On the other hand, there were no definite limits to the
                    prerogative, which insinuated itself wherever it was not practically checked.
                    Accordingly we find parliament avoiding for some time any distinct recognition
                    of the prerogative of the crown, or the privileges of the subject, and acting on
                    the defensive against the former. Thus, by statute 1 Ed. III. c. 5, “The king
                    wills, that no man from henceforth shall be charged to arm himself, otherwise
                    than he was wont in the times of his progenitors kings of England; and that no
                    man be compelled to go out of his shire but where necessity requireth, and
                    sudden coming of strange enemies into the realm; and that it shall be done as
                    hath been used in times past for the defence of the realm.” The seventh chapter
                    of the same statute gives redress on complaints that commissioners appointed to
                    raise soldiers had been chargeable to the shires; and by the instructions to the
                    sheriffs in the 10th Ed. III. stat. ii. money so exacted is directed to be
                    returned. More decided attempts to amalgamate the assize of arms with the feudal
                    force appear to have been opposed in 1351, when by 25 Ed. III. stat. V. c. 8, it
                    was enacted that “no man shall be constrained to find men of arms, hobelers nor
                    archers, other than those who shall hold by such services, if it be not by
                    common assent and grant made in parliament.”</p><p>At an early period, the crown gradually enlarged its military authority, by
                    issuing commissions of array. These writs, which were at first probably mere
                    authorities to individuals to use the royal name and influence in collecting
                    troops, came from practice to be viewed as emanating from the prerogative. In
                    that anxiety to avoid collision with the crown, which distinguishes many of the
                    old acts of parliament, they are frequently alluded to without being either
                    sanctioned or condemned. A singular instance of apparently intentional ambiguity
                    occurs in 1 Ed. III. stat, ii. c. 15, which was avowedly passed for the relief
                    of individuals, who, at the suggestion of “false and evil counsellors,” had been
                    prevailed on by “duress” to come under burdensome obligatioris to perform
                    military duties. The contracts are cancelled with a sort of oracular
                    qualification, evidently inserted as the nominal price of a real concession:
                    “Considering that such writings were made to the king’s dishonour, sithens that
                    every man is bound to do to the king as his liege lord all that pertaineth to
                    him, without any manner of writing.” In the fifth year of Henry IV. a statute
                    was passed limiting the form and authority of commissions of array. It involves
                    the anticipation of foreign invasion, empowers the commissioners in such
                    circumstances to array and train all men-at-arms, to cause all able-bodied men
                    to arm themselves according to their substance, to amerce those unable to bear
                    arms in a similarly adjusted ratio, and to require the services of persons so
                    armed on the sea-shore, or elsewhere, at the moment of danger. It is singular
                    that this statute, which forms the only legislative authority to which Charles
                    I. finally appealed in the celebrated struggle for the command of the militia,
                    has never been conceived of sufficient importance to be printed in any
                    collection of the statutes, and seems to have been accidentally discovered in
                    manuscript by some <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the crown officers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Vide Rush.
                    Hist. Cot.</hi> part iii. vol. i. 661-9.</p></note> It was indeed, like the last
                    cited statute, an act of grace, having been passed for the protection of the
                    persons nominated as commissioners, who, according to the preamble, were liable
                    to many penalties and forfeitures in the performance of their assigned duties.
                    It is worthy of note, as bearing on the extent of the authority' intended to be
                    conferred by this act, that during the previous year (by 4 Hen. IV. c. 13) the
                    enactments above referred to, checking the encroachments of the royal authority,
                    were all jealously confirmed; the holders of lands in Wales find of military
                    fiefs, and persons who had bound themselves by contract to perform military
                    services, being specially excepted. During the Tudor dynasty, the declaratory
                    limitations attempted by the old statutes were undoubtedly little respected by
                    the crown, and forced levies were made on many occasions, when the necessities
                    contemplated by the acts couf(l be brought forward as a nominal justification,
                    without being minutely questioned. A statute of the year 1558 (4 and 5 Phil, and
                    Μ. c. 3) appears at first sight to give full sanction to the right of
                    impressment; but an observation of the circumstances in which the act was to be
                    enforced, and reference to a previous act which it professed to amend, show that
                    it was intended for the discipline of those who had become soldiers, and to
                    prevent their desertion. During the long parliament, by an act granting the
                    temporary power of impressing as many men as the king and both houses of
                    parliament might appoint (16 Car. I. c. 28), the limitations were again
                    confirmed; and it was declared, that by the law of the realm the subject ought
                    not to be impressed or compelled to go beyond his county, &amp;c. in the same
                    terms as the statute of the first of Edward III.</p><p>Such was the state of matters when, in the celebrated dispute between Charles I.
                    and the parliament regarding the right to command the militia, it was maintained
                    on the one hand that the preservation of the peace of the country, and its
                    protection from foreign invaders, were the unalienable privileges of the crown,
                    and involved the right to command all armies, and to demand on all occasions the
                    military service of the lieges; and, on the other, that such privileges existed
                    in no individual without the consent of both houses of parliament; whilst it was
                    urged, first in the form of an ordinance, and next in that of a bill, that the
                    king should consent to the militia being placed in the hands of commissioners
                    named by parliament. Although the statutes above referred to show that in
                    moments of danger the king was so far the guardian of the peace, that he was
                    entitled to put himself at the head of the persons bound to keep themselves in
                    readiness for such occasions, and the practice had been undoubtedly still more
                    favourable to the prerogative, neither an act of the legislature, nor any
                    uninterrupted train of precedents, had given the monarch the unlimited military
                    command which he arrogated. At an unfortunate time for the adjustment of such a
                    question, it had to be settled between the conflicting branches of the
                    legislature; and Whitelocke at least approached the truth, when he said he
                    apprehended “that the power of the militia is neither in the king only', nor in
                    the parliament; and if the law hath placed it any where, it is both in the king
                    and parliament, when they join together ;” though the state of matters
                    equivocally illustrated his remark, in continuation that “it is a wise
                    institution of our law not to settle this power any where, but rather to leave
                    it <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">dubio,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">nubibus,</hi> that the people might be kept in
                    ignorance thereof, as a thing not fit to be known nor to be pried into.”
                    Arguments founded on precedent and the nature of the constitution were at that
                    juncture, however, merely like the diplomatic manoeuvres preceding<pb break="no" facs="nls:193820119" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0119-0070"/> an
                    international war. Each party was calculating its strength for the approaching
                    conflict; and if their respective rights were so earnestly insisted on by either
                    side, with any other view than that of colouring the real grounds of the
                    rupture, it was that of securing the wavering by a show of adherence to
                    constitutional principles. In a short time each party mustered its own forces in
                    its own way.</p><p>In the parliament which was summoned after the Restoration, effectual means were
                    taken by two statutes (13 Car. II. c. 6, and 13 and 14 Car. II. c. 3), which
                    probably would not have been passed by the convention parliament, to put an end
                    to any doubts as to the prerogative on this point. It was declared, that “the
                    sole supreme government, command, and disposition of the militia, and of all
                    forces by sea and land, and of all forts and places of strength, is, and by the
                    laws of England ever was, the undoubted right of his majesty and his royal
                    predecessors and lieutenants and their deputies were empowered to charge their
                    counties to provide horse and foot soldiers, according to a fixed scale of
                    property. The system thus constructed was slightly amended in the years 1699,
                    1714, and 1743.</p><p>In 1756, when the large standing force, which the position of Britain rendered it
                    expedient to keep up, was made more unpopular by the introduction of the
                    Hanoverian mercenaries, a bill to reconstruct the militia passed through the
                    House of Commons under the auspices of Mr Charles Townshend and his friends, but
                    was rejected in the House of Lords by 59 to 23. With some difficulty the measure
                    was carried in 1757; but, though approved of by a large party, its practical
                    enforcement frequently produced discontent and local disturbance. In 1762 the
                    system was improved, and several acts were afterwards passed amending particular
                    departments. In 1802, the militia laws of England and Scotland were consolidated
                    by 42 Geo. Hl. c. 90 and 91; and these statutes, with that of 49 Geo. III. c.
                    120, applicable to Ireland, contain, with some partial amendments made by later
                    acts, the law applicable to the militia of the united kingdom. Before giving
                    such a brief selection from the many minute regulations prescribed by these
                    statutes, as a work of general reference is expected to contain, we may be
                    permitted to glance at the origin of the militias of Scotland and Ireland.</p><p>In Scotland there seems never to have been, except in burghs, a national force
                    for the defence of the citizens, like the Fyrd of the Saxons. The earliest acts
                    of parliament, however, enforce practice in the bow, of which the efficiency had
                    been so dearly learned in the English wars; whilst periodical “wapenshawings”
                    are directed to be held, in which each individual should be armed upon a scale
                    vaguely proportioned to his property.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Acts, 1424, c. 18 and 41; 1425, c. 60; 1457, c. 64; 1491, c.

                    were issued, charging all sheriffs and magistrates of burghs, to direct the
                    attendants of the respective wapenshawings to join the king’s host;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>1482, c. 90.</p></note> and
                    the criminal records contain many prosecutions for “abiding from” the various
                    “raids,” which are generally settled by composition with the lord treasurer.
                    During the civil wars of the seventeenth century, the army which had been
                    brought into existence by the enthusiasm of the covenanters, was supported by
                    levies and assessments apportioned by district committees of war appointed by
                    parliament, whose duties and powers were modelled on those of the commissioners
                    of array in England. In 1662 (1 Car. II. 3,27), the parliament made offer
                    of20,000 foot and 2000 horse to be at his majesty’s sole disposal, and to be
                    marched to any part of Scotland, England, or Ireland. This body constituted a
                    regular standing army, the organization of which underwent some alterations in
                    the years 1669, 1672, 1693, and 1695. From this last period, no legislative
                    improvements were made in the militia of Scotland until the year 1797, when the
                    system established in England was partially extended to that part of the empire,
                    though not without considerable local disturbance.</p><p>In Ireland the predatory army of gallowglasses, which, even in times of
                    comparative tranquillity, it was found necessary to keep constantly armed for
                    the preservation or the enlargement of the pale, was supported to a small extent
                    by supplies from England; but it chiefly depended on exactions from the
                    Anglo-Irish, made by a dexterous application of the many fines and petty
                    tributes originally exigible by the native chiefs. To these the English added
                    the formidable exactions of coign and livery, which embracing free quarters, and
                    all that is generally taken under the sanction of that licence, were the
                    frequent subject of bitter complaint, though not much heeded by a government
                    which expected that the conquest would at least support itself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Irish State Papers,
                    published by authority of government, ii. 477, &amp;c.</p></note> In 1715, on
                    occasion of the rebellion in Scotland, an act was passed by the Irish parliament
                    (2 Geo. I. c. 9) for raising a militia to consist of Protestants. Roman
                    Catholics were subject to double rates; and all serviceable horses belonging to
                    them might be seized and made use of, provided that within ten days the sum of
                    L.5 (deducting the expense of seizure and keeping) was tendered to the owner of
                    each as full payment. After several partial alterations, the militia laws were
                    consolidated by the Irish parliament in 1793 (33 Geo. HL c. 22) and 1795 (35
                    Geo. III. c. 8), and accommodated to those of England in 1809.</p><p>By the present constitution of the militia in the united kingdom, his majesty

                    or province, with power to call out and train the militia annually, and to
                    appoint twenty or more deputy-lieutenants or governors, or other officers,
                    subject to the royal approval. A deputy in England or Ireland requires, as his
                    qualification, to be proprietor of real property worth L.200 a year, or heir
                    apparent to an estate of twice that value. In Scotland he must possess, or be
                    heir-apparent to, landed property to the extent of L.400 Scotch of valued rent.
                    In England a colonel must hold an estate of L.1000 a year, or be heir-apparent
                    to one of L.2000; in Scotland he must hold or be heir-apparent to one of L.800
                    of valued rent; and in Ireland he must hold an estate of L.2000 a year, or be
                    heir-apparent to one of L.3000. A lieutenant-colonel’s qualification is, in
                    England, an annual estate of L.600, or an apparency of L.1200; in Scotland a
                    valued rent of L.600; and in Ireland an estate of L.1200, or an apparency of
                    L.1800. The qualifications of the lower ranks are upon a corresponding scale,
                    personal property being taken into consideration in those of lieutenants and
                    ensigns. There are distinct qualifications, generally of a lower grade, for
                    Wales, the Isle of Ely, Huntingdon, Monmouth, Westmoreland, Rutland, Edinburgh,
                    Dublin, Cork, Limerick, and those towns which are counties within themselves,
                    and by ancient usage trained a separate militia. The militias of London and the
                    Tower Hamlets are regulated by separate acts (viz. 36 Geo. III. c. 92,37 Geo.
                    III. c. 25 and 75, and 39 Geo. III. c. 92); and those of the Cinque Ports and
                    their members are, in pursuance of ancient custom, left to the administration of
                    the warden.</p><p>The business of balloting for and calling out the militia commences with the
                    annual general meeting of the lieutenancy of each county, when the next
                    subdivision meeting is appointed, to which chief constables, or other <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820132" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0132-0071"/>
                    officers, are required to diréct constables or schoolmasters to return lists of
                    all males between the ages of eighteen and forty-five in their respective
                    parishes. Within fourteen days after requisition, the constable or schoolmaster
                    leaves a schedule in each dwelling-house, to be filled up within fourteen days,
                    with the names and designations of persons within the ages, and their claims of
                    exemption, if there be any, under a penalty of L.5. Within a month after serving
                    the notices, the constables or schoolmasters make up and affix, to the
                    church-doors, lists, mentioning exemptions and incapacities, and notifying the
                    times and places for the discussion of appeals. These are decided by two or more
                    deputies at the subdivision meetings, and their decisions are final. The clerks
                    of general meetings then transmit lists to the privy council, distinguishing
                    those liable to serve from those exempt. The men to be enrolled arc chosen by
                    ballot from each parish; all who are not above four feet and five inches in
                    height, or are not approved of on examination by a surgeon, being discharged,
                    and others balloted for in their room. Those who do not personally appear, or
                    send an approved substitute to take the oath, are liable in a penalty of L.10.
                    There are arrangements by which, with the consent of the inhabitants,
                    volunteers, remunerated by parish assessments, may be substituted for balloted
                    men.</p><p>The persons exempted are, peers; commissioned officers of the other forces,
                    whether on full or half-pay; non-commissioned officers and private men in the
                    other forces; persons serving, or who have served for four years, as
                    commissioned officers in the militia; persons serving in the yeomanry or
                    volunteers; persons serving, or who have served at any time within a year past,
                    in the local militia; resident members of the several universities; clergymen of
                    the establishments, and registered dissenting clergymen; parish schoolmasters;
                    articled clerks; apprentices; seafaring men; persons employed in his majesty’s
                    docks, the Tower, Woolwich Warren, the gun-wharfs of Portsmouth, and the stores
                    under the direction of the Board of Ordnance; persons free of the company of
                    watermen of the Thames; any poor man with more than one child born in wedlock,
                    in England; any man with more than two lawful children, and not possessing
                    property to the value of L.50, in Scotland; and in Ireland, any poor man not
                    worth L.10, or who does not pay L 5 a year of rent, and has more than three
                    lawful children under the age of fourteen.</p><p>The number of private men apportioned amongst the different countries is, for
                    England and Wales 40,963, for Scotland 7950, and for Ireland 21,616, making a
                    total of 70,529; but this number has been increased by temporary acts. The privy
                    council may, at the end of every period of ten years, alter the proportional
                    numbers assigned to the respective counties; but this arrangement has been
                    subject to alteration by temporary acts. The annual training is, for such a
                    period, not exceeding twenty-eight days, as his majesty may direct; and the
                    calling out of the whole, or of any part, may be suspended by an order in
                    council. The mutiny act and the articles of war apply to the militia so called
                    out, with the ordinary constitutional limitation, that no punishment can extend
                    to life or limb. There are separate provisions for recovering deserters, &amp;c.
                    In the case of anticipated invasion or rebellion, his majesty may direct each
                    lord-lieutenant, or, in the case of the death or absence of a lord-lieutenant,
                    any three of his deputies to embody the militia with all convenient speed, the
                    occasion being first notified in parliament, if it is assembled; and if not,
                    declared in council, and published by proclamation. By a similar proceeding, a
                    supplementary militia may be raised, to the extent of one half of the fixed
                    number. The regiments are liable to be marched to any part of the united
                    kingdom; but no Irish regiment can be compelled to serve in Britain, or British
                    regiment in Ireland, longer than two years at one time; nor must above a fourth
                    part of the British militia be employed in Ireland, or a third of the Irish
                    militia in Britain. These restrictions, adopted in 1811, when the militias of
                    the two islands were united under the title of the Militia of the United
                    Kingdom, were partially suspended in 1813; and during the time of actual
                    invasion or rebellion they may be disregarded. The old principle, that the
                    militia cannot be compelled to serve out of the kingdom, is still adhered to,
                    although in 1813 (54 Geo. III. c. 1) provision was made for accepting the
                    service of militiamen and officers, to be formed into provisional regiments, and
                    to co-operate with the regular forces. At previous periods, considerable numbers
                    of militiamen had been drafted into the line, the losses of the militia
                    regiments being made up by temporary acts, which slightly increased their
                    original quotas.</p><p>By 48 Geo. III. c. 111 and 150, the celebrated local militia was, in 1808,
                    appointed in England and Scotland, being limited in each county to “six times
                    the original quota or proportion of the original quota of militia.” In 1812, two
                    new acts were passed (52 Geo. III. c. 38 and 68), which apportioned the numbers
                    of men to the respective shires in England and Scotland, but contained
                    regulating provisions which tended to make the local militia and volunteers
                    together amount to six times the number of the original militia contingents.
                    When these forces were added to the two hundred thousand men allowed to be
                    trained by Mr Windham’s act (46 Geo. III. c. 90), the citizen army, at the
                    disposal of government in Great Britain, amounted, independently of the militia,
                    &amp;c. of Ireland, and of temporary augmentations, to very nearly five hundred
                    thousand men. In 1811, the effective strength of the regular militia was 77,424
                    private men, whilst that of the local militia was 213,609. In 1819, the
                    disembodied militia of Britain and Ireland, calculated from the estimates of'
                    the year, amounted in round numbers to 71,200; and in 1829, it amounted to
                    70,082, private men and drummers.</p><p>The balloting, enrolling, and exercising of the militia now only takes place at
                    occasional periods, an act being generally passed during each session,
                    suspending their annual recurrence. By 10 Geo. IV. c. 10, the staff'of the
                    disembodied militia was reduced; and, according to a recent return, amounted,
                    after the reduction, to 127 adjutants, 127 serjeant-majors, 1692 serjeants, 82
                    drum-majors, and 669 drummers. A further reduction was authorized by 5 and 6
                    Wil. IV. c. 37, and made by an order in council of the 10th October 1835. It
                    appears from a return to the House of Commons of the 7th July 1836, that the
                    staff of the militia of the united kingdom at present receiving pay amounts to
                    119 adjutants, 123 serjeant-majors, and 845 serjeants. The cost of the militia
                    of the united kingdom, including the half-pay of officers and non-commissioned
                    officers, during each of the last three quarters of the year ending 31st March
                    1836, was, for the quarter ending 30th September 1835, L.25,985. 8s. 5½d; for
                    that ending 31 st December 1835, L.37,139.8s. 4d.; and for that ending 31st
                    March 1836, L.32,219. 16s. lOd. According to the estimates for 1836-37, the
                    number of private men is, in Great Britain, 50,888; in Ireland 18,525. <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ. μ. μ. μ.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
