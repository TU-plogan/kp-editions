                    name is well entitled to notice here, on account of his connection with this
                    work, was horn in the town of Ayr, on the 4th of February 1762. He received the
                    early part of his education in the Academy at Ayr, where he acquired
                    considerable knowledge of the learned languages. He afterwards passed through
                    the ordinary <hi rend="italic">curriculum</hi> of the literary, philosophical,
                    and theological classes in the university of Glasgow, in order to qualify
                    himself to enter the church of Scotland; and, as is usual for young men déstined
                    to that profession, employed part of his time in the business of private
                    teaching. Having been induced by his friend Dr Porteons to go out to Jamaica as
                    tutor in a gentleman’s family, he remained in that island for four years; and
                    upon returning home, he was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Irvine. He
                    afterwards for a considerable time officiated as chaplain to the university of
                    Glasgow. His success in this vocation did not, however, correspond with his
                    expectations; and, being naturally possessed of an acute and aspiring mind, he
                    turned his thoughts to the study of medicine. He accordingly removed to
                    Edinburgh, and completed his medical course in this university, where he
                    received his degree. He then proceeded to Paisley, and continued to exercise the
                    duties of his profession for some years in that place; but as he had always been
                    distinguished by an ardent love of science, he was induced to return to
                    Edinburgh, as likely to furnish occupation more congenial to his taste and
                    views. He was at first engaged in writing for, or in superintending, one or
                    other of the periodical miscellanies then published in this city; but a more
                    extensive and important field was at length opened to his abilities and
                    industry, by the proprietors of this Encyclopaedia, with whom he entered into an
                    agreement to superintend a new and improved edition of it, being the fourth. The
                    third edition consisted of eighteen volumes, to which was appended a Supplement
                    in two; but it was resolved, from the first, to extend the fourth to twenty
                    volumes, and Dr Millar had the satisfaction of conducting· this great
                    undertaking from first to last, and of being instrumental in introducing into
                    the work, notwithstanding the limited means at his disposal, a variety of new
                    treatises, besides other improvements, not less required though not so
                    prominent, and many corrections. Having abandoned all other occupations, in
                    order to devote himself exclusively to this work, he took possession of the
                    editorial house, connected with the printing establishment belonging to the
                    proprietors, and there he continued to reside till the completion of the
                    undertaking. This was the happiest as well as the most useful period of his
                    life. The house he occupied was small but comfortable; and it contained a very
                    useful collection of books of reference and general literature, to which the
                    proprietors continued to add from time to time; so that he was not only enabled
                    to furnish his contributors with the materials of their labours, but to carry on
                    his own, without stirring abroad in quest of the necessary books. As chemistry
                    and natural history were the sciences which he chiefly studied, and to which,
                    indeed, he was enthusiastically devoted, the new articles which he himself
                    contributed to the work have been mostly superseded, and replaced by others more
                    in unison with the rapid progress of knowledge in these departments; but it is
                    due to his memory to mention the following, as affording proofs both of his
                    industry and the range of his acquirements: Cetology, Chemistry, Conchology,
                    Crystallization, Dyeing, Dynamics, Erpetology, Furnace, Galvanism, Mineralogy,
                    Ores, and the analysis of Stones. Some of these treatises were afterwards
                    republished, we believe, in separate forms. About the same period that he
                    completed his labours upon the Encyclopaedia, namely, in 1810, he gave to the
                    world a new and greatly improved edition of Williams’s Mineral Kingdom, in two
                    volumes octavo. Although entirely a work of practical experience, the result of
                    a confined occupation in the coal and mining districts of the country, Dr Millar
                    so enlarged and expanded it, as to render it a not unacceptable present to the
                    scientific reader. In an appendix, he gave an extended view of the sciences of
                    mineralogy and geology, which was necessarily precluded by the limited knowledge
                    and experience of Mr Williams. Although geology since that period has made
                    singular and unexpected advances, this part of the publication deserves to be
                    noticed, as including a more copious detail of geological facts than had at that
                    time been presented to the public.</p><p>The only other literary undertaking in which Dr Millar engaged was the
                    Encyclopaedia Edinensis, the ostensible design of which was to present to the
                    public, in a few volumes, a succinct and accessible epitome of general
                    knowledge, suited to the great mass of the community. But in consequence of the
                    embarrassed affairs of the proprietors, the undertaking was for a time
                    suspended, and he did not live to complete it. From this period Dr Millar
                    relinquished all connection with literary undertakings, and officiated for
                    several years as physician to the Edinburgh Dispensary, the duties of which
                    situation he discharged with a zeal and philanthropy beyond all praise. By those
                    who knew him well Dr Millar was greatly esteemed. He was an agreeable and
                    intelligent companion, whose conversation was acceptable as well to men of the
                    world as to men of science. Though he lived a life of labour, his rewards were
                    but small; and this, joined to the failure of some of his attempts to establish
                    himself as a lecturer on chemistry and mineralogy, contributed somewhat, in the
                    later period of his life, to sour his temper; but he always manifested a liberal
                    and independent spirit, and took <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820262" xml:id="kp-eb0715-0262-0081"/>a warm interest
                    in the progress of knowledge, as well as in the welfare of its cultivators. He
                    died at Edinburgh on the 13th of July 1827, leaving a widow and several
                    children.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
