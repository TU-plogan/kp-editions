                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Microscope,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">μικgος,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">small object,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ακοτrεω, to see</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">examine,</hi> is the name of a well-known optical instrument
                    for examining and magnifying minute objects, or the minute parts of large ones.
                    Dr Goring has, in his various ingenious works on the microscope, used the word
                    <hi rend="italic">engiscope,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">εγγυς, near,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">σκοπεω, to see</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the old and
                    venerable term is so associated with the history of optical discovery, and is so
                    expressive of the application of the instrument, that we cannot consent to the
                    proposed change.</p>
                <p>As the early history of the microscope must form a part of the general history of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> we must refer our readers to that article for
                    an account of its invention and progressive improvements, as well as for an
                    account of the optical principles on which it depends.</p>
                <p>There is probably no branch of practical science which has undergone such
                    essential and rapid improvements as that which relates to the microscope. It has
                    become quite a new instrument in modern times, and it promises to be the means
                    of disclosing the structure and laws of matter, and of making as important
                    discoveries in the infinitely minute world, as the telescope has done in that
                    which is infinitely distant.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.—ON SINGLE MICROSCOPES.</p>
                <p>A single microscope is one in which only one convex lens is used for magnifying
                    objects. The object to be examined is placed before the lens,∙in its focus; and
                    the rays which emerge from the lens after refraction are parallel, and therefore
                    give distinct vision of the object to the eye placed behind it. The simplest
                    form of the single microscope is when the lens is fitted into a rim of brass
                    furnished with a handle, and the object being held in the left hand and the lens
                    in the right, it may be examined with great correctness. If the convex lens is
                    very minute, and has a short focal length, such as from the 10th to the 100 th
                    of an inch, it cannot be conveniently used in the hand, and must therefore be
                    placed in a firm microscope stand, having a shelf for holding the object, a
                    screw or a rack and pinion for placing the object in the focus of the lens, and
                    a lens or mirror, or both, for throwing light upon the object. In this form,
                    however complex be its structure, it is still called a single microscope.</p>
                <p>A single microscope, in order to have all the perfection which art can give, must
                    consist of a <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> perfectly homogeneous, like a
                    fluid without double refraction, or any variation of density. Its <hi
                    rend="italic">figure</hi> ought to be that of a planoconvex lens, whose convex
                    surface is part of a hyperboloid, in order to correct completely the spherical
                    aberration. Its <hi rend="italic">surface</hi> should be perfectly smooth and
                    highly polished, so as not to disturb the perfection of vision; and the
                    substance of which it is made should have the <hi rend="italic">lowest
                    dispersive</hi> power. As it is a great object to obtain high magnifying powers
                    with as little convexity as possible, and a large aperture, substances with high
                    refractive and low dispersive ones are the most suitable for single lenses, such
                    as <hi rend="italic">diamond, garnet,</hi> or which have no double refraction
                    when well crystallized; or such as <hi rend="italic">ruby, sapphire, topaz,</hi>
                    &amp;c. which have double refraction. As <hi rend="italic">fluor spar</hi> has
                    the lowest <hi rend="italic">dispersive power,</hi> it might be used with great
                    advantage when high powers are not wanted, and when the diminution of colour is
                    an object.</p>
                <p>Of all the substances we have named, fluids have properties best suited for
                    single microscopes. They possess perfect homogeneity, their surfaces when made
                    into lenses are perfectly smooth, and it is possible to mould minute drops of
                    them into a form approaching to that of the hyperboloid. Their defect, however,
                    consists in their not having a high refractive power, in their want of
                    durability, and the difficulty of forming sufficiently minute lenses for
                    producing high magnifying powers. These defects, however, especially the last,
                    may be overcome by patience and experience; and in proof of this we may state,
                    that we <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819573" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9573-0028"/>have
                    succeeded in forming fluid lenses that were fully equal to the best sapphire
                    lenses that have been executed.</p>
                <p>In the present state of this branch of science, it would be unprofitable to
                    detail the methods of producing microscopic globules of glass, given by Dr
                    Hooke, Father di Torre of Naples, Mr Butterfield, or Mr Sivright; because when
                    they are made after their methods, and in the most perfect manner which the
                    methods will permit, they are of no value compared with lenses of glass when
                    ground and polished to the same focal length.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These methods may be found.by the following

                <p>We shall therefore proceed to describe a single microscope when fitted up in the
                    best form for observation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Description of a Single Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>The most essential part of this instrument is the lens or lenses, upon which the
                    value of the microscope depends. The lenses are generally made of plate-glass,
                    and should have focal distances varying from the 1-10th to the 1-50th of an
                    inch. In order that the spherical aberration of these lenses may be the smallest
                    possible, the radii of their two surfaces should be as 1 to 6; the surface whose
                    radius is as 1, or the most convex side, must be turned towards the eye. The
                    lenses, thus made, are then set in the centre of the lower surface of concave
                    brass caps, a section of one of which is shown in Plate CCCLIX. fig. 1.</p>
                <p>The best mode of fitting up the microscope is that contrived by Mr Pritchard,
                    which is represented in fig. 2, on a scale about one third of its real size. It
                    is shown in an inclined position; but it may be used either in a vertical or a
                    horizontal one, according to the convenience of the observer. The body of the
                    instrument rests on a pillar <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> supported by three legs,
                    shown at α, and is connected with it by the clip <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> being
                    fixed by the pinching screw <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> Within the tube <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> there slides a tube A, connected by a screw which passes
                    through it to the triangular tube or bar <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> carrying the
                    arm <hi rend="italic">ij,</hi> into which is placed the brass cap y which
                    carries the lens. This lens is adjusted to the distinct vision of objects placed
                    on the stage <hi rend="italic">I</hi> by sliding the tube <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> up or down, and a perfect adjustment is obtained by turning the milled
                    head <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> The stage <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> which carries
                    the objects, is fitted into the triangular box <hi rend="italic">r</hi> at the
                    extremity of the stem, by means of two pins, and can be removed at pleasure. The
                    spring slider-holder, for holding the sliders in which the objects are placed,
                    is fixed by a bayonet-joint into the stage; and it may be used to hold stops or
                    diaphragms for limiting the field of view. The tube above <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> represents an illuminator fixed to the slider-holder. Upon the tube <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> two sockets <hi rend="italic">d, e</hi> slide with
                    sufficient spring and friction to keep them in their place. The socket <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> carries the reflector <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the
                    socket <hi rend="italic">e</hi> carries the condensing lens, which is not
                    inserted in the figure.</p>
                <p>A section of the stem <hi rend="italic">rck</hi> is shown in fig. 3, in order to
                    exhibit the mechanism by which the adjustment is effected. Into the box <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> screwed into the top of the stem, is fitted the triangular
                    tube <hi rend="italic">ii',</hi> which carries the arm <hi rend="italic"
                    >ij.</hi> In the lower end <hi rend="italic">i'</hi> of this triangular tube is
                    a small block with a fine screw working in it, the stem of which turns along
                    with the milled head <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> to which it is fixed. The upper
                    end of a spiral spring, shown in the figure, bears against the block <hi
                    rend="italic">i'</hi> at the bottom of the triangular tube, while its lower end
                    acts against a stop fixed within the sliding tube A. The method of managing,
                    illuminating, and examining opaque objects with this microscope is the same as
                    that used in the achromatic compound microscope, in the drawing of which it will
                    be more distinctly seen.</p>
                <p>The preceding instrument of Mr Pritchard’s is intended for general purposes; but
                    as the dissection of botanical and other objects is now a leading object with
                    naturalists, we shall add an account of another microscope, constructed by Mr A.
                    Ross, with much skill, for Mr W. Valentine of Nottingham, the parts of which are
                    given in considerable detail.</p>
                <p>A perspective view of this microscope is shown in Plate CCCLIX. fig. 4. It is
                    supported on a closing tripod, <hi rend="italic">aaa,</hi> whose feet can be
                    folded together, and are made of hard bell-metal, prevented from springing by
                    edge bars, as seen on the left-hand foot. A firm pillar, which rises from the
                    tripod, carries the stage <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> which is fixed on brackets,
                    to give a steady support to the hands of the operator. A capital, <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> fixed to the top of the tube by three screws, has in its
                    axis a triangular hole, into which is fitted the triangular tube/ the lower end
                    of which passes through another similar triangular tube in the piece <hi
                    rend="italic">gg,</hi> fixed to the tube. This triangular tube is made to slide
                    up and down by a fixed screw, <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which is wrought by a
                    large milled head, o, which is most judiciously placed at the base of the
                    pillar. At the top and bottom of the triangular tube, at <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> and near r, are fitted two pieces, with triangular holes through them
                    for receiving the triangular bell-metal bar ss, which moves up and down in them.
                    This bar carries the arm 10 with the lenses. It is moved up and down, so as to
                    adjust the lenses to distinct vision of the objects on the fixed stage, by the
                    rack and pinion <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> when a quick adjustment is required;
                    but when a slow and nicer adjustment is wanted, it is effected by the milled
                    head <hi rend="italic">o.</hi> A slit, <hi rend="italic">uv,</hi> is made in the
                    shaft of the pillar, to allow the neck of the small milled head <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> to move up and down; for when the screw is in action by the
                    large milled head <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> the triangular tube and the bar move
                    together. The triangular bar is perforated at both ends, the upper perforation
                    for receiving a conical pin, and the lower for admitting the adjusting screw to
                    preserve the length of the bar. The piece <hi rend="italic">w</hi> is removed
                    from the side of the pillar, to show the bearings of the pinion <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> which are attached to the triangular tube. The bar moves
                    1½ inch, and the tube 1½, so that we can command an elevation of 3 inches. At
                    the ingenious suggestion of Mr Solly, the screw <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> moved
                    by the milled head <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> has fifty threads in an inch, and
                    the milled head is graduated into 100 parts, for the purpose of measuring the
                    thickness of any vessel or other object in the direction of the axis of vision.
                    For this purpose the upper surface of the body is brought into distinct vision;
                    the division at which the index or pin of the tripod stands is then observed;
                    and the under surface being in like manner brought into focus by turning the
                    milled head <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> the division is again observed. The number
                    of divisions, which are each 5000ths of an inch, between these two numbers, <hi
                    rend="italic">will indicate,</hi> according to Mr Valentine, <hi rend="italic"
                    >the space through which the lens has passed, which is the diameter of a
                    vessel.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="superscript"> %</hi> This is not the case, as the refraction of the light
                    issuing from the lower side of the vessel or object is not considered. The right
                    mode is, after having observed the upper surface of an object lying upon glass,
                    remove the object, and observe the divisions when the surface of the glass is
                    seen distinctly: the difference will be the true thickness. Mr Samuel Varley is
                    said to have constructed an instrument on this principle for measuring the
                    thickness of foci of lenses; but unless he removed his lens after observing the
                    first surface, his results must have been all erroneous.</p></note></p>
                <p>In this microscope, different parts of an object may be brought into the field,
                    either by moving the stage or the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819586"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9586-0029"/>lens, a very important requisite in a microscope
                    used for the purposes of discovery. With this view, the large stage <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> is formed of three plates, the lowest of which is fixed to
                    the pillar by the ring 1; and,.to make it bear the weight of the hands, it rests
                    upon the strong brackets 2, 2. The under side of this plate is shown in fig. 6;
                    the middle plate, fig. 7, contains two pair of dovetail slits, 3, 3 and 4, 4,
                    the widest orifice of each being on opposite sides of the plate. The dovetail
                    pieces in 4, 4 screw into the upper side of the upper plate, fig. 8, the points
                    of the screws being shown at 4. 4 in that figure, while the dovetail pieces in
                    3, 3 are secured to the upper side of the under plate by the screws 3, 3, fig.
                    3. The plates are thus moved diagonally, and at right angles to one another, by
                    the adjusting screws 7 and 8. One of the screws, with its ball and milled head,
                    is shown in fig. 9. In the adjusting screw 7, the ball is placed in spring
                    couplings, and fastened to the under side of the upper plate. These screws are
                    judiciously placed, one on each side of the pillar, that the hand may reach them
                    easily and not intercept the light. By turning first one screw, and then the
                    other, or both at once, any part of the object may be brought into the
                    field.</p>
                <p>The arm for holding the lenses is shown at 10, in fig. 1 and fig. 10. A conical
                    pin projects from underneath, and fits into a hole made down the triangular bar,
                    as shown at 9, fig. 8. The lens will therefore have a circular movement in a
                    horizontal plane, and it may be placed at any point in this plane by the action
                    of the rack and pinion at 10. Hence the most complete adjustment can be obtained
                    without any motion of the stage.</p>
                <p>The elevated stage for holding the objects is shown at 11 in fig. 4 and 8. A
                    tube, 12, fig. 11, screws into the upper plate, and upon this fits the tube 11,
                    carrying the finger spring, shown in fig. 4. Objects of different thickness are
                    thus kept down upon the plates by the pins sliding in the small pipes. An
                    elevated stage is shown in fig. 12, for viewing the sides of objects without
                    disturbing them. A condensing lens, fig. 13, slides into the sockets 5 or 6; and
                    fig. 14 shows the pincers, to be applied in the same manner.</p>
                <p>The large reflector above α, fig. 8, may be removed, and any other illuminating
                    apparatus substituted. That of Dr Wollaston is shown in fig. 15, at 19. The
                    handles 18, 18 serve to move the lens up and down in the tube.</p>
                <p>The mode of attaching the body of a compound microscope is shown in fig. 16. For
                    this purpose the arm 10, fig. 4, is withdrawn, and the conical pin 20 is made to
                    fit in the same hole in the triangular bar.</p>

                    microscopes, and also with what are called doublets and triplets, we shall now
                    proceed to give an account of the various improvements which the single
                    microscope has undergone.</p>

                <p>The low refractive power of glass rendered it necessary, when high powers were
                    wanted, to use lenses with very short foci, and consequently with very deep
                    curves and very small diameters, so as to admit only a narrow pencil of light
                    into the eye.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster was the first person who pointed out the value of using other
                    materials for the construction of lenses; and he remarked, that no essential
                    improvement could be expected in the single microscope, unless from the
                    discovery of some transparent substance, which, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >diamond,</hi> combines a high refractive with a low dispersive power. Having
                    experienced the greatest difficulty in getting a small diamond cut into a prism
                    in London, he did not conceive it' practicable to grind and polish a diamond
                    lens,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Pritchard
                    informs us (see <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Journal of Science,</hi> No. 1, new
                    series, p. 149, July 1829), that Messrs Rundell and Bridge of Ludgate Hill had,
                    at the time when Mr Pritchard began his experiments, many Dutch diamond-cutters
                    at work; and that the foreman, Mr Levi, with all his men, assured him, <hi
                    rend="italic">that it was impossible</hi> to work diamonds into spherical
                    lenses. The same opinion, he adds, was also expressed by several others, who
                    were considered of standard authority in such matters. When Mr Pritchard had,
                    contrary to the expectation of many, succeeded in finishing his first lens, it
                    was examined by Mr Levi, who expressed great astonishment at it, and added, that
                    he was not acquainted with any means by which that figure could have been
                    effected.</p></note> and therefore did not put his opinion to the test of
                    experiment. He got two lenses, however, executed in Edinburgh by Mr Peter Hill,
                    an ingenious optician, the one made of ruby, and the other of garnet; and these
                    lenses he found to be greatly superior to any lenses that he had previously
                    used.</p>
                <p>Dr Goring, whose zeal and success in the improvement of microscopes has not been
                    surpassed, directed the attention of Mr Pritchard in 1824 to the passages in Sir
                    David Brewster’s Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments, respecting the value
                    of the precious stones for single microscopes; and having immediately seen their
                    full force, it was agreed that they should undertake to grind a diamond into a
                    magnifier.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diamond Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of this attempt is so interesting, that we must give it in Mr
                    Pritchard’s own words :—“For this purpose,” says he, “Dr Goring forwarded me a
                    small brilliant diamond to begin upon; and it was proposed to give it the curves
                    that in glass would produce a lens of a twentieth of an inch focus, with the
                    proportion of the radii of their surfaces as <hi rend="italic">two</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">five.</hi> This stone I ground with the proper curves, and
                    polished the flatter side, contrary to the expectations of many whose judgment
                    in these matters was thought of much weight, who predicted that the crystalline
                    structure of the diamond would not permit it to receive a spherical figure. When
                    thus far advanced, fate decreed that I should lose the stone, and my only
                    consolation was, to discover afterwards, that had it been completed, its
                    thickness and enormous refractive power would probably have caused the focus to
                    fall within the substance of the stone.</p>
                <p>“Having, however, in this experiment proved the possibility of working lenses of
                    adamant, I set about another, and selected a rose-cut diamond, in order to form
                    it into <hi rend="italic">a</hi> plano-convex lens, and thereby save a moiety of
                    the labour.</p>
                <p>“In the progress of working this stone, the heat generated by friction, in the
                    course of the abrasion of the diamond, was perpetually melting the cement
                    (shell-lac) by which the flat side was affixed to the tool, and compelled me to
                    seek some means by which it might be prevented. After several trials, I found,
                    that when a portion of finely powdered pumice-stone was mixed with the
                    shell-lac, the cement was much stronger, and less liable to melt, than any other
                    similar substance.</p>
                <p>“On thefirst of December 18241 had the pleasure of first looking through a
                    diamond microscope, and it was doubtless the first time this precious gem had
                    been employed in making manifest the hidden secrets of nature. A few days after,
                    I had polished it sufficiently to put it into the hands of Dr Goring, who tried
                    its performance on various objects, both as a single microscope and as the
                    objective of a compound. He states in a letter addressed to me, dated 3d <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819599" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9599-0030"/> January 1825, ’
                    that it has shown the most difficult transparent objects I have submitted to it
                    ;’ and again, ‘ I can clearly perceive the amazing superiority it will possess
                    when completely finished.’ I must, however, inform my readers, that we
                    discovered in this state various flaws in the stone, in consequence of which we
                    abandoned all thought of completing it. In this condition the project remained
                    for about a year, when I determined to resume my attempts; and having worked
                    several stones into lenses, I at last succeeded in obtaining a perfect one. In
                    the course of these labours, a new though not unexpected defect appeared in
                    several lenses, which would have subverted the whole scheme, had not the first
                    diamond lens been free from it.</p>
                <p>“These lenses, instead of giving a single image like the first, gave a double or
                    triple one. This rendered them utterly useless as magnifiers, and made the
                    defects of soft and hard parts in the same stone, and the small cavities in
                    others, of comparatively trifling consequence. The images exhibited in such
                    lenses overlapped each other, but were never entirely separated, though the
                    quantity of overlapping varied in different specimens.</p>
                <p>“It was now evident that these defects arose from polarisation, though this stone
                    is described as <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> refracting single.’ I
                    subsequently learned from Dr Brewster, after I had overcome these obstacles,
                    that this property of the diamond had been observed by him, and an account of it
                    given in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions.<note anchored="true"

                    referring to his paper, it appears Dr Brewster found that some stones ‘
                    polarised in particular <hi rend="italic">parts,</hi> while other <hi
                    rend="italic">portions of the same stone were quite free from any trace of
                    polarity,'</hi> and thus perfectly adapted to our purpose, as had previously
                    been demonstrated in the first diamond lens.</p>
                <p>“Notwithstanding these difficulties, and the consequent expense and labour they
                    entailed on me before sufficiently experienced in working upon this refractory
                    material with certainty, I have, now the satisfaction of being able, by
                    inspection <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> to decide whether a diamond is fit
                    for a magnifier or not; and have now executed two planoconvex magnifiers of
                    adamant, whose structure is quite perfect for microscopic purposes. One of these
                    is about the twentieth of an inch focus, and is now in the possession of his
                    Grace the Duke of Buckingham; the other, in my hands, is the thirtieth of an
                    inch focus, and has consequently amplification enough for most practical
                    purposes.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Microscopic
                    Cabinet, p. 107-111.</p></note></p>
                <p>As the expense of the diamond, and the labour of working it, are very great,
                    about fifty or sixty hours being necessary to complete a diamond lens with
                    double convexity, it is of the greatest consequence to ascertain beforehand if
                    the substance of the diamond is homogeneous, that is, free from difference of
                    density or double refraction, and if it does not contain any small cavities. The
                    best way is to examine the stone, by cutting two flat faces upon it, unless it
                    is a <hi rend="italic">laske</hi> or table diamond, which always has two flat
                    faces upon it; but this labour may often be avoided by examining it when plunged
                    or held in a glass trough containing <hi rend="italic">oil of cassia,</hi> the
                    fluid which approaches nearest to it in refractive power. This will diminish all
                    the refractions at the irregular surface of the diamond, and make any internal
                    imperfections as easily seen as if its substance was plate-glass.</p>
                <p>By comparing the indices of refraction of diamond and glass, it may be easily
                    shown that the same magnifying power may be obtained with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >diamond</hi> lens having its curvature with a radius of 8, as with a <hi
                    rend="italic">glass</hi> lens, the radius of whose curvature is 3; and as the
                    spherical aberration increases with the depth of curvature or the thickness of
                    the lens, a lens of diamond will bear a much larger aperture than one of glass
                    before indistinctness of vision is produced. Mr Pritchard has given a very
                    useful ocular representation of the relative value of a diamond and a glass
                    lens. In the annexed figure, G is the section of a semi-lens of glass, and D the
                    section of one of dia mond, so placed that their principal focus F shall be at
                    the same point. In the diamond semi-lens the marginal rays will intersect the
                    axis at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and in the glass semi-lens at <hi
                    rend="italic">g;</hi> the longitudinal aberration being &lt;7F in the <hi
                    rend="italic">diamond,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gF</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">glass</hi> lens.</p>
                <p>In order to obtain a numerical increase of these aberrations, Mr Pritchard
                    computed them from the formula, and found that of the diamond lens to be ^ths of
                    its own thickness, that of the glass lens being½ths of its thickness; and by
                    taking the thickness of the diamond lens to be 255, while that of the glass is
                    758, he obtained ⅞ths of 255= 108, and ½ths of 758 = 884, and hence it follows
                    that <hi rend="italic">the actual aberration of a</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> diamond</hi><hi rend="italic">lens is only about one ninth of the
                    aberration of a</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> glass</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lens</hi> of the same power and aperture.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the diamond lens to be ground on the same tool with the glass lens,
                    so as to have the same curvature, the same thickness, and the same diameter, the
                    longitudinal aberration of the diamond will be to that of the glass lens as 43
                    is to 117, or nearly one third of it; and if we suppose the focal length of both
                    to be⅛th of an inch, the magnifying power of the diamond lens will be 2133,
                    while that of the glass one will be only 800. In order that a lens of glass may
                    have the same magnifying power as that of the diamond above mentioned, its focal
                    distance would require to be only the 200th part of an inch.</p>
                <p>The durability of the diamond lens is also another valuable property, which
                    allows it to be burnished into a disc of metal, and taken out and cleaned
                    without any danger of being scratched. In treating of microscopic doublets and
                    achromatic microscopes, we shall have occasion to recur again to the diamond
                    lens.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sapphire Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>The ruby and the sapphire are the same substance, differing only in colour. Mr
                    Pritchard has, with his usual success, executed many lenses of sapphire, which,
                    though inferior to those of diamond, are vastly superior to the best executed
                    lenses of glass. When a double convex lens of sapphire and one of plate-glass
                    are ground to the same focus, so as to have the same aperture and magnifying
                    power, their relative curvatures are as 5 to 3, and their thicknesses as shown
                    in the annexed figure, where A is the section of a semi-lens of sapphire, whose
                    focus is at F, and B a section of a semilens of glass, having its focus at the
                    same point. This figure points out in the clearest manner another advantage of
                    using the precious stones in place of glass. In small lenses of glass, the
                    thickness of the glass is such that there is no room between its anterior
                    surface and the object for the admission of instruments for dissection, and not
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819612" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9612-0031"/>even for the
                    thinnest plate of glass, so that it is impossible to use glass lenses of small
                    foci in viewing objects placed in glass sliders. If the preceding figure
                    represents lenses with a focus of ⅛th of an inch, the distance of the glass lens
                    B from F will be little more than <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth of an inch, which is less than the thinnest
                    glass.</p>
                <p>In using the <hi rend="italic">Sapphire</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ruby,</hi> or
                    any precious stone which refracts doubly, such as <hi rend="italic">zircon,
                    topaz,</hi> &amp;c. for lenses, we are exposed to a very serious defect, arising
                    from the duplication of minute lines, in consequence of the double refraction of
                    these crystals. In order to remedy this defect, the optician endeavours to cut
                    the stone so that the axis of the lens may coincide with the axis of double
                    refraction. This, however, is a difficult task; and, even if it were
                    accomplished, we should not get rid entirely of the duplication of the images,
                    as in all double convex lenses, as well as in plane convex lenses with the plane
                    side turned to the object, the rays cannot pass through the lens in parallel
                    directions, and therefore must suffer double refraction, however small. It may
                    be reduced, however, to the smallest possible amount, and even to nothing, for
                    pencils of rays diverging from a point in the axis, by making the lens
                    plano-convex, and turning the plane side to the eye, as in the annexed figure,
                    where rays issuing from F, and entering the eye parallel at E, must pass through
                    the lens AB in parallel directions, suffering all their refraction at the first
                    or curved surface of the lens. By adopting this form and position of the lens,
                    we, however, lose more than we gain; for the lens is placed in the position
                    which gives a maximum spherical aberration. When the magnifying power is not
                    very high, the residual double refraction is not injurious; and in proof of this
                    we may state, that we have in our possession a double convex lens of sapphire,
                    executed by Mr Pritchard, which exhibits minute objects with the greatest beauty
                    and precision. The only way, therefore, is to employ precious stones, such as
                    the <hi rend="italic">diamond,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">garnet,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">spinelle ruby,</hi> which have no double refraction when their
                    crystallization has been regularly effected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Garnet and Spinelle Ruby Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>The garnet is superior in its structure to the spinelle ruby, and the best and
                    purest which we have seen is that which is brought from Greenland, and has a
                    slight tinge of purple. We have used lenses made of this substance by Mr Hill,
                    Mr Adie, Mr Blackie, and Mr Veitch, all of which exhibit minute objects with
                    admirable accuracy and precision; and we can state with confidence, that we have
                    never experienced the slightest inconvenience from the colour of the garnet,
                    which diminishes with its thickness, and consequently disappears almost wholly
                    in very minute lenses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Single Fluid Microscopes.</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Stephen Gray long ago proposed to construct single microscopes with drops of
                    water, which he lifted up with a pin, and deposited in a small hole made in a
                    piece of brass. The drop retained a sort of imperfect sphericity, and showed
                    objects with some distinctness; but it is obvious that the very weight of the
                    drop destroyed its spherical form, even if it had not been disturbed by minute
                    irregularities on the circumference of the aperture in which it was placed.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster long ago constructed fluid lenses in a different manner, so as
                    to avoid the irregularities above mentioned. He placed minute drops of very pure
                    turpentine varnish, and other viscid fluids, on plates of thin and parallel
                    glass. By this means he formed plano-convex lenses of any focal length; and by
                    dropping the varnish on both sides, he formed double convex lenses, with their
                    convexities in any required proportion. By freeing the glass carefully from all
                    grease with a solution of soda, the margin of these lenses was beautifully
                    circular; and the only effect of gravity, which diminishes with the viscidity of
                    the fluid and with the smallness of the drop, is to elongate the lower lens and
                    flatten the upper one. These lenses were found to answer well as the
                    object-glasses of compound microscopes.</p>
                <p>After experiencing’the extreme difficulty of obtaining precious stones free of
                    double refraction or difference of density, and from little cavities and
                    imperfections, as well as the difficulty of giving their surfaces a perfect
                    polish and a correct figure, Sir David Brewster has, we understand, recently
                    made an extended series of experiments on the formation of minute fluid lenses,
                    which should equal in power and distinctness those made of precious stones. The
                    primary difficulty which was encountered in this attempt was that of depositing
                    a sufficiently minute drop of fluid upon a surface of glass. This arose from two
                    causes, from the difficulty of taking up on the slenderest fibre a minute
                    globule of a fluid of any moderate tenacity, and the still greater difficulty of
                    overcoming its adhesion to the fibre, and laying a portion of it on glass. The
                    first of these difficulties he overcame by a suitable mixture of two fluids, and
                    the second by a mechanical process. Having thus succeeded in obtaining lenses
                    too small to be recognised distinctly by the eye, he next endeavonred.to make
                    their figure approximate to the hyperbolic form when the lenses were not of the
                    smallest size, and the results which he obtained were far beyond his
                    expectation. Some of these lenses preserved their perfection for more than a
                    year, and if protected from dust might have been kept much longer. If fluids
                    could be obtained of a high refractive power, and not of a volatile nature,
                    microscopes of extreme perfection might thus be readily constructed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Catadioptric Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>A single lens, by which light is both refracted and reflected, seems at first
                    sight to be something paradoxical. Such a lens, however, which was proposed and
                    used by Sir David Brewster, is shown in the annexed figure, where ABC is a
                    hemispherical plano-convex lens, which, if we use it in the common way, will
                    have a certain magnifying power; but if we use it as shown in the figure, it
                    acts as a double convex lens of the same radius, and has consequently twice the
                    magnifying power. Bisect the semicircle BAC in A, and join AB, AC. If we now
                    place an object at <hi rend="italic">rnn,</hi> and look into the lens BA at F,
                    we shall see by reflection from the surface BC the object <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> with the same distinctness and under the same angle as if we had
                    placed the two lenses Aα B√, Aα <hi rend="italic">Cd,</hi> with their plane
                    sides AB, AC together. Since tRe light is incident on the reflecting surface BDC
                    at an angle of 45°, not a ray of it will be lost, as it suffers total
                    reflection. The lens thus used has less spherical aberration than when used as a
                    whole, ABC, and there is no error from imperfect centring. This lens may be used
                    as the object-glass of a compound microscope; and it will be seen in another <pb

                    possesses other advantages than those which have been mentioned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Grooved Sphere.</hi></p>
                <p>This lens derives its name from its having a deep groove cut round it in the
                    plane of a great circle perpendicular to the axis of vision. Sir David Brewster
                    was led to its construction by the doublet of Dr Wollaston, which will be
                    described in another section. It consists of a spherical lens or sphere, with a
                    deep concave groove cut round it, so as to cut off the marginal pencils, and
                    thus give a wider field and a more perfect image. It is represented in the
                    annexed figure, where AB CD is a sphere of glass, having the unshaded parts
                    below AC and above BD cut away, in order to prevent rays that fall very
                    obliquely from reaching the eye. The central thickness of the lens may be made
                    so small as to render the spherical and even the chromatic aberration almost
                    insensible. As all the pencils pass through the centre, every part of the image
                    will be equally distinct; a property possessed by no other lens whatever.</p>
                <p>Mr Coddington,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil.
                    Trans. 1830, part i. p. 69-84.</p></note> who entertains a high opinion of the
                    value of this lens, observes: “Besides all this, another advantage appears in
                    practice to attend this construction, which I did not anticipate, and for which
                    I cannot now at all account. I have stated, that when a pencil of rays is
                    admitted into the eye, which, having passed without deviation through a lens, is
                    bent by the eye, the vision is never free from the coloured fringes produced by
                    eccentrical dispersion. Now with the sphere I certainly do not perceive this
                    defect, and I therefore conceive that if it were possible to make the spherical
                    glass on a very minute scale, it would be <hi rend="italic">the most perfect

                    as its use extends, its only defects being the very small field of view, and the
                    impracticability of applying it, except to transparent objects seen by
                    transmitted light. Now the sphere has this advantage, that whereas it makes <hi
                    rend="italic">a very good simple microscope, it is more peculiarly</hi> fitted
                    for the object-glass of a compound instrument, since it gives a perfectly
                    distinct image of any required extent, and that, when combined with a proper
                    eye-piece, it may without difficulty be employed for opaque objects.” We do not
                    rightly apprehend the exact import of these observations. Mr Coddington
                    distinctly asserts that the grooved sphere is the most perfect simple
                    microscope, or the most perfect microscope with one lens; and yet he says in the
                    next paragraph that it is only “a very good simple microscope,” being “more
                    peculiarly fitted for a compound instrument.”</p>
                <p>With regard to the difficulty of making it on a small scale, it is by no means
                    great; for if we can grind and polish its two surfaces, we may readily excavate
                    it round its margin. We have now before us a grooved sphere of garnet ^⅛th of an
                    inch radius, executed by Mr Blackie: The focus is almost close to the lens,
                    which in many kinds of observation is a great advantage, and its performance is
                    remarkably fine.</p>
                <p>It will be seen in our article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> that when the
                    refractive inde*x of a sphere exceeds 2∙000, its focus falls within the sphere.
                    Hence a grooved sphere made of diamond is useless. When made with garnet, it is
                    invaluable, and its focus is just thrown so near its surface, that i the objects
                    may be laid upon its surface, or pressed against it by a concave surface of the
                    same radius.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Crystalline Lenses of Small Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>The crystalline lens of minnows and small. fishes may ( be taken out of the eye
                    in a state of such perfection, that, 1 when used as single microscopes, they
                    give a very perfect &lt; image of minute objects. In such lenses which have an
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> increasing density towards their centre, the
                    spherical aberration is almost wholly corrected. Great care, however, must be
                    taken to make the axis of the lens the axis of vision, to prevent its form from
                    being injored by pressure against the aperture which holds it. The best way is
                    to make a ring at the end of a piece of wire, having its diameter a little
                    greater than that of the lens. A ring of viscid fluid is then made to line the
                    ring of wire, and the lens is suspended in the ring of fluid, some of the fluid
                    encroaching upon its anterior or posterior surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Magnifying Forcer of Single Microscopes.</hi></p>
                <p>Having thus described the various kinds of single microscopes, we shall now
                    consider the subject of their magnifying power. When an eye in the prime of
                    life, and neither long nor short sighted, views the minutest object which it can
                    recognise, it will generally place it at the distance of about five inches. When
                    the same object is viewed through a single microscope, the distance at which it
                    is seen is equal to the focal length of the lens; and as the apparent magnitude
                    of objects is inversely as the distances at which they are seen, we have only to
                    divide the distance five inches by the focal length of the lens, in order to
                    know its magnifying power, or its apparent magnitude when seen through the
                    lens.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the magnifying power of lenses of all focal lengths,
                    from 5 inches up to the 100th of an inch, and is applicable to all lenses, of
                    whatever substance they are made.</p>

                <p>We have already mentioned the advantages which the precious stones have over
                    glass ones, in having a much less spherical aberration. In order that a glass
                    lens may have the least spherical aberration, its radii of curvature must be as
                    one to six, the flattest side being turned to the object; but this is not the
                    case with bodies of a different refractive power. Mr Coddington, in his valuable
                    Treatise on the Reflection and Refraction of Light,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Page 111, Cambridge, 1829.</p></note> has
                    computed the ratio of the curves when the aberration is a minimum for various
                    indices of refraction from 1∙5 up to 2O, and the amount of the aberration itself
                    in parts of the thickness of the lens. This table is very important in a
                    practical point of view, as will be seen from the observations which follow
                    it.</p>

                <p>It appears from the preceding table, that when the refractive index is between

                    magnifying power in order to obtain this advantage in diamond; but the sacrifice
                    will be well bestowed, for such a lens will be almost wholly free of spherical
                    aberration. It appears from the table, that when the index of refraction is a
                    little less than l∙7, a plano-convex lens, with its plane side turned to the
                    object, is the best form for a single microscopè.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the difficulty of the task, we would earnestly direct the
                    attention of artists to the subject of grinding plano-convex lenses of a
                    hyperbolic form for single microscopes. The smallness of a lens must increase
                    the difficulty; but in this case the effect may be accidentally obtained, as it
                    is often done in giving a parabolic and an elliptical form to specula. Mr Potter
                    has given, and put to the test of experiment, a method of obtaining any curve
                    derived from revolution, by giving a particular form to the grinding and

                <p>CHAP. II.—DESCRIPTION OF MICROSCOPIC DOUBLETS AND TRIPLETS.</p>
                <p>Under this chapter we propose to describe all combinations of lenses in which two
                    or more are placed in contact, or at such a distance that no image is formed
                    between them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wollaston’s Periscopic Doublet.</hi></p>
                <p>The earliest proposal of a doublet lens was that which Dr Wollaston described in
                    1812,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1812,
                    p. 375.</p></note> under the name of a periscopic microscope. The following is
                    his own description of it: “The great desideratum,” says he, “in employing high
                    magnifiers, is sufficiency of light; and it is accordingly expedient to make the
                    aperture of the little lens as large as is consistent with distinct vision. But
                    if the object to be viewed is of such magnitude as to appear under an angle of
                    several degrees on each side of the centre, the requisite distinctness cannot be
                    given to the whole surface by a common lens, in consequence of the confusion
                    occasioned by oblique incidence of the lateral rays, excepting by means of a
                    very small aperture, and proportionable dimi nution of light. In order to remedy
                    this inconvenience, I conceived that the perforated metal which limits the
                    aperture of the lens might be placed with advantage in its centre; and
                    accordingly I procured two plano-convex lenses ground to the same radius, and
                    applying their plane surface on opposite sides of the same aperture, in a thin
                    piece of metal (as is represented by a section, fig. 6), I produced the desired
                    effect, having virtually a double convex lens, so contrived that the passage of
                    oblique pencils was at right angles with its surface, as well as the central
                    pencil. With a lens so constructed, the perforation that appeared to give thς
                    most perfect distinctness was about <hi rend="italic">one-fifth</hi> part of the
                    focal length in diameter; and when such an aperture is well centred, the visible
                    field is at least as much as 20* in diameter. It is true, that a portion of
                    light is lost by doubling the number of surfaces; but this is more than
                    compensated by the greater aperture which, under these circumstances, is
                    compatible with distinct vision.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Periscopic Sphere.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding passage Dr Wollaston describes only a double convex periscopic
                    microscope, consisting of two plano-convex lenses; but he does not take the case
                    where these two lenses are hemispheres, and, consequently, where the doubly
                    convex one which they form is a sphere. When the lenses are not hemispheres, the
                    pencils are not centrical, and the rays from different parts of the object do
                    not each suffer the same species of refraction as they do when passing through a
                    sphere, so that every part of the field is not equally distinct. It is obvious
                    also that Dr Wollaston did not think of filling up the central aperture<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819651" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9651-0034"/> with a fluid of
                    the same refractive power as the lens, in order to remove the loss of light from
                    the double number of surfaces, which he mentions as a defect in his
                    microscope.</p>
                <p>The construction of a periscopic sphere proposed by Sir David Brewster combines
                    these two properties. The lenses, whether they are hemispherical or not, must be
                    so placed that their convex surfaces form part of the same sphere, as shown in
                    the annexed figures.</p>
                <p>In fig. 7, the plano-convex lenses AB, CD may be cemented to a piece of plate
                    glass <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> of such a thickness in one direction as to
                    complete the sphere, and of such a diameter in the direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >mu</hi> as to form a suitable contraction of the aperture.</p>
                <p>In fig. 8, the space between the lenses may be filled up, as in the figure, by
                    two pieces of plate-glass ArønB, C≡D, between which is a plate of brass, or of
                    thin black paper, containing a suitable aperture in the centre of the lenses.
                    Here there are <hi rend="italic">six</hi> surfaces within the sphere, but, by
                    uniting them with a proper cement, the whole becomes a single sphere, in which
                    there is no perceptible loss of light.</p>
                <p>In fig. 9, lenses of unequal size and thickness are combined, either with a plate
                    of glass, or a fluid between them of the same refractive power as the glass, and
                    the apertures may be placed on the plane surfaces AB, CD.</p>
                <p>In fig. 10, two convex lenses may be combined into a sphere, the intermediate
                    portion being filled up with a fluid of the same refractive power. This may be
                    readily done by cementing each lens on the end of a brass or glass tube <hi
                    rend="italic">ab,</hi> and introducing the fluid by an aperture.</p>
                <p>In uniting these lenses, it is obviously necessary that the convex outer surfaces
                    should be exactly of the same curvature, and of the same kind of glass. The best
                    way of effecting this is to grind a thick lens ABC, either greater or less than
                    a hemisphere, and then to bisect it at AD, and out of the portions ADB, ADC to
                    form two plano-convex or two double convex lenses AB, CD. The outer surfaces of
                    these two lenses will belong accurately to the same sphere. The perfect
                    similarity of the inner surfaces is of less consequence, as all refraction by
                    them is removed by the cement.</p>
                <p>By these different steps Sir David Brewster was led to the idea of the grooved
                    sphere, or the lens already described under the head of single microscopes, in
                    which the aperture is contracted by excavating the sphere all round in one of
                    its great circles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Periscopic Achromatic Spheres.</hi></p>
                <p>If, in the construction shown in fig. 12, in place of making the fluid <hi
                    rend="italic">op</hi> of the same refractive and dispersive power as the two
                    lenses, we make it such as to correct the colour of these lenses, we shall
                    obtain an achromatic sphere, as proposed by Sir David Brewster; and the compound
                    lens may be still farther improved as a microscope, by attaching, either by
                    cement or not to the back of the first lens AB, a convex speculum of silver or
                    steel for illuminating the object, the contracted aperture being the hole in the
                    centre of the speculum. The concave fluid lens is shown at <hi rend="italic"
                    >op</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and such a curvature must be given to the

                    lenses (double convex ones), in opposite positions, a concave lens of a medium
                    more highly dispersive than that of the lenses, adjusting the curvatures so that
                    the outer surfaces of the crossed lenses shall be portions of the same sphere,
                    and that the interior surfaces shall exactly fit into each other.</p>
                <p>“In such a system, we may consider the effect to be the same as that of an entire

                <p>“Whether we ought or ought not,” says Sir John, “to aim at the rigorous
                    destruction of rays parallel to the axis, the use to which the lens is to be
                    applied must decide. In a burning-glass it is of the highest importance. A
                    slight consideration will suffice to show, that the difference of temperatures
                    produced in the foci of a double convex lens of equal radii, and one of the same
                    focal length, but of the best form, must be very considerable. In order to try
                    whether even the latter might not be improved by the shortening of the focus,
                    and the superior concentration of the exterior rays, by applying a correcting
                    lens of one of the forms above calculated, in spite of the loss of heat in
                    passing through a second glass, I procured two lenses to be figured to the radii
                    assigned in the first column of the foregoing table. They were about three
                    inches in aperture, and when combined as above described, the aberration was
                    almost totally destroyed, and probably would have been so completely had the
                    index of refraction proper to the glass been employed instead of that adopted in
                    our calculation for brevity. Their combined effect as a burning-lens appeared to
                    me decidedly superior to that of the first lens used alone, and there is
                    therefore good reason to presume, that the effect of the other construction,
                    which, with the same loss of heat, affords a much greater contraction of the
                    focus, would be still better; and I regret not having tried it in
                    preference.</p>

                    attention, as a small insect, or (when applied to astronomical purposes) if we
                    would scrutinize the appearance of a planet, a lunar mountain, the nucleus of a
                    comet, or a close double star, where extent of field is of less consequence than
                    perfect distinctness in the central point, too much pains cannot be taken in
                    destroying the central aberration.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Mr Pritchard informs us, that he has executed some of these doublets for the
                    object-glasses of compound microscopes, “for which,” he says, “they answer
                    remarkably well, but their angle of aperture is small compared with combinations
                    of double achromatics.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="italic">s Periscopic Doublet.</hi></p>
                <p>We owe also to Sir John Herschel the construction of a periscopic doublet with a
                    very large field of moderate distinctness. “In spectacles,” says he,
                    “reading-glasses, magnifiers of moderate power, and eye-glasses for certain
                    astronomical purposes, the correction of the aberration in the centre of the
                    field may be sacrificed with little inconvenience. By far the best periscopic
                    combination I am acquainted with consists of a double convex lens of the best
                    form, but placed in its worst position (radii as 6 to 1) for the lens next the
                    eye, and a plane concave whose focal length is to that of the other as 2∙6 to 1,
                    or as 13 to 5, placed in contact with its flatter surface, and having its
                    concavity towards the object, as in the annexed figure, for the farthest; yet
                    for destroying the aberration of rays parallel to the axis nothing can be
                    worse.</p>
                <p>In fact our formula gives for the aberration in this construction 22∙02, or about
                    22 times what the best single lens of equal power would give; yet, on
                    accidentally combining two such lenses in this manner, I was immediately struck
                    with the remarkable extent of oblique vision, with the absence of fatigue on
                    reading some lines with a power much beyond that of the natural eye, and with
                    the freedom from colour at the edges of the field, arising from <hi
                    rend="italic">the opposition of the prismatic refractions</hi> of the two
                    solids, an advantage which a single meniscus does not possess.” The focal length
                    of the compound lens which Sir John tried was 1 ’ 84 of an inch. The field of
                    tolerably distinct vision extended fully 40° from the axis, and the letters of a
                    book might be read, and the forms of objects distinguished, with management, as
                    far as the 75th degree. In using such a combination the lenses should be very
                    thin, and the eye applied as close as possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plano-Convex Doublet.</hi></p>
                <p>A doublet of much simpler construction, and withits spherical aberration greatly
                    diminished, has also been proposed by Sir John Herschel. It is represented in
                    the annexed figure, and consists of. two convex lenses of equal focal lengths,
                    the convex sides being placed in contact, and the eye and object opposite the
                    plane sides. In this case the aberration will be only 0∙6028. But if we make the
                    focal length of the first to that of the second as 1 to 2∙3, the aberration will
                    be reduced to 0 ’ 2481. In order to have an idea of the value of such a doublet,
                    we shall give the series of aberrations for single lenses, as investigated by
                    Sir John Herschel.</p>

                <p>As these calculations are made for glass, the advantage of such a doublet made of
                    garnet or sapphire must be much greater. In a garnet the minimum aberration
                    takes place when the form of the lens differs very little from that of
                    plano-convex; and as it is then to that of glass as 35 to 107, the aberration

                <p>The advantage of the first lens having its plane side next the object is, as Dr
                    Wollaston states, that if it should touch a fluid, the view is not only not
                    impaired, but improved, whereas a double convex lens would require to be taken
                    out and cleaned. The following excellent observations on this doublet are made
                    by Pritchard.</p>
                <p>s “Having mounted some plano-convex lenses of the relative foci named by Dr
                    Wollaston, in such a manner that the distances might be varied at pleasure, I
                    was surprised to find, that after the doublet was adjusted <hi rend="italic">by
                    trial,</hi> so as to obtain the maximum of distinctness, the distance between
                    the lenses did not accord either with the rule given by Huygens,or that of Dr
                    Wollaston. Supposing that I had not got the combination intended by Dr
                    Wollaston, I procured several doublets made by different artists, and to my
                    astonishment found they agreed with my own, and therefore presumed the doctor
                    was mistaken in the distance by the thickness of the lenses and the minuteness
                    of the space between them. The distance which appeared to me essential to obtain
                    the best effect, <hi rend="italic">is the difference of the focal length of the
                    two lenses, making a proper allowance for their thickness.</hi> The proportion
                    of the foci of the two lenses may be varied <hi rend="italic">ad libitum.</hi>
                    All that is requisite in this respect is, that the difference must be greater
                    than the thickness of the anterior lens, while it may be observed (in high
                    powers), that the greater the difference between their two focal lengths, the
                    more space will be left in front; and as this is of great practical importance,
                    they should never be less than as 1 to 3. I have made some very good ones,
                    differing as much as 1 to 6. Another advantage resulting from attending to this
                    point is, that we do not lose so much magnifying power in such combinations as
                    when the difference between the lenses is less.</p>
                <p>“The delicacy and beauty with which these doublets exhibit the structure of
                    tissues will justify my entering into some minute details respecting them. The
                    following is necessary to ensure their goodness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">First,</hi> The convex surface of each
                    lens must be <hi rend="italic">truly spherical.</hi> If this is not obtained, it
                    will be in vain to procure a good doublet, however beautifully the lenses may be
                    polished, or accurately adjusted. From this circumstance, I have found globules
                    perform very well, providing they are free from air-bubbles, which, however, is
                    rarely the case. It should be observed, that a slight scratch on their surface
                    is trifling compared to air-bubbles; for the latter not only stop the light,
                    but, by the reflection around the edges of each bubble, produce considerable fog
                    or glare. <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> The distance between the lenses is the
                    next point of importance; its adjustment is best accomplished by trial, mounting
                    the lenses in such a manner that their distance can be varied at pleasure, and
                    capable of being turned round, so as to adjust the centring. When this is
                    obtained, they should be fixed so that their distance and position cannot be
                    altered. This it is necessary to regard, as I have sometimes spent whole days in
                    re-adjusting a doublet that had been separated to examine the lenses singly. <hi
                    rend="italic">Third,</hi> The stop or diaphragm, for limiting the aperture in
                    these combinations, should be placed immediately behind the anterior lens. From
                    the difference of the situation of this stop in the various doublets I have
                    examined, it will appear that their makers did not know that the field of view
                    depended upon the plane of the stop. I have found, that when the stop is
                    situated <hi rend="italic">close</hi> behind the anterior lens, no other is
                    required, and the field is enlarged without sensibly augmenting the aberration.
                    On this account, the lenses of the finest doublet, when used singly with the
                    same aperture as combined, has so much aberration and distortion that distinct
                    vision cannot be obtained, even with the most rigid adjustment of the focus.
                    From the difficulty of procuring a flat surface, some makers have worked the
                    anterior surface of the lens next the object concave: these lenses do not
                    possess any advantage in point of performance, not even to compensate for the
                    loss of power from the negative side.”</p>
                <p>Mr Pritchard remarks, that when the lens next the object is a jewel, the
                    performance of the doublet is improved; but that he has not observed any
                    advantage when both lenses are gems. This must be a mistake; for lenses of any
                    gem, that are superior to glass ones when acting singly, must, if suitably
                    combined, be superior also when united. In proof of this, we have a garnet
                    doublet before us, executed by Mr Blackie, the performance of which, is quite
                    remarkable. The lenses are made of Elie garnets, and their convex sides are
                    placed towards each other. The radius of the smallest lens near the object is
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛th <hi rend="italic">{one seventieth}</hi> of an
                    inch, and that of the other g⅛th <hi rend="italic">{one twentieth} of</hi> an
                    inch. Its magnifying power is very high, exceeding greatly that of the
                    semi-jewel doublet made by Mr Pritchard, with a sapphire lens ∙ <hi

                    inch focus.</p>
                <p>In the experiments to which we have already referred on fluid lenses, Sir David
                    Brewster has constructed doublets, one of the lenses of which is made of glass
                    or a precious stone, and the other a fluid one, and he has been enabled to
                    increase the power of any single lens by the addition of a fluid one, till the
                    object touches the anterior surface of the object-lens. He has also made fluid
                    spheres contracted in the middle, and fluid doublets in which the centring is
                    effected by an infallible process.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pritchard</hi><hi rend="italic">'s</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Triplet.</hi></p>
                <p>Upon the same principle as the doublets, Mr Pritchard has constructed triplets,
                    the third or posterior lens having a longer focal length than the two others.
                    This combination requires much more precision in the adjustment, and more
                    attention in the centring. Mr Pritchard remarks, that, “when perfected, they
                    amply repay the pains bestowed upon them, in the accuracy with which they
                    exhibit the most difficult lined objects, though it is to be regretted that
                    neither these nor the doublets of deep power will show pleasantly cylindrical
                    bodies of large diameter, such as a large mouse or bat’s hair.” Having long made
                    use of one of Mr Pritchard’s triplets, we can amply confirm the account which he
                    has given of the excellence of this combination. MrBlackichas executed for us a
                    triplet, the centre lens of which is garnet, the posterior one of quartz, and
                    the anterior one of flat glass. It is a very powerful combination, and performs
                    admirably.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster has made triplets in which two of the lenses are fluids and
                    the third a solid, and some inwhich they are all fluids.</p>

                <p>In many of the doublets which we have already described, the chromatic aberration
                    is partially, and sometimes greatly corrected, but still not to such a degree as
                    to entitle<pb break="no" facs="nls:193819690" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9690-0037"/>

                    the art of grindino∙ and polishing small lenses, has enabled the optician to
                    execute <hi rend="italic">double</hi> and <hi rend="italic">triple</hi>
                    achromatic lenses, having a diameter so small as from ½th to <hi

                    angle of aperture of 65°. These lenses may be advantageously used where very
                    high powers are not required, or when they cannot be applied, though it is usual
                    to employ them as the object-glasses of compound microscopes, as we shall
                    afterwards see.</p>

                    lens is of course a meniscus in which the concavity predominates, as it is

                <p>Single reflecting microscopes are not much in use. They consist of a concave
                    metallic speculum of a short focal length, so that any minute body placed in its
                    focus will be seen magnified. The form of the speculum should of course be
                    parabolic. Such a microscope is principally useful for looking at one’s own eye,
                    or any part of it not far from the pupil. In these cases no image is formed, as
                    the rays enter the eye parallel.</p>

                    rubbed with it the inner circle of the ring A, so as to give it a mercurial

                <p>CHAP. II.—ON COMPOUND MICROSCOPES.</p>
                <p>A compound microscope is an instrument in which a distinct and enlarged image of
                    an object is formed by an object-glass or a speculum, and this enlarged image
                    again magnified by one or more eye-glasses.</p>
                <p>There is every reason to believe, that the earliest compound microscopes, which
                    were used by Jansen and Galileo, consisted of a convex lens for an object-glass,
                    and a concave one for an eye-glass, like the telescope which was at that time in
                    use.</p>
                <p>Fontana in 1646 used <hi rend="italic">two</hi> convex lenses; Dr Hooke <hi

                    convex sides towards each other, to give a high power and a large and flat
                    field. In 1691 Philip Bonnani<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    added to it an illuminating apparatus with two lenses.'</p>
                <p>The reflecting compound microscope was first suggested by Sir Isaac Newton, and
                    its construction varied and made more complex by Dr Barker and Dr Smith of
                    Cambridge. The simple contrivance of Sir Isaac has in modern times been greatly
                    improved by Amici, Potter, Tulley, Cuthbert, and Dr Goring, whose labours in
                    improving the microscope have been indefatigable, arid in the highest degree
                    successful. An account of these improvements will be given in this chapter.</p>
                <p>%</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Compound Refracting Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>The principle of the compound microscope with two lenses will be understood from
                    the annexed figure, where MN is a minute object placed in the focus of the
                    objectglass AB, or rather a little farther from it than its principal focus. An
                    image of this objectwill be formed atwm, at some distance behind AB, the
                    distance nA increasing as AM diminishes. The size of the image <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> will be to that of the object MN as ?zA is to AM, their distances from
                    the lens AB. If we now view this magnified image <hi rend="italic">rnn</hi>
                    through an eye-glass EF, so placed that <hi rend="italic">rnn</hi> is in its
                    principal focus, we shall again magnify it in the inverse proportion of En to
                    the distance at which the eye secs minute objects most distinctly, which is
                    about five inches. The object MN is thus doubly magnified, so that if nA is six
                    times AM, and the lens EF has a focal length of half an inch, the magnifying
                    power will be 6 × 5 -÷- ½ s≡ 60. While the lenses are the same, the magnifying
                    power may be increased to any extent by increasing the distance between the
                    lenses EF and AB, but the object becomes indistinct as the magnifying power
                    increases, so that it is not advisable to make the distance nA more than five,
                    six, or seven inches; or callingy the focal distance of the eye-glass, D = AM,
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = An, and Δ the distance at which we see objects
                    distinctly, then this magnifying power Μ will be Μ = -^∙ × -y. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi>, <hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi rend="italic">⅛</hi></p>
                <p>In this arrangement of lenses the field of view is small, and therefore we cannot
                    see the whole of many objects at one view. In order to remedy this, a large
                    lens, called the amplifying glass, is placed between the image and the
                    object-glass, as shown in fig. 20, where <hi rend="italic">nm</hi> is the image
                    formed by AB alone; but in consequence of the interposition of GH, it is
                    contracted into <hi rend="italic">νμ,</hi> and this contracted image is
                    magnified by the eyeglass EF. In order to widen the field still farther, and
                    make it flat, two plano-convex lenses have been placed at E, F, having their
                    convex sides in contact. In order to find the magnifying power when the lens GH
                    is used, we must multiply the magnifying power, as obtained by the preceding<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819703" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9703-0038"/> formula, by the
                    quantity-^-, p representing the focal ð <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> length of
                    the lens GH and L = r <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi

                <p>ò — P &lt; <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> the distance between the first and

                    third glasses</p>
                <p>Dr Goring prefers the following method of finding the magnifying power of these
                    microscopes. Measure the aperture of the object glass and call it <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> make AM = <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and having measured
                    with a micrometer scale the diameter of the usual pencil of rays before they
                    enter the eye, call it <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then <hi
                    rend="italic">a ∙.f = d</hi>: F, F being the focal length of a single lens
                    having the same power as the compound microscope. But the magnifying power <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> of a lens F is —. Hence the magnifying power Μ of the
                    compound micro-</p>
                <p>scope will be Μ = —.</p>
                <p>In accurate investigations with the microscope, the common compound refracting
                    instrument above described is of little use, and has been superseded by better
                    combinations. As it is, however, very serviceable for common purposes, we shall
                    describe one of them of the most convenient and modern construction. This
                    instrument is shown in Plate CCCLX. fig. 19, where the body of the microscope
                    and all its parts are seen. They all slide on a triangular bar S, the sliding
                    pieces having springs on one side. The three lenses within the body of the
                    microscope are shown at EF, GH, AB, as in the last figure. The object MN is
                    placed on a slider attached to the stage PQ. The reflector for illuminating the
                    field is at R, being moved by a Hooke’s universal joint at XX. A condensing lens
                    is placed at C, for increasing the light reflected from the mirror R. The body
                    of the instrument is adjusted to distinct vision of the object MN, by a rack and
                    pinion working a triangular bar at right angles to the bar S. It is often
                    thought preferable to move the stage towards the microscope, rather than the
                    microscope towards the stage; but as the motion of the stage often disturbs
                    animalcules, and may derange the position of inanimate objects, the motion of
                    the body of the microscope has many advantages. When the stage, however, is
                    moveable, it is made to consist of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> plates. The
                    upper plate, which carries the sliderholder, is secured with a screw across the
                    middle plate, which middle plate is carried across the lower stage-plate by a
                    similar motion, but in a direction at right angles to the upper plate. By these
                    movements the object can be placed in any position with regard to the axis of
                    the fixed microscope, first by turning the one screw and then the other.</p>
                <p>Some attention is requisite in adjusting the apertures of the object-glasses
                    employed. The smaller they are, the less will be the spherical and chromatic
                    aberration of the object-glass, but the less will be the light. When a
                    planoconvex lens about half an inch focus is used, its plane side should be
                    towards the object, and its aperture limited to - <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>-th of an
                    inch.</p>
                <p>A compound microscope is sometimes so constructed that it can be used as a single
                    microscope. This is done by screwing the lower end of the body round the
                    objectglass into a projecting arm at the top of the stand. When the body is
                    unscrewed and removed, a single lens or a doublet or triplet may be screwed into
                    the same place, and the moveable stage, with the slider and object, brought near
                    the single lens, just as if it had been the object-glass of a compound
                    microscope.</p>

                <p>When the compound microscope does not require to have a high power, a compound
                    object-glass of two lenses may be advantageously employed. Dr Goring<note

                    the annexed figure, where A is a plano-convex lens with its flat side next the
                    object, having its focal distance about one half or two thirds that of the piano
                    or double convex lens B. A stop D is placed in the posterior focus of the
                    object-glass A. Mr Pritchard remarks, that when the focal length of A “is not
                    less than half an inch, this combination has been employed with considerable
                    advantage, both as regards distinctness and aperture.”</p>

                <p>The improvement suggested by Mr Coddington on the eye-pieces of compound
                    microscopes is shown in Plate CCCLX. fig. 20. The object of the contrivance is
                    to fulfil the condition proposed by Huygens in his excellent telescopic
                    eye-piece, namely, to have the refraction of the pencils divided between the two
                    lenses, and to produce the greatest possible flattening of the field. Mr
                    Coddington found that the most proper form of the lenses was that shown in. the
                    annexed figure, where the two ⅛ye-glasses con sist of a meniscus A next the eye,
                    and a double equi-convex lens B, while the field-glass is composed of two
                    mensicuses C, D. Mr Coddington, however, informs us, that he “found no sensible
                    error arise from the substitution of plano-convex lenses for the
                    meniscus-glasses, which are difficult and expensive to form.” He remarks also,
                    that theory indicates “a farther flattening of the field to be made by
                    separating the eye-glasses a little, which requires the distance of the first
                    eye-glass from the field-glass to be diminished by about half as much but he did
                    not perceive any improvement arising from this alteration in practice, and
                    therefore he does not recommend the change. The object-glass which Mr Coddington
                    uses in this microscope is shown at <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> and is the grooved
                    sphere proposed by Sir David Brewster.</p>
                <p>In his treatise on the eye and optical instruments, Mr Coddington has proposed a
                    different combination for the eye-glasses and the field or amplifying-glass.
                    Supposing the distance between the object-glass and field-glass to be 1 inch,
                    and the focal length of the field and eye-glasses 1 inch each, and the distance
                    between the field-glass andnear-est eye-glass 1 inch, he finds the distance of
                    the two eyeglasses to be ½th of an inch. He finds also, “that all indistinctness
                    arising from the oblique refractions will be corrected when the field-glass is
                    convexo-convex, nearly convexo-plane, the first eye-glass convexo-convex<note

                <p>Taking another case, he supposes the distance of the object-glass from the
                    field-glass to be 2 inches, and the eye-glasses to be in contact, as in fig. 22,
                    then “it appears that for the achromatism we must have the distance between the
                    field-glass and second eye-glass 1 inch.” <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819716"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9716-0039"/>Then the field-glass must be convexo-plane nearly;
                    the first eye-glass equi-convex, and the second eye-glass a meniscus with the

                <p>Dr Goring, who examined one of the instruments constructed on these principles,
                    states, <hi rend="italic">that both the chromatic and spherical aberration of

                    beauty of the field of this microscope for extent of flatness. Now we think that
                    Dr Goring has mistaken Mr Coddington, who never pretended to correct the
                    spherical and chromatic aberration of the object-glass.<note anchored="true"

                    of the grooved sphere, which is the object-glass he uses, as reduced to very
                    small quantities, by leaving only a small channel in its axis for the passage of
                    the rays. Whatever the residual aberration may be, Mr Coddington is not
                    answerable for it, as his object was merely to make the other part of the
                    microscope good, which, according to Dr Goring, he has succeeded in doing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Compound Achromatic Microscape.</hi></p>
                <p>Although the achromatic microscope has only recently come into use as an
                    effective and superior instrument, yet it can scarcely be considered as a new
                    instrument. Every person knew that an achromatic object-glass was most desirable
                    in a compound microscope. So early as 1776 Euler proposed to employ them in
                    compound microscopes; but so late as 1821 Μ. Biot considered their introduction
                    as out of the question, from the impracticability of achromatizing lenses as
                    small as those which the microscope requires.</p>
                <p>In 1823 Μ. Selligues and Dr Goring were both occupied with the subject, the
                    former having employed MM. Chevalier, two excellent opticians in Paris, and the
                    latter Mr Tulley, to execute small achromatic object-glasses. It is to Μ.
                    Selligues, however, in so far as we can learn, that we are indebted for the new
                    and happy idea of making the object-glass consist of <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    achromatic compound lenses, each consisting of two lenses. This idea is the
                    actual source of the superiority of the achromatic microscopes; and in proof of
                    this we may state, that Professor Amici, who had early been following out the
                    old idea of a single achromatic object-glass, abandoned his attempts in 1815,
                    but afterwards successfully resumed them by adopting Μ. Selligues’ plan of the
                    superposition of several object-glasses. In Μ. Selligues’ instrument the focal
                    length of each object-glass was 18 lines, its diameter 6 lines, and its
                    thickness at the centre 6 lines. In that of Amici the focal length of each was
                    about 6 lines, and MM. Chevalier have executed them having only 2 lines in focal
                    length. More recently, however, Mr Pritchard has surpassed all these artists by
                    making them of one sixteenth of an inch in focal length.</p>
                <p>From this brief historical detail, we shall proceed to give a more minute account
                    of the lenses executed by these different individuals, for which we are indebted
                    to Mr Jackson Lister, whose able memoir on this subject is, as we shall see, one
                    of the most valuable contributions to the science of the microscope that has for
                    a long time appeared.</p>
                <p>The achromatic object-glasses of Μ. Selligues’ microscope made by MM. Chevalier,
                    consisted of a plano-concave lens of flint glass, and a double convex one of
                    crown or plate glass, with their inner curves cemented together by a mixture of
                    mastic and turpentine, to remove the reflection of the interior surfaces, and
                    prevent the introduction of dampness. Four of these lenses, of from 1½ to 1½ of
                    an inch in focal length, were made to screw before each other; so as to be used
                    either all together, or any of them individually, in the usual manner, like the
                    object-glasses of a compound microscope. The aberration of colour was thus
                    corrected in a considerable degree, but the glasses were fixed in their places,
                    with their convex sides towards the object, which is their worst position; and
                    in consequence of this, the spherical aberration was enormous, and was
                    distinctly seen, even with the small aperture to which it was necessary to
                    reduce them.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this defect, the grand idea of the combination was acquired: and
                    Μ. Chevalier having observed the mistake committed by Μ. Selligues, made them of
                    less focal length, and more achromatic; and turning the concave lens to the
                    object, he produced in 1825 an instrument far above that of Μ. Selligues. His
                    deepest glasses were four tenths of an inch in focal length; and in his first
                    microscope two such compound lenses were combined for his highest power.</p>
                <p>The date of Fraunhofer’s achromatic microscopes is not known. Many years ago the
                    writer of this article ordered an achromatic object-glass from Fraunhofer for a
                    large microscope, for the purpose of making a particular class of observations;
                    but at that time he seems not to have made any compound lenses to be combined
                    after the manner of Selligues. Mr Robert Brown<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 188.</p></note> has a
                    series of five such object-glasses, recently obtained from Utz-schneider, whose
                    focal lengths are from 1∙8 to 0∙43 of an inch.</p>
                <p>When Professor Amici visited London in 1827, he brought with him some compound
                    object-glasses, which performed very well; and Mr Lister has since learned from
                    him that he has executed a combination of 2∙7 lines in focal length, and 2∙7
                    lines in aperture, which greatly excels the former.</p>
                <p>Among the most successful improvers of the achromatic microscope we must rank Mr
                    Jackson Lister, who has discovered some curious and valuable properties of these
                    lenses that have escaped the notice of the most skilful analysts. Mr Lister has
                    investigated the subject entirely as a matter of observation, and therefore his
                    results are more likely to have a higher practical value.</p>
                <p>Mr Lister takes as the basis of a microscopic objectglass two conditions, 1. that
                    the flint glass shall be planoconcave; and, 2. that it shall be joined by some
                    cement to the convex lens. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> condition obviates
                    the risk of error in centring the two curves, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >second</hi> diminishes by nearly a half the loss of light from reflection,
                    which is very great at the numerous surfaces of a combination of compound
                    object-glasses.</p>
                <p>Now Mr Lister has found that in every such compound lens which he has tried,
                    whether the flint glass was Swiss or English, with a double convex of plate
                    glass, which has been rendered achromatic by the form given to the outer curve
                    of plate glass, the ratio between the refractive and dispersive powers has been
                    such that its figure has been correct for rays issuing from some point in its
                    axis not far from the principal focus on its plane side; and these rays either
                    tend to a conjugate focus within the tube of the microscope, or emerge nearly
                    parallel.</p>
                <p>If AB represents such an object-glass, let us suppose that it is free from
                    spherical and achromatic aberration for a ray FDEG radiating from F, then the
                    angle of emergence GEH will be about three times as great as that of incidence
                    FDI. If the radiant point is now made <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819729"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9729-0040"/>to approach the lens, the angles of incidence and
                    emergence will approach to equality, and the spherical aberration produced by
                    the two will bear a less proportion to the opposing error of the single
                    correcting curve ABC, and hence in this case the rays will be <hi rend="italic"
                    >overcorrected</hi> for such a focus.</p>
                <p>As F continues to approach the lens, the angle of incidence continuing to
                    increase, it will exceed that of emergence, which has been in the mean time
                    diminishing, so that the spherical aberration produced by the two outer surfaces
                    will recover their original proportion. When F has reached this point F'' (at
                    which the angle of incidence does not exceed that of emergence so much as it had
                    at first come short of it), the rays will again be free from spherical
                    aberration. If F" still comes nearer the lens, or is carried beyond F in the
                    opposite direction, the angle of incidence in the former case, or of emergence
                    in the latter, becomes disproportionately effective, and in either case the
                    aberration exceeds the correction, or the rays are <hi rend="italic"
                    >under-corrected.</hi> Hence Mr Lister gives the following rule.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic superscript"> t,</hi><hi rend="italic">That in general an
                    achromatic object-glass·, of which the inner surfaces are in contact, or nearly
                    so, will have on one side of it two foci in its axis, for the rays proceeding
                    from which the spherical aberration will be truly corrected at a moderate
                    aperture</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">that for the space
                    between these two points, its spherical aberration ινill be over-corrected, and
                    beyond them either way, under-corrected?</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Lister found also, “that when the longer aplanatic focus is used, the marginal
                    rays of a pencil not coincident with the axis of the glass are distorted, so
                    that a coma is thrown outwards, while the contrary effect of a coma directed
                    towards the centre of the field is produced by the rays from the shorter focus.”
                    These interesting results obviously furnish the means of destroying both
                    aberrations in a large focal pencil, and of thus surmounting what has been
                    hitherto the chief obstacle to the perfection of the ‘microscope. And when it is
                    considered that the curves of its diminutive object-glasses have required to be
                    at least as exactly proportioned as those of a large telescope, to give the
                    image of a bright point equally sharp and colourless, and that any change made
                    to correct one aberration was liable to disturb the other <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> some idea may be formed of what the amount of that obstacle would have
                    been. It will, however, be evident, that if any object-glass is but made
                    achromatic, with its lenses truly worked and cemented, so that their axes
                    coincide, it may with certainty be connected with another possessing the same
                    requisites, and of suitable focus, so that the combination shall be free from
                    spherical error also in the centre of its field.</p>
                <p>For this the rays have only to be received by the front glass B, from its shorter
                    aplanatic focus F, and transmitted in the direction of the larger correct pencil
                    FA of the other glass A. It is desirable that the latter pencil should neither
                    converge to a very short focus, nor be more than very slightly, if at all,
                    divergent; and a little attention at first to the kind of glass used will keep
                    it within this range, the denser flint being suited to the glasses of shorter
                    focus and larger angle of aperture. If the two glasses which in the diagram are
                    drawn as at some distance apart, are brought nearer together (if the place of A,
                    for instance, is carried to the dotted figure), the rays transmitted by B in the
                    direction of the larger aplanatic pencil of A, will plainly be derived from some
                    point (Z) more distant than F' <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>, and lying between
                    the aplanatic foci of B; therefore (according to what has been stated) this
                    glass, and consequently the combination, will then be spherically
                    over-corrected. If, on the other hand, the distance between A and B is
                    increased, the opposite effects are of course produced.</p>
                <p>In combining several glasses together, it is often convenient to transmit an
                    under-corrected pencil from the front glass, and to counteract its error by
                    over-correction in the middle one.</p>
                <p>Slight errors in colour may, in the same manner, be destroyed by opposite ones;
                    and on the principles described, we not only acquire fine correction for the
                    central ray, but by the opposite effects at the two foci in the transverse
                    pencil, all coma can be destroyed, and the whole field rendered beautifully flat
                    and distinct.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil.
                    Trans. 1830, p. 199.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Compound Achromatic
                    Microscopes, with Solid and Fluid Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1812, a very simple method was employed by Sir David Brewster, for making both
                    single and compound achromatic microscopes. Almost all objects are seen to the
                    greatest advantage when immersed in a fluid, even the finest test objects, such
                    as the scales of the Podura. Having placed the object on a piece of glass, he
                    put above it a drop of an oil having a greater dispersive power than the single
                    lens, or than the concave lens which formed the object-glass of the microscope.
                    The lens was then made to touch the fluid, so that the surface of the fluid was
                    as it were formed into a concave lens. Now if the radius of the outward surface
                    of this lens was such as to correct the dispersion, we have here a perfect
                    achromatic microscope, both simple and compound. The best way is to over-correct
                    the colour of the plate-glass lens by the fluid, and then to reduce the
                    dispersion of the fluid by mixing it with one of a less dispersive power. This
                    will be understood from the annexed diagram, where AB is an unequally convex
                    lens, the flattest side of which is plunged in the fluid <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> placed in a watch-glass CD. The object is placed at <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> and the dispersion of the concave surface of the fluid compensates
                    that which is produced by the lens. All errors of centring are here removed, and
                    also the loss of light at the touching surfaces of solid lenses. If AB is a
                    single microscope, the object <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will be placed in its
                    principal focus, and the emergent parallel rays will enter the eye; but if it is
                    the object-glass of a compound microscope, an image will be formed a few inches
                    behind AB, by withdrawing AB a little from <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> or placing
                    the object a little without its principal focus. We have already had occasion to
                    describe an achromatic grooved sphere, but in the process of achromatizing it,
                    the sphere loses in a very small degree its valuable property of refracting in
                    the very same manner all the pencils that enter the eye. This property, however,
                    may be preserved in the bird’s-eye sphere by the achromatic method which we have
                    now described. Let AB be the grooved sphere, and CD the watch-glass containing
                    the fluid; it is obvious that every ray which passes through the centre of the
                    sphere will enter and <hi rend="subscript"> k</hi> quit it perpendicularly,
                    without suffering any refraction? The same mode of achromatizing the sphere AB
                    may be adopted<pb break="no" facs="nls:193819742" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9742-0041"/>
                    with a solid concentric concave lens ABCD of flint-glass or other substance, or
                    the sphere may be placed between two such concentric lenses. The greater the
                    dispersion of the flint-glass, the nearer must the outer surface CD approach to
                    AB. By these means the grooved sphere may be rendered perfect, both as a single
                    microscope and as the objectglass of a compound one.</p>
                <p>The principle above described may be applied to a system of object-glasses like
                    those of Selligues’ microscope. Let A, B, E be three convex lenses, so placed at
                    the end of the tube of a compound microscope, that the highly dispersive fluid
                    in the watch-glass CD will enter between' the glasses A, B, and E. The concave
                    lenses of fluid will over-correct the three lenses A, B, aad E; but if a very
                    deep curvature on the outside of A is not sufficient to compensate this
                    over-correction, it may be effected by a suitable lens at F. If the three lenses
                    are made of the precious stones, with a high refractive power and a low
                    dispersive one, the concave fluid lenses will not over-correct them.</p>

                <p>This instrument is represented in Plate CCCLX. fig. 21, 22, 23, as fitted up by
                    Mr Pritchard. All its parts are so distinctly shown in the figures, that they
                    require no description, especially as the uses of most of the parts have been
                    described in a former chapter. Fig. 21 is a perspective view of the instrument
                    in its most convenient position for examining transparent objects by reflected
                    light. The stops and condensing illuminator, which are seen under the stage,
                    should be removed when particular objects are viewed. When test objects are to
                    be viewed by direct light, the instrument can be turned round. Fig. 22 shows the
                    position of the instrument for dissecting. The rest for supporting the hands is
                    shown at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and the large moveable stage at <hi

                    rend="italic">c</hi> by the condensing lens, is again reflected by the mirror
                    upon the object. Fig. 22 is an eye-piece; and fig. 23 represents an apparatus

                    >∣</hi></p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton seems to have been the firfet person who described a reflecting
                    microscope. He communicated his plan to Oldenburg in 1679, as shown in the
                    annexed diagram, where AB is a concave speculum, 0 the object, F the place where
                    an image of it is formed, and CD an eye-glass for magnifying it. In another
                    letter to Oldenburg, dated 11th July of the same year, he refers to another
                    improvement on microscopes, which is to “illuminate the object in a darkened
                    room, with <hi rend="italic">the light of any convenient colour, not too much
                    compounded</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>-for by that means the microscope will,
                    with distinctness, have a deeper charge and larger aperture, especially if its
                    construction be such as I may hereafter describe.” We are not aware that this
                    idea was ever further developed by its author.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Mr Potter<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh
                    Journal of Science, Jan. 1832, No. XI. p. 61.</p></note> has recently described
                    “a new construction of Sir Isaac Newton’s microscope,” principally with the view
                    of removing the difficulty of illuminating the object. His first construction
                    was for opaque objects; and in order to illuminate them, he cut a large circular
                    aperture <hi rend="italic">abc</hi> in the tube, between the object and the
                    speculum; but the light which fell on the sides of the tube occasioned a good
                    deal of indistinctness in the field of view. This defect, however, was
                    completely removed by lining all the lower parts of the tube with black velvet.
                    Mr Potter found it advantageous to concentrate the light on these objects that
                    required it, by a large lens at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> For transparent
                    objects he applied a lens, as shown at <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> Its convergent
                    beam is reflected on the object placed at the end of the wire <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> fixed to a handle A, by means of a small diagonal mirror in the axis of
                    the tube, and inclined to this axis 45°. By this means a very strong light may
                    be thrown through, and past the object. By means of moveable caps to cover the
                    opening <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi> and the lens <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> all
                    interference of foreign light is prevented; and without altering the position of
                    the object, both methods of illumination may be successively adopted. Mr Potter
                    attaches his objects to thin brass pins <hi rend="italic">α</hi> stuck into
                    wooden handles <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and these pins pass through a slit cut
                    into a small piece of cork attached to the sliding piece <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> which at the same time carries the lens <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and
                    the plane mirror, the whole of which are moved by the small arm connected to the
                    crank, as at <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> The adjustment of the object to the focus
                    of the mirror is effected by turning a nut attached to the pivot on which the
                    crank is fixed.</p>
                <p>In the microscope used by Mr Potter, he employs a speculum one inch in diameter,
                    with a focal length of 1½ inch; and he generally employs a distance of from 12
                    to 14 inches between the object and the image.</p>
                <p>This size of the speculum allows him to place an insect <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819755" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9755-0042"/>or other object of ½th of an
                    inch square in the tube, without any perceptible bad effect resulting from
                    it.</p>
                <p>When Mr Potter had adjusted the illuminators in the manner which we shall
                    afterwards have occasion to describe, he “saw quite easily what are called the
                    diagonal lines on the scale from the wing of the white cabbage butterfly, which
                    has been proposed as a difficult test object by Dr Goring; and it is such a one
                    as those who have only seen the stronger longitudinal striae or scales from the
                    wings of moths and butterflies have little idea of.” Mr Potter was also able to
                    resolve a delicate blue tissue in the web of a spider called the <hi
                    rend="italic">clubiona atrdx,</hi> into its component fibres.</p>
                <p>The great size of speculum used by Mr Potter arises from his being able to give
                    all his specula a true ellipsoidal figure, so as to remove all spherical
                    aberration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The process
                    by which he does this is fully described in the Edinburgh Journal of Science,
                    No. 12, new series.</p></note> We have in our possession t&amp;o of Mr Potter’s
                    instruments, one of them with a <hi rend="italic">spherical</hi> and the other
                    with an <hi rend="italic">ellipsoidal</hi> mirror. The quantity of light and the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Amici’s Reflecting Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>This instrument is shown in section in the annexed figure, where <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is a small ellipsoidal speculum about 1 inch in diameter,
                    and 2 <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ¾ths in focal length. The object is placed on
                    a stage <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> below the tube of the microscope, and the
                    rays which issue from it fall upon a small speculum <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    inclined 45° to the axis of the ellipsoidal speculum, in the same manner as if
                    the object had been placed in the tube as far to the right hand of the small
                    mirror as it is below it. An image of this object is of course formed in
                    the.other focus of the ellipsoidal speculum, and may be viewed by a single or
                    double eye-piece, as in other compound microscopes. Professor Amici, however,
                    uses a negative eye-piece, consisting of two plano-convex lenses A, B.</p>
                <p>The new and peculiar part of this instrument is the use of the small speculum,
                    which allows the object to be placed without the tube, and illuminated with the
                    utmost facility. Dr Goring, to whom science is indebted for the perfection of
                    the reflecting microscope, remarks, that “the instrument was turned out of
                    Professor Amici’s hands in a rough and ineffective state, owing to the concave
                    metal being of too long a focus and too small an angle of aperture, and the
                    diagonal one (or small mirror <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which was half an inch
                    in diameter) of too large a diameter, which caused it to intercept too large a
                    quantity of light from the other, leaving only a narrow rim of reflexion to
                    enter the retina, which occasioned a disagreeable nebulosity in the middle of
                    the field of view, unless the eye-glass was of great depth.”<note

                <p>Mr Cuthbert, an ingenious London optician, constructed one of Amici’s
                    instruments, the speculum having 1⅜ inch of aperture, and a focal length of 3
                    inches, and the body of the microscope being about 1 foot long. Dr Goring and he
                    having tried it on the test objects which the doctor had newly introduced, found
                    its performance quite unsatisfactory. Dr Goring, therefore, recommended that the
                    speculum should be only half an inch in focal length, and the body 4 or 5 inches
                    long. Mr Cuthbert accordingly finished a pair of metals six tenths of an inch in
                    focal length, and only three tenths in diameter. The excellent performance of
                    this instrument induced Dr Goring and Mr Pritchard to turn their attention to
                    its improvement; and, as Mr Cuthbert<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to produce an instrument of a very perfect kind.</p>
                <p>This microscope is represented in Plate CCCLXI.fig. 26, 27, where the instrument
                    is seen to rest on a tubular pillar, its body being held by a split socket. The

                <p>The metals No. 1, 2, and 3 arc those most useful for examining opaque objects.
                    No. 3 is excellent also for all kinds of transparent objects. No. 5 can scarcely
                    be used for opaque objects, as it leaves almost no space between the tube and
                    the object for allowing the latter to be illuminated. No. 6 cannot be used at
                    all for opaque objects, but is especially intended for the most difficult class
                    of transparent test objects.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Dr Smiths Reflecting</hi><hi rend="italic">Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>Having constructed one of Sir Isaac Newton’s microscopes in 1738, Dr Smith of
                    Cambridge observed that the colours of objects were much more beautiful and
                    natural than in refracting microscopes. He found that objects were very distinct
                    and sufficiently light when the microscope bad the following dimensions :—</p>
                <p>Focal length of the speculum 2½ inches.</p>
                <p>Diameter of ditto 1</p>
                <p>Focal length of the plano-convex eye-glass 2½</p>
                <p>Ratio of the distance of the object from the fo cus of the speculum to the focal
                    distance of the speculum 1 to 19.</p>
                <p>Finding that, in order to obtain a high magnifying power, the speculum required
                    to be very concave and small, he contrived another microscope with two
                    reflecting spherical surfaces of any size, but so related to each other that the
                    second reflexion should correct the aberration of the first. This instrument is
                    shown in fig. 31.</p>
                <p>Dr Smith’s microscope is shown in fig. 31, where AA is a concave spherical
                    speculum, having its polished convex surface inwards. The rays from an object o
                    placed in the slider <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will be reflected from the
                    concave speculum AA upon the convex CC, and will have a distinct and magnified
                    image of it formed before the convex eye-glass E, by which it will be magnified
                    still more. This instrument, in short, is nothing more than the Cassegrainian
                    telescope converted into a microscope, with this difference only, that in the
                    telescope distinct vision is obtained by moving the, convex mirror, whereas in
                    the microscope it is obtained by a motion of the eye-glass. Dr Smith constructed
                    one of these microscopes, which he found to perform “nearly as well, in all
                    respects, as the very best refracting microscopes ;” and the writer of this
                    article has one of them now before him, which performs wonderfully well, though
                    both the specula have their polish considerably injured. It shows the lines on
                    some of the test objects with very considerable sharpness.</p>
                <p>The following are the dimensions, &amp;c. of Dr Smith’s reflecting mirror, as
                    given by himself:—</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding the excellence of Professor Amici’s miscroscope, as constructed
                    with Dr Goring’s improvements and with Mr Cuthbert’s specula, we are quite
                    convinced that it does not owe these advantages to the peculiarity in its
                    construction which constitutes it a different instrument from Newton’s. This
                    peculiarity is in our opinion a disadvantage, and we consider the instrument as
                    recommended solely by its possessing an ellipsoidal speculum, with a large angle
                    of aperture. The only advantage which can be ascribed to Amici’s instrument is a
                    more convenient mode of illumination, though not much more so than Mr Potter’s;
                    but this advantage, whatever be its amount, is purchased at great sacrifices. 1.
                    The whole instrument is an awkward-looking piece of mechanism, with its
                    triangular bar and all its appendages dangling at one end of it. 2. It cannot be
                    used in the vertical position, which we consider a very great defect. 3. By the
                    use of the small reflecting speculum, <hi rend="italic">more, than one half of
                    the whole light is lost.</hi> 4. With small concave specula, such as those <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> θths of an inch in
                    diameter, opaque objects cannot be illuminated, as stated by Dr Goring.</p>
                <p>The construction which has been proposed by Sir David Brewster to remedy most of
                    these defects is shown in the annexed figure, where ABC is the body of the
                    instrument, which screws at its lower end C into the horizontal projecting arm
                    DE of the stand, either of the achromatic microscope or the single microscope,
                    so that we get rid of all trouble about the objects placed at <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> and their mode of illumination, as every thing concerning them is the
                    same as in other microscopes. This, we must say, is a great advantage; for
                    neither naturalists nor amateurs are disposed to purchase and use two sets of
                    the extended apparatus necessary for holding, moving, and illuminating
                    microscopic objects. At the lower end C of the body, exactly where the
                    object-glasses of the compound and achromatic object-lenses are placed, is a
                    small tube <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> at the lower end of which is placed the
                    concave speculum <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> perforated with a very small hole at
                    its centre, and with its concave surface upwards. Above it is the plane speculum
                    <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> fixed by a slender arm to the side <hi rend="italic"
                    >bd</hi> of the small tube, and having its diameter a little greater than the
                    perforation in the speculum <hi rend="italic">cd.</hi> This little tube <hi
                    rend="italic">abed</hi> screws into the arm DE, as if it were a microscopic
                    doublet or single lens; and the body ABC may <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819781"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9781-0044"/>either screw upon the outside of this tube, or,
                    what is better, upon a stronger piece of tube forming part of the arm DE. A
                    concave illuminating reflector <hi rend="italic">kh,</hi> for opaque objects,
                    may screw on the back of the speculum <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> or that
                    speculum may be made thick, and ground and polished on both sides, so that while
                    one side magnifies the objects, the other illuminates them.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, that rays proceeding from an object at <hi rend="italic">mn</hi>
                    will be reflected from the plane speculum e, upon the concave speculum <hi
                    rend="italic">cd,</hi> exactly as if the objects were placed at <hi
                    rend="italic">τ,</hi> as far above <hi rend="italic">e</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> is below it, and an image of it would be formed in the other focus of
                    the ellipsoid, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> being the one focus, if the rays were
                    not intercepted by the eye-piece AB, by which the image is farther magnified. By
                    this mode of construction, the whole of the reflecting microscope, in place of
                    having a separate stand and separate apparatus costing a large sum of money, is
                    comprehended in the little tube <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> and may be
                    considered as a reflectingobject-speculum, forming part of a general microscope,
                    furnished with single lenses, doublets, and compound ach-ro ma tics.</p>
                <p>By the means now described are removed all the defects which we enumerated as
                    belonging to Amici’s combination, except the <hi rend="italic">third,</hi> which
                    is one of such importance that it is of consequence to consider how far it is
                    capable of being remedied. Sir David. Brewster has proposed to get rid of this
                    loss of light by placing the object mn, as in Amici’s instrument, outsideof the
                    tube, but inclined to its axis, and refracting its rays upon the specu-lurci <hi
                    rend="italic">cd,</hi> by means of an achromatic prism <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>
                    in a manner analogous to his method of producing a similar effect in the
                    Newtonian telescope.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Treatise on Optics, Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopaedia, p. 3õ4.</p></note> The
                    faces of this prism are equally inclined to the axis of the microscope and the
                    axis of the pencil issuing from the point of the object under examination. As
                    the prisms of plate and flint glass which compose <hi rend="italic">e</hi> are
                    cemented by a substance of nearly the same refractive power, there will be no
                    farther loss of light than what is reflected at the two surfaces. A socket may
                    be placed at D, for holding an illuminating lens, or the little apparatus for
                    opaque objects, shown in Plate CCCLXI. fig. 27. But in order to avoid the
                    encumbrance and expense of separate stands and apparatus for this, as well as
                    Amici’s form of the instrument, we would propose that a strong piece of tube
                    should be inserted in the opening, above <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> to screw
                    into the upper side of the projecting arm, as shown in the preceding figure; or
                    a solid screw attached to the upper side of the tube, a little to the right hand
                    of C, and above the opening, might screw into the lower end of the projecting
                    arm DF. In these cases the object at <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will be placed on
                    the ordinary stage, and illuminated in the common manner; but it will be
                    necessary to have a counterpoise at D, to balance the weight of the body
                    ABC.</p>
                <p>Those who are acquainted with the principle of the Cassegrainian telescope, and
                    of Dr Smith’s compound microscope, will readily see that the reflecting
                    microscope, with the perforated speculum, may be converted into a more compound
                    reflector, analogous to Dr Smith’s, by making the little speculum <hi

                <p>The solar microscope is a well-known popular instrument, for exhibiting on a

                    by the condensed light of the sun. As the sun cannot often be commanded in our
                    climate, this instrument may be considered as having fallen into disuse; but the
                    discovery of the lime-ball light by Mr Drummond amply supplies the place of the
                    great luminary, in so far as the microscope is concerned. The instrument has
                    accordingly been revived under the name of the oxyhydrogen microscope, and is
                    now a favourite public exhibition.</p>
                <p>The solar microscope was proposed by Dr Lieberkhun in 1738; and early in 1739,
                    when he paid a visit to London, he exhibited an instrument of his own
                    construction to several members of the Royal Society, and to Mr Cuff, Mr Adams,
                    and other London opticians.</p>
                <p>This microscope is nothing more than a convex lens, in front of which, a little
                    farther from it than its principal focus, is placed a microscopic object, the
                    rays of the sun being reflected in a horizontal line, and condensed by a lens.
                    This will be understood from the annexed figure, where CD is the convex lens, E
                    the object placed before it, and AB the illuminating condenser. An enlarged
                    image of E will be formed to the right hand of CD, on a wall or screen, and the
                    size of the enlarged image will be to that of the object as the distance of CD
                    from the screen or wall is to CE, the distance of the object from the lens. Dr
                    Lieberkhun’s solar microscope had no mirror for reflecting the sun’s rays into
                    the tube, so that it could only be used a few hours, when the tube could be
                    conveniently pointed to the sun. The improvement of adding a mirror was made by
                    Mr Cuff, who constructed the instrument in a very superior manner.<note

                    vol. i. p. 22.</p></note> Dr Lieberkhun subsequently fitted up the solar
                    microscope to show opaque objects; but the method which he employed is not
                    known. Since the time of Mr Cuff, the solar microscope has undergone many
                    improvements. Mr Benjamin Martin added greatly to the value of this instrument,
                    by fitting it up both for opaque and transparent objects, in the manner shown in
                    Plate CCCLXI. figs. 28 and 29. In fig. 28 it is shown as fitted up for opaque
                    objects. The body ABCDEF has the part ABCD of a conical, and the part CDEF of a
                    tubular form. A large convex lens, corresponding with AB, in fig. 34 is placed
                    at AB, at the end of the conical tube ABCD, which screws into the square plate
                    QR, which is fastened to a window-shutter opposite a hole of at least the size
                    of the lens AB, by means of the screw e, <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Upon the
                    square plate QR there is a moveable circular plate <hi rend="italic">abc.</hi>
                    To this circular plate is attached the silvered glass mirror NOP, placed in a
                    brass frame, which moves round a joint PP, and which may be placed in any
                    position with regard to the sun, so as to reflect his rays into the tube ABCD by
                    means of rack-work and pinions at Q and R. The pinion Q moves the circular plate
                    <hi rend="italic">abc</hi> (to which the mirror NOP is fixed) in a plane
                    perpendicular to the horizon, while the nut R gives it a motion in an opposite
                    plane. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819794" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9794-0045"
                    />light introduced by this mirror falls upon the lens AB, which throws it in a
                    condensed state upon any object in the tube. But before it reaches the opaque
                    object, it is received by a mirror Μ, placed in the box HILX, which reflects the
                    condensed light back upon the face of the object E, fig. 34, next to the lens
                    CD, fig. 34. This mirror is adjusted to a proper angle by the screw S.</p>
                <p>Above the body ABEF is seen the part ∕VK which carries the sliders or objects,
                    and the object-glass or lens CD, fig. 34. The tube K slides within the tube V,
                    and V again slides into the box HILX. These tubes carry each a magnifying lens.
                    The inner tube K is sometimes taken out of the other V, seen within the box, and
                    used alone. The sliders and objects are introduced into a slit or opening at H.
                    The brass plate to the left of H is fixed to a tube A, by means of a spiral wire
                    within the tube, which presses the plate against the side of the box HILX, so
                    that the sliders, when placed in the opening, are pressed against the side of
                    the box.</p>
                <p>In using this microscope, the sun’s rays are first made to pass along the tube
                    ABCD, by the nuts Q and R. The box for opaque objects, HILX, is then slid by its
                    tube G into the tube EF. The slider containing the object, having its face to be
                    examined turned to the right hand, is then pushed into the opening at H, till
                    the object is in the centre of the tubes V, K. The condensed light falling on
                    the mirror Μ is then thrown back on the face of the object in the slider, and
                    the door <hi rend="italic">hi</hi> shut. Upon a white paper screen or cloth,
                    from <hi rend="italic">four</hi> to <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> feet square,
                    and placed at the distance of from six to ten feet from the window, the
                    observer, in the room made thoroughly dark, will see on the screen a magnified
                    representation of the object, which may be rendered distinct at different
                    distances of the screen, by pulling out or pushing in the tubes V, K containing
                    the convex lenses. As the sun is constantly moving, its rays must be kept in the
                    axis of the tubes by now and then turning the nuts Q and R.</p>
                <p>When the microscope is to be used for transparent objects, the box HI LX, with
                    its tube G, and other appendages, is removed, and the apparatus shown in fig. 31
                    substituted for it. This is done by sliding the tube Y of fig. 31 into the tube
                    EF of fig. 30. A slider containing the magnifying lens is then slipped through
                    the opening at <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and a second condenser may or may not
                    be inserted in the opening at <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> The slider with the
                    object is then placed in the opening <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and when its
                    magnified picture falls upon the screen, it is adjusted to distinctness by
                    turning the milled nut 0.</p>
                <p>The picture formed by a solar microscope being in Dr Robison’s opinion “generally
                    <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> so indistinct that it is fit only for amusing
                    ladies,” he proposed to use as an objectglass the achromatic eye-piece of four
                    lenses, constructed by Mr Ramsden for telescopes. Having made the experiment, he
                    found the image “perfectly sharp,” and recommended this application “to the
                    artists, as a valuable article of their trade.”</p>
                <p>A much simpler method, however, of correcting the defects of the microscope, is
                    to use compound achromatic lenses, which were first suggested by Mr Benjamin
                    Martin.</p>
                <p>Another mode of improving the instrument was proposed in 1812 by Sir David
                    Brewster,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Treatise on
                    New Philosophical Instruments, p. 410.</p></note> who has described a new solar
                    microscope, which can be rendered achromatic. The method of doing this is shown
                    in the diagram, fig. 34, where AB is the condensing lens, and CD the
                    object-glass, cemented firmly into one end of a tube “zCD?z, which has a tubular
                    opening at E, while the other end of the tube has a circular piece of parallel
                    glass cemented upon it. The tube wCDn is then filled with water, or any other
                    fluid; and the object, when placed upon a slider, or held in a pair of forceps,
                    is introduced at the opening E into the fluid. The mechanism for producing these
                    effects is easily conceived. By the instrument thus constructed, imperfectly
                    opaque and corrugated objects, rendered transparent, and extended by the fluid
                    medium, may be examined in this microscope, though incapable of being used in
                    any other. Objects may be even dissected in the aqueous tube. Nay, objects
                    preserved in spirits might be exhibited by immersing the bottle, if it is small,
                    in the trough or tube <hi rend="smallcaps">∞CDa,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Treatise on New Philosophical
                    Instruments, p. 401, for an account of the advantages of examining objects

                <p>But the most important purpose effected by this form of the instrument is, that
                    it can be rendered perfectly achromatic by using a fluid of higher dispersive
                    power than the glass lens CD, and making the interior curvature of the side CD,
                    which touches the fluid, of that degree of convexity which will convert the
                    fluid into a concave lens capable of correcting the colour of CD. The lens CD
                    may be made most advantageously of fluor spar, which, from its low dispersive
                    power, might form an achromatic combination with water.</p>
                <p>Although, in so far as we know, metallic’specula have never been regularly fitted
                    up as a reflecting solar microscope for use, yet every person familiar with, and
                    in the habit of using, specula and lenses, must have made the experiment of
                    forming magnified images both in solar and artificial light, with small concave
                    specula. The perfection of these images cannot be doubted; and it has often
                    appeared to us surprising that the optician did not avail himself of such a
                    combination for a solar microscope. Neither the Newtonian nor the Amician form
                    of the instrument offer facilities for this purpose. Sir David Brewster has
                    therefore proposed to employ his form of the reflecting microscope for a solar
                    and oxyhydrogen instrument. Its facilities for this purpose are very great, and
                    there can be little doubt that it will be practically successful, and will be as
                    superior to other solar microscopes as the best reflecting compound microscope
                    is to other compound microscopes. Dr Goring made an experiment with the Amician
                    microscope; but he obviously considers it as not likely to succeed, remarking,
                    that “after all that could be done, a refractor would be sure to beat it hollow;
                    therefore I shall take my leave of the subject, as I cannot conscientiously
                    recommend such an instrument.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dr Goring states, that a friend of his had constructed a
                    solar microscope with metals on the Araician principle, and without a body or
                    eye-glass, which exhibited a variety of test objects in a highly satisfactory
                    manner.</p></note> It is no wonder that this experiment failed, because Dr
                    Goring seems to have used <hi rend="italic">the whole of the Aηιician
                    microscope,</hi> eye-glasses and all, as the magnifier in the solar microscope,
                    and therefore it could not be considered as a <hi rend="italic">reflecting</hi>
                    solar microscope, being in fact as much a <hi rend="italic">refracting</hi> one.
                    The construction to which we have above referred is shown <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819807" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9807-0046"/>in the annexed figure, where
                    AB is the illuminating lens, throwing the condensed rays of the sun upon a
                    transparent object <hi rend="italic">mn.</hi> The rays from this object falling
                    upon the small speculum <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> are reflected to the deep

                    at MN on a screen at some distance behind it, distinct vision being obtained
                    either by moving the object or the speculum.</p>
                <p>For opaque objects this form of the instrument is peculiarly adapted. The
                    parallel rays of the sun falling upon the deep speculum <hi rend="italic"
                    >kh,</hi> are condensed by it and thrown on the inner face of the object <hi
                    rend="italic">mn,</hi> of which a magnified image is formed, as before, at MN. A
                    greater condensation of light may be obtained by using the lens AB, so that the
                    speculum <hi rend="italic">kh</hi> shall receive its convergent beam before the
                    rays reach their focus and complete their convergency.</p>
                <p>ìn this construction we have the disadvantage of two reflections, belonging also
                    to the Amician form ;’ but this may be considered as compensated by the image
                    being without the tube, and more under our command. Though this is true in the
                    compound microscope, yet the advantage of having the object outside the tube is
                    of less consequence in a solar microscope. To avoid therefore two reflections,
                    and two mirrors with their relative adjustments, Sir David Brewster has proposed
                    to construct the reflect ing solar microscope in the manner shown in the annexed
                    figure, where CD is the perforated concave speculum, <hi rend="italic">mn</hi>
                    the object in one of its foci, and MN the magnified image in its other focus.
                    The object <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> placed on a slider passing through an
                    opening in front of the speculum, is illuminated as an opaque object by the lens
                    AB, whose refracted rays are farther condensed by a lens placed in the aperture
                    of the speculum. This form of the solar microscope is therefore singularly
                    adapted for opaque objects; and as the whole of the effect of the instrument is
                    produced by a single reflection from a single surface, it is the simplest
                    optical instrument in existence. In order to throw light upon <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> as a transparent object, the rays must pass through it in-an opposite
                    direction from the side MN, and this may be done by the very same method given
                    by Mr Potter, and represented in fig. 29.</p>
                <p>The simplicity and practical value of this instrument will be immediately
                    recognised by comparing it with the complex opaque box, which in all solar
                    microscopes is a necessary appendage for opaque objects. See Plate CCCLXI. fig.

                    also be used like the common solar microscope in a darkened room.<note

                    formed of transparent matter. A strong framework A of wood rests upon four legs,
                    having a large hole in it, into which the instrument is fixed with two screws F,
                    F. The frame is large enough to protect the observer from the solar rays. A long
                    plane mirror B is fixed to an arm C, which moves round a pin fixed to the side
                    of the mirror frame, and also round a joint attached to a strong round wire E,
                    which slides backwards and forwards in the tube D, having a spring within, and a
                    pinching nut to fix it in its place. The inclination of the mirror is varied by
                    pulling out or pushing in the mirror, which has also another motion produced by
                    the action of the milled head G on a rack and pinion. A common illuminating

                    having a hayonet catch at L to receive the rest of the instrument, viz. the tube
                    carrying the stage and rackwork. This tube 11 moves within the conical one by
                    means of the milled head Μ and rack and pinion N. The end of this tube is
                    closed, and an ordinary slider-holder 0 is fixed to it. On the inner side of the
                    stage, near N, is fixed a condensing lens, about one and a half inch in diameter
                    and two inches in focal length, which, by means of a sliding wire passed through
                    a hole in the stage, can be moved from one side of the tube to the other, and
                    also made to approach to or recede from the stage. A second tube PPP, slit open
                    at the sides, is screwed into the tube in which the stage moves; and into this
                    tube the optical part <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is made to slide, the objectglass
                    being placed at K. Dr Goring here remarks, that “the focus may of course be
                    roughly adjusted, by sliding the body backwards and forwards in its containing
                    tube, before it is attached to the camera, fig. 31; but when this has been done,
                    it must of course remain immoveable. I look upon it,” he continues, “as a <hi

                    import of this passage; but we apprehend that the magnifier or object-glass may
                    be, nay, must be moved in any way that is necessary to produce distinct vision
                    upon the screen, whatever be its distance; and that the essential condition is,
                    that the distance of the illuminator and the object shall be invariable, the
                    object being, if possible, accurately situated in the focus, unless where a
                    slight deviation is necessary to prevent its destruction by the concentrated

                <p>The great popularity of the public exhibition made with this instrument has
                    turned the attention of opticians and amateurs to its improvement. Mr Pritchard
                    has written a long and interesting chapter of nearly fifty pages on the subject
                    of solar and oxyhydrogen gas microscopes, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Micrographia</hi> already referred to, and has given a most popular and minute
                    account of all the details of the instrument. These details, to which we must
                    refer our readers, do not belong to an article like the present; and we shall
                    content ourselves with explaining what an oxyhydrogen microscope is, and how the
                    optical apparatus of a solar microscope may be readily converted into that of an
                    oxyhydrogen one, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>An oxyhydrogen gas microscope differs from a solar one chiefly in this, that a
                    brilliant light obtained by igniting a ball of lime the ’ size of a pea (hence
                    called the <hi rend="italic">pea</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lime</hi> light, or
                    more appropriately the <hi rend="italic">Drummond</hi> light, from its inventor
                    Mr Drummond) with oxyhydrogen gas, is substituted in place of the solar rays.
                    This enables us to enjoy the amusement of the solar microscope apparatus in all
                    weathers and at all hours of the day.</p>
                <p>As the lime-ball light, however, is at our elbow, it sends forth diverging rays;
                    whereas the rays of the sun are parallel. A very beautiful principle, already
                    referred to in our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Micrometer,</hi> enables us to
                    give the simplest direction for this purpose. Let AB be the illuminating lens of
                    the common solar microscope, throwing the parallel rays <hi rend="italic"
                    >er</hi> of the sun upon the object <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> and let the whole
                    instrument be in perfect adjustment; then, without moving or changing any part
                    of it, we may convert it into an oxyhydrogen microscope, where the light
                    diverges from the lime ball L, simply by placing in front of AB another lens CD,
                    whose focal length is equal to the distance of the lime-ball light L from the
                    lens AB. The oxyhydrogen microscope will then have its objects at <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> illuminated in precisely the same way as they were by the
                    sun’s rays. The two lenses CD, AB, should be in contact, the space being left to
                    show the parallel rays <hi rend="italic">er.</hi> Now, as L is the focus of the
                    lens CD, the converging rays <hi rend="italic">er</hi> will be parallel, and
                    consequently will be refracted by AB, exactly as if they had been the rays of
                    the sun.</p>
                <p>If the instrument had been made originally as an oxyhydrogen microscope, with a
                    large and deep lens at AB, which would be required to refract rays diverging
                    from L to <hi rend="italic">inn,</hi> then we might convert the instrument into
                    a solar microscope by simply placing a <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> lens in
                    front of AB, whose focal distance is equal to the distance of L from AB. This
                    concave lens will give such a divergency to the parallel rays of the sun that
                    they will have their focus at <hi rend="italic">mn.</hi></p>

                <p>The methods of illuminating microscopic objects that have been long in use have
                    been described in the preceding chapters. They consist in throwing light upon
                    the object, either by means of a mirror or a lens, or both combined; but the
                    nature of the light employed, the magnitude of the pencil, its condition with
                    regard to parallelism, divergency or convergency, and the diameter of the pencil
                    employed, or the direction in which it falls upon the object, have never been
                    discussed as matters of science, and upon which the performance of the finest
                    instrument essentially depends.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819833" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9833-0048"/>
                <p>In so far as we know, the most important of these topics was pressed upon the
                    notice of the scientific reader by Sir David Brewster, in the year 1820; and in
                    order that the progress of improvement in this essential branch of the art of
                    making discoveries with the microscope may be understood, we shall quote his
                    observations on the subject.</p>
                <p>“The art of illuminating microscopic objects is not of less importance than that
                    of preparing them for observation. No general rules can be given for adjusting
                    the intensity of the illumination to the nature and character of the object to
                    be examined; and it is only by a little practice that this art can be acquired.
                    In general, however, it will be found that very transparent objects require a
                    less degree of light than those that are less so; and that objects which reflect
                    white light, or which throw it off from a number of lucid points, require a less
                    degree of illumination than those whose surfaces have a feeble reflective
                    force.</p>
                <p>“Most opticians have remarked, that microscopic objects are commonly seen better
                    in candle-light than in day-light; a fact which is particularly apparent when
                    very high magnifying powers are employed; and we have often found that very
                    minute objects, which could scarcely be seen at all.in day-light, appeared with
                    tolerable distinctness in candle-light. So far as we know, the cause of this has
                    not been investigated; and as it leads to general views respecting the
                    illumination of microscopic objects, we shall consider it with some
                    attention.</p>
                <p>“Let LL, fig. 38, be a single microscope placed before the eye at E, and let /be
                    a microscopic object placed in its anterior focus, and illuminated by two
                    candles at A and B. As the rays <hi rend="italic">Afa</hi> and B∕S cross at <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> the focus of parallel rays, and as the two shadows of the
                    microscopic object will be formed at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> as it were, by rays diverging from <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> the images of these two shadows formed upon the retina will coincide and
                    make only one image, so that the object <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will appear
                    perfectly distinct. If the object, however, is placed either within or without
                    the focus <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> its shadows being formed, as it were, by
                    rays diverging from a point either within or without the principal focus fi wilΓ
                    not coincide on the retina, but appear to form two images, either overlapping
                    each other, or completely separated. If, instead of two candles, A, B, we have
                    4, 5, or 6, we shall have 4, 5,-or 6 overlapping or separated images. Now, as it
                    is impossible to place the different parts of a microscopic object exactly in
                    the focus <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and as every lens has different foci for the
                    differently coloured rays, and even for homogeneous light, in consequence of its
                    spherical aberration, it necessarily follows, that when microscopic objects are
                    illuminated by light proceeding from several points, the image upon the retina
                    must consist of a number of images not accurately coincident; and hence it
                    becomes of the greatest importance that the object be <hi rend="italic"
                    >illuminated only from one point,</hi> and not from a large surface of light,
                    such as the sky, which is equivalent to an infinite number of radiant
                    points.</p>
                <p>“The following rules may therefore be laid down respecting the illumination of
                    microscopic objects, and the method of viewing them.</p>
                <p>“1. The eye should be protected from all extraneous light, and should not receive
                    any of the light which proceeds from the illuminating centre, excepting that
                    portion of it which is transmitted through or reflected from the object.</p>
                <p>“2. Delicate microscopical observations should not be made when the fluid which
                    lubricates the cornea of the observer’s eye happens to be in a viscid state,
                    which is frequently the case. See Brande’s <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> vol.
                    ii. p. 127.</p>
                <p>“3. The figure of the cornea will be least injured by the lubricating fluid,
                    either by collecting over any part of the cornea, or moving over it, when the
                    observer is lying on his back, or standing vertically. When he is looking
                    downwards, as into the compound vertical microscope, the fluid has a tendency to
                    flow towards the pupil, and injure the distinctness of the vision.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> 4. If the microscopic object is longitudinal,
                    like a fine hair, or consists of longitudinal stripes, the direction of the
                    lines or stripes should be towards the observer’s body, in order that their form
                    may be least injured by the descent of the lubricating fluid over the
                    cornea.</p>
                <p>“5. The field of view should be contracted, so as to exclude every part of the
                    object, excepting that which is under immediate examination.</p>
                <p>“6. The light which is employed for the purpose of illuminating the object,
                    should have as small a diameter as possible. In the day time it should be a
                    single hole in the window-shutter of a darkened room, and at night it should be
                    an aperture placed before an argand lamp.</p>
                <p>“7. In all cases, and particularly when very high powers are requisite, the
                    natural diameter of the light employed should be diminished, and its intensity
                    increased by optical contrivances.</p>
                <p>“8. When a strong light can be obtained, and indeed in almost every case,
                    homogeneous light should be thrown upon the object. This may be done either by
                    decomposing the light with a prism, or by transmitting it through a coloured
                    glass, which has the property of admitting <hi rend="subscript"> fc</hi> only
                    homogeneous rays.”</p>

                    illuminating objects in the solar and the lucernal microscopes.” “The great
                    defects,” says he, “which still attach to the solar and lucernal microscopes,
                    arise from the imperfect method of illuminating the objects. The method
                    suggested by Aepinus, and employed almost universally by opticians, of
                    reflecting the light concentrated by a lens upon the objects, by means of a
                    plane mirror, is good enough so far as it goes; but in consequence of the light
                    arriving from one direction only, the surface of the illuminated object is
                    covered with deep shadows, and the intensity of illumination is by no means
                    sufficient when the power of the instrument is considerable. We propose,
                    therefore, that in the solar microscope the sun’s light should be reflected by a
                    very large mirror through four apertures, A, B, C, D (surrounding the tube T),
                    each of which is furnished with an illuminating lens. The four cones, if
                    condensed, are then received, before they reach their focus, each by an inclined
                    mirror, which reflects them upon the object; the distance of the lens from the
                    mirror, added to the distance of the mirror from the object, being always less
                    than the focal length of the illuminating lens. In the lucernal microscope it
                    would be desirable to place an argand lamp opposite each of the apertures A, B,
                    C, D. By these means the light would <hi rend="italic">fall upon the surface of

                    becomes necessary, for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> reasons: 1st, Because, if the
                    focus of the illuminating lens fall exactly upon the object, it might burn it,
                    or destroy it by corrugation; and, 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> In the ordinary
                    illuminating lenses, the diameter of the focal spot, or image of the sun, is not
                    sufficient to cover the whole object, or to give a sufficient luminous field
                    around it. For these reasons it is recommended in the preceding extract to place
                    the object a little way within the focus of the illuminator, that is, between
                    the illuminator and its focus. But if the object is such that it cannot be
                    injured by the solar heat, or if the illuminator is sufficiently large to give a
                    focal spot capable of filling the field of the microscope, then the object
                    should be placed in the solar focus of the illuminator.</p>
                <p>After a lapse of nearly ten years, the subject of microscopic illumination was
                    discussed by Dr Wollaston, in his paper on the microscopic doublet, published in
                    the Phil. Trans, for 1829. This eminent philosopher, whose ingenuity never
                    failed in executing in the best manner whatever he attempted, was then on his
                    death-bed; and this, among other papers, was published without that complete
                    revision which its author would otherwise have given it.</p>
                <p>“The state of my health,” says Dr Wollaston, “induces me to commit to writing
                    rather more hastily than I have been accustomed to do, some observations on
                    microscopes; and I trust that, in laying them before the Royal Society, they
                    will meet with that indulgence which has been extended to all my former
                    communications.</p>
                <p>“In the illumination of microscopic objects, whatever light is collected and
                    brought to the eye beyond that which is fully commanded by the object-glasses,
                    tends rather to impede than to assist distinct vision.</p>
                <p>“My endeavour has been to collect as much of the admitted light as can be done by
                    simple means, to a focus in the same plane as the object to be examined. For
                    this purpose I have used with success a plane mirror to direct the light, and a
                    plano-convex lens to collect it; the plane side of the lens being towards the
                    object to be illuminated.”</p>
                <p>These two principles of illumination, the first of which is the same as the first
                    and fifth of the rules already given, though not so fully developed, and the
                    second founded upon a mistaken principle, have been carried into effect by Dr
                    Wollaston in the following manner:</p>
                <p>“T, U, B, E represents a tube about six inches long, and of such a diameter as to
                    preclude any reflection of false light from its sides; and the better to insure
                    this, the inside of the tube should be blackened. At the top of the tube, or
                    within it at a small distance from the top, is placed either a plano-convex lens
                    ET, or one properly curved, so as to have the east aberration, about ∣ths of an
                    nch focus, having its plane side next the object to be viewed; and at the bottom
                    is a circular perforation A, of about γ⅞ths of an inch diameter, for limiting
                    the light reflected from the plane mirror R, and which is to be brought to a
                    focus at α, giving a neat image of the perforation A, at the distance of about
                    ⅛ths of an inch from the lens ET, and in the same plane as the object which is
                    to be examined. The length of the tube, and the. distance of the convex lens
                    from the perforation, may be somewhat varied. The length here given, six inches,
                    being that which it was thought would be most convenient for the height of the
                    eye above the table, the diameter of the image of the perforation A must not,
                    excepting with lower powers than are here meant to be considered, exceed one
                    twentieth of an inch.</p>
                <p>“The intensity of illumination will depend upon the diameter of the illuminating
                    lens and the proportion of the image to the perforation, and may be regulated
                    according to the wish of the observer.</p>
                <p>“The lens ET, or the perforation A, should have an adjustment by which the
                    distance between them may be varied, and the image of the perforation be thus
                    brought up to the same plane as the object to be examined.</p>
                <p>“For the perfect performance of this microscope, it is necessary that the axis of
                    the lenses, and the centre of the perforation A, should be on the same right
                    line. This may be known by the image of the perforation being illuminated
                    throughout its whole extent, and having <hi rend="italic">its whole
                    circumference equally well defined.</hi> For illumination at night, <hi
                    rend="italic">a common bull’s-eye lanthorn may be used with great
                    advantage.</hi></p>
                <p>“Supposing the plano-convex lens to be placed at its proper distance from the
                    stage, the image of the perforation may be readily brought into the same plane
                    with the object, by fixing temporarily a small wire across the perforation with
                    a bit of wax, viewing any object placed upon a piece of glass upon the stage of
                    the microscope, and varying the distance of the perforation from the lens by
                    screwing its tube <hi rend="italic">until the image of the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >taire</hi><hi rend="italic">is seen distinctly at the same time with the object
                    upon the piece of 'glass.'</hi> ’</p>
                <p>In the preceding passages we have extracted every one of Dr Wollaston’s
                    observations in reference to his method of illuminating microscopic objects, so
                    that the reader will be enabled thoroughly to understand it.</p>
                <p>This method of illumination was highly commended by optical writers. Dr
                    Goring<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Microscopic
                    Illustrations, Exord. p. 1, Lend. 1830.</p></note> considered it as most
                    effective, and enumerates it among the inventions which founded a new era in the
                    history of the microscope; and he elsewhere states, that “there is no
                    modification of daylight illumination superior to that invented by Dr
                    Wollaston.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Microscopic
                    Cabinet, p. 181, Lond. 1832.</p></note></p>
                <p>The marked difference between the methods of illumination proposed by Dr
                    Wollaston and Sir David Brewster, induced the latter to publish, in 1831, a
                    paper “On the Principle of Illumination of Microscopic Objects.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh Journal of Science,
                    new series, No. AI. p. 83.</p></note> In this paper the mistake committed by Dr
                    Wollaston is clearly pointed out. The rays which Dr Wollaston throws upon the
                    object, in place of being <hi rend="italic">rays actually converged to a
                    focus,</hi> as they ought to be, are rays which diverge from a focus situated
                    between the object and the lens. He makes the focal point of the circular margin
                    of the perforation fall upon the object, without considering that the rays which
                    pass through that perforation do not diverge from it, and therefore cannot be
                    collected in the conjugate focus corresponding to the perforation. In Dr
                    Wollaston’s diagram (Phil. Trans. 1829, plate ii. fig. 1), the rays which are
                    incident on the mirror R are actually drawn as parallel rays; and it is quite
                    clear that he meant them to be parallel rays issuing from the bull’s-eye
                    lanthorn which he re <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819859"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9859-0050"/>commends. But if we suppose that a common flame is
                    used, the error is just of the same nature. It is a distinct image of the <hi
                    rend="italic">flame</hi> that should be thrown upon the object; and hence the
                    perforation A should be placed close to the flame,—the source of light and the
                    illuminated object forming the conjugate foci of the lens. After explaining this
                    principle, Sir D. Brewster adds in the same paper :—“I have no hesitation in
                    saying, that the apparatus for illumination <hi rend="italic">requires to be as
                    perfect as the apparatus for vision</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and on this
                    account I would recommend <hi rend="italic">that the illuminating lens should be
                    perfectly free of chromatic and spherical aberration, and that the greatest care
                    be taken to exclude all extraneous light, both from the object and from the eye
                    of the observer”</hi></p>
                <p>At the meeting of the British Association at York in 1831, the preceding methods
                    were communicated to Mr Potter, who was then engaged in inquiries with the
                    reflecting microscope, and who had used only the common method of illuminating
                    his objects. The effect which he obtained by it is thus described.<note

                    information on the necessity of having the focus of the illuminating lens for
                    transparent objects to fall exactly upon the object, when great nicety of vision
                    is required. Having adjusted my microscope carefully on this point (see our
                    figure, p. 41, where the object is seen in the focus of the illuminating rays),
                    I saw quite easily what are called the diagonal lines on the scale from the wing
                    of the white· cabbage butterfly, which has been proposed as a difficult test
                    object by Dr Goring; and it is such a one as those who have only seen the
                    stronger longitudinal striae on scales from the wings of moths and butterflies
                    have little idea of.” By the same means Mr Potter’s instrument “showed him
                    easily not only the striae on the scales of the wing of the small house-moth,
                    but also the diagonal lines.” Mr Potter afterwards applied his microscope, and
                    the new method of illumination, to “a much more difficult object than those just
                    referred to.” This object is the broad bluish band first noticed in the web of

                    this blue band consists of lines produced by the spider, and woven into the
                    delicate tissue. To demonstrate these fibres, however, is a work for an expert
                    microscopist, provided with a first-rate instrument. So critical a defining
                    power is required, at the same time with a large quantity of light, that I doubt
                    much whether any compound refracting microscope, even the best achromatic, will
                    ever show the construction of this web on a transparent object. When viewed in
                    this manner through good common compound microscopes, the blue band can scarcely
                    be perceived at all with a moderately high power. It is better seen as an opaque
                    object by the light of the sun, and it was on this method that I discovered it,
                    when highly illuminated and highly magnified, to be covered very regularly and
                    closely with white spots. This was sufficient information that it was of an
                    uniform texture; but as there is always in such a light a strong display of
                    irradiations and prismatic colours, it was impossible to trace the fibres. I had
                    discovered something of the texture with small globules of glass, used after the
                    manner prescribed by Leewenhoeck; but with very high powers the distinct field
                    of view is so small, that I dared hardly to pronounce decidedly upon the general

                <p>After this strong testimony to the practical utility of Sir David Brewster’s
                    method of illumination, and the unquestionable optical principles on which it is
                    founded, we were surprised to observe that Dr Goring and Mr Pritchard should, in
                    the Microscopic Cabinet, published in 1832, still recommend and use a method so
                    decidedly erroneous in theory, and founded on no optical principles whatever. Dr
                    Goring has even contrived what he calls an improved illuminator, which is just
                    Dr Wollaston’s, with a stop in the focus of the lens.</p>
                <p>As the progress of discovery with the microscope must depend upon the scientific
                    illumination of the objects under examination, we shall proceed to describe, in
                    detail, the method of illumination used by Sir David Brewster. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> be the plane surface on which the object rests accurately
                    perpendicular to the axis of the lens, lenses, or mirrors, which constitute the
                    microscope. Let PQRST be a tube from one and a half to two inches long, and
                    wholly lined with black velvet.</p>
                <p>This tube has an opening at ST, and must be so attached by an universal joint, or
                    any analogous contrivance, to the slider-hold-≈ er, that the axis FL of the tube
                    can be inclined at any angle to the surface <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> from 90°,
                    its general position, to 60° or less, as circumstances may require. It should
                    also have a circular motion about its axis, in order that the inclination may be
                    made in any azimuth. A doublet AB, CD, of no aberration, and having a focal
                    length of from half an inch to an inch, is then placed in the tube, with a rack
                    and pinion, or any other adjustment, to bring its focus for parallel rays F, or
                    its conjugate focus for diverging rays, accurately to a point in the plane <hi

                    A short way below it is placed a metallic speculum (not a silvered glass one),
                    which receives parallel or diverging rays, entering the tube at ST, and reflects
                    them upon the doublet ABCD. This speculum should be of pure virgin silver,
                    notwithstanding its liability to tarnish, and should be wrought with the same
                    care as the plane speculum of a Newtonian telescope; or it might be a
                    rectangular prism of good homogeneous glass, acting by total reflection. This
                    part of the illuminator forms part of the microscope.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>If the axis of the microscope is placed
                    horizontally, or even with some obliquity, we may dispense with this speculum
                    altogether, and direct the tube at once to the illuminating flame.</p></note>
                    The other part of the illuminator, which is detached, is no less essential. It
                    consists of the flame S, which should be as bright and small as will give the
                    necessary quantity of light after condensation. As close to it as possible is
                    placed a stand for holding a screen, with different circular apertures, and a
                    variable rectilineal aperture. If a stronger light is required than can be
                    obtained from the plane S, its light must be condensed into a parallel beam SL,
                    by another doublet of no aberration, A'B'C ʹ D', the flame S being in its
                    anterior focus.</p>
                <p>The illuminator, as now described, is adapted to homogeneous light, either as
                    obtained from a monochromatic lamp, or by means of coloured glasses, or from the
                    prismatic spectrum; but if we employ common light, the doublets ABCD, A'B'C'D'
                    must be achromatic. We have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819872"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9872-0051"/>mentioned above a variable rectilineal aperture.
                    This is a most essential accompaniment for giving perfection to the vision of
                    lined objects. The aperture should be made to form every possible angle with a
                    vertical line, and should be opened and shut by means of a screw, till as much
                    light is introduced as is necessary to obtain a perfect view of the object. The
                    image of the slit, which is close to the flame, must be thrown upon <hi
                    rend="italic">mn,</hi> so as to be parallel with the lines of the object. When
                    the objects are circular, circular apertures are preferable to any other.</p>
                <p>We have already stated that no light should reach the eye, either from the field
                    of the microscope, or any other source. For this reason it would be desirable to
                    have circular and rectilineal apertures of different sizes, to be placed
                    immediately beneath <hi rend="italic">rnn,</hi> so as to allow no part of the
                    field to be seen, excepting that which is occupied by the object or part of it
                    under examination.</p>
                <p>The above apparatus being provided, let us suppose that the observer is called to
                    examine some structure very difficult to be resolved, such as the blue band of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Clubiona</hi><hi rend="italic">atrox,</hi> or the
                    structure and nature of the lines on test objects. We omit at present the
                    consideration of the preparation of the object and the eye of the observer, and
                    also the nature of the light which he is to use, as these will be separately
                    considered; and confine ourselves to the use of the illuminator. The object is
                    first placed on a piece of thin colourless parallel glass, or film of topaz or
                    sulphate of lime, near its middle, and the microscope is directed to it, so that
                    it can be seen distinctly in the ordinary way. Put the illuminator in its place,
                    and set the proper aperture close to the small plane. Adjust the doublet ABCD by
                    its screw or pinion till a distinct image of the aperture GH is seen in the
                    field; and, by means of the apertures below <hi rend="italic">mη,</hi> any
                    strong or unnecessary light may be still more completely excluded. If the
                    structure is not rendered sufficiently distinct by this process, it will be
                    proper to try the effects of oblique illumination, by inclining the axis FL of
                    the illuminator to the plate <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> and observing carefully
                    the effects which it produces in different azimuths. If all these means are
                    insufficient, we must have recourse to new auxiliaries,—to monochromatic light
                    if the microscope is not achromatic, or to monochromatic illumination if it is
                    achromatic; and we must prepare both the eye and the object, the one for
                    exhibiting and the other by viewing to the best advantage the structure which we
                    are anxious to develope. These important topics we shall treat in their order,
                    with as much brevity as possible.</p>
                <p>CHAP. V. ON THE MONOCHROMATIC ILLUMINATION OF MICROSCOPIC OBJECTS.</p>
                <p>If a simple and easily applied system of monochromatic illumination, that is, of
                    illuminating objects with homogeneous light, which a prism, and consequently a
                    lens, is not capable of dispersing or refracting in different directions, could
                    be contrived, we should never again hear of compound achromatic microscopes. We
                    believe it will be admitted, that in Sir John Herschel’s doublet of no
                    aberration, the spherical aberration is more completely corrected than in any
                    double or even triple achromatic object-glass. Hence it follows, that in
                    homogeneous light such a doublet would be a better microscope than the compound
                    lens. But in the best system of achromatic compensation that can be executed,
                    the secondary spectrum still remains without a remedy; and hence the doublet of
                    no aberration, in which there can be no secondary colour in homogeneous light,
                    must be a superior instrument to the compound achromatic lens. Now, in
                    telescopes it is impossible, except in viewing the sun’s disc,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A solar telescope should
                    never be an achromatic one, but should consist of a compound lens of no
                    aberration, all the colours of the spectrum being corrected by the dark
                    glass.</p></note> to work with homogeneous light; but in microscopes, where the
                    quantity of light is in our power, it is perfectly practicable to make that
                    quantity so great that all the yellow or red rays which it contains may give
                    sufficient light for microscopical observations. This insulation of homogeneous
                    light may be effected in two ways; <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >st,</hi> by a monochromatic lamp, as proposed and constructed by Sir David
                    Brewster; <hi rend="italic superscript"> c</hi><hi rend="italic">½dly,</hi> by
                    the absorption of coloured media; and, 3<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> by the
                    prism.</p>
                <p>The monochromatic lamp is shown in the annexed figure, where AB is a lamp having
                    its globe A filled with diluted alcohol, which descends gradually through the
                    tube C, into a thin platina or metallic cup, in which it burns. A strong heat is
                    kept up by a spirit lamp L enclosed in a dark lanthorn, and when the diluted
                    alcohol is inflamed, it will burn with a fierce and powerful yellow flame. If
                    the flame should not be perfectly yellow, or rather of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >nankeen</hi> colour, owing to an excess of alcohol, a small proportion of salt
                    thrown into the cup D will have the same effect as a farther dilution of the
                    alcohol. Sometimes a little blue light will be found mixed with the yellow, but
                    this may be easily absorbed by a piece of yellow glass placed on any part of the
                    microscope through which the rays pass. Although this light is feeble compared
                    with that of white flames, yet, by using larger lenses for condensing it, it is
                    quite easy to obtain a pencil sufficiently powerful for all microscopic
                    observations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh
                    Transactions, vol. ix. p. 435.</p></note></p>
                <p>A stronger flame may be produced by using a gas lamp, or, what is still better, a
                    portable gas one containing compressed gas. This gas, when rushing out in a full
                    stream, explodes when burned with atmospheric air, emitting much heat, and a
                    faint bluish and reddish light. As the force of the issuing gas is sufficient to
                    blow out the flame, a contrivance for sustaining it becomes necessary. The
                    method which we contrived for this purpose is shown in the annexed figure, where
                    PQ is the main body of the lamp, MN the principal burner, and A the screw which
                    opens the main cock. A small gas tube <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi> communicating
                    with the main burner, terminates above the burner, and has a short tube <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi> moveable up and down within it, but so <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819885" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9885-0052"/>as to be gas light. This tube
                    <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> closed at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> communicates with
                    the hollow ring <hi rend="italic">fg,</hi> in which four apertures are
                    perforated so as to throw their jets of gas to the apex of a cone whose base is
                    <hi rend="italic">fg.</hi> When the gas is made to issue from the burner Μ, it
                    rushes also into the tube <hi rend="italic">abcdg,</hi> and issues in four small
                    flames at the apertures in the ring <hi rend="italic">fg</hi>; and the height of
                    these flames is regulated by the stopcock at. <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The
                    explosive mixture of air and gas which rushes up through the ring is sustained
                    in combustion by these small flames, through which it passes. A broad collar,
                    made of coarse cotton-wick, and thoroughly soaked in a saturated solution of
                    common salt, is fixed on a ring <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and when the bluish flame of the explosive mixture rises above <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> it will be converted by the salted collar into a strong mass of
                    homogeneous yellow light. A hollow cylinder of sponge, with numerous projecting
                    tufts, may be substituted for the cotton collar, or a collar of asbestos cloth
                    might be used, and supplied from a capillary fountain containing a saturated
                    solution of salt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Edinburgh Journal of Science, new series, No. I. p. 108.</p></note></p>
                <p>When the few blue rays which sometimes mingle themselves with this yellow light
                    are absorbed, every part of the light will be found to have a definite
                    refrangibility greater∙ than any other artificial light that can be produced.
                    The minutest objects, and the smallest type, will appear perfectly distinct in
                    this light when seen or read through the largest possible angle of the greatest
                    dispersive prism, an irrefragable proof of the perfect homogeneity of the
                    light.</p>
                <p>2. The second method of producing homogeneous light, and by far the simplest and
                    most easily applicable to microscopes, is that of absorption; and the best rays
                    to leave unabsorbed or insulated are the red. It requires some experience and
                    scientific knowledge of the action of different absorbing media to select those
                    which will leave the <hi rend="italic">narι'owestandbrightestband</hi> of the
                    <hi rend="italic">red</hi> space in the spectrum. We have now under our
                    microscope (a grooved sphere of garnet executed by Mr Blackie<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This sphere, which we have
                    already mentioned, is made of the purest garnet, and is executed in the most
                    admirable manner; and though we cannot say that we see any defect in it, yet if
                    the groove were still deeper, both its spherical and achromatic aberration would
                    be diminished.</p></note>), two scales of a moth lying in sulphuric acid, and
                    covering each other. With solar light the spaces between the lines glitter with
                    all the hues of the rainbow; but when a thickish plate of red mica is combined
                    with another plate of red glass, and placed beneath the object, all these
                    colours instantly disappear, and a perfection of vision is obtained, which can
                    be disturbed only by the very small portion of spherical aberration which must
                    exist in the sphere, and which an increased depth of the groove would render
                    almost insensible. Blue glasses, and green and yellow, as well as coloured
                    fluids, may be successfully used in narrowing the range of refrangibility of the
                    red space.</p>
                <p>3. The third method, or that of prismatic refraction, is perhaps the surest and
                    the best method, of obtaining homogeneous light with the smallest extent of
                    refrangibility. A certain effect may be produced by small prisms; but in order
                    to have a perfect apparatus, the <hi rend="italic">microscope should form part
                    of the apparatus for examining the lines of the solar spectrum;</hi> that is, it
                    should screw into the eyepiece of the telescope, in front of the object-glass of
                    which is placed a fine large prism, for forming the spectrum within the
                    telescope. By this method, which we have put to the test of experiment,
                    microscopical observations can be carried on with an accuracy and satisfaction
                    which nothing can exceed. We enjoy the luxury of perfectly monochromatic vision,
                    which the most perfect achromatic compensation cannot give; and while we have
                    the spherical aberration corrected, we have no secondary colours, and none of
                    the imperfections of vision which must arise in transmitting light through six
                    or eight lenses of plate and flint glass.</p>
                <p>Although we hope that the scientific reader will admit that the preceding views
                    are ‘demonstrably correct, yet Dr Goring has pronounced a most unfavourable
                    opinion of the system of monochromatic illumination.<note anchored="true"

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Page 73.</p></note> We shall
                    therefore again examine his objections in their order, as they obstruct the
                    progress of improvement among those who justly admire Dr Goring’s ingenuity and
                    knowledge in every thing which relates to the microscope.</p>
                <p>1. Dr Goring’s first objection to monochromatic illumination is, that it is too
                    weak, and must be about one seventh of the whole beam of light. This we are not
                    disposed to dispute; but Dr Goring is too well acquainted with the resources of
                    optical science, to forget that this monochromatic seventh of a beam of light
                    may be made <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> times more intense than the whole beam.
                    The objection, however, does not apply to the solar spectrum, for one seventh of
                    the sun’s light is too intense for any eye to bear.</p>
                <p>2. The second objection of our author is, that the colours of the spectrum, when
                    separated by the prism, are actually separated into different colours when they
                    are refracted in oblique pencils by a microscope. If this observation is
                    correct, then we must denounce the prism that produced such a spectrum as
                    utterly useless. Dr Goring, however, conceives his observation and his prism to
                    be good, and endeavours to explain the result by referring to Sir David
                    Brewster’s analysis of the spectrum, in which it is shown that white light
                    exists at every point of it; but this white light, which has been rendered
                    visible by absorption, cannot be decomposed by refraction of any kind, as it
                    consists of red, yellow, and blue rays, of the same refrangibility. Such white
                    light is the light that is wanted for the microscope; and there can be little
                    doubt that absorptive media will yet be discovered to effect its insulation in
                    sufficient quantity for practical purposes.</p>
                <p>3. Another objection to monochromatic light is, that it will not show the real
                    colours of microscopic bodies. This is true; but the object of the microscope is
                    not to find out colours, but structures. A common glass lens, with common light,
                    will let the observer have all that he wants of the colours of objects; and when
                    he has learned this, he will then gladly avail himself of coloured light for
                    more important purposes. We can truly say, that though we have wrought with the
                    microscope for thirty years, we do not at present recollect a single case where
                    we required to know any thing of the precise colours of minute bodies.
                    Notwithstanding this discussion, Dr Goring concludes his chapter with the
                    following observation, in which we entirely concur. “A monochromatic light,
                    therefore, being once obtained <hi rend="italic">in a sufficient state of
                    intensity for practical purposes,</hi> bids fair to conduct us to the highest
                    perfection of which aplanatic object-glasses and magnifiers are susceptible.” It
                    may be proper to add, that the best system of compound achromatic object-glasses
                    now in use would be freed of all their secondary colours, by using monochromatic
                    light; and they may be also greatly improved by employing suitable coloured
                    media to absorb what are called the outstanding rays in an achromatic
                    combination.</p>

                <p>CHAP. VI.—ON THE PREPARATION OF THE OBJECT AND THE EYE FOR MICROSCOPICAL
                    OBSERVATIONS.</p>
                <p>In using lenses of short focus, either singly or in doublets and triplets, the
                    object is so near the lens, and its thickness, even when very small, forms’such
                    a considerable part of its distance from the nearest refracting surface, that
                    any bend or want of flatness in the object completely interferes with the
                    distinct vision of its parts. When the object will bear pressure, the best way
                    is to lay above it a thin transparent film, with perfectly parallel and polished
                    surfaces, such as a splinter of New Holland topaz, a thin plate of sulphate of
                    lime, or a film of mica. If these plates are a little less thick than the
                    distance between the lens and the object, a little bees-wax should be interposed
                    between the" brass setting of the lens and the plate, so that the lens in the
                    act of adjustment would press the wax against the plate, and the plate against
                    the object, till distinct vision is obtained. The object should be placed upon a
                    deeply curved concave surface.</p>
                <p>The proper flattening of the object, when it is tender, may be effected by
                    pressing a thick balsam above it, and allowing the lens to dip into the balsam.
                    If the surface of the lens is flat, its magnifying power will suffer no
                    diminution.</p>
                <p>When grooved spheres are used, such as the garnet one above mentioned, the object
                    requires to be very near its surface. It should therefore be placed in a concave
                    lens of glass, of a little greater radius than the sphere, and pressed into the
                    concave form by interposing a narrow strip of a thin film of mica, and, if
                    necessary, pieces of wax or India-rubber, as before; the pieces filling up the
                    space between the lens and the mica, so as not to interfere with the part of the
                    object under examination.</p>
                <p>If a diminution of the magnifying power can be permitted, a fluid maybe placed
                    between the concave object-plates and the grooved sphere, and the chromatic
                    aberrati on greatly reduced. By the interposition of a fluid a grooved diamond
                    sphere may be used; for though its focus for parallel rays falls within the
                    sphere when the refractions are made from air and into air, yet when the first
                    refraction is made from a suitable fluid, the focus will fall without the
                    sphere.</p>
                <p>When the object is put into the best possible condition for observation, and the
                    illuminator applied in the best possible manner, the observer will have every
                    advantage in his researches; but still the structure which he seeks to develope
                    may escape his eager research. Under these circumstances, he must perform his
                    part of the observation in the best possible manner.</p>
                <p>Unless particular arrangements are made by the observer for his own comfort,
                    there is no bodily fatigue to be compared with that of the use of the
                    microscope. The eye, the mind, and the whole frame, are on the stretch. The
                    observer must therefore first try if his own eye is in a right state for
                    observation. The fluid which lubricates the cornea, which must be considered as
                    a lens, and as part of the microscope, is sometimes in such a viscid state, that
                    when the eyelids roll over the cornea by that beautiful provision of nature by
                    which it is kept smooth and clean, the lubricating fluid, which is pushed into a
                    ridge between the eyelids, does not quickly recover a convex surface. This state
                    of the cornea is incompatible with delicate microscopic observations, and its
                    existence may be ascertained by viewing the expanded image of a luminous point
                    held close to the eye, and, after shutting the eyelids and again opening them
                    slowly, observing if the luminous disc recovers its uniform luminosity quickly
                    or slowly. If the luminous line produced by the fluid accumulated between the
                    eyelids continues to be visible, and the general surface mottled and spotted,
                    the lubricating secretion should be excited by exposing the eye to the vapour of
                    hartshorn, raised by pouring a few drops on the surface of boiling water. The
                    secretion will now flow copiously, the cornea will be swept clean by the purer
                    and less viscid fluid, and the vision of the observer greatly improved. But this
                    moveable fluid surface of the cornea generates another imperfection of vision,
                    which has already been referred to. This fluid, when undisturbed by the eyelids,
                    descends by the influence of gravity in vertical lines, and the minute ridges
                    thus formed obliterate and render indistinct all horizontal lines seen by the
                    eye, but have a tendency rather to improve the vision of vertical lines. In
                    proof of this, we may state the unquestionable fact, that if we take a striped
                    pattern of any fabric, and bend part of it into a horizontal direction, while
                    the rest remains vertical, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> the vertical
                    part will always appear the most distinct. Hence, in viewing lined objects, when
                    the position of the observer’s head is either vertical or oblique, the lines of
                    the lined object should be always placed parallel to the direction of the
                    descending fluid. If the axis of the lenses is vertical, and the eye looks
                    downwards, the lubricating fluid will collect irregularly at the apex of the
                    cornea, and injure vision. If the axis of the lenses is horizontal, and the
                    observer’s head in its natural position, the fluid will descend in vertical
                    lines; but if the observer lies on his back and looks into the microscope
                    upwards, a position, we admit, not favourable for research, the fluid will flow
                    equally in all directions from the apex to the margin of the cornea, and leave a
                    clear centre well fitted for distinct vision. We may here notice the beautiful
                    contrivance, not mentioned by natural theologians, that the effect of vertical
                    descent of the lubricating fluid is counteracted by the eyelids opening
                    horizontally, and consequently effacing the tendency of the fluid to form
                    vertical currents. Had the eyelids opened vertically, the vertical ridges would
                    have been increased, and vision greatly impaired.</p>
                <p>When every thing has been done to fit the <hi rend="italic">cornea</hi> (the only
                    part of the eye over which we have any direct command) for accurate vision, the
                    general state of the health, or any casual irregularity of diet, will be
                    sometimes found to affect the state of the organ, and unfit it for nice
                    observation. To remedy'this defect of vision, we must refer the patient to the
                    simplest prescriptions of his physician.</p>
                <p>When these precautions have been taken, the observer must protect his eye from
                    all extraneous light; and the most effectual way of doing this is to use the
                    snow spectacles of the Greenlanders, which are cut out of wood so as to exclude
                    all light whatever, except what enters through a circular aperture the size of
                    the pupil, and directly in front of it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the snow spectacles a long narrow slit is used to enable
                    the wearer to look on each side of him. An interesting account of the great
                    value of these spectacles, by the celebrated Professor Blumenbach, will be found
                    in the Edinburgh Phil. Journal, vol. viii. p. 261.</p></note> A cast should be
                    taken in plaster of Paris from the part of the face to which they are to be
                    applied, to enable the artist to cut them of a proper shape; and when finished
                    they should be lined with black velvet.</p>
                <p>The last requisite for accurate microscopical observation is steadiness in the
                    microscope, and a steady and comfortable position for the observer. The first is
                    easily attained. The second may be accomplished by the observer resting his
                    doubled arms upon a stool or frame nearly the height of the eye-glass of the
                    microscope, but unconnected with it, while his chin rests either upon his arms
                    or upon his breast.</p>
                <p>When all these means and precautions fail in unravelling a mysterious structure,
                    we have often derived advantage, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819911"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9911-0054"/>in the case of lined objects, by looking through
                    cylindrical lenses or good prisms; the length of the cylinder, or the refracting
                    edge of the prism, being at right angles to the lines. Narrow slits may also be
                    used with advantage next the eye; but in all these cases, while we improve and
                    give a finer definition to the lines and the spaces between them, we deteriorate
                    vision for other parts of the structure.</p>
                <p>CHAP. VII. ON TEST OR PROOF OBJECTS FOR TRYING THE</p>
                <p>PERFORMANCE OF MICROSCOPES.</p>
                <p>This class of objects, and their application to the microscope, we owe to Dr
                    Goring; and to their introduction we must ascribe much of the rapid improvement
                    which this instrument has undergone. The finest test-objects are the scales of
                    butterflies and moths, which were suggested to Dr Goring by the following
                    passage in Leewenhoeck. “If we examine the wings of this creature (the silk-worm
                    moth) by the microscope, we shall find them covered with an incredible number of
                    feathers (scales), of such various forms, that if an hundred or more of them
                    were to be seen lying together, each would appear of a different shape. To show
                    more clearly this wonderful object, I caused eight feathers to be delineated,
                    for I do not remember that I ever saw them of so curious a make in any flying
                    insect.</p>
                <p>“Although the microscope, by which these feathers were drawn, represented objects
                    very distinctly, <hi rend="italic">the limner could not through it see the ribs
                    or streaks in each feather until I pointed them out to him</hi>; therefore, I
                    put into his hands a microscope which magnified objects almost as much as that
                    by which the silk worm’s thread was drawn, desiring him to give the figure of
                    that feather which through it he could see the most distinct.”<note

                    63.</p></note></p>
                <p>From this passage, Dr Goring naturally inferred, that there were some peculiar
                    properties in the lines on the feathers and scales of insects, which rendered
                    them more difficult to be discovered than other microscopic objects; and hence
                    he discovered their properties as <hi rend="italic">test</hi> or proof objects
                    for trying the penetrating powers of microscopes. Mr Pritchard regards the <hi
                    rend="italic">penetrating</hi> power of a microscope as dependent on its angle
                    of aperture, and its <hi rend="italic">defining</hi> power as in the inverse
                    ratio of the quantity of chromatic and spherical aberration. When the angle of
                    aperture was less than a certain quantity, he found that the lined structure of
                    the scales could not be rendered visible, however perfect the instrument was.

                    interesting objects:</p>

                <p>In some of the preceding figures of the lined proof objects the reader will
                    perceive diagonal or oblique lines, as in fig. 9, 10, different from the
                    longitudinal ones seen in fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. These lines are reckoned more
                    difficult to be seen than the longitudinal ones; and Dr Goring has mentioned
                    those on the scales of the white-cabbage butterfly as a difficult test object.
                    Mr Potter, who has seen these diagonal lines, mentions also his having observed
                    them on the scales of the wing of the small housemoth. As the nature of these
                    oblique lines is far from being understood, and as their real existence is in
                    our opinion questionable, we shall lay before our readers Mr Pritchard’s
                    observations on those observed in the scales of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Podura</hi><hi rend="italic">plumbea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pieris
                    brassica.</hi></p>
                <p>“In the foregoing account,” says he, “of the different scales from the wings and
                    bodies of insects, the design has been to give their <hi rend="italic"
                    >appearances</hi> under microscopes or engiscopes without in the least
                    determining their actual structure. When it is considered that these lines are
                    less than the twenty thousandth of an inch distant, it must be allowed there is
                    some difficulty in accurately determining their construction. The Morpho
                    menelaus and Lepisma saccharina are of sufficient size to distinctly perceive
                    they are composed of two delicate tissues with longitudinal cords (probably
                    tabular) disposed between them; but in the two delicate ones, the subject of
                    these remarks, we perceive other systems of }ines disposed obliquely; and as
                    they are extremely delicate, it becomes à question whether they actually exist,
                    or whether they are appearances produced under certain modifications of the
                    illumination. As there is only one set shown at a time, and I have never been
                    able to see them in the decided way of the longitudinal lines, I have been
                    induced to consider them as appearances only, and not real lines. To determine
                    this point, it became necessary to ascertain the cause that would produce such
                    an effect; and it immediately occurred to me that these oblique lines were
                    occasioned by the disposition and pressure of the superambient scales, in the
                    same manner as the watering or wavy appearance communicated to-corded silks and
                    moreens by the pressure of two pieces passed between rollers.<note

                    interesting observations on lined objects, of which it is necessary to give some
                    account. In order to explain the effects of aperture on lined objects, he has
                    represented in the <hi rend="italic">seven</hi> circles shown in fig. 23, Plate
                    CCCLXII. the different appearances of a portion of the scale of the <hi

                    aperture. He used a triple achromatic object-glass nine tenths of an inch focus,
                    and half an inch in aperture, with a negative eye-piece of one fourth of an
                    inch.</p>
                <p>No. 1. shows the appearance of the scale when the aperture was one tenth of an
                    inch, not a vestige of lines being visible.</p>
                <p>No. 2. Aperture three twentieths; Dr Goring fancied he saw indications of lines
                    or scratches.</p>
                <p>No. 3. Aperture one fifth; traces of irregular scratches seen.</p>
                <p>No. 4. Aperture three tenths; nascent lines recognised by a practised eye, like
                    an aggregation of dots, but interrupted and broken.</p>
                <p>No.5. Aperture four tenths; the lines resolved, but not fairly. They are very
                    faint, and seem rugged, as if still composed of dots and points.</p>
                <p>No. 6. Aperture five tenths; the full aperture of the lens. The lines appear in
                    their true character, as if drawn by a pen with some blue pigment on
                    light-violet coloured paper.</p>
                <p>No. 7. Same aperture. When the object is turned one fourth round, the cross
                    striae become perceptible.</p>
                <p>Our limits will not permit us to give Dr Goring’s excellent observations on the
                    lines of the <hi rend="italic">Pontia brassica,</hi> as seen also with apertures
                    of different sizes in a reflecting microscope. With a well-figured metal, three
                    tenths of an inch focus, and an angle of 55½° aperture, the lines and cross
                    striae he found never to be resolved into dots and points, but to appear in what
                    he supposes to be their proper character. “The two sets of diagonal lines,” he
                    remarks, “will be shown with a force and effect which will leave no doubt of
                    their existence in the mind of a candid observer; the various lines, the
                    longitudinal, the cross striae, and the two sets of diagonals, being all
                    observable <hi rend="italic">successively</hi> by a slight change of
                    illumination, though we can scarcely see two of the systems well at the same

                    one instrument shows the lines dotty, broken, interrupted, or ragged, while
                    another shows them clearly made out as veritable lines or stripes drawn with a
                    pen and ink, the latter is the best.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Notwithstanding these repeated decisions of Dr Goring, he seems, in an earlier
                    part of his volume,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Micrographie!,</hi> p. 44.</p></note> to have had some misgivings
                    on the subject. In speaking of the lined tests, he says, “<hi rend="italic"
                    >There is an inexplicable mystery about them, for if their lines are in reality
                    pι oduced on the same principle as those of micrometers, why are they not as
                    easily seen</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> No penetrating power or large angular
                    aperture is requisite to bring out the lines on a micrometer, though divided
                    nearly as finely as ordinary tests, to the extent perhaps of 10,000 in an inch.”
                    These observations are just and philosophical, and we would add only a single
                    observation in support of them, that Dr Wollaston made platina wires the
                    18,000th of an inch in diameter, and saw them distinctly; and we venture to say,
                    that in no instrument whatever would such lines appear either dotted or
                    ragged.</p>
                <p>Such was the state of this subject when these lined objects were examined by Sir
                    David Brewster, both in reference to their action upon light when examined by
                    the naked eye, and when placed under the microscope as test objects. Having been
                    occupied for several years in a series of analogous observations on the lines
                    which apparently separate the component fibres of the crystalline lenses of
                    animals, he was familiar with the class of optical illusions which interfere
                    with the accurate development of such structures.</p>
                <p>Upon exposing the finest lined objects to a bright light, and excluding as much
                    as possible all other extraneous rays, he saw distinctly the fringes of colour
                    produced by inte rference; and on measuring the angular distances of the first
                    red fringe from the light, he found that the distance of the lines, or rather
                    the diameter of one black line and half the bright space between the lines,
                    varied from the 10,000th to the 22,000th of an inch. Hence, if we take the black
                    lines and their intervals to be equal, the diameter of each will vary from about
                    the 13,000th to the 29,000th of an inch.</p>
                <p>Although these apparent lines give colours by interference, exactly like the
                    analogous lines in the laminae of the crystalline lens, yet neither of them are
                    <hi rend="italic">real lines,</hi> as decided upon by Dr Goring. With small
                    apertures the lines in the crystalline lens appear <hi rend="italic">dotty,
                    interrupted, uneven,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ragged,</hi> and exhibit, in
                    short, all the general phenomena of the lines on proof objects; but with a good
                    microscope and ajarge aperture, we discover the true secret of all these
                    appearances. They are not lines, but a succession of teeth arranged in lines;
                    and from the great number of lines forming the sides of the teeth, they appear
                    dark. Each fibre, in short, has teeth on each side of it,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Phil. Trans. 1830.</p></note> and the
                    teeth of one fibre lock into the spaces between the teeth of the adjacent
                    fibres. When we trace these fibres towards the pole to which they converge, they
                    become smaller and smaller, the teeth diminishing in the same proportion, so
                    that they become as difficult, and finally more difficult to resolve than the
                    lines in the proof objects.</p>
                <p>After a laborious examination of the lined tests, and the use of every optical
                    resource which he could command, Sir David Brewster has found that the
                    mysterious lines on these test objects are only apparent lines, being composed
                    of a succession of interlocking teeth, by which the fibres to which they are
                    attached form that delicate film which composes the scale of a moth. We now see
                    the source of all the perplexities which have beset this class of observations.
                    We understand why such lines are not seen so distinctly as the real lines on
                    micrometers, and the dots and the raggedness are all explained. In the lenses of
                    quadrupeds the teeth of the fibres are not round like those of fishes, but are
                    often sharp pointed and extremely short, like a jagged line, or a line with <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819937" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9937-0056"/> points projecting
                    from it. In like manner, the separation of the teeth is much more distinct in
                    some of the lined objects than in others. See fig. 24, in which we have given a
                    rude representation of the lines.</p>
                <p>With regard to the diagonal or oblique lines, which have been such a source of
                    perplexity to microscopical observers, we have little hesitation in pronouncing
                    <hi rend="italic">those which we have seen</hi> to be optical illusions from the
                    accidental <hi rend="italic">alignement</hi> of the sides of the teeth in
                    different grooves, when similarly illuminated by oblique rays. When the scales
                    are immersed in diluted sulphuric acid, we have never seen the diagonal lines.
                    When the sulphuric acid is too strong, the scales curl up, and often in this
                    state exhibit the lines very beautifully. We have observed diagonal lines
                    singularly developed in the laminae of the crystalline, and clearly arising from
                    the interference of the rays acted upon by the lines on one side of the lamina,
                    with the rays acted upon by the lines on the other side, and therefore we have
                    been the more confirmed in our opinion. As we have not had the advantage,
                    however, of using any of the fine reflecting microscopes with which Dr Goring
                    observed the oblique lines so distinctly brought out, it is still with
                    considerable diffidence that we place our conclusions in opposition to so direct
                    and distinct an observation, made by such skilful and experienced observers as
                    he and Mr Pritchard.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr
                    Pritchard informs us that the diagonal lines or cross striae are most easily
                    seen in the scales from the wing of the <hi rend="italic">Euplcea
                    limniacae,</hi> and in the blue scales from the <hi rend="italic">Papiliο
                    Paris,</hi> where they “are strongly and easily developed under a power of from
                    100 to 200 times.” In speaking of the ordinary lines, Mr Pritchard remarks, that
                    these lines or “markings,” with his best instruments, “appear detached like
                    short hairs or spines covering the delicate tissue of the scale. This latter
                    appearance is correct, the prominent portions of the lines which have escaped
                    the pressure of those of the surrounding scales being in a plane above the other
                    portions of the lines.” This opinion of the structure of the lines, published in
                    1835, is not repeated in the <hi rend="italic">Micrographia,</hi> published in
                    1837, where Dr Goring decides that they are real lines. See <hi rend="italic"

                    1835.</p></note></p>
                <p>With the view of arriving at a just decision respecting the nature of the lines,
                    Sir David Brewster endeavoured to ascertain the disposition of the colouring
                    matter on the scales. Owing to the great brightness of the lines on the black
                    scales, especially near their root, he was at first disposed to infer that, at
                    least in these scales, the colouring matter was arranged along the black lines,
                    the particles being more readily detained in their places by the edges of the
                    teeth. He has found, however, that in other scales the colouring matter lies
                    also along the bright lines; and it is only when this colouring matter is
                    removed, or its effect masqued, by removing the refraction at its surface by
                    immersion in a fluid, that the lines of proof objects are developed with perfect
                    distinctness.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster has made an attempt to count the number of scales and teeth in
                    the wing of a brown moth, or in one superficial inch, the area of the two
                    surfaces of each wing. He supposes, of course, all the scales to be the same in
                    size and structure, and he finds that there are</p>
                <p>Scales 158,400</p>
                <p>Teeth 19,800,000,000</p>

                <p>CHAP. Vlll.—ON MICROSCOPIC OBJECTS.</p>
                <p>In the preceding chapter we have already described some of the most interesting
                    objects for microscopical observation. Every department of nature is full of
                    objects, from the examination of which the most important discoveries may be
                    expected; bnt though the zealous observer can never be at any loss for subjects
                    of research, it is desirable to know what has been done by our predecessors, and
                    what trains of inquiry are most likely to prove of general interest. There are
                    subjects of microscopic inquiry which are closely connected with the most
                    interesting parts of physiology; and even geology itself, conversant with the
                    grandest subjects of research, has recently been illustrated by the aid of the
                    microscope.</p>
                <p>Μ. Ehrenberg, to whom we are indebted for so many important discoveries
                    respecting the organisation of infusorial animalcules, has lately made the most
                    remarkable discovery of <hi rend="italic">infusorial organic remains.</hi> These
                    remains are the siliceous shells of animalcules belonging to the division
                    Bacillaria, and form strata of Tripoli, or poli-schiefer (polishing-slate), at
                    Franzenbad, in Bohemia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    semiopal found along with the polishing-slate in the tertiary strata of Bilin,
                    in the chalk flints, and even in the semiopal or noble opal of the porphyritic
                    rocks.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ibid.</hi> No. VI. p. 464.</p></note> The size of a single individual of these
                    animals is about -&lt;Ath of a line, or <hi rend="strikethrough">y¾⅜¾</hi> th of
                    an inch. In the polishing-slate from Bilin, in which there appear to be no
                    vacuities, <hi rend="italic">a cubic line</hi> contains, in round numbers, 23
                    millions of these animals, and <hi rend="italic">a cubic inch</hi> contains
                    41,000 millions of them!</p>
                <p>The weight of a cubic inch of the polishing-slate is 270 grains. There are,
                    therefore, 187 millions of these animals in a single grain, or the siliceous
                    coat of one of these animals weighs the 187 millionth part of a grain!</p>
                <p>In Plate CCCLXII. figs. 24 and 25, we have given representations of these
                    singular microscopic objects, as seen by Ehrenberg.</p>
                <p>Another example of the value of microscopical observations may be drawn from the
                    discovery of the teeth of the fibres, which compose the crystalline lenses of
                    almost all animals. The crystalline lens is composed of innumerable fibres of
                    nearly the same length, each of which tapers from its middle to its two
                    extremities, where it comes to the sharpest point. The sides of each of these
                    fibres are furnished with teeth like those of a watch-wheel, and the teeth of
                    the one lock into those of the adjacent ones, as shown in fig. 28, Plate
                    CCCLXII. When the power is small, or the microscope not good, or the laminae too
                    thick and not nicely detached, each row of interlocking teeth appears as a dark
                    line, sometimes as sharp as a black line drawn upon paper with a pen. Sometimes
                    the lines appear rough and ragged, and as the fibres become less and less in
                    approaching the poles, the black lines are as difficult to resolve into teeth as
                    the lines on test-objects already described. The following measures, taken by
                    Sir David Brewster, will show what a wonderful structure in the eye has been
                    thus disclosed to us by the microscope. The calculations refer to the lens∙of a

                <p>There is another class of objects of extreme interest, which Mr Pritchard has
                    omitted to notice, and the development of which called forth all the resources
                    of optical knowledge and practical experience with the microscope. These objects
                    are the microscopic cavities in minerals, containing two fluids unknown to the
                    chemist, groups of crystals, floating balls, and exhibiting actual chemical
                    operations going on in these minute laboratories when exposed to changes of
                    temperature. These various phenomena have been described and represented in
                    drawings, in two papers by Sir David Brewster, published in the Transactions of
                    the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In some of the precious stones, particularly in
                    diamond, garnet, &amp;c. these cavities are perfect spheres; but, owing to the
                    great refractive power of the gem, they appear completely black and opaque,
                    though the microscope descries a small spot of light in their centre, which is
                    the pencil of light which they refract. These spherical cavities, and this
                    central spot, are the finest objects for examining the aberration of lenses and
                    specula, and are infinitely preferable to the reflected patches of light from
                    small spherules of quicksilver. Dr Goring has observed spherical cavities or
                    air-bubbles in fluids, and, with his usual ingenuity, recognised their utility
                    for indicating the effects of aberration. Those which we have used in the gems
                    are, however, permanent instruments of much greater utility, not only from our
                    being able to use the same bright spot with all instruments and on all
                    occasions, but from the dark ring round the bright spot being incomparably
                    greater in the gems than in fluids.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The ratio between the diameter of the dark sphere and of the
                    small luminous spot gives a measure of the refractive power of the solid or
                    fluid.</p></note> Representations of some of the cavities in fluids are given in
                    Plate CCCLXII. fig. 29, 30, 31. Fig. 29 shows the cavities containing the two
                    new fluids, which will not mix, though in the same cavity. The little circle is
                    the bubble either of gas or of vacuity. The fluid round it is a highly
                    evaporable fluid, and the fluid in the angles and ends of long cavities is a
                    thick and unevaporable fluid, which indurates when exposed to the air. Figs. 29
                    and 30 are beautifully formed cavities in topaz.</p>
