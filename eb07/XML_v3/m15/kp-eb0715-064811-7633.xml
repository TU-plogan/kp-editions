                    eminent natural historian, but peculiarly distinguished for the ardour of his
                    botanical researches, was a native of Spain, and born at Cadiz on the 6th of
                    April 1732. His parents were respectable inhabitants of that city, and conferred
                    on him the best elementary education that could be acquired in Andalusia. His
                    first instructions were received in the College of San Fernando, in his native
                    city, and thence he was removed to the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827646" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7646-0649"/>University of
                    Seville. In both these seminaries he was distinguished, as well by his
                    application and talents, as by the modesty of his demeanour. He attended the
                    classical and mathematical course as taught in the latter seminary, as well as
                    to the study of theology; and during his residence there, he sedulously applied
                    himself to anatomy, medicine, and natural history. The ardour he displayed for
                    this class of pursuits was great, so that when he removed to Madrid in 1757, he
                    had made such progress as to enable him to become a lecturer on anatomy. It was
                    then usual for the court of Madrid to select some promising young men, and send
                    them to Leyden, Paris, or Bologna, to improve their faculties, and advance their
                    knowledge of the sciences. Mutis was selected for this purpose; but about the
                    same period Don Pedro Messia de la Cerda was appointed viceroy of New Granada,
                    and proposed to the ardent naturalist to accompany him, in the quality of
                    physician, to that interesting country. His natural modesty and love of
                    retirement induced him to relinquish the opportunity of visiting different
                    countries, and thereby increasing his knowledge in Europe, and to devote himself
                    to the examination and description of those objects of natural history which the
                    mountains of South America presented, and which had previously been scarcely
                    explored by any scientific European.</p><p>He embarked with the viceroy, and landed at Carthagena in the year 1760. The
                    various new productions that met his eye at every point in that hot climate did
                    not detain him from ascending towards the mountain plain, where, at the city of
                    Santa Fé de Bogota, he fixed his abode.</p><p>He had scarcely reached the destined place of his residence, before he began to
                    arrange his plan for the collection of those plants to the study of which he was
                    attached, and the descriptions of which formed the delight of his life, and the
                    basis of his future fame. He soon began a correspondence with Linnaeus, which
                    continued during the life of that celebrated man, who procured his admission to
                    the academy at Stockholm. His accuracy, diligence, and enthusiasm were highly
                    estimated by the Swedish botanist, who felt, in the eulogiums he paid him, that
                    he very imperfectly gratified his own sentiments of respect and admiration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In memoriam Josephi

                    throughout Europe by all the botanists of considerable eminence, as his
                    discoveries were communicated to many of them through the extensive
                    correspondence which he maintained.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cavanilles, in writing, thus expresses himself: “In honorem
                    sapientissimi viri (J. C. Mutis) qui jure merito Botanicoum in America princeps
                    salutatur, debetque etiam inter primates Europeos colocari.”</p></note></p><p>At the time Mutis arrived at Santa Fé de Bogota, that capital was in profound
                    ignorance of science; and even in the university, the true system of the
                    universe was so little known, that he is represented as having encountered great
                    difficulties, when he first taught that the world turned upon its own axis,
                    revolved round the sun, and was in reality only a planet of the solar system.
                    With the approbation of the viceroy, he began to dispense mathematical, and
                    especially astronomical knowledge, to the pupils in the college of the Rosario;
                    and he had the satisfaction, long before the close of a protracted life, to see
                    a race of scholars formed on the principles of the, Newtonian philosophy, in
                    spite of the anxious and alarming fears of their parents, who, on its first
                    introduction, considered it as impious, or at least heretical.</p><p>He continued diligently exploring the Andes for every vegetable production,
                    during the intervals of instruction in astronomy, and continued both pursuits
                    with unabated ardour. When his patron Cerda had finished the period of his
                    viceroyship, he proposed to Mutis to return with him to Spain; but he was so
                    much fascinated with the solitude of the vast woods and extended plains, with
                    the features of nature displayed on the boldest scale, and the deep azure of the
                    unclouded sky, that he determined, under their favouring auspices, to spend the
                    remainder of his life in South America, in the contemplation of vegetation and
                    of the starry world. His studies, instead of producing scepticism, strengthened
                    his religious faith, and, under its influence, he entered into holy orders in
                    1772. From that period he divided his time between religion and the sciences;
                    and whilst in the former he was a model of ecclesiastical virtue, he displayed
                    in the latter the qualities of a genuine philosopher.</p><p>It was a fortunate circumstance, both for the science of botany and for the fame
                    of Mutis, that the court of Madrid felt a peculiar interest in the promotion of
                    that study, and appointed commissioners in each of its extensive dominions in
                    America, to investigate, arrange, describe, and draw their various productions.
                    Mutis was appointed president of the botanical board for the viceroyalty of
                    Santa Fé, and commenced his operations by the project of that great work the <hi rend="italic">Flora of Bogota,</hi> which only the munificence of a government
                    could enable him to undertake. In 1782, he selected the spot most favourable for
                    executing this great design, and, judging the central situation of Mariquita, at
                    the foot of the mountains of Quindiu, to be the best adapted for his purpose, he
                    removed thither, and resided in that place for the succeeding seven years, in
                    pursuance of his plan of study. The place was admirably chosen; for though at
                    the foot of the Andes, it is on a high level, and in a temperate climate; and,
                    being in the vicinity of the river Magdalena, though considerably higher, it has
                    the advantage of easy access to every degree of temperature, and to all the
                    various family of plants which the greatest possible differences of climate can
                    produce. In this secluded town, he and his pupils were constantly employed in
                    roaming in the extensive plains, penetrating the thickest woods, scaling the
                    highest mountains, and at times encountering the severe heat of the valleys,
                    whilst collecting every rarity of the vegetable kingdom. He there created a
                    class of painters, who drew the plants as they were collected; and he had a
                    school of engraving, in which were executed some of those large plates, which
                    have excited so much admiration amongst the botanists and artists of Europe. The
                    state of his health, arising principally from the exertions he made and the
                    hardships he encountered in these pursuits, induced him to remove from Mariquita
                    in 1772, and fix his residence again in the capital, to which he was also drawn
                    by the desire of being nearer to a greater number of artists than could be
                    collected in the retired spot from whence his exploratory journeys had been
                    directed. His labours in perfecting the <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi> were
                    continued with unabated industry till the end of his life; and, after his
                    decease, the work was continued by some of his pupils, though it received
                    serious interruptions from the civil wars, in the course of which some of those
                    appointed to continue it were cut off amidst the contests of the various
                    revolutionary factions. Amongst these is particularly to be regretted Don
                    Francisco Caldas, who was endeared to Mutis, and most nearly resembled him in
                    his industry, and his attachment to the study of natural history. Besides the
                    great work, the <hi rend="italic">Flora,</hi> Mutis finished one on the history
                    of the trees of the quina species, and exercised his great acuteness in the
                    investigation of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193827659" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7659-0650"/>varieties of that family, the bark of which has
                    introduced a new era in the practice of medicine.</p><p>Amidst his botanical labours, Mutis never neglected his astronomical observations
                    and experiments. It had often been suggested by philosophers in Europe, that the
                    moon had probably an influence on the barometer, similar to what it exercises on
                    the tides. The situation of Santa Fé was favourable for a variety of
                    experiments, which Mutis conducted, and by which he ascertained the fact so
                    clearly, as to remove all doubts on the subject. He was instrumental in
                    obtaining powers from Madrid for the construction of an observatory on the
                    summit of the Andes, at a far higher elevation than any of the observatories of
                    Europe are placed. He had remarked, that the blue of the firmament appears
                    darker in proportion to the elevation at which the observer stands, and that on
                    the highest attainable situations, the sky seems almost black; so that the stars
                    shine with a brilliancy uninterrupted by clouds, and, even in day-light, are
                    visible without the help of glasses.</p><p>He deemed the position favourable for astronomical observations, and especially
                    for those of the fixed stars; for being near the equator, it commanded a view of
                    the constellations both of the northern and southern hemispheres; and, from its
                    height, the observer is little liable to interruption from intervening clouds,
                    or to errors from the inconstancy of the refractions. At his earnest
                    recommendation, and under his inspection, the observatory was begun in 1802, and
                    finished in the following year. Some instruments were collected in the country,
                    and others were ordered from Europe. The first were, as may be supposed,
                    destitute of those improvements which have been more recently introduced; and it
                    unfortunately happened, that some of those exported from Europe were lost on the
                    passage. The apparatus had not been completed when Mutis died, and the political
                    storms which since agitated that country have prevented the completion of the
                    collection. The founder had, however, directed the course of observations to be
                    prosecuted with as much attention as the imperfection of the instruments would
                    admit. Though the wise intentions of Mutis have been delayed, we may hope that
                    they have not been frustrated, but may look forward to a time when the catalogue
                    of fixed stars in the southern hemisphere shall be considerably augmented, and
                    their positions determined with the greatest accuracy. In the mean time, some
                    astronomical and meteorological observations have been made and published, in a
                    periodical register, and the exact latitude and longitude of the observatory has
                    been determined. Its elevation above the level of the ocean, as determined by
                    barometrical observations, frequently repeated, is 9416 feet. As this
                    observatory is the first erected in South America, and as it stands much higher
                    than any other that ever was constructed, if its advantages shall be properly
                    improved, it will be a benefit to science, and a durable monument to the fame of
                    its founder.</p><p>Mutis enjoyed good health throughout a long life, which was closed in a manner
                    worthy of a philosopher and a Christian, without pain or struggle, on the 11th
                    of September 1808. He left various manuscript works on plants, on meteorology,
                    and on mining; an herbarium of upwards of 20,000 plants, more than 5000 drawings
                    of plants, and a large collection of woods, of shells, of minerals, and skins of
                    animals. He had also a very extensive collection of oil-paintings, of all the
                    various animals of the viceroyalty, coloured in exact conformity to nature. It
                    was the last wish he expressed, that his valuable collections might furnish the
                    basis of a national museum; but the turbulent season which commenced soon after
                    his death, and the unsettled state in which public affairs subsequently
                    continued, have hitherto prevented the fulfilment of his wishes. (See <hi rend="italic">El Espanol.</hi><hi rend="italic">Diario</hi><hi rend="italic">de Santa Fé.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
