                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    Poquelin</hi></label>, the most celebrated comic writer of France, was born at
                    Paris on the 15th of January 1622. He was the son of Jean Poquelin, a
                    merchant-upholsterer, and of Marie Cressé, whose father followed the same
                    calling. Being designed by his parents to succeed them in their business, he was
                    early employed in assisting them; and, at the age of fourteen, all he had
                    acquired was a little reading, writing, and arithmetic. Fortunately he had a
                    grandfather, who, being a lover of plays, used sometimes to take the boy alongst
                    with him to the Hôtel de Bourgoyne. This was sufficient to inspire him with a
                    distaste for his situation, and a desire to acquire that instruction of which he
                    felt that he had been deprived. With much difficulty he prevailed on his parents
                    to permit him to study, and he was sent as a day-scholar to the College of
                    Clermont. Circumstances the most favourable to his fortune and his genius
                    attended him in that seminary. He had as his class-fellow Armand de Bourbon,
                    Prince of Conti, whose affectionate protection became afterwards useful to him
                    upon more than one occasion. Another who followed the same course of study was
                    Chapelle, the natural son of Lhuillier, a ric' magistrate, who had appointed as
                    his preceptor the celebrated Gassendi, and associated with him as the companion
                    of his studies, Bernier, then a poor child, but afterwards famous for his
                    travels in India. Gassendi, struck with the happy disposition of young Poquelin,
                    admitted him to the private lessons which he gave to his two pupils; a favour
                    which was equally enjoyed by Cyrano de Bergerac, who did not profit quite so
                    much by the opportunity thus afforded him.</p>
                <p>From the conversations of Gassendi, who had combated, and often with success,
                    Aristotle and Descartes, the two great rival powers of ancient and modern
                    philosophy, Poquelin contracted the habit of not submitting his reason to any
                    other authority than that of demonstrated truth. The ethical system of Epicurus,
                    almost equally calumniated by his adversaries and his followers, was that which
                    Poquelin then adopted, and which he ever afterwards professed. But his studies
                    were destined soon to experience an interruption. Poquelin the father held the
                    office of domestic upholsterer to the king; but being prevented by bad health
                    from discharging its duties, the son, who had obtained the reversion of the
                    situation, was obliged to attend Louis XIII. in his journey to Narbonne in the
                    year 1641. Having returned with the court to Paris, his passion for the stage,
                    which had first induced him to study, revived more strongly than ever. It has
                    been said by some that he studied law for a time, and that he was even called to
                    the bar. But this seems at least doubtful; or, if true, he must soon have
                    abandoned his legal studies for those more attractive and fascinating pursuits
                    in which he afterwards attained unrivalled eminence, and became the restorer of
                    genuine comedy in France. The passion of Cardinal Richelieu for dramatic
                    amusements had communicated itself to the nation; and everywhere in the capital
                    private theatres were opened, where Rotrou and Desmarets, Corneille and
                    Scu-déry, were indiscriminately applauded. Poquelin assembled several young
                    persons who had, or thought they had, a talent for declamation; and this
                    society, which soon eclipsed all the others, was called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Illustre</hi><hi rend="italic">Theatre.</hi> It was then that Poquelin resolved
                    to follow his vocation, assumed the name of Molière, in order, as it should
                    seem, that his parents might not have to reproach him with prostituting their
                    name on the boards of a playhouse.</p>
                <p>But the troubles of the Fronde interrupted the amusements of the theatre, and
                    during this ridiculous tempest Molière disappeared; nor did he show himself
                    again until the royal authority had reconquered its sway by transactions more
                    powerful than arms. In this interval, extending from 1648 to 1652, he was
                    probably occupied with the composition of some of those pieces which were
                    afterwards exhibited to the public. His first regular production was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Etourdi,</hi> or Blunderer, which was represented at Lyons in
                    1653. Upon his arrival in that city, he had found another company of comedians,
                    whom the public, however, promptly abandoned for his, and the principal
                    performers of which then attached themselves to his fortunes, never more to
                    separate. With this reinforcement he repaired to Beziers, where his old
                    class-fellow, the Prince of Conti, was holding the states of Languedoc. Being
                    specially instructed to amuse the city, the assembly, and the prince, he brought
                    out in succession all the pieces in his little repository, which had just been
                    enriched with the <hi rend="italic">Depit</hi><hi rend="italic">Amoureux.</hi>
                    The prince, delighted with his wit and his zeal, offered to employ him as his
                    secretary; but this he declined, observing, “I am <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    tolerable author, but I should make a very bad secretary.” Having continued for
                    some time his strolling performances in the south of France, he at length
                    approached the capital, to which he was attracted by the secret hope of better
                    fortune and greater fame; and when he actually returned thither in the year
                    1658, he again obtained the protection of his august college-companion, and
                    through it acquired still more elevated patronage, name <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193823395" xml:id="kp-eb0715-3395-0322"/>ly, that of Monsieur, brother
                    of the king, and also the favour of the king himself. It was under their
                    auspices, and in their presence, that, on the 3d of November 1658, he opened
                    that theatre which, in less than fifteen years, he enriched with more than
                    thirty works, the half of which are masterpieces. Paris, which was now appealed
                    to, confirmed the judgment of the provinces, and in the capital the <hi
                    rend="italic">Etourdi</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Dépit Amoureux</hi> were as
                    successful as they had been in the south of France. On entering upon this new
                    career, he had no other guide than his genius; but it proved all-sufficient.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Précieuses</hi><hi rend="italic">Ridicules</hi> appeared in
                    1659, and at once struck with consternation those haughty coteries where
                    affectation perverted at once the understanding and the feelings, and whose
                    jargon infested literature as well as society. This was succeeded by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cocu Imaginaire,</hi> in which he combated Scarron with his own
                    weapons, and succeeded, by manners more true, a gaiety more natural, and a
                    buffoonery in better taste. <hi rend="italic">Don Garcie de Navarre,</hi> a
                    heroic comedy, imitated from the Spanish, was but coldly received; but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ecole</hi><hi rend="italic">des Maris,</hi> a comedy at once of
                    manners, character, and intrigue, and of which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adelphi</hi> of Terence had furnished the fundamental idea, was completely
                    successful. The <hi rend="italic">Fâcheux</hi> was produced the same year, 1661,
                    and was played at Vaux in presence of Louis XIV. a few days before that monarch
                    caused to be arrested, and imprisoned for the rest of his life, the minister who
                    then entertained him. The <hi rend="italic">Ecole</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Femmes</hi> appeared in 1662, and, as might have been expected, excited a
                    violent sensation, during the prevalence of which the author was assailed on all
                    sides, and with every species of abuse; but in his <hi rend="italic">Critique de
                    l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecole</hi><hi rend="italic">des Femmes,</hi> which came
                    out in 1663, he took ample vengeance on the envious fools and prudes who had
                    leagued together to vilify that masterpiece. The same year he produced the <hi
                    rend="italic">Impromptu de Versailles,</hi> by way of reprisal on Boursault, who
                    had attacked him in an impudently satirical piece, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Portrait</hi><hi rend="italic">du Peintre.</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">Marriage Force,</hi> 1664, is drawn from Rabelais, whom
                    Molière, like La Fontaine, freely put in requisition; and, the same year, he
                    composed the <hi rend="italic">Princesse</hi><hi rend="italic">(IElide,</hi> the
                    subject of which belongs to the Spanish theatre. In 1665, Molière produced his
                    <hi rend="italic">Festin</hi><hi rend="italic">de Pierre,</hi> and also <hi
                    rend="italic">EAmour</hi><hi rend="italic">Médecin,</hi> which last, he says,
                    was proposed, written, learned, and represented in five days. The following year
                    he brought out first the <hi rend="italic">Misanthrope,</hi> and next <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Médécin malgré lui,</hi> the subject of which is taken from one
                    of the old Fabliaux.</p>
                <p>In 1677, besides the <hi rend="italic">Fagotier,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Sicilien, ou</hi><hi rend="italic">l’Amour</hi><hi rend="italic">Peintre,</hi>
                    he conceived and executed the <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe,</hi> one of the
                    boldest and best of his compositions. The idea of bringing upon the stage
                    religious hypocrisy, in an age when devotion was the mode, certainly evinced no
                    ordinary hardihood on the part of the incomparable writer; but, notwithstanding,
                    he triumphed over all opposition. <hi rend="superscript"> &lt;(</hi> Les faux
                    dévots,” says one of his French biographers, “furent frappes de terreur; des
                    hommes vraiment pieux en conçurent des vives alarmes; ils ne voyaient pas sans
                    horreur le profane théâtre s’arroger, pour ainsi dire, un droit de jurisdiction
                    en matière sacrée. Et dans ce zèle ardent d’un comédien contre un vice dont
                    l’eglise gémissait en secret, ils n’appercevaient qu’une envie mal déguisée
                    d’insulter à la vertu même dont ce vice empruntait les dehors. Quand on songe au
                    nombre, à la puissance, des personnes que les calculs d’un odieux intérêt ou les
                    erreurs d’un zèle respectable avaient liguées contre le <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tartuffe,</hi> on ne peut être surpris des difficultés qu’éprouva la
                    représentation; on doit l’être sculement que Molière soit parvenu à les
                    surmonter.” In 1668, he produced the <hi rend="italic">Amphitryon</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">EAvare,</hi> both imitated, and in part borrowed, from Plautus,
                    and also <hi rend="italic">George Dandin,</hi> a comedy; in 1669, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pourceaugnac,</hi> a farce, containing some scenes highly comic,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Amans Magnifiques,</hi> in which he ridicules the
                    chimeras of astrology, with which many persons were then infatuated; and, in
                    1670, the <hi rend="italic">Bourgeois</hi><hi rend="italic">Gentilhomme,</hi> of
                    which the king said, “Vous n’avez encore rien fait qui m’ait tant diverti, et
                    votre pièce est excellente.” The <hi rend="italic">Fourberies de Scapin,
                    Psyché,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Comtesse dEs-carbagnas,</hi> came out in
                    1671; and the following year he produced the <hi rend="italic">Femmes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Savantes,</hi> which was condemned before being heard, as much
                    from apprehension as any other cause. His last comedy was <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Malade Imaginaire,</hi> 1673, which terminated the dramatic career of
                    Molière.</p>
                <p>Upon the day when this piece was acted for the fourth time, the author suffered
                    severely from a pain in the chest, and his friends endeavoured to persuade him
                    not to play. He persisted, however, and, in the entertainment of the piece, at
                    the moment when he pronounced the word <hi rend="italic">Juro,</hi> he was
                    seized with convulsions, which he endeavoured in vain to conceal under a forced
                    smile. He was removed to his house, where some hours afterwards he died from a
                    vomiting of blood, which appears to have suffocated him. His death took place in
                    the evening of the 17th of February 1673, in the fifty-second year of his age.
                    As he had died in a state of excommunication, the curate of Saint-Eustache, his
                    parish, refused him ecclesiastical sepulture. “What !” exclaimed his widow, “do
                    they here refuse him sepulture? In Greece they would have raised altars in his
                    honour.” This objection was overcome, however, and his remains were interred in
                    the cemetery of Saint-Joseph.</p>
                <p>All that we learn respecting the personal character of Molière is greatly to his
                    honour. Happy in the society of his friends, he was respected and beloved by his
                    equals; and, though courted by the great, he retained to the last the original
                    simplicity of his character. Marshal Vivonne, the great Condé, and even Louis
                    X1V., treated him with that familiarity which considers the distinction of merit
                    as placing its possessor upon a level with the highest accidents of birth or
                    fortune; but this flattering notice neither corrupted his heart nor misled his
                    understanding. He was kind, generous, and liberal alike of his means and his
                    influence; he had an honest consciousness of superiority, which exalted him
                    above envy, whilst his disposition prompted him to do all the good in his power.
                    He assisted Racine in his difficulties, and, by the encouragement he gave to
                    that poet, proved instrumental in bringing forward a genius destined to become
                    the glory of the French stage. The occupation of Molière in lashing the vices
                    and follies of his time naturally drew upon him the indignation of those who had
                    smarted under the poignant keenness of his wit; throughout his whole career,
                    indeed, he had been pursued by satirical libels; and even after his death, his
                    enemies, carrying their resentment beyond the grave, assailed his memory, in
                    sarcastic epitaphs. The author of one of these pieces had the ill fortune, or
                    the stupidity, to offer it to the great Condé: “Plût à Dieu,” said the hero
                    sternly, “que celui dont tu me présentes l’épitaphe, fût en état de me presenter
                    la tienne !” The only one of these productions possessing any point is the
                    following :—</p>
                <p>Roscius hic situs est tristi Molierus in urna, Cui genus humanum ludere, ludus
                    erat.</p>
                <p>Dum ludit mortem, mors indignata jocantem Corripit, et mimum fingere soeva
                    negat»</p>
                <p>The French nation has with one voice assigned to Molière the first and highest
                    place amongst its comic authors. Nor does there appear to be any reason whatever
                    for impeaching the validity and the soundness of this judgment. Of all the
                    dramatic writers who illustrated the age of Louis XIV., no one attained a higher
                    reputation, or more nearly reached the acmé of perfection in his art. Indeed,
                    Voltaire boldly pronounces him the most eminent comic poet that any age or
                    country has produced; nor is this opinion peculiar to the author of the <hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-3408-0323"/>Louis XIV. insisted upon Boileau telling him whom
                    he considered as the most original writer of his time, Boileau answered,
                    Molière. The French comic poet is always the satirist of vice and folly, and of
                    these alone; virtue, with him, is ever sacred. The characters he selected for
                    ridicule were mostly peculiar to the times in which he lived; but he has
                    nevertheless managed to render each as it were the type of a class, and thus to
                    impart to his delineations an universality which must prevent them from ever
                    becoming obsolete. The external manifestations of vice and folly may change with
                    time, and vary according to the fluctuations of fashion, caprice, or accident;
                    yet the essential elements of human character and passion will remain always the
                    same; and Molière penetrated too deeply below the surface not to distinguish the
                    permanent from the accidental, and to catch those generic indications which are
                    at all times equally significant. He possessed comic powers of the very highest
                    order, and wit of the purest kind; his mirth is unalloyed with bitterness,
                    and’his pleasantry is always innocent. His comedies in verse, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Misanthrope</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe,</hi>
                    constitute a specific variety of their class, in which vice is exposed in the
                    style of elegant and polished satire, although with a formal gravity ill suited
                    to our notions of the comic. His verses have all the freedom and fluency of
                    conversation, yet he is said to have passed whole days in fixing upon a proper
                    epithet or a suitable rhyme. In his prose comedies, though there is a profession
                    of ridicule equally pointed and effective, yet there is nothing to offend the
                    most fastidious purity, or to throw contempt on sobriety and virtue. But, with
                    all these high qualities, Molière has also some acknowledged defects. He is not
                    happy in the unravelling of his plots. More attentive to the strong exhibition
                    of character than to the conduct of the intrigue, he seems to be carried away by
                    this natural predilection; and hence the denouement is frequently brought about
                    with too little preparation, and without sufficient attention to probability.
                    The scene is wound up on a sudden, and in a manner which leaves an impression of
                    disappointment, mixed with a conviction that, in unfolding the character, the
                    author has neglected the incidents. In his rhymed comedies he is sometimes not
                    sufficiently interesting, and many of the speeches are by far too long; whilst,
                    in his shorter pieces, intended to serve as interludes or entertainments, the
                    comic often degenerates into the farcical. Upon the whole, however, few writers
                    ever possessed the genuine spirit and attained the true end of comedy so
                    perfectly as Molière. His <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe</hi> in the grave style,
                    and his <hi rend="italic">Avare</hi> in the gay, are accounted by his countrymen
                    his two greatest masterpieces. The French Academy, which had declined admitting
                    him as a member on account of his profession, sought to render to his memory the
                    homage which it had considered itself obliged to refuse to his person, and in
                    the year 1778 ordered his bust to be placed in the hall containing the portraits
                    of academicians, with this inscription, proposed by Saurin:</p>
                <p>Rien ne manque à sa gloire; il manquait à la nôtre.</p>
                <p>And, not content with this, it proposed, as the subject of competition for a
                    prize, an eulogium on Molière. The successful candidate was Chamfort, who
                    evinced m,uch spirit and discrimination in judging and praising the productions
                    of the great dramatist.</p>
