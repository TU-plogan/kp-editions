                <p><label type="entry">BROTHER</label>, <hi rend="italic">Prater,</hi> a term of
                    relation between two male children, sprung from the same father, or mother, or
                    both. Sealiger and Vossius derive <hi rend="italic">frater</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;ρξaτr</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">(ρ^ατωο,</hi> which properly signifies a person
                    who draws water in the same well; pg≡αg, in Greek, signifying <hi rend="italic"
                    >well,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">φξωτζia,</hi> a company of people who have a
                    right to draw water out of the same well. The word, it is said, came originally
                    from the city Argos, where there were only a few wells distributed in certain
                    quarters of the city, to which those of the same neighbourhood alone
                    repaired.</p>
                <p>By the civil law, brothers and sisters stand in the second degree of
                    consanguinity; by the canon law they are in the first degree. By the Mosaic law
                    the brother of a man who died without issue was obliged to marry the widow of
                    the deceased. Deuter, xxv. 7. The ancients applied the term brother
                    indifferently to almost all who stood related in the collateral line, as uncles
                    and nephews, cousin germans, and the like. This we learn not only from a great
                    many passages in the Old Testament, but also from profane authors. Cicero, in
                    his Philippics, says, Antonia was both wife and sister of Mark Antony, because
                    she was daughter of his brother C. Antonius. And as to cousins, Tullus
                    Hostilius, in Dionysius Halicarnasseus, calls the Horatii and Curiatii brothers,
                    because they were sisters’ children. The language of the Jews, Bishop Pearson
                    observes, included in the name of brethren not only the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193740759" xml:id="kp-eb0705-0759-0592"/>strict relation of
                    fraternity, but also the larger one of consanguinity. We are brethren, says
                    Abraham to Lot, Gen. xiii. 8, whereas Lot was only his nephew. So Jacob told
                    Rachel that he was her father’s brother, Gen. xxix. 12, whereas he was only her
                    father’s nephew. This consideration has been urged with good advantage against
                    the Antidicoarianites, who, from the mention made of the brethren of Jesus, John
                    ii. 12, Matt. xii. 46, have impugned the perpetual virginity of the mother of
                    Christ. Among us it is customary for kings to give the title of brother to each
                    other; the unction in coronation being esteemed to create a kind of brotherhood.
                    Nor is the custom modern. Menander mentions a letter of Cosroes king of Persia
                    to the emperor Justinian, beginning thus: “Cosroes, king of kings, to the
                    emperor Justinian my brother.” Kings now also give the same appellation to the
                    electors of the empire. In the civil law, brothers, <hi rend="italic"
                    >fratres,</hi> in the plural, sometimes comprehends sisters; as <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucius</hi><hi rend="italic">et Titia, fratres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">tres fratres, Titius,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Moevius,</hi><hi rend="italic">et Seia.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Foster-B</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> rorhers,</hi> those who have been
                    suckled by the same nurse. The French call them <hi rend="italic"
                    >fratres</hi><hi rend="italic">du</hi><hi rend="italic">lait,</hi> or brothers
                    by milk; which is most properly used in respect of a person who had been suckled
                    by a nurse at the same time with the nurse’s own child.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brother</hi> was also used by the writers of the middle ages
                    for a <hi rend="italic">conies,</hi> or governor of a province.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brother</hi> is applied, in a less proper sense, to denote a
                    person of the same profession; in which sense judges, bishops, priests, call
                    each other brothers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brother</hi> is also a customary term by which priests of
                    the same persuasion address one another: but it is more particularly used to
                    denote the relation between monks of the same convent; as Brother Zachary. In
                    English we more usually say Friar Zachary, from the French word <hi
                    rend="italic">frère,</hi> brother. Preachers also call their hearers <hi
                    rend="italic">my brethren,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">my dear brethren.</hi> This
                    appellation is borrowed from the primitive Christians, who all called each other
                    <hi rend="italic">brothers.</hi> But it is now principally used for such of the
                    religious as are not priests; those in orders are generally honoured with the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">father,</hi> whereas the rest are only simple
                    brothers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brother</hi> is also an appellation more peculiarly given to
                    certain orders of religious.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Brothers</hi><hi rend="italic">of Arms,</hi> an
                    appellation given to those who contract a kind of fraternity in war, obliging
                    themselves to the mutual service and assistance of each other. In the military
                    orders the knights are also called <hi rend="italic">brothers.</hi> In the order
                    of Malta there is a particular class who are called <hi rend="italic">serving
                    brothers,</hi> consisting of such as cannot give proof of their nobility. In
                    Latin they are denominated <hi rend="italic">fratres</hi><hi rend="italic"
