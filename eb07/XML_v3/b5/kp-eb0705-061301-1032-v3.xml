                    mankind.</p><p>Among brutes the monkey kind bear the nearest resemblance to man, both in the
                    external shape and internal structure, but more in the former than in the
                    latter. In the monkey kind the highest and the nearest approach to the likeness
                    of man is the ourang ou tang, or <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi><hi rend="italic">Sylvestris.</hi> (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.)</hi> The structure and
                    economy of brutes make the objects of what is called <hi rend="smallcaps">Comparative Anatomy.</hi> (See vol. iii. page 1, of this work.)</p><p>Philosophers have been much puzzled about the essential characteristics of
                    brutes, by which they may be distinguished from man. Some define a brute to be
                    an <hi rend="italic">animal not risible,</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">living
                    creature incapable of laughter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> others call them
                    <hi rend="italic">mute animals.</hi> The Peripatetics allowed them a sensitive
                    power, but denied them a rational one. The Platonists allowed them reason and
                    understanding, though in a degree less pure and refined than that of men.
                    Lactantius allows every thing to brutes which men have, except a sense of
                    religion; and even this has been ascribed to them by some sceptics. Descartes
                    maintained that brutes are mere inanimate machines, absolutely destitute not
                    only of reason, but of all thought and perception, and that all their actions
                    are only consequences of the exquisite mechanism of their bodies. This system,
                    however, is much older than Descartes; it was borrowed by him from Gomez
                    Pereira, a Spanish physician, who employed thirty years in composing a treatise
                    which he entitled <hi rend="italic">Antoniana</hi><hi rend="italic">Margarita,</hi> from the Christian names of his father and mother. It was
                    published in 1554; but his opinion had not the honour of gaining partizans, nor
                    even of being refuted, so that it died with him. Even Pereira seems not to have
                    been the inventor of this notion, something like it having been held by several
                    of the ancients, as we find from Plutarch and St Augustin. Others who rejected
                    the Cartesian hypothesis, have maintained that brutes are endowed with ∙a soul
                    essentially inferior to that of men; and to this soul some have allowed
                    immortality, others not. And, lastly, in a treatise published by one Bougeant, a
                    Jesuit, entitled <hi rend="italic">A Philosophical Amusement οη the Lan</hi><hi rend="italic">guage of Eeasts,</hi> he affirms that they are animated by evil
                    spirits or devils.</p><p>The opinion of Descartes was probably invented, or at least adopted, by him, to
                    refute two great objections: one against the immortality of the souls of brutes,
                    if they were allowed to have any; the other against the goodness of God, in
                    suffering creatures who had never sinned to be subjected to so many miseries.
                    The arguments in favour of it may be stated as follow: 1. It is certain that a
                    number of human actions are merely mechanical, because they are done
                    imperceptibly to the agent, and without any direction from the will, which are
                    to be ascribed to the impression of objects and the primordial disposition of
                    the machine, wherein the influence of the soul has no share; of which number are
                    all habits of the body acquired from the reiteration of certain actions. In ail
                    such circumstances human beings are no better than automata. 2. There are some
                    natural movements so involuntary that we cannot restrain them; for example, that
                    admirable mechanism ever on the watch to preserve an equilibrium when we stoop,
                    bend, or incline our bodies in any way, and when we walk upon a narrow plank. 3.
                    The natural liking for, and antipathy against, certain objects, which in
                    children precede the power of knowing and discriminating them, and which
                    sometimes in grown persons triumph over all the efforts of reason, are all
                    phenomena to be accounted for from the wonderful mechanism of the body, and are
                    so many cogent proofs of that irresistible influence which objects have on the
                    human frame. 4. Every one knows how much our passions depend on the degree of
                    motion into which the blood is put, and the reciprocal impressions caused by the
                    animal spirits between the heart and brain, that are so closely connected by
                    their nerves; and if such effects maybe produced by such simple mechanical means
                    as the mere increase of motion in the blood, without any direction of the will,
                    we are not to wonder at the actions of brutes being the effects only of a
                    refined mechanism, without thought or perception. 5. A further proof will arise
                    from a consideration of the many wonderful effects which even the ingenuity of
                    men has contrived to bring about by mechanical means; the an-droide, for
                    instance, of Mr Kempell, which played at chess. Now it is not to be questioned
                    but that the mechanism of the body of the meanest animal infinitely surpasses
                    that of Mr Kempell’s machine; and what can be the consequence of this, but that
                    the actions of that animal must be proportionably more surprising than those of
                    the wooden chess player? See <hi rend="smallcaps">Androides</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Automaton.</hi></p><p>The above is a short abstract of all the arguments that are brought in favour of
                    the Cartesian system; but they are evidently very far from being conclusive.
                    They are .deficient, in the first place, because, though w e allow them in the
                    utmost extent the Cartesians themselves can desire, they prove only the
                    possibility of brutes being inanimate, and that the power of God actually could
                    produce such and such actions from inanimate machines; but that he has actually
                    done so, they have not the least tendency to prove. In the second place, the
                    Cartesian argument is insufficient, because it has no limits, and knows not
                    where to stop. By the same method of arguing every man might prove his neighbour
                    to be an inanimate machine; for though every individual be conscious of his own
                    thoughts, he is not so of those of his neighbours; and it no more exceeds the
                    power of God to cause an inanimate machine to perform the actions of a man than
                    those of a beast. Neither are the two objections which the hypothesis is
                    calculated to answer to be at all admitted as arguments in its favour. They are,
                    1. That if we allow brutes to have souls, they must be immaterial, and
                    consequently immortal; and, 2. It seems a contradiction to the goodness of God
                    to think <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741045" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1045-0614"/>that he should subject innocent creatures to such
                    a multitude of evils as we see the brute creation endure in this world. The
                    first of these is productive of no bad consequences to us, though it should be
                    granted; and if it is supposed that the brute creatures are really immortal, the
                    second objection vanishes, because, in the enjoyment of endless felicity, all
                    temporary afflictions, how severe soever, must be swallowed up as though they
                    had never been.</p><p>As to a positive proof on the other side, namely, that brutes are really endowed
                    with sensation and consciousness, there is undoubtedly the same evidence for the
                    sensibility of brutes that there is for that of mankind. We see brutes avoid
                    pain as much as we do; and we likewise see them seek for pleasure, and express
                    their happiness in the enjoyment of certain things by signs not at all
                    equivocal. Therefore, though we grant the possibility of all this being the
                    effect of mere mechanism, yet, as we are conscious that in ourselves similar
                    effects are produced by a sentient principle, we have all the reason in the
                    world to conclude that in brutes they are likewise derived from a principle of
                    sensation, especially seeing we know of no kind of mechanism in any other part
                    of nature which produces any thing like the effects just mentioned; and until we
                    see that a mechanism of this kind does take place in some part of nature, we
                    have no reason to suppose it in any. As to those actions of the human body in
                    which it seems to move spontaneously, like an automaton, without the direction
                    of the mind or will, it is almost superfluous to observe, that they were not
                    performed in this manner originally, but required very great exertions of the
                    will and intellectual faculty before the body could be brought to perform them
                    easily.; so that from these nothing can be inferred. Add to this, that divine
                    revelation sets forth to us in many places the brute creation as objects of
                    mercy, which could not be done without the highest absurdity, if they were not
                    really capable of feeling pleasure and pain as well as we.</p><p>The most rational opposers of the Cartesian scheme maintain that brutes are
                    endowed with a principle of sensation as well as we, though of an inferior
                    nature to ours. Great disputes, however, have arisen on this subject, some
                    maintaining that the soul of brutes is merely sensitive, and that they are
                    altogether destitute of reflection and understanding; others, that they not only
                    reason, but make a better use of it than men do. That the brutes are endowed
                    only with sensation, and totally destitute of all power of reflection, or even
                    reasoning, is what can by no means be maintained on good grounds; neither can it
                    be asserted that they act entirely from instinct or a blind propensity to
                    certain things without knowing why or wherefore. In numberless instances,
                    needless to be mentioned here, but which will readily occur to every reader, it
                    is evident that education will get the better of many of the natural instincts
                    of brutes, which could never be the case were they absolutely incapable of
                    reasoning. On the other hand, it is equally certain that they are by no means
                    capable of education in the same degree that men are, neither are the rational
                    exertions of beasts at all to be compared even with those of the meanest
                    savages. One remarkable instance of this is in the use of the element of fire.
                    The most savage nations have known how to make this element subservient to their
                    purposes; or if some have been found who have been entirely ignorant of its
                    existence, they have quickly learned its uses on seeing it employed by others;
                    but though many of the brute creatures arc delighted with warmth, and have
                    opportunities every day of seeing how fire is supplied with fuel, and thereby
                    preserved, it never was known that one of them attempted to preserve a fire by
                    this means. This shows a strange defect of rationality, unaccountable upon any
                    other supposition than that the soul or sentient principle of brutes is somehow
                    or other inferior in its nature to that of man; but still it is a sentient
                    principle, capable of perceptions as quick as our own, and in many instances
                    much more so.</p><p>Father Bougeant supports his opinion of the spirits of brute creatures being
                    devils in the following manner:— Having proved at large that beasts naturally
                    have understanding, he says, “Reason naturally inclines us to believe that
                    beasts have a spiritual soul; and the only thing that opposes this sentiment is
                    the consequences that might be inferred from it. If brutes have a soul, that
                    soul must be either matter or spirit; it must be one of the two, and yet you
                    dare affirm neither. You dare not say it is matter, because you must then
                    necessarily suppose matter to be capable of thinking; nor will you say that it
                    is spirit, this opinion bringing with it consequences contrary to the principles
                    of religion; and this, among others, that man would differ from beasts only by
                    the degrees of plus and minus, which would demolish the very foundation of all
                    religion. Therefore, if I can elude all these consequences; if I can assign to
                    beasts a spiritual soul without striking at the doctrines of religion, it is
                    evident that my system, being moreover the most agreeable to reason, is the only
                    warrantable hypothesis. Now I shall, and can do it, with the greatest ease
                    imaginable. I even have means, by the same method, to explain many very obscure
                    passages in the holy Scripture, and to resolve some very great difficulties
                    which are not well confuted. This we shall unfold in a more particular
                    manner.</p><p>“Religion teaches us that the devils, from the very moment they had sinned, were
                    reprobate, and that they were doomed to burn for ever in hell; but the church
                    has not yet determined whether they do actually endure the torments to which
                    they are condemned. It may then be thought that they do not yet suffer them, and
                    that the execution of the verdict brought against them is reserved for the day
                    of the final judgment. Now, what I pretend to infer from hence is, that, till
                    doomsday comes, God, in order not to suffer so many legions of reprobate spirits
                    to be of no use, has distributed them through the several spaces of the world,
                    to serve the designs of his providence, and make his omnipotence to appear. Some
                    continuing in their natural state, busy themselves in tempting men, in seducing
                    and tormenting them, either immediately, as Job’s devil, and those that lay hold
                    of human bodies, or by the ministry of sorcerers or phantoms. These wicked
                    spirits are those whom the Scripture calls the <hi rend="italic">powers of
                    darkness,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">powers of the air.</hi> God, with the
                    others, makes millions of beasts of all kinds, which serve for the uses of men,
                    which fill the universe, and cause the wisdom and omnipotence of the Creator to
                    be admired. By that means I can easily conceive, on the one hand, how the devils
                    can tempt us; and, on the other, how beasts can think, know, have sentiments,
                    and a spiritual soul, without any way striking at the doctrines of religion. I
                    am no longer surprised to see them have forecast, me· mory, and judgment. I
                    should rather have occasion to wonder at their having no more, since their soul
                    very likely is more perfect than ours. But I discover the reason of this; it is
                    because, in beasts as well as in ourselves, the operations of the mind are
                    dependent on the materia organs of the machine to which it is united; and thos
                    <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> organs being grosser and less perfect than in us,
                    it ι°J' lows that the knowledge, the thoughts, and the other spiritual
                    operations of the beasts, must of course be lesspe <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> ' feet than ours; and if these proud spirits know their own dismal state,
                    what a humiliation must it be to them thus to see themselves reduced to the
                    condition of beasts· But whether they know it or not, so shameful a degra <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> tion is still, with regard to them, the primary
                    effect of *- <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193741058" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1058-0615"/>divine
                    vengeance I just mentioned; it is an anticipated hell.”</p><p>Having mentioned the prejudices against this hypothesis, such particularly as the
                    pleasure which people of sense and religion take in beasts and birds, especially
                    all sorts of domestic animals, he proceeds, “Do we love beasts for their own
                    sakes? No. As they are altogether strangers to human society, they can have no
                    other appointment but that of being useful and amusing. And what care we whether
                    it be a devil or any other creature that amuses us? The thought of it, far from
                    shocking, pleases me mightily. I with gratitude admire the goodness of the
                    Creator, who gave me so many little devils to serve and amuse me. If I am told
                    that these poor devils are doomed to suffer eternal tortures, I admire God’s
                    decrees, but I have no manner of share in that dreadful sentence; I leave the
                    execution of it to the sovereign judge; and, notwithstanding this, I live with
                    my little devils as I do with a multitude of people, of whom religion informs me
                    that a great number shall be damned. But the cure of a prejudice is not to be
                    effected in a moment; it is done by time and reflection: give me leave, then,
                    lightly to touch upon this difficulty, in order to observe a very important
                    thing to you.</p><p>“Persuaded as we are that beasts have intelligence, have we not all of us a
                    thousand times pitied them for the excessive evils which the majority of them
                    are exposed to, and in reality suffer? How unhappy is the condition of horses!
                    we are apt to say upon seeing a horse whom an unmerciful carman is murdering
                    with blows. How miserable is the dog whom they are breaking for hunting! How
                    dismal is the fate of beasts living in woods! they are perpetually exposed to
                    the injuries of the weather; always seized with apprehensions of becoming the
                    prey of hunters, or of some wilder animal; for ever obliged, after long fatigue,
                    to look out for some poor insipid food; often suffering cruel hunger; and
                    subject, moreover, to illness and death! If men are subject to a multitude of
                    miseries that overwhelm them, religion acquaints us with the reason of it, viz.
                    the being born sinners. But what crimes can beasts have committed by birth to be
                    subject to evils so very cruel? What are we, then, to think of die horrible
                    excesses of miseries undergone by beasts? miseries, indeed, far greater than
                    those endured by men. This is, in any other system, an incomprehensible mystery;
                    whereas nothing is more easy to be conceived from the system I propose. The
                    rebellious spirits deserve a punishment still more rigorous, and happy it is for
                    them that their punishment is deferred. In a word, God’s goodness is vindicated,
                    man himself is justified; for ∖vhat right can we have, without necessity, and
                    often in the way of mere diversion, to take away the lives of millions of
                    beasts, if God had not authorized us so to do? And beasts being as sensible as
                    ourselves of pain and death, how could a just and merciful God have given man
                    that privilege, if they were not so many guilty victims of the divine
                    vengeance?</p><p>“But hear still something more convincing, and of greater consequence. Beasts by
                    nature are extremely vicious. We know well that they never sin, because they are
                    not free; but this is the only condition wanting to make them sinners. The
                    voracious birds and beasts of pŗey are cruel. Many insects of one and the same
                    species devour one another. Cats are perfidious and ungrateful, monkeys are
                    mischievous, and dogs envious. All beasts in general are jealous and revengeful
                    to excess, not to mention many other vices we observe in them; and at the same
                    time that they are by nature so very vicious, they have, say we, neither the
                    liberty nor any helps to resist the bias that hurries them into so many bad
                    actions. They are, according to the schools, necessitated to do evil, to
                    disconcert the general order, to commit whatever is most contrary to the notion
                    we have of natural justice and to the principles of virtue. What monsters are
                    these in a world originally created for order and justice to reign in? This is,
                    in good part, what formerly persuaded the Manicheans that there were of
                    necessity two orders of things, one good and the other bad; and that the beasts
                    were not the work of the good principle: a monstrous error! But how then shall
                    we believe that beasts came out of the hands of their Creator with qualities so
                    very strange! If man is so very wicked and corrupt, it is because he has himself
                    through sin perverted the happy nature that God had given him at his creation.
                    Of two things then we must say one; either that God has taken delight in making
                    beasts so vicious as they arc, and of giving us in them models of what is most
                    shameful in the world; or that they have, like man, original sin, which has
                    perverted their primitive nature.</p><p>“The first of these propositions finds very difficult access to the mind, and is
                    an express contradiction to the holy Scriptures, which say, that whatever came
                    out of God’s hands at the time of the creation of the world was good, yea very
                    good. What good can there be in a monkey’s being so very mischievous, a dog so
                    full of envy, a cat so malicious? But then many authors have pretended that
                    beasts, before man’s fall, were different from what they are now; and that it
                    was in order to punish man that they became so wicked. But this opinion is a
                    mere supposition, of which there is not the least footstep in holy Scripture. It
                    is a pitiful subterfuge to elude a real difficulty. This at most might be said
                    of the beasts, with whom man has a sort of correspondence; but not at all of the
                    birds, fishes, and insects, which have no manner of relation to him. We must
                    then have recourse to the second-proposition, that the nature of beasts has,
                    like that of man, been corrupted by some original sin: another hypothesis, void
                    of foundation, and equally inconsistent with reason and religion, in all the
                    systems which have been hitherto espoused concerning the souls of beasts. What
                    party are. we to take? Why, admit of my system, and all is explained. The souls
                    of beasts are refractory spirits, which have made themselves guilty towards God.
                    The sin in beasts is no original sin; it is a personal crime, which has
                    corrupted and perverted their nature in its whole substance; hence all the vices
                    and corruption <hi rend="italic">we</hi> observe in them, though they can be no
                    longer criminal, because God, by irrevocably reprobating them, has at the same
                    time divested them of their liberty.”</p><p>These quotations contain the strength of Father Bou-geant’s hypothesis, which
                    also has had its followers; but the reply to it is very obvious. Beasts, though
                    remarkably mischievous, are not completely so; they are in many instances
                    capable of gratitude and love, which devils cannot possibly be. The very same
                    passions which are implanted in the brutes exist in the human nature; and if we
                    choose to argue frorn the existence of those passions, and the ascendency they
                    at some times have over mankind, we may say with as great justice that the souls
                    of men are devils, as that the souls of brutes are devils. All that can
                    reasonably be inferred from the greater prevalency of the malignant passions
                    among the brutes than among men, is, that the former have less rationality than
                    men; and accordingly it is found’that among savages, who exercise their reason
                    less than other men, every species of barbarity is practised without being
                    deemed a crime.</p><p>On the present subject there is a very ingenious treatise in German, published by
                    Professor Bergman, under the title of “Researches designed to show what the
                    brute animals certainly <hi rend="italic">are not,</hi> and also what they
                    probably <hi rend="italic">arc."</hi> That they are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                    machines, he proves with more <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741071" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1071-0616"/>detail than seemed necessary for refuting a
                    hypothesis which would equally tend to make us all machines. It is certain that
                    the half-reasoning elephant cannot be deemed a machine by us, from any other
                    consideration than that he goes upon four feet, while we go upon two; and he
                    might as well take us for mere machines, because we go upon two feet, while he
                    goes upon four.</p><p>But if animals are not mere machines, what are they? Manifestly sensitive beings,
                    with an immaterial principle; and thinking or reasoning beings to a certain
                    degree. In certain classes of animals this appears evident to our author, who
                    seems to have observed with great sagacity and attention their various
                    operations and proceedings, their ways and means, &amp;c. He thinks it
                    impossible to deduce this variety of action, in any animals, if we except those
                    of the lowest classes in the gradation of intelligence, from a general and
                    uniform instinct. For they accommodate their operations to times and
                    circumstances. They combine; they choose the favourable moment; they avail
                    themselves of the occasion, and seem to receive instruction by experience. Many
                    of their operations announce reflection: the bird repairs a shattered nest,
                    instead of constructing instinctively a new one; the hen who has been robbed of
                    her eggs changes her place in order to lay the remainder with more security; the
                    cat discovers both care and artifice in concealing her kittens. Again, it is
                    evident that on many occasions animals know their faults and mistakes, and
                    correct them; they sometimes contrive the most ingenious methods of obtaining
                    their ends, and when one method fails have recourse to another; and they have,
                    without doubt, a kind of language for the mutual communication of their ideas.
                    How is all this to be accounted for, says our author, unless we suppose them
                    endowed with the powers of perceiving, thinking, remembering, comparing,, and
                    judging? They have these powers, indeed, in a degree inferior to that in which
                    they are possessed by the human species, and form classes below them in the
                    graduated scale of intelligent beings. But still it seems to our author
                    unreasonable to exclude them from the place which the principles of sound
                    philosophy, and facts ascertained by constant observation, assign to them in the
                    great and diversified sphere of life, sensation, and intelligence. He does not,
                    however, consider them as beings whose actions are directed to moral ends, nor
                    consequently as accountable and proper subjects for reward or punishment in a
                    future world.</p><p>That brute animals possess reflection and sentiment, and are susceptible of the
                    kindly as well as the irascible passions, independently of sexual attachment and
                    natural affection, is evident from the numerous instances of affection and
                    gratitude daily observable in different animals, particularly the dog. Of these
                    and other sentiments, such as pride, and even a sense of glory, the elephant
                    exhibits proofs equally surprising and indubitable.</p><p>As to the natural affection of brutes, says an ingenious writer, “the more I
                    reflect on it the more I am astonished at its effects. Nor is the violence of
                    this affection more wonderful than the shortness of its duration. Thus every hen
                    is in her turn the virago of the yard, in proportion to the helplessness of her
                    brood; and will fly in the face of a dog or a sow, in defence of those chickens
                    which in a few weeks she will drive before her with relentless cruelty. This
                    affection sublimes the passions, quickens the invention, and sharpens the
                    sagacity of the brute creation. Thus a hen, just become a mother, is no longer
                    that placid bird she used to be; but, with feathers standing on end, wings
                    hovering, and clocking note, she runs about like one possessed. Dams will throw
                    themselves in the way of the greatest danger, in order to avert it from their
                    progeny, lhus a partridge will tumble along before a sportsman, in order to draw
                    away the dogs from her helpless covey. In the time of nidification the most
                    feeble birds will assault the most rapacious. All the hirundines of a village
                    are up in arms at the sight of a hawk, whom they will persecute till he leaves
                    that district. A very exact observer has often remarked, that a pair of ravens
                    nestling in the rock of Gibraltar would suffer no vulture or eagle to rest near
                    their station, but would drive them from the hill with amazing fury; even the
                    blue thrush, at the season of breeding, would dart out from the clefts of the
                    rocks to chase away the kestrel or the sparrow-hawk. If you stand near the nest
                    of a bird that has young, she will not be induced to betray them by an
                    inadvertent fondness, but will wait about at a distance with meat in her mouth
                    for an hour together. The fly-catcher builds every year in the vines that grow
                    on the walls of my house. A pair of these little birds had one year
                    inadvertently placed their nest on a naked bough, perhaps in a shady time, not
                    being aware of the inconvenience that followed; but a hot sunny season coming on
                    before the brood was half fledged, the reflection of the wall became
                    insupportable, and must inevitably have destroyed the tender young, had not
                    affection suggested an expedient, and prompted the parent-birds to hover over
                    the nest all the hotter hours, while with wings expanded and mouths gaping for
                    breath they screened off the heat from their suffering offspring. A further
                    instance I once saw of notable sagacity in a willow-wren, which had built in a
                    bank in my fields. This bird a friend and myself had observed as she sat in her
                    nest; but were particularly careful not· to disturb her, though we saw she eyed
                    us with some degree of jealousy. Some days after, as we passed that way, we were
                    desirous of remarking how this brood went on; but no nest could be found, till I
                    happened to take up a large bundle of long green moss, as it were carelessly
                    thrown over the nest in order to dodge the eye of any impertinent intruder.”
                    (White’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History of Selborne.')</hi></p><p>A wonderful spirit of sociality in the brute creation, independent of sexual
                    attachment, has been frequently remarked. Many horses, though quiet with
                    company, will not stay one minute in a field by themselves; nor can the
                    strongest fences restrain them. A horse has been known to leap out at a stable
                    window through which dung was thrown, after company. Oxen and cows will not
                    fatten by themselves, but will neglect the finest pasture that is not
                    recommended by society. It would be needless to instance sheep, which
                    constantly’ flock together. But this propensity seems not to be confined to
                    animals of the same species.</p><p>Even great disparity of kind and size does not always prevent social advances and
                    mutual fellowship. Of this the following remarkable instance is given in the
                    work above quoted: “A very intelligent and observant person has assured me, that
                    in the former part of his life, keeping but one horse, he happened also on a
                    time to have but One solitary hen. These two incongruous animals spent much of
                    their time together in a lonely orchard, where they saw no creature but each
                    other. By degrees an apparent regard began to take place between these two
                    sequestered individuals. The fowl would approach the quadruped with notes of
                    complacency, rubbing herself gently against his legs; while the horse would look
                    down with satisfaction, and move with the greatest caution and circumspection,
                    lest he should trample on his diminutive companion. Thus by mutual good offices
                    each seemed to console the vacant hours of the other; so that Milton, when he
                    puts the following sentiment in the mouth of Adam, seems to be somewhat
                    mistaken:</p><lg part="N"><l part="N"> Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl, </l><l part="N"> So well converse, nor with the ox the ape.” </l></lg><pb break="no" facs="nls:193741084" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1084-0617"/><p>To such an instance of attachment between incongruous animals from a spirit of
                    sociality or the feelings of sympathy, may be added the following instance of
                    fondness from a different motive, recounted by Mr White, in the work already
                    quoted. “My friend had a little helpless leveret brought to him, which the
                    servants fed with milk in a spoon; and about the same time his cat kittened, and
                    the young were dispatched and buried. The hare was soon lost, and supposed to be
                    gone the way of most foundlings, or to be killed by some dog or cat. However, in
                    about a fortnight, as the master was sitting in his garden in the dusk of the
                    evening, he observed his cat, with tail erect, trotting towards him, and calling
                    with little short inward notes of complacency, such as they use towards their
                    kittens, apd something gambling after, which proved to be the leveret, which the
                    cat had supported with her milk, and continued to support with great affection.
                    Thus was a graminivorous animal nurtured by a carnivorous and predaceous
                    one.</p><p>“Why so cruel and sanguinary a beast as a cat, of the ferocious genus of <hi rend="italic">Felis,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">murium leo,</hi> as Linnaeus
                    calls it, should be affected with any tenderness towards an animal which is its
                    natural prey, is not so easy to determine. This strange affection probably was
                    occasioned by that desiderium, those tender maternal feelings, which the loss of
                    her kittens had awakened in her breast, and by the complacency and ease she
                    derived to herself from the procuring her teats to be drawn, which were too much
                    distended with milk, till from habit she became as much delighted with this
                    foundling as if it had been her real offspring.</p><p>“This incident is no bad solution of that strange circumstance which grave
                    historians as well as the pocts assert, of exposed children being sometimes
                    nurtured by female wild beasts that probably had lost their young; for it is
                    notone whit more marvellous that Romulus and Remus, in their infant state,
                    should be nursed by a she-wolf, than that a poor little sucking leveret should
                    be fostered and cherished by a bloody grimalkin.”</p><p>But besides the different qualities enumerated, besides reflection and sagacity
                    often in an astonishing degree, and besides the sentiments and actions prompted
                    by social or natural attachments, certain brutes seem on many occasions inspired
                    with a superior faculty, a kind of presentiment or second sight as it were, with
                    regard to events and designs altogether unforeseen by the rational beings whom
                    they concern. Of the faculty alluded to various instances will probably consist
                    with the knowledge or the recollection of most readers: we shall therefore only
                    recite the following, on account of its unquestionable authenticity. At the seat
                    of the Earl of Lichfield, three miles from Blenheim, there is a portrait in the
                    dining-room, of Sir Henry Lee, by Johnston, with that of a mastiff-dog which
                    saved his life. It seems a servant had formed the design of assassinating his
                    master and robbing the house; but the night he had fixed on, the dog, which had
                    never been much noticed by Sir Henry, for the first time followed him up stairs,
                    got under his bed, and could not be got from thence by either master or man: in
                    the dead of night the same servant entered the room to execute his horrid
                    design, but was instantly seized by the dog, and being secured, confessed his
                    intentions. Upon what hypothesis can we account for a degree of foresight and
                    penetration such as this? Or will it be suggested, as a solution of the
                    difficulty, that a dog may possibly become capable in a great measure of
                    understanding human discourse, and of reasoning and acting accordingly; and
                    that, in the present nstance, the villain had either uttered his design in soli-
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> quy, or imparted it to an accomplice, in the
                    hearing of he animal?</p><p>It has been much disputed whether the brutes have any language by which they can
                    express their minds to each other; or whether all the noise they make consists
                    only of cries inarticulate, and unintelligible even to themselves. We are,
                    however, too little acquainted with the intellectual faculties of these
                    creatures to be able to determine this point. Certain it is, that their
                    passions, when excited, are generally productive of some peculiar cry; but
                    whether this be designed as an expression of the passion to others, or only a
                    mechanical motion of the muscles of the larynx occasioned by the passion, is
                    what we have no means of knowing. We may, indeed, from analogy, conclude with
                    great reason, that some of the cries of beasts arc really expressions of their
                    sentiments; but whether one beast is capable of forming a design, and
                    communicating that design by any kind of language to others, is what we submit
                    to the judgment of the reader, after giving the following instance, which, with
                    others, is brought as a proof of it by Father Bougeant. “A sparrow finding a
                    nest that a martin had just built, standing very conveniently for him, possessed
                    himself of it. The martin, seeing the usurper in her house, called for help to
                    expel him. A thousand martins came full speed, and attacked the sparrow; but the
                    latter being covered on every side, and presenting only his large beak at the
                    entrance of the nest, was invulnerable, and made the boldest of them who durst
                    approach him repent of their temerity. After a quarter of an hour’s combat, all
                    the martins disappeared. The sparrow thought he had got the better, and the
                    spectators judged that the martins had abandoned their undertaking. Not in the
                    least. They immediately returned to the charge; and each of them having procured
                    a little of that tempered earth with which they make their nests, they all at
                    once fell upon the sparrow, and inclosed him in the nest to perish there, though
                    they could not drive him thence. Can it be imagined that the martins could have
                    been able to hatch and concert this design all of them together without speaking
                    to each other, or without some medium of communication equivalent to language ?”
