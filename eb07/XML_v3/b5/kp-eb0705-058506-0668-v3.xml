                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">BROACH</label>, a town and district of Hindustan, in the
                    province of Gujerat. The district is situated principally between the 21st and
                    22d degrees of north latitude, and it is bounded on the west by the Gulf of
                    Cambay. It is one of the best cultivated and most populous tracts on the west
                    coast of India, and was finally acquired by the Bombay presidency by the treaty
                    concluded with Scindia in 1803. This district, prior to its occupation by the
                    British, was greatly exposed to robberies; but since its final cession in 1803
                    it has enjoyed almost uninterrupted prosperity. Its chief annoyance has
                    proceeded from the adjacent countries, out <hi rend="italic">οι</hi> which such
                    gangs of armed Bheels have issued as entirely to set at defiance the ordinary
                    force of the police. The inhabitants of the district itself have been quiet,
                    orderly, and industrious, and the land is remarkably high priced.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Broach,</hi> the capital, is situated on an eminence on the
                    north bank of the Nerbuddah, twenty-five miles from the entrance of the river.
                    The houses are generally lofty, and the streets narrow and dirty. In the town
                    and vicinity are many dilapidated mosques and mausoleums. The town has a
                    considerable trade, and annually exports large quantities of raw and
                    manufactured, cotton to Bombay. Besides cotton, the principal exports are wheat,
                    joaree, <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> 'ce, and other grains; nuts, oil seeds,
                    and dyeing shrubs and plants. The water of the Nerbuddah is said to possess a
                    peculiar property in bleaching clothes to a pure white; yet the muslins are
                    inferior to those of Bengal, and the coloured chintzes to those on the
                    Coromandel coast, n 1772 this city was besieged by a British force under general
                    Wedderburne, brother to Lord Loughborough, P <hi rend="superscript"> 0 was</hi>
                    killed under its walls. It was stormed a few days atterwards. In 1782 it was
                    ceded, along with the district, ⅛cindia; but was again taken possession of in
                    1803 by an army under Colonel Woodington, and has ever since emained in
                    possession of the British. Broach is thought to have been the Barygaza of the
                    ancients; and when it surrendered to the emperor Acbar in 1572 it still
                    continued to be a p ace of great trade. In 1780 it was about two miles and a
                    half in circumference, and fortified in the oriental manner, with high walls,
                    perforated for musketry, and flanked with towers; forming, with its natural
                    advantages, an Asiatic fortress of considerable strength. The travelling
                    distance from Bombay is two hundred and twenty-one miles, from Oojein two
                    hundred and sixty-six, and from Poona two hundred and eighty-seven miles. Lone

                    rend="italic">Brocha,</hi> from the French <hi rend="italic">broche,</hi>
                    denotes an awl or bodkin; also a large packing needle. A spit, in some parts of
                    England, is called a <hi rend="italic">broach</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    from this word comes to pierce or broach a barrel. In Scotland, <hi

                    >brooch,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">brotche,</hi> is the name of an utensil which
                    the Highlanders used, like the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> of the Romans, to
                    fasten their vest or plaid. It is usually made of silver, of a round figure,
                    with a tongue crossing its diameter, to fasten the folds of the garment;
                    sometimes with two tongues, one on each side of a cross bar in the middle. There
                    are preserved in several families ancient brooches of very elegant workmanship,
                    and richly ornamented. Some of these are inscribed with names, to which
                    particular virtues used to be attributed; others are furnished with receptacles
                    for relics supposed to preserve the wearer from harm: so that these brooches
                    seem to have been worn not only for use, but as amulets. One or two of this sort
                    are figured and described by Mr Pennant, <hi rend="italic">Tour in
                    Scotland,</hi> i. 90, iii. 14, 3d. edit.</p>
