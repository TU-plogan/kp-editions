                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                    rend="smallcaps">le Clerc,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Count of,</hi> a celebrated
                    naturalist, was born at Montbard, in Burgundy, on the 9th of September 1707. His
                    father, Benjamin le Clerc, was a counsellor of the parliament of Dijon, and the
                    son was destined to the same office, if science had not drawn him away from the
                    law. He studied at Dijon; and his eager activity, his acuteness, penetration,
                    and robust constitution, fitted him to pursue business and pleasure with equal
                    ardour. His early passion was for astronomy, and the young Le Clerc was seldom
                    without Euclid in his pocket. At the age of twenty he went with an English
                    nobleman (the young Duke of Kingston) and his tutor to Italy; but he overlooked
                    the choicest remains of art, and amidst the ruins of an elegant and luxurious
                    people he first felt the charms of natural history, of which he afterwards
                    proved the zealous and successful admirer. On his return to France he fought, on
                    some accidental quarrel, with an Englishman, whom he wounded, and was obliged to
                    retire to Paris, where he translated Newton’s Fluxions from the Latin, and
                    Hales’s Statics from the English, into the French language. He afterwards went
                    to England at the age of twenty-five, and remained there about three months.
                    This concluded his travels. At the age of twenty-one he succeeded to the estate
                    of his mother, which was valued at about 300,000 livres, or L.12,000 sterling;
                    and he was one of those whose easy or affluent circumstances urge them on to
                    literary pursuits, and clear the path of some of its thorns. Perhaps this was
                    the period of his retirement to Montbard, where he spent much time, and where
                    his leisure was little interrupted; for whilst he resided in the capital, his
                    office of intendant of the king’s garden and cabinet occupied much of his time.
                    He loved company much, and was partial to the fair; but he loved fame more. He
                    spent fourteen hours every day in study; yet when we examine the extent of his
                    knowledge and the number of his works, we wonder at his having executed so much
                    even in that time. At five in the morning he retired to a pavilion in his vast
                    gardens, and he was then inaccessible. This was, as Prince Henry of Prussia
                    called it, the cradle of natural history; but she was indifferently
                    accommodated. The walls were naked; and an old writing-table, with pen, ink, and
                    paper, and an elbow chair of black leather, were the only furniture of his
                    study. His manuscripts were in a cabinet in another building, and he went
                    occasionally from one to the another. The eras of Buffon’s works are pretty well
                    known. When each was finished it was put aside, in order that he might forget
                    it, and afterwards return to it with the severity of a critic. He was anxious to
                    render it perspicuous; and if those to whom he read his works hesitated a
                    moment, he changed the passage. The works of others he often read like
                    Magliabechi, confining himself to the titles, the contents, and the most
                    interesting parts; but he perused M. Neckars <hi rend="italic">Compte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Rendu,</hi> and the Administration of the Finances, at length, and
                    spoke of them with no little enthusiasm. His favourite authors were Fenelon,
                    Montesquieu, and Richardson.</p>
                <p>M. de Buffon’s conversation was unadorned, rarely animated, but sometimes very
                    cheerful. He was exact in his dress, particularly in arranging his hair. He sat
                    long at table, and then seemed at his ease. His conversation was at this time
                    unembarrassed, and his guests had frequently occasion to notice some happy turn
                    of phrase, or some' deep reflection. His complaisance was very considerable. He
                    loved praise, it is true, and even praised himself; but it was with such
                    frankness, and with so little contempt of others, that it was never
                    disagreeable. Indeed, when we consider the extent of his reputation, the credit
                    of his works, and the attention with which they were always received, we need
                    not wonder that he was sensible of his own value. It would perhaps have
                    displayed a stronger mind to have concealed it. His father lived to the age of
                    ninety-three, and almost adored his son; his grandfather to that of
                    eighty-seven; and the subject of the present article exceeded eighty. He died in
                    April 1788. Fifty-six stones were found in his bladder; and if he had consented
                    to the operation of lithotomy, he might probably have lived longer. He left one
                    son, who, near a high tower in the gardens of Montbard, erected a low column,
                    with an inscription, to his memory. This son fell a victim to the tyranny of
                    Robespierre during the reign of terror in France.</p>
