                    historian, philologer, and biographer, was born at Augsburg on the 22d of
                    January 1696. His father, who was a respectable burgher, destined him for the
                    church; and his own inclinations according with his father’s wishes, he was
                    sent, at the usual age, to pursue his studies in the university of Jena. Here he
                    took the degree of master of arts in 1718; and in the following year he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Tentamen Introductionis</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">Pistoriam</hi><hi rend="italic">doctrinae de</hi><hi rend="italic">Ideis,</hi> in 4to; a work which, having afterwards amplified
                    and completed, he republished under the title of <hi rend="italic">Pistoria
                    Philosophica</hi><hi rend="italic">doctrinae de</hi><hi rend="italic">Ideis,</hi> at Augsburg in 1723. He returned to bis native city in 1720; but
                    here his merit having attracted envy rather than recompense, he was induced to
                    accept of the office of parish minister of Kaufbevern in 1723. In the same year
                    he published a memoir <hi rend="italic">De Vita</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Scriptis</hi><hi rend="italic">Cl. Etingeri,</hi> Augs. 8vo. His reputation
                    having been at length established by these learned works, in 1731 he was elected
                    a member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and soon afterwards he was
                    invited to Augsburg to fill the honourable situation of pastor and senior
                    minister of the church of St Ulric. He published in the same year three
                    dissertations relating to the history of philosophy, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Otium Vindelicum, sive</hi><hi rend="italic">Meletematmn

                    Besides several smaller dissertations on biography and literary history, printed
                    at different times, and which he afterwards collected in his <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea,</hi> h <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> published at Ulm, in 1737, <hi rend="italic">Neue</hi><hi rend="italic">Zusaet</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"> z</hi><hi rend="italic">e verschiedne</hi><hi rend="italic                     subscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">Vermehrungen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">zu</hi><hi rend="italic">den kurtzen</hi><hi rend="italic">Fragen</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> α</hi><hi rend="italic">us</hi><hi rend="italic">der Philosophischen</hi><hi rend="italic">histone,</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi> vols. 12mo. This work, being a history of philosophy in
                    question and answer, contains many details, especially in the department of
                    literary history, which he has chosen to omit m his greater work on the same
                    subject. He was forced by the booksellers, in opposition to his own opinion, to
                    adopt the erotematic method, which at that time had been rendered pooular by the
                    writings of Hubner and Rambach.</p><p>In 1741, at Leipsic, appeared the first volume of his great work, <hi rend="italic">Pistoria Critica</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophiae,</hi><hi rend="italic">a mundi incunabulis</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">nostram usque cetatem deducta.</hi> Four other ponderous quartos,
                    completing the first edition of this elaborate history, followed in 1744. Such
                    was the success of this publication, that the first impression, consisting of
                    four thousand copies, was exhausted in twenty-three years, when a new and more
                    perfect edition, the consummation of the labours of half a century devoted to
                    the history of philosophy, was in 1767 given to the world in six volumes quarto.
                    The sixth volume, consisting entirely of supplement and corrections, is
                    applicable to the first as well as to the second edition. Of the merits of this
                    work we shall speak in the sequel.</p><p>His attention, however, was not wholly occupied by this stupendous undertaking.
                    The following books would of themselves have been sufficient to exhaust the

                    accomplished by Teller. He died at Augsburg in 1770; and he may be added to the
                    catalogue of Huetius, to prove that literary labour is not incompatible with
                    sound health and longevity. (See <hi rend="italic">Saxii Oηοmastico</hi><hi rend="italic">; Biographie Universelle;</hi> Gesner’s <hi rend="italic">Isagoge.}</hi></p><p>It is only by his writings on the history of philosophy that Brucker is now known
                    in the literature of Europe. In this study his great work forms an important
                    era, and even at the present day it is the most extensive and elaborate upon the

                    his details, he wou <pb break="no" facs="nls:193740993" xml:id="kp-eb0705-0993-0610"/>have left us a work which might have had some
                    pretensions to be considered as a rational history of human opinion. He lived,
                    however, at a period when these different qualities were only beginning to be
                    conjoined, and when as yet the history of philosophy had been written merely as
                    a chronicle of the passing theories of individuals and sects. To give to the
                    science of history a regular and connected form, and to arrange the narrative of
                    successive events, and still more of successive opinions, according to the
                    relation they bear to principles of established influence, was an attempt of
                    which few in that age had any conception, and of which Brucker certainly had
                    none. In civil history it was then believed that the historian had fulfilled all
                    the duties of his office if he strung together the events which were known or
                    believed to have occurred, in good language, and garnished them occasionally by
                    a few general reflections on the absolute motives of human action. A very
                    different notion is now held of the functions of the historian. He who at
                    present attempts to write the history of any country, must reflect, before he
                    begins, what were the chief occurrences in that history, and what were the
                    revolutions which the manners and constitution of that particular nation have
                    undergone. He must bea∙r with him, from the commencement to the conclusion of
                    his labours, a constant impression that every occurrence should be more or less
                    considered, not only as it took place, and as it bore an influence on
                    contemporary affairs, but as it may have remotely contributed to the events, and
                    the opinions, and the character of succeeding times. But if this be true in
                    regard to the histories of particular nations, it is evident that, by how much
                    the traces of opinions are more light and evanescent than those of events,— by
                    how much the speculations of philosophers whose writings have either perished or
                    come down to us mutilated and obscure, are more difficult to be appreciated in
                    their causes, and connections, and consequences, than the actions of warriors
                    and statesmen,—by so much the more is it necessary in philosophical than <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> in civil history to combine reasoning with erudition,
                    and to substitute the researches of the philosopher for the details of the
                    chronicler. History and philosophy are two different things; and he who would
                    write the history of philosophy must excel in both. Bacon had long ago required
                    this union, and had pointed out the manner in which the historian of literature
                    should endeavour to establish those principles of connection which constitute
                    the soul and charm of such a history; how, by detecting, the union of effects
                    and causes, he might be enabled to determine the circumstances favourable or
                    adverse to the sciences; and how, in short, by a species of enchantment he might
                    evoke the literary genius of each different age. The fulfilment of this plan
                    was, however, far beyond the capacity of Brucker, and was an undertaking of
                    which he had even no conception. Better qualified by nature and education for
                    amassing than arranging materials, he devoted his principal attention to a
                    confused compilation of facts, leaving to others their application, the
                    discovery of their mutual connections, and the formation of the scattered
                    fragments into a whole.</p><p>The merit of his great work consists entirely in the ample collection of
                    materials. The reader who would extract any rational view of the progress of
                    opinion must peruse it with a perpetual commentary of his own thoughts. He will
                    find no assistance from his author in forming any general views, or in tracing
                    the mutual dependencies of the different parts of the subject. Brucker has
                    discovered the fountains of history, but he has made us drink of them without
                    purifying the draught. Even in this respect his merit has been greatly
                    overrated. Vast as is the body of materials which he has collected, we are
                    always missing those very things which we might reasonably have expected would
                    have been the first objects of a rational inquirer, and we are continually
                    disappointed of the information we are most anxious to acquire. The idle and
                    slavish attention which he has bestowed on previous compilers, has frequently
                    diverted him from the study of the original authors themselves. Quoting the
                    passages of the ancients from others, or trusting, perhaps, to the reference of
                    an index, he has frequently overlooked those very testimonies which could have
                    given us the most authentic knowledge of the opinions or characters of ages and
                    individuals. He has often presented the authorities he has adduced, mutilated or
                    misapplied; and this either from not having sufficiently studied these passages
                    in their general connection with the system they illustrate, or from having been
                    unable to withdraw them from the obscurity in which they were involved. He has
                    shown no critical sagacity in distinguishing the spurious from the authentic, or
                    in balancing the comparative weight of his authorities. He has frequently
                    transcribed where he ought to have explained the words of the original authors;
                    and without taking into account the different value of the same term in
                    different nations and ages, he has left us to apply a doubtful or erroneous
                    meaning to words which might have been easily rendered by other expressions, and
                    to suppose a distinction in the sense where there only existed a difference in
                    the language. The glaring errors, even, which occasionally occur in his
                    expositions of the Grecian philosophy, while they are inconsistent with any
                    critical knowledge of the tongue, would make us suspect that he was in the habit
                    of relying on the treacherous aid of translations. In short, if we knew nothing
                    more of the ancient philosophers than what we acquire from Bruςker, we should be
                    often obliged to attribute to them opinions so obscure, or so absurd, that we
                    must either believe ourselves wrong in the interpretation, or be unable to
                    comprehend the cause of all the admiration and reverence they have received.</p><p>He has discovered little skill in his analysis of the different systems of
                    philosophy; and the confusion of what is essential and principal with what is
                    accidental and subordinate clearly evinces that these abridgments were thrown
                    together while acquiring, in detail, a knowledge expressly for the purpose,
                    instead of being the consummation of a long and familiar meditation on the
                    subjects in all their modificationsand dependencies. He has dwelt with the most
                    irksome minuteness on every unimportant and doubtful circumstance in the lives
                    of the philosophers; but he has too often overlooked the particular and general
                    causes that produced an influence on the destinies of their philosophy. The
                    aphoristic method which he has adopted prevents him from following a consecutive
                    argument throughout its various windings. The most convincing reasoning in his
                    hands loses much of its demonstration and beauty; and every ingenious paradox
                    comes forth from his alembic a mere <hi rend="italic">caput mortwm∙r~⅛</hi>
                    residue from which every finer principle has been expelled. Where the genius of
                    the philosopher is discovered more in the exposition and defence than in the
                    origina selection and intrinsic stability of his tenets, Brucker has not found
                    the art of doing justice both to the philosopher and his opinions, or of
                    conveying to the reader any conception of the general value of the original.
                    Ibis last defect, it must, however, be acknowledged, is more or less inseparable
                    from every abstract of opinions, where it is <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ways
                    necessary to separate in some degree what is essen tial to the subject from what
                    is peculiar to the man. <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> has relieved the
                    sterility of his analysis by none o *∙ ae elegancies of which the subject was
                    susceptible, v∖ιt <hi rend="superscript"> 10</hi> ^ any pretension to purity,
                    his diction is defective even <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741006" xml:id="kp-eb0705-1006-0611"/>precision; and his sentences, at all times void of
                    harmony and grace, are abrupt, and often intricate in their structure.</p><p>The person, therefore, who would attempt to write a history of philosophy without
                    the imperfections of that of Brucker, must draw from obscurity many important
                    facts hitherto omitted; he must arrange and combine these in a more perspicuous
                    order; and, above all, he must review the opinions he shall thus relate and
                    methodise with a more accurate criticism. He ought not to write of Peripatetics
                    like a disciple of Aristotle, of Platonists like a pupil of Proclus, nor of the
                    doctrines of the Porch like a follower of Zeno. Still less must he compare the
                    tenets of one sect by the principles of another; or endeavour to estimate
                    doctrines, dubious in themselves, by reference to a standard equally arbitrary
                    and contingent. He must place himself, to use the language of Lucretius, upon
                    the highest pinnacle of the temple of science, from which he may look calmly
                    back, and compare and study the doctrines of all these departed sages, without
                    being himself involved in the partialities of particular sects or opinions,—</p><lg part="N"><l part="N"> Despicere unde queat alios, passimque videre </l><l part="N"> Errare, atque viam palanteis quaerere veri. </l></lg><p>He must honour the genius of all alike, and believe that all are deserving of
                    commendation, although all are more or less subject to error. He ought, in
                    short, to be a philosopher superior even to the prejudices of philosophy.</p><p>If we take a survey of what has been attempted since the death of Brucker in
                    accomplishing a more perfect history of philosophy, we shall find that more has
                    been done in illustrating the philosophical tenets of particular sects, or the
                    progress of particular portions of science, than in giving a comprehensive view
                    of the general history of thought. In France, in Italy, and in our own country,
                    those who have laboured in this department, far from being able to correct the
                    errors of Bruckcr, have, in general, through defect of erudition, been wholly
                    indebted to his industry for their materials, and have been content to rely on
                    his accuracy with more than Pythagorean faith. If we except some ingenious
                    speculations, which are more of the nature of philosophical essays on the
                    history of philosophy, and which endeavour rather to illustrate the general
                    spirit than to detail the particular opinions of the philosophers, there is
                    nothing valuable on this subject to be found in the literature of these
                    countries. Among the learned of his own country Brucker has never enjoyed a very
                    distinguished reputation; and the Germans, while they were the most capable of
                    discovering his defects, have had the honour of most sedulously and successfully
                    endeavouring to supply them. We are indebted to them especially for many
                    valuable treatises on the history of particular portions of philosophy, in which
                    we find at Iength a profound reasoning united to an extensive and original
                    erudition. The works of Meiners, Fulleborn, Tiedmann, and perhaps Buhle, deserve
                    especially to be distinguished. An undertaking, however, which, from the extent
                    of its plan, as well as the ability of its execution, claims particular notice,
                    is the <hi rend="italic">History of Philosophy,</hi> by Professor Tenneman of
                    Jena. This work, as far as it is completed, affords us the most accurate, the
                    most minute, and the most rational view we yet possess of the different systems
                    of philosophy, in their intrinsic and relative bearings. The author has not only
                    given us a minute analysis of each system, the result of a profound and familiar
                    study of the original philosopher, but he has also displayed to us his
                    philosophy, divested of its peculiarities, and compared with others by a general
                    and impartial review. The main defect of this work, at least in reference to
                    readers not German, is, that, like Buhle and the other disciples of Kant, he has
                    taken the criti cal philosophy as the vantage-ground from which to make his
                    survey of all former systems. Thus the continual reference to the peculiar
                    doctrines of the school of Kant, and the adoption of its language, render it
                    frequently im- ' possible for those who have not studied the dark works of this
                    modern Heraclitus to understand the strictures of Tenneman on the systems even
                    of Aristotle or Plato, (v v.)</p></div></body></text></TEI>
