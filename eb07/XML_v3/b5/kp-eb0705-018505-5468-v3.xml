                    however, has not been exclusively applied to the alloy of these metals; for the
                    gunmetal, which has been also called brass, is an alloy of copper with tin. The
                    same alloy, with more tin, is used in machinery, and is preferred to the alloy
                    of copper and zinc, on account of its greater hardness.</p>
                <p>It appears from the analysis of the brass of the ancients that it was an alloy of
                    copper and tin. A small portion of tin gives to copper great hardness, and
                    renders it capable of bearing much greater resistance. A larger portion of tin
                    gives increased hardness, but is less fitted to bear a straining resistance, on
                    account of its brittleness. Its elasticity is very great, which fits it for
                    bells. In this state it is called bell-metal; and with a still greater
                    proportion of tin it forms an alloy employed for the mirrors of reflecting
                    telescopes. The alloy of copper with tin is easily distinguished from that with
                    zinc, from the agreeable colour of the latter, which varies with the proportions
                    of the metals. Pinchbeck has the least proportion of zinc. Common brass has more
                    zinc, and the gold-coloured alloy called prince’s metal contains a still greater
                    proportion of zinc. An alloy of copper with a very large proportion of zinc is
                    used for the common white metal buttons.</p>
                <p>i The various alloys of copper with tin and zinc forming the different kinds of
                    brass, are to be considered as chemical compounds, and, of course, governed by
                    the same laws of definite proportions which obtain in the more conspicuous
                    compounds. On these principles, which cannot be doubted, we have an unerring
                    rule for uniting these and other metals in the best proportions, the weights of
                    their atoms being previously known.</p>
                <p>The weight of the atom of copper being 8, tin 7∙35, and zinc 4, the following
                    tables exhibit the proportions of the various alloys, expressed in atoms, and
                    their proportions by weight, the third column pointing out the colour and
                    character of the resulting compound. CZ and T are to represent the atoms of the
                    metals respectively.</p>

                <p>Hitherto the proportions of these alloys have depended upon the practice of
                    workmen, guided by numerous trials; but what confirms the law of definite
                    proportions, is the necessity of adhering to fixed proportions, ascertained by
                    trial. By attending to the proportions pointed out in the above tables, the most
                    striking and proper compounds will be produced, without the trouble of trying.
                    Any intermediate proportions will, doubtless, be marked by defective colour,
                    irregular crystallization, or imperfect malleability.</p>
                <p>Although the most direct way of forming these different kinds of brass is by
                    immediately combining the metals together, one of them, which is most properly
                    called brass, was manufactured long before ziric, one of its component parts,
                    was known in its metallic form. The ore of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193735481" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5481-0186"/>latter metal was cemented
                    with sheets of copper, charcoal being present; and the zinc was united with the
                    copper, without becoming visible in a distinct form. The same method is still
                    practised for making brass.</p>
                <p>The materials used in making brass are copper in small round masses, produced by
                    passing the melted metal through an appropriate vessel into water, in which
                    state it is called shot copper; and calamine, an ore of zinc. This latter
                    substance is a carbonate of zinc, often containing some oxide of iron, which
                    gives it a reddish appearance. As it is chiefly found in combination with lead,
                    the lumps frequently contain more or less gallena, which requires to be
                    separated by the same means as those employed for purifying lead ore. The
                    calamine is first reduced to powder, and the lead is then separated by washing.
                    When the calamine is separated, reduced to powder, and sifted, it is heated upon
                    the hearth of a reverberatory furnace. This expels the volatile matter, which is
                    principally water and carbonic acid. What remains is principally oxide of zinc,
                    abounding with some earthy matter, and probably much carbonic acid, which is not
                    all expelled by the heat. The calamine thus prepared, charcoal powder, and
                    copper, are the materials to be operated upon. The proportions in which they are
                    mixed together are equal weights of copper and prepared calamine, and ⅛th their
                    weight of powdered charcoal.</p>
                <p>This mixture, intimately blended, is compressed into a crucible of the form of
                    fig. 3, Plate CXXVII. One of these crucibles holds about 100 lbs. of brass when
                    the process is finished; but as this consists of the pure copper and zinc, the
                    pot, when charged, will contain of copper 66 ’ 3 lbs., of calamine 63 lbs., and
                    of charcoal powder 13 lbs. When the crucible is filled, the contents should be
                    covered with a mixture of clay sand and horse-dung, in order to defend the
                    metals and charcoal from the action of the air. When this covering is strictly
                    attended to, less charcoal powder may be employed, and a larger dose of the
                    other ingredients may be put in its place; but it is generally the most
                    defective part of the process.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1, Plate CXXVII., is a plan of the furnace. The part AB is taken at the
                    level EF, showing the opening into the furnace on the ground floor at <hi

                <p>Fig. 2 is an elevation and section of the same furnace. AB shows a front view of
                    the pyramidal chimney, and the archway opening into it. CD is a section of the
                    same, through the middle of the fire-place 11. R,P,Q, is a vaulted passage going
                    across the building, and open at both ends for the admission of air, which
                    passes through the openings in the arch, into the fires. The bottom of the
                    furnace is not a common grate, but a thick plate of castmetal, perforated with
                    holes for the air to pass through; one hole being between each pot, as they are
                    seen arranged in fig. 1, at I, I, and also in the section at <hi rend="italic"
                    >x, y.</hi> When the pots are put upon the plate, the fire is not placed
                    immediately upon them, as it would not only injure them, but displace the
                    covering. To prevent this, the pots are first covered by some dried heath or
                    common brambles, which defend them for a time, when the fuel is thrown in. By
                    the time the brambles are consumed the coal will have coked upon the pots, and
                    thus act as a defence for the rest of the process. The fire is kept up from
                    twelve to twenty hours at the Cheudle brass-works in Staffordshire, from which
                    these drawings were taken. They cast twice in the twenty-four hours.</p>
                <p>After the refuse is skimmed off, the melted brass is cast into ingots if sold for
                    melting over again, and into plates if intended to be rolled into sheets or made
                    into wire. The plates are cast between large blocks of Cornwall stone. The lower
                    stone is fixed, and the face made even and smooth, by filling up the recesses of
                    the rough stone with fine sand. The upper stone is similarly prepared, and is
                    suspended, over the fixed one. The height and breadth of the place to receive
                    the metal is limited by iron bars laid on the lower stone. The upper stone is
                    then let down upon the bars. The lower stone is a little longer than the upper
                    one, and projects to the front. Being a little higher in that part, it forms a
                    lip or mouthpiece for receiving the metal. The flat sides of the cast plate are
                    therefore bounded by the surface of the stones, and the edges of these by the
                    bars above mentioned. The ingot moulds are recesses in blocks of cast-iron, open
                    on one side.</p>
                <p>The most certain and correct method of forming brass and the other compounds
                    expressed in the table above given, is by immediately uniting the metals in
                    given weights. It should, however, be observed, that it will he found difficult
                    to introduce zinc into melted copper. The best way of uniting it with copper, in
                    the first instance, is to introduce the copper in thin slips into the melted
                    zinc, till the alloy requires a considerable heat to fuse it, and then to unite
                    this alloy with the melted copper.</p>

                    tiles on the leet of the furnace, near the occhis, let it stand to be calcined
                    there for four days, and it will become a black powder sticking together in
                    lumps. Pulverize this, sift it fine, and recalcine it during four or five days
                    more; at the end of which time it will not stick together, but remain a loose
                    powder of a russet colour. This is to be calcined a third time in the same
                    manner; but great care must be taken in the third calcination that it be neither
                    overdone nor underdone. The way to be certain when it is right, is, to try it
                    several times in glass while melting. If it causes the glass, when well
                    purified, to swell, boil, and rise, it is properly calcined; if not, it requires
                    longer time. This, according to the different proportions in which it is used,
                    produces a sea-green, an emerald-green, or a turquoise colour.</p>
                <p>Brass, by long calcination alone, and without any mixture, affords a fine blue or
                    green colour for glass; but there is a method of calcining it also with powdered
                    brimstone, so as to make it afford a red, a yellow, or a chalcedony colour,
                    according to the quantity and other variations in the using of it. This method
                    of calcination is the following: Cut thin plates of brass into small pieces with
                    shears, and lay them <hi rend="italic">stratum super stratum,</hi> with
                    alternate beds of powdered sulphur, in a crucible ’, calcine this for
                    twenty-four hours in a strong fire, then powder and sift the whole, and finally
                    expose the powder upon tiles for twelve davs to a reverberating furnace, at the
                    end of which time powder it fine and keep it for use. The glass-makers have also
                    a method of precuring a red powder from brass by a more simple calcination,
                    which serves for many colours. The method of preparing it is this: They put
                    small and thin plates of brass into the arches of the glass furnaces, and leave
                    them there till they are sufficiently calcined, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193735494" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5494-0187"/>which the heat in that place,
                    not being sufficient to melt them, doos in great perfection. The calcined
                    matter, powdered, is of a dusky red, and requires no further preparation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">BRASS-Colour,</hi> one prepared by the braziers and colourmen
                    to imitate brass. There are two sorts of it, the red brass or bronze, and the
                    yellow or gilt brass. The latter is made only of copper-fiīings, the smallest
                    and brightest that can be found; with the former it is usual to mix some red
                    ochre, finely pulverized; and both are used with varnish. In order to make a
                    fine brass that will not take any rust or verdigris, it must be dried with a
                    chafing-dish of coals as soon as it is applied. The finest brass-colour is made
                    of powdered brass imported from Germany, diluted into a varnish, which is
                    prepared and used after the following manner: The varnish is composed of one
                    pound four ounces of spirits of wine, two ounces of gum-lae, and two ounces of
                    sandarae; these two last drugs being pulverized separately, and afterwards put
                    to dissolve in spirit of wine, and care being taken to fill the bottle but half
                    full. The varnish being made, mix a quantity of it with the pulverized brass,
                    and apply it with a small brush to that which it is intended to brass over. But
                    too much must not be mixed at once, because the varnish being very apt to dry,
                    it would not be possible to employ it all soon enough. It is therefore better to
                    make the mixture at several times. In this manner are brassed over figures of
                    plaster, which look almost as well as if they were of cast brass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Brass</hi><hi rend="italic">Leaf</hi> is made of
                    copper, beaten into very thin plates, and afterwards rendered yellow. The German
                    artists, particularly those of Nuremberg and Augsburg, are said to possess the
                    best method of giving to these thin plates of copper a fine yellow colour like
                    gold, by simply exposing them to the fumes of zinc, without any real mixture of
                    it with the metal. These plates are cut into little pieces, and then beaten out
                    fine like leaves of gold; after which they are put into books of coarse paper
                    and sold at a low price for the vulgar kinds of gilding. The parings or shreds
                    of these very thin yellow leaves, being well ground on a marble plate, are
                    rcduced to a powder similar to gold, which serves to cover, by means of
                    gum-water or some other glutinous fluid, the surface of various mouldings or
                    pieces of curious workmanship, giving them the appearance of real bronze, and
                    even of fine gold, at a very trifling expense, because the gold colour of this
                    metallie powder may be easily raised and improved by stirring it in a wide
                    earthen bason over a slow fire.</p>
