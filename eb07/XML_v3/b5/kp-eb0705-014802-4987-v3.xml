                <p><label type="entry">BOULTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Matthew</hi></label>, a
                    manufacturer and practical engineer of great celebrity, son of Matthew Boulton,
                    by his wife Christian, daughter of Mr Peers of Chester, was born at Birmingham
                    on the 14th of September 1728, and died in August 1809.</p>
                <p>He was educated at a neighbouring grammar-school, kept by Mr Ansted of Deritend,
                    and was called early into active life upon the death of his father in 1745. The
                    various processes by which the powers of the human mind have given facility to
                    the artist in rendering the different forms of matter obedient to his command,
                    afforded ample scope for the exercise of his inventive faculties, in improving
                    the manufactures of his native place. His first attempt was a new mode of
                    inlaying steel; and he succeeded in obtaining a considerable demand for the
                    products of his manufactory, which were principally exported to the Continent,
                    and not uncommonly re-imported for domestic use, as of foreign manufacture.</p>
                <p>In 1762, his fortune being already considerable, he purchased a tract of barren
                    heath in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, with a single house on it, and there
                    founded, at the expense of L.9000, the manufactory which has been so
                    flourishing, and so well known under the name of Soho. His workmen were at first
                    principally employed in the imitation of or moulu, and in copying oil paintings
                    with great accuracy, by means of a mechanical process which was invented by a Mr
                    Egginton, who afterwards distinguished himself by various works in stained
                    glass. Mr Boulton finding the force of horses inadequate to the various purposes
                    of his machinery, erected in 1767 a steam-engine, upon the original construction
                    of Savery, which, notwithstanding the inconvenience of a great loss of steam
                    from condensation, by its immediate contact with the water raised, has still
                    some advantages from the simplicity of the apparatus which it requires, and has
                    even lately been found to succeed well upon a small scale. But Mr Boulton’s
                    objects required a still more powerful machine, and he had the discernment to
                    perceive that they might be very completely attained by the adoption of the
                    various improvements lately made in the steamengine by Mr Watt of Glasgow, who
                    had obtained a patent for them in 1769, the privileges of which were extended in
                    1775, by an act of Parliament, to a term of 25 years. Mr Boulton induced this
                    ingenious and scientific inventor to remove to Birmingham. They commenced a
                    partnership in business, and established a manufactory of steam-engines, in
                    which accurate execution kept pace so well with judicious design, that its
                    productions continued to be equally in request with the public after the
                    expiration of the term of that legal privilege which at first gave the
                    proprietors the exclusive right of supplying them, and which had been confirmed
                    in 1792 by a decision of the Court of King’s Bench against some encroachments on
                    the right of the patentee. It was principally for the purpose of carrying on
                    this manufactory with greater convenience, that the proprietors established an
                    iron-foundery of their own at Smethwick, in the neighbourhood of Soho.</p>
                <p>In 1785 Mr Boulton was made a fellow of the Royal Society, about the same time
                    with Withering, and several others of his scientific neighbours. In 1788 he
                    turned his attention to the subject of coining, and erected machinery for the
                    purpose, so extensive and so complete, that the operation was performed with
                    equal economy and precision, and the coins could not be imitated by any single
                    artist for their nominal value; each of the stamps coining, with the attendance
                    of a little boy only, about eighty pieces in a minute. The preparatory operation
                    of laminating and cutting out the metal is performed in an adjoining room; and
                    all personal communication between the workmen employed is rendered unnecessary,
                    by the mechanical conveyance of the work from one part of the machinery to
                    another. A coinage of silver was executed at this mint for the Sierra Leone
                    Company, and another of copper for the East Indies, besides the pence and
                    halfpence at present in circulation throughout England, and a large quantity of
                    money of all kinds for Russia. In acknowledgment of Mr Boulton’s services, and
                    in return for some specimens of his différent manufactures, the Emperor Paul
                    made him a present of a valuable collection of medals and of minerals.</p>
                <p>Mr Boulton obtained, in 1797, a patent for a mode of raising water by impulse,
                    the specification of which is published in the ninth volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Repertory of Arts,</hi> p. 145. It had been demonstrated by Daniel
                    Bernoulli, in the beginning of the last century, that water flowing through a
                    pipe, and arriving at a part in which the pipe is suddenly contracted, would
                    have its velocity at first very greatly increased; but no practical application
                    of the principle appears to have been attempted, until an apparatus was set up
                    in 1792 by Mr Whitehurst, for Mr Egerton of Oui ton, in Cheshire, consisting of
                    an air-vessel, communicating with a water-pipe by a valve, which was forced open
                    by the pressure or rather impulse of the water, when its passage through the
                    pipe was suddenly stopped by turning the cock in the ordinary course of domestic
                    economy; and although the pipe through which the water was forced up was of
                    moderate height, the air-vessel, which was at first made of lead, was soon burst
                    by the “momentous force,” as Mr Whitehurst very properly terms it. The apparatus
                    had excited much attention in France, under the name of Montgolfier’s hydraulic
                    ram; and Mr Boulton added to it a number of ingenious modifications, some of
                    which, however, are more calculated to display the vivid imagination of a
                    projector, than the sound judgment of a practical engineer, which had in general
                    so strongly characterized all his productions.</p>
                <p>He died, after a long illness, in possession of considerable affluence and of
                    universal esteem, leaving a son and a daughter to profit by the wealth and
                    respectability which he had acquired. He was buried on the 24th of August, at
                    Handsworth, near Soho, attended by a procession of 600 workmen, and by a
                    numerous train of his friends and acquaintance. <hi rend="italic">(Monthly
