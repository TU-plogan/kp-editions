                <p><label type="entry">BOURBON</label>, an island in the Indian Sea, about 400 miles
                    to the east of Madagascar. It was discovered by the Portuguese in 1545, as
                    appears by a date inscribed by them upon a pillar when they first landed. They
                    gave it the name of Mascarenhas, but do not appear to have formed any
                    establishment; so that when the French settled in Madagascar, this island was
                    totally desolate. In 1642, De Pronis, agent for the French East India Company,
                    took possession of the island, but used it merely as a place of banishment for
                    offenders. The exiles, however, gave so favourable a report, that, in 1649, De
                    Harcourt, then governor of Madagascar, formed an extensive settlement, to which,
                    from the royal family of France, he gave the name of Bourbon. The colonists,
                    however, finding their situation uncomfortable, and receiving no support from
                    Madagascar, embraced the offer of an English captain, and in the year 1658
                    embarked for Madras. When the last great blow was given to the French at
                    Madagascar by the natives, who surprised and cut them off in one night, there
                    escaped as many men as, with their wives, who were natives, filled two canoes;
                    and these being driven by the wind on the isle of Bourbon, formed a fresh
                    colony, who, for want of an opportunity to remove, were constrained to remain in
                    and to cultivate it. It was not long before a further supply of inhabitants
                    arrived. A pirate who had been committing depredations in the Indian seas,
                    returning to Europe, ran ashore and had his vessel dashed to pieces on the
                    rocks, so that the crew were forced to join the former inhabitants; and as they
                    had on board their vessel a great many Indian women whom they had made
                    prisoners, they lived with them, and in process of time had a numerous
                    posterity. As East India ships touched frequently here when too late to double
                    the Cape, many of the sailors deserted and became planters in the isle of
                    Bourbon. When the place grew more populous, the people naturally became more
                    civilized, and desirous of living in a more commodious manner; which induced
                    them to build small vessels, and make trips to Madagascar in order to purchase
                    slaves, whom they employed in their plantations to cultivate aloes, tobacco, and
                    other products, with which they carried on a small trade when ships of any
                    nation anchored in their roads for refreshments. In this situation the French
                    East India Company put in their claim; and assuming the property of the island,
                    sent thither five or six families and a governor. At first the inhabitants
                    expected to reap some benefit from their new masters; but finding very little,
                    and considering the governor as tyrannical, they revolted at the instigation of
                    a priest, and seized and put him into a dungeon, where he died. Some of the
                    ringleaders were punished, a kind of fort was erected, and a few guns placed on
                    it; but in other respects, within the last forty years, the island was in no
                    state of defence. The number of inhabitants in the year 1717 was computed at
                    2000, viz. 900 free and 1100 slaves. When the present French India Company
                    became, by their charter, possessed of the island of Bourbon, they began very
                    diligently to improve it; raising new forts and batteries, so as to render it in
                    a manner inaccessible, and importing the coffee-tree from Arabia, which has
                    succeeded so well, that it has become an extensive object of culture, and is
                    considered as only second to that of Yemen. The clove-tree was also introduced
                    with success. In 1811 Bourbon was captured by a British force, but restored at
                    the general peace.</p>
                <p>The physical structure of this island presents many striking features. It does
                    not, like the Isle of France, consist of a level plain, from which conical hills
                    arise in detached masses. The whole island is as it were one mountain, having
                    its most elevated points in the centre, and thence sloping gradually down to the
                    sea. This great mass, however, is split into two portions, of which the
                    loftiest, situate in the northern part, is called the <hi rend="italic">Gros
                    Morne,</hi> and its summit the <hi rend="italic">Piton des Neiges</hi> or Snowy
                    Peak. There is here no present action of volcanic fire; but the frequent
                    occurrence of deep valleys or basins, rapid rivers bordered by perpendicular
                    walls of rock, hillocks precipitated into these valleys and torrents, basaltic
                    prisms often disposed in regular colonnades, strata thrown into the most
                    irregular positions,—all these, in Μ. Bory de St Vincent’s opinion, indicate
                    terrible physical revolutions in former times. The northern mountain is entirely
                    volcanic, and the phenomena present themselves in an extraordinary state of
                    frequency and activity. This writer not only conceives both these mountains to
                    have been originally volcanic, but the whole island to have been thrown up by
                    the action of subterranean fire. They appear to him also to have formerly
                    composed only one, having an intermediate summit higher than that of either now
                    is. The volcanic agitations, however, having hollowed the internal part of this
                    great mass, the exterior crust fell in, and reduced the island to the shattered
                    state which it now exhibits. To a great extent indeed it is divided into two
                    portions by an immense hollow, bordered with perpendicular walls of rock, which,
                    after running parallel for seven or eight miles, form an arch and unite. At the
                    foot of the volcano is found an immense track of what the inhabitants call <hi
                    rend="italic">Brulé,</hi> or burnt country, supposed to have been formed by the
                    lava spreading into a species of fiery lake, and then consolidating into the
                    present surface. It is destitute of all vegetation whatever; and its colour is
                    of the gloomiest black, the surface being broken by holes, crevices, and
                    innumerable asperities of every description. These, joined to its hard and
                    brittle consistence, render it impossible to tread on it without the severest
                    injury to the feet. Those of our traveller’s attendant negroes were severely
                    lacerated; and his own, though defended by strong shoes, were wounded in several
                    places.</p>
                <p>The streams of Bourbon are mere mountain torrents, which descend from steep to
                    steep, and throw themselves into the sea. In their fall they dig deep ravines,
                    bordered by lofty and almost perpendicular walls. The largest river, however,
                    that of St Denis, has only a course of seven or eight miles. These deep and
                    foaming torrents, the rude surface of the ground, and the perpendicular rents by
                    which it is everywhere broken, render travelling through Bourbon a most arduous
                    undertaking. Μ. Bory de St Vincent was assured that his plan of reaching the two
                    principal peaks was altogether impracticable; but his enterprise and love of
                    science enabled him to surmount all the intervening difficulties.</p>
                <p>In the ascent to the summit of the volcanic mountain, the obstacles encountered
                    were truly formidable. Sometimes the sides of nearly perpendicular rocks were to
                    be climbed; at other times a road was to be made by cutting down the bushes and
                    filling up the crevices; whilst a mist, which rises every day from the sea,
                    rendered it impossible to distinguish his companions at the smallest distance.
                    At length they reached the summit of the <hi rend="italic">Mamelon central.</hi>
                    The crater here, to which the name of Dolomieu was given, consists of a cavity
                    forty fathoms in diameter, and about eighty feet deep, the bottom filled with
                    confused piles of greyish coloured lava. The sides showed none of that soft lava
                    which forms a species of varnish over the interior of other craters; they
                    consisted of irregular fragments of hard and compact substances. Our author here
                    notices the errororthose who expect, v hen they reach the summit of a crater, to
                    look down into an unfathomable abyss. The fact is, that from whatever depth the
                    liquified substances may have ascended, as soon as the conflagration ceases,
                    they harden and fill up the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735013"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-5013-0150"/>opening, so that only a very small void remains.
                    Being ' led, however, by a sulphureous smell, to the left side of the present
                    crater, they discovered a deep hollow like a tunnel, the walls of which were
                    composed of burning lava; while beneath, two columns of fiery matter, rising to
                    the height of 120 feet, threw up a bloody light, which shone brightly, even amid
                    the blaze of a tropical noon. This spectacle, accompanied with a sound similar
                    to that of a mighty cascade, filled their minds with terror and admiration.</p>
                <p>Our traveller, in ascending, had supposed the <hi rend="italic">Alamelon
                    central</hi> to be the highest peak of the volcanic mountain; but he now
                    discovered, at the distance of about 200 fathoms, a still more elevated point,
                    which, after himself, he named <hi rend="italic">Pory.</hi> It is a vast
                    elliptic basin, the largest diameter of which is 120, and the smallest 100
                    fathoms. The sides rise perpendicularly like walls, and are 200 feet high at
                    their greatest elevation. There were some broken parts, however, by which the
                    travellers could descend into the abyss. They found it tolerably level; but the
                    volcanic ashes with which it was bestrewed hid the scoriae and other substances
                    which filled it. In the centre was a crevice, the depth of which they could not
                    discover. This crater was entirely silent.</p>
                <p>The travellers spent the night on the crater Dolomicu; but the tremendous sounds,
                    the blaze of light, and the singularity of their situation, scarcely allowed
                    them to close their eyes. At about 1200 feet beneath, they perceived a stream of
                    lava issuing from the mountain, the outlet, probably, of those liquified
                    substances which they saw fermenting at the bottom of the crater.</p>
                <p>The crater is said to have been formed during a violent eruption of the volcano
                    in 1791. In the beginning of June a burning vapour appeared rising from the
                    summit, then the side of the mountain opened, and a vast torrent of lava rushed
                    into the sea. On the 17th of July a subterranean noise, like the discharge of
                    cannon, was heard throughout the island; after which there rose from the top of
                    the mountain an enormous column of smoke, of a deep black, with white spots
                    interspersed. The inhabitants, who had never before witnessed such a phenomenon,
                    were struck with consternation? Soon, however, the column fell down, and formed
                    a species of arch over the volcano. The falling in of the interior, undermined
                    by the previous discharge, is supposed to have been the cause of the tremendous
                    sound, and of the ultimate opening of the crater.</p>
                <p>This is, perhaps, the most active volcano in nature. Since the Christian era,
                    Etna has made only twenty-seven eruptions, and Vesuvius twenty-four. But a
                    resident at Bourbon assured our author, that, from 1785 to 1802, the mountain
                    had vomited flames at least twice every year, and eight of the streams had
                    entered the sea. The lava, however, scarcely ever issues from the summit of a
                    crater, but generally from openings far down the mountain, and sometimes almost
                    on a level with the sea. It is remarkable, also, that earthquakes, which so
                    generally desolate volcanic countries, are here unknown, or, at least, so
                    slight, as to occasion no serious inconvenience. The constant escape of the
                    subterraneous fire through the channel of the volcano may probably be the chief
                    cause which prevents it from shaking the surrounding regions. Another usual
                    accompaniment, that of warm springs, is also wanting; and none of the waters are
                    impregnated with any species of gas. No petroleum has been found, nor any metal,
                    except iron.</p>
                <p>Our traveller next made an excursion to the <hi rend="italic">Piton des
                    Neiges,</hi> which forms the summit of the <hi rend="italic">Gros Morne,</hi>
                    the highest mountain in the island. This undertaking proved still more arduous.
                    The season was favourable; yet, when they had mounted about half-way, a
                    prodigious rain came on; and the road lay through wet and swampy grounds, which
                    were soon entirely covered with water. The mists became so thick, that nothing
                    could be distinguished. The negroes, accustomed to a milder air, were benumbed;
                    and, refusing to proceed, would have perished with cold, had not the Frenchmen
                    driven them forcibly on, till they came to a spot where they found shelter and
                    refreshment. They spent here two nights, and on the third day were able to reach
                    their destination.' The view from the summit appeared to our traveller to equal
                    the most majestic scenes of the Alps and the Pyrenees. In the island beneath,
                    every object was visible as on a map; while, on every side, the immeasurable
                    extent of ocean mingling with the skies, made them feel as if insulated on this
                    spot from the rest of the universe. The thermometer was so low as 8°. Here
                    considerable masses of rock were observed, undermined to such a degree that a
                    very slight effort was sufficient to throw them down the precipices, where,
                    displacing others, they rolled to a great depth, and caused prodigious havock.
                    Every part of the mountain, indeed, appears furrowed and shattered by the
                    violent action of the rains, which have already sensibly diminished its
                    magnitude, and are likely to do so more and more.</p>
                <p>M. Bory does not appear to have instituted any investigation into the height of
                    these mountains. Professor Jameson, in his <hi rend="italic">Geognosy,</hi>
                    estimates that of the <hi rend="italic">Gros Morne</hi> at 9600, and that of the
                    volcano at 7680 feet above the level of the sea. The French traveller gives a
                    copious, but not very precise account of its geological features. The lower part
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Gros Morne</hi> is composed of basalt, a substance
                    which abounds in every part of the island, and which, from the manner in which
                    it is connected with and surrounded by lava, is conceived by our author to have
                    been universally crystallized from a state of fusion. He notices, also, the
                    frequent occurrence of what he calls <hi rend="italic">trappean lava;</hi>
                    though this, as well as much of the basalt, would probably, by the disciple of
                    Werner, be referred to some of the newer formations of trap. On some of the
                    precipices at the summit of the <hi rend="italic">Gros Morne,</hi> there
                    appeared an immense depth of horizontal strata, which might have rendered an
                    igneous origin improbable, had it not been so clearly proved by other phenomena.
                    Large blocks of granite are found in the rivers which flow at the foot of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gros Morne.</hi></p>
                <p>It is now time to take a view of the political and commercial aspect of Bourbon.
                    By the revolutionists it was· called Reunion; but this name, which was never
                    fully es- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> tablished, maybe now supposed to have
                    again given place' to its ancient appellation. The island is divided into eleven
                    parishes, St Denis, containing the capital of that name, St Marie, St Susanne,
                    St André, St Benoit, St Rose, St Joseph, St Pierre de la Riviere d’Abord, St
                    Louis du Gaul, St Leu, and St Paul. St Denis can scarcely be called a city; the
                    streets resemble roads in the country, being covered with grass and sand, under
                    which are often concealed sharp pointed stones, which inflict severe wounds on
                    the feet. The houses are built of wood, and are agreeable; they are constructed
                    entirely with a view to coolness. The furniture is slender, and many of the
                    rooms are not even carpeted; a deficiency not arising from absolute poverty, but
                    from the difficulty, in this remote situation, of procuring the artificial
                    conveniences of life. The houses in the country are of a peculiar construction,
                    very long, very narrow, and tapering to a point.</p>
                <p>The island is distinguished into the windward and leeward quarters; of which the
                    former, descending by a gentle slope, and refreshed by continual breezes, is
                    fertile and smiling; while the latter is comparatively rude, dry, and barren.
                    The torrents, continually washing away the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735026"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-5026-0151"/>soil, are supposed to augment the sterility. Only
                    a narrow slope, about a league and a half inward from the sea, is under regular
                    cultivation. The interior consists of immense forests, inhabited by a species of
                    fugitive mulattoes, who live almost in a state of nature. The population in 1763
                    was estimated by Bory de St Vincent at 4000 whites and 15,000 slaves. If these
                    numbers are at all accurate, the increase must have been very great. The
                    enumeration of 1827 gave 18,747 whites, 6387 free people of colour, 41,340
                    males, and 22,107 female slaves; in all 88,581.</p>
                <p>The staple production of this island is coffee. The first plants were early
                    brought from Arabia, and soon flourished to such a degree, that the coffee of
                    Bourbon was only second to that produced in the parent district. During the
                    revolution, the want of a regular market, by diminishing the encouragement to
                    careful cultivation, sensibly lowered the quality. It is still, however,
                    produced in large quantity. Next to it ranks the article of cloves. The
                    clove-tree is of very easy cultivation; the chief disadvantage is the
                    precariousness of the produce. It has been known in one year to yield only 1000
                    lbs., and in the next 500,000 lbs. Cotton, likewise, has been long a staple of
                    the island; but a violent hurricane in 1801, and a disease which afterwards made
                    its appearance among the plants, discouraged a number of the planters, who
                    accordingly began to employ their lands in the culture of coffee. During the
                    last ten or twelve years the culture of coffee, cotton, and cloves, has
                    diminished, partly from local causes, and partly from the low price which they
                    bear in Europe. On the other hand, that of sugar has very remarkably increased.
                    In 1820 the produce was only from four to five millions of kilogrammes; in 1828
                    it had risen to thirteen, and in 1829 to twenty-nine millions. In 1827 the
                    quantity of land employed in the production of sugar was stated at 8241
                    hectares, coffee 8909, spices 4993, grains 28,840. Bourbon labours under the
                    serious disadvantage of not possessing a single harbour, nor any roadstead in
                    which vessels can ride with safety. The trade, therefore, can be conducted only
                    through the medium of Mauritius, and is entirely in the hands of the merchants
                    of that island. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"

                    that Margaret de Valois appointed him preceptor to her daughter Jane d’Albret of
                    Navarre, the mother of King Henry IV. After a residence of several years at
                    court he retired to Candc, where he had a benefice, and died about the year

                    caused him to be nominated professor of eloquence in the Royal College. He was
                    also canon of Langres, and one of the forty of the French academy. At length he
                    retired to the fathers of the oratory, where he died in 1644, aged seventy. He
                    is esteemed as one of the greatest Latin poets France has produced. His poems
                    were printed at Paris in 1630. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi
