                <p><label type="entry">BURKE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edmund</hi></label>, an
                    illustrious writer, orator, and statesman, was born in Dublin on the 1st of
                    January 1730. His father was an attorney, first in Limerick, and afterwards in
                    Dublin. Young Burke received the rudiments of his education at Castletown Roche.
                    He was afterwards put under the tuition of Abraham Shackleton, a quaker of some
                    celebrity in Ballitore, in the county of Kildare. Committed to the care of a
                    master so well qualified for the business of instruction, he applied to his
                    studies with commendable assiduity, and in this seminary laid the foundation of
                    his knowledge of the ancient languages, and probably also imbibed that love of
                    liberty which so often pointed his oratory, inflamed his passions, animated his
                    sentiments, and in his best days secured him an almost unequalled
                    reputation.</p>
                <p>Here several years of his life were spent; and the attachment of the master and
                    the gratitude of the pupil reflect equal honour on both. The former lived to see
                    his scholar attain a considerable degree of reputation; and the latter, on his
                    part, was accustomed to spend a portion of his annual visit to Ireland at
                    Ballitore. He also kept up an epistolary correspondence with him, which lasted
                    till the death of his tutor.</p>
                <p>From this provincial seminary Edmund was sent to the university of Dublin. But
                    here he does not appear to have distinguished himself much either by application
                    or talents: his character as a student was merely negative. He received a
                    degree, however, before he departed, and during this period he commenced author,
                    by writing some political essays.</p>
                <p>Mr Burke now addicted himself to other pursuits, particularly logic and
                    metaphysics, and is said to have planned a refutation of the systems of Berkeley
                    and Hume. But whilst thus employed in treasuring up the means of attaining a
                    species of celebrity which far different avocations prevented his afterwards
                    aspiring to, he was not inattentive to the grand object of obtaining a suitable
                    settlement in life. IÏis family was not opulent, and as he already panted after
                    independence, he repaired to the metropolis, and enrolled his name as a student
                    of the Inner Temple.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742333" xml:id="kp-eb0705-2333-0713"/>
                <p>It appears from his speeches, his writings, and his conversation, that he studied
                    the outlines of our municipal jurisprudence with attention; but it may be
                    doubted whether he ever entered deeply into the study of law. The versatility of
                    his talents and his avocations were, indeed, but little calculated for that dull
                    and plodding perseverance which can alone lead to an intimate knowledge of our
                    laws; and even if he had been gifted with the necessary application, both time
                    and opportunity were wanting; for it is well known that at this period of his
                    life the <hi rend="italic">res</hi><hi rend="italic">angusta domi</hi> did not
                    permit the student to dedicate his attention solely to this, or indeed to any
                    other single pursuit. The exhausted state of his finances called frequently for
                    a speedy supply; and, instead of perusing the pages of Bracton, Fleta,
                    Littleton, and Coke, he was obliged to write essays, letters, and paragraphs,
                    for the periodical publications of the day. But if these pursuits diverted his
                    attention from graver studies, they acquired him a facility of composition, and
                    a command of style and of language, which proved eminently serviceable to him in
                    the course of his future life. About this period he became a candidate for a
                    vacant chair in the university of Glasgow, but he was unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>His health, however, became at length impaired, and a nervous fever ensued. This
                    circumstance induced him to call in the aid of Dr Nugent, a countryman of his
                    own, and a man of amiable manners, though not of extensive practice. This
                    gentleman, who was himself an author, readily discovered the source of Mr
                    Burke’s malady, and, by removing him from books and business to his own house,
                    soon effected a cure; an event which is said to have been hastened, if not
                    entirely completed, by a physician of another kind, the accomplished daughter of
                    Dr Nugent, whose delicate attentions to the invalid appear to have made a deep
                    impression on his heart. In fact this lady afterwards became Mrs Burke; and the
                    circumstance was particularly fortunate for him, as her disposition was mild and
                    gentle, and she continued throughout a long series of years, and many
                    vicissitudes of fortune, to soothe and tranquillize passions always violent, and
                    often tumultuous.</p>
                <p>After some time ostensibly spent in the study of law, Mr Burke seems to have
                    determined once more to endeavour to distinguish himself as an author; and
                    accordingly he took advantage of the death of a celebrated nobleman to compose a
                    work after the manner of that distinguished writer, so that, by exaggerating his
                    principles, he might be enabled to bring them into contempt; but this effort
                    proved unsuccessful, and the treatise in question was for a long time consigned
                    to oblivion, nor would it have ever been heard of, had it not been resuscitated
                    by his future fame. But the success of another performance made ample amends for
                    this disappointment. His <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Sublime and
                    Beautiful</hi> attracted a great degree of notice, and acquired him considerable
                    celebrity as a man of letters. In addition to the profits of the publication, he
                    is said to have received a present of a hundred pounds from his father; but his
                    circumstances must have been greatly embarrassed about this time, as he was
                    obliged to sell his books,—a measure which nothing but the extremity of distress
                    could have forced a man of letters to resort to.</p>
                <p>This work having an immediate relation to taste, excited a desire in Sir Joshua
                    Reynolds, even then at the head of his profession, to become acquainted with Mr
                    Burke; and a friendship ensued which continued uninterrupted during the life of
                    the painter, and was unequivocally testified by a handsome bequest in his will.
                    Dr Johnson also sought and obtained his friendship; and he now became the
                    constant frequenter of two clubs, composed of some of the most celebrated men of
                    that day. One of these met at the Turk’s Head Tavern in Gerrard Street, and
                    consisted of Dr Johnson, Mr (afterwards Sir Joshua) Reynolds, Dr Goldsmith, Mr
                    Topham Bcauclerc, Dr Nugent, Sir John Hawkins, Mr Bennet Langton, Mr Charnier,
                    Mr Garrick, and Mr Burke. The other assembled at the St James’s Coffee-house,
                    and, besides many of the above, included Mr Cumberland, Dr Douglas, bishop of
                    Salisbury, Dr Bernard, dean of Derry, Mr Richard Burke, Mr William Burke, Mr
                    Hickey, and others. Dr Goldsmith, who was Mr Burke’s contemporary at Dublin
                    College, was member of both, and wrote the epitaphs of those who composed the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>A literary work on a new plan, first suggested in 1750, and by some attributed to
                    the Dodsleys, but by others to Mr Burke, became for some time a considerable
                    source of emolument to him. This was called the <hi rend="italic">Annual
                    Register,</hi> a publication which soon obtained considerable celebrity, and of
                    which he had for several years the superintendence.</p>
                <p>But Mr Burke was at length called off from his literary pursuits by avocations of
                    a far different kind. A gentleman who afterwards obtained the name of
                    Singlespecch Hamilton, having been appointed secretary to the lord-lieutenant of
                    Ireland, invited his friend Mr Burke to accompany him thither, an offer which he
                    readily accepted; and although he acted in no public station, and performed no
                    public service, while he remained in that country, he was rewarded with a
                    pension of three hundred pounds per annum, which the conduct of Mr Hamilton soon
                    afterwards compelled him to throw up.</p>
                <p>On his return to England he amused himself, as usual, with literary composition;
                    and a series of essays written by him in a newspaper, which at the time enjoyed
                    great celebrity, attracted the notice of the Marquis of Rockingham; in
                    consequence of which Mr Fitzherbert, father of Lord St Helen’s, introduced him
                    to that nobleman. From this moment he became a public man, and dedicated his
                    studies, his eloquence, and his pen, almost exclusively to politics. Meanwhile
                    Lord Rockingham, having proved more compliant than the Earl of Chatham, came
                    into power; and when seated on the treasury bench, he selected Mr Burke as his
                    private secretary,—an office of no power, and very little emolument, but one
                    which naturally leads to both. As it was now necessary that he should have a
                    seat in' parliament, although it can scarcely be supposed that he was legally
                    qualified in point of property, he applied to Lord Verney, patron of Wendover,
                    and was returned for that borough, which was then dependent on his lordship,
                    being principally occupied by his tenants.</p>
                <p>Having thus obtained a seat in 1765, he prepared to qualify himself for his -new
                    situation. He had all the necessary talents, and was only deficient in knowledge
                    of the forms of business, and in facility of expressing his sentiments before a
                    public audience. The first of these he mastered by sedulous attention; and as to
                    the second, if we are to credit those who were intimately acquainted with him at
                    this period of his life, he overcame all difficulties by a previous initiation
                    elsewhere. In short, he had acquired celebrity at the Robinhood before he
                    attempted to speak in the British senate, and vanquished an eloquent baker ere
                    he began to cope with the greatest orators this nation has ever produced.</p>
                <p>Holding a confidential place under the Rockingham administration, he of course
                    supported all its measures. A former ministry, anxious to increase its influence
                    by means of increased imposts, had conceived the idea of taxing America through
                    the medium of a parliament in which she was not represented, and attempted to
                    carry this into effect by means of the famous stamp act; but the Americans,
                    alarmed at what they conceived to be a flagrant violation of every principle of
                    the English constitution, made <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742346"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2346-0714"/>such a spirited resistance to the measure, that it
                    was abandoned, and the Rockingham party readily consented to the repeal. Under
                    the pretext, however, of vindicating the honour of the crown, they unfortunately
                    proposed and carried the declaratory act, by means of which, although the
                    original scheme was abandoned, the principle on which it had been built was
                    asserted anew, and a foundation laid for all the miseries which afterwards
                    ensued. But if the Rockingham administration deserved no great credit on this
                    occasion, it is entitled to considerable praise on account of other parts of its
                    conduct; for it repealed the cider act, procured a declaration of the House of
                    Commons condemning the seizure of papers, and carried a resolution against
                    general warrants. On retiring from office, however, they did not carry much
                    popularity along with them; Lord Chatham and his friends, who in some measure
                    monopolized the public favour, were intrusted with the management of affairs for
                    a short time; and it is extremely probable that they would have sunk into
                    neglect had not America been driven into open resistance.</p>
                <p>It now fell to the lot of Lord North to enforce the scheme which the Grenville
                    party had projected, which the Rockingham administration had by an unaccountable
                    blunder at once recognised and annihilated, and which they afterwards manfully
                    and at length successfully opposed. This forms the most brilliant epoch of Mr
                    Burke’s life. He was hostile to the expulsion of Mr Wilkes, an act which the
                    House of Commons afterwards rescinded from its records. On the application of
                    the dissenters for relief, he espoused their cause, and expressed his resentment
                    in very animated terms against that misguided policy which permitted all those
                    not within the pale of the establishment to enjoy liberty less by right than by
                    connivance. But perhaps the noblest part of his conduct consisted in his steady
                    and uniform opposition to the American war, and his marked hostility to the
                    abettors of the struggle. His speech against the Boston Port Bill was one of the
                    most brilliant specimens of oratory that had ever been displayed in the British
                    senate; and on the 19th of April 1774, on a motion for the repeal of the tea
                    duty, he discovered such talents, that an old and respectable member exclaimed,
                    “Good God, what a man is this! How could he acquire such transcendent powers ?”
                    And when, in reply to another who had said that the Americans were our children,
                    and it was horrible to revolt against their parent, the orator uttered the
                    following passage, the whole house was electrified: “They are our children, it
                    is true; but when children ask for bread, we are not to give them a stone. When
                    those children of ours wish to assimilate with their parent, and to respect the
                    beauteous countenance of British liberty, are we to turn to them the shameful
                    parts of our constitution? Are we to give them our weakness for their strength;
                    our opprobrium for their glory; and the slough of slavery, which we are not able
                    to work off, to serve them for their freedom ?”</p>
                <p>The city of Bristol, the merchants of which had become rich by the commerce with
                    America, were likely to suffer by its interdiction. This consideration alone
                    rendered many of them hostile to the proceedings of the ministry; but nobler and
                    more exalted motives actuated the bosoms of some, particularly the quakers,
                    dissenters, and other sectaries, who were moved by zeal against oppression, and
                    a love of liberty imprinted on their minds by a constitution which until then
                    had remained inviolate. Gratified by the exertions of Mr Burke in behalf of
                    civil and religious freedom, they put him in nomination for the city, and sent
                    into Yorkshire to request his immediate personal attendance. After consulting
                    with his patron concerning an offer so flattering and unexpected, accompanied at
                    the same time with assurances most punctually fulfilled, that he should be put
                    to no expense whatever, he immediately set out for the west of England, and
                    found that no less than three candidates had started before him. The first was
                    Lord Clare, afterwards Lord Nugent, one of the former representatives, whose
                    unpopularity was such that he soon discovered the necessity of resigning all his
                    pretensions; and of the two others, Mr Cruger and Mr Brickdale, who remained in
                    the field, the former, like Mr Burke himself, was averse to a rupture with
                    America.</p>
                <p>The new candidate did not appear on the hustings until the afternoon of the sixth
                    day’s poll, on which occasion he addressed the electors in a very able speech,
                    admirably calculated for the occasion; expressing a modest diffidence of his own
                    abilities, and a high opinion of the important trust they were assembled to
                    confer; boldly declaring himself hostile to a contest with America; and
                    asserting that England had been rendered flourishing by liberty and commerce,
                    the first of which was dear to his heart, whilst the latter had been a favourite
                    object of his studies, both in its principles and details. This harangue was
                    well received by the electors ;· the contest proved propitious to his wishes;
                    and when the sheriffs had notified, at the close of the poll, that he was
                    elected, he delivered the most brilliant address on the occasion that had ever
                    been heard within the walls of the city.</p>
                <p>Mr Burke returned from his new constituents to parliament with increased vigour,
                    reputation, and zeal. The Earl of Chatham, notwithstanding his reputation for
                    wisdom, having failed in an attempt to adjust the troubles of the colonies by
                    means of a conciliatory bill introduced by him into the House of Peers for that
                    purpose, the obstinacy of the ministry now became apparent to every one. But
                    this circumstance, which would have appalled an inferior man, did not, however,
                    discourage the member for Bristol from making a similar attempt in another
                    place; and accordingly, on the 22d March 1775, he brought forward his celebrated
                    thirteen propositions, which were intended to close the fatal breach, and heal
                    all the differences between the mother country and her colonies. His plan, on
                    this occasion, embraced not only immediate conciliation, by a repeal of the late
                    coercive acts, but also the creation of an independent judicature, and the
                    regulation of the courts of admiralty. The whole, however, was quashed by a
                    large majority on the side of the minister who moved the previous question.</p>
                <p>Mr Burke had hitherto chiefly distinguished himself in opposition to the measures
                    of others; but in 1780 he himself stood forth as the original author of a scheme
                    which soon engaged the attention of the public, and actually appeared big with
                    the most important results. When lie found ministers obstinately persisting in a
                    disastrous war, and perceived that the people began to bend beneath the weight
                    of the taxes for its support, it struck him as at once advantageous and
                    politically expedient to attempt to diminish the public burdens and the number
                    of adherents of the court. Accordingly, on the 11th of February, he brought in a
                    bill for the regulation of his majesty’s civil establishments, and of certain
                    public offices; for the limitation of pensions, and the suppression of sundry
                    useless, expensive, and inconvenient places; and for applying the monies saved
                    thereby to the public service. This scheme was manifestly founded on the late
                    reforms which had taken place in France; for, by an edict of the king,
                    registered in the parliament of Paris, it appeared that he ha suppressed no less
                    than four hundred places in his household by one regulation. The orator
                    judiciously adverted to this event, and endeavoured to make use of it as an
                    incitement to a similar attempt here, calling in national rwa - ship by way of
                    an inducement to consent to this sacn ce on the part of the crown. To this bill
                    the minority ι <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193742359"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2359-0715"/>not at first give much opposition; and indeed the
                    mover of it contrived to soften those features which appeared harsh to them. But
                    notwithstanding this, it did not prove successful during Lord North’s
                    administration; and when it was at length carried, it was much modified and
                    altered.</p>
                <p>Parliament was dissolved in 1780, but Mr Burke was not re-elected for Bristol.
                    This is said to have made a deep impression on the mind of the orator; but it
                    must have been obliterated by the important events which speedily ensued; for
                    the minister now tottered on the-treasury bench, being abandoned by many of his
                    staunchest supporters, and but little confident in his own schemes, all of which
                    had proved eminently unsuccessful. Meanwhile the opposition having increased to
                    a considerable degree, unceasingly assailed him, until at length, on the 28th
                    March 1782, Lord North assured the House of Commons that his administration was
                    at an end.</p>
                <p>The day had now arrived when the ministry and opposition were to change places,
                    and Mr Burke, whose services had been so conspicuous, was made a privy
                    counsellor, and invested with the lucrative appointment of paymaster-general of
                    the forces. He was thus at length enabled to enforce his plan of political
                    economy, tendered before in vain; and the board of trade, the board of works,
                    the offices of third secretary of state, treasurer of the chamber, cofferer of
                    the household, the lords of police in Scotland, the master of the harriers, the
                    master of the stag-hounds, the six clerks of the board of green cloth, and the
                    paymaster of the pensions, were abolished. But when the reins of government were
                    confided to the hands of the Marquis of Lansdown, then Earl Shelburne, this
                    event gave such offence to those who wished to place the Duke of Portland at'the
                    head of affairs, that Mr Fox, Lord John Cavendish, and Mr Burke, immediately
                    resigned.</p>
                <p>In the mean time the critical state of the English East India Company had long
                    agitated the public mind, and become occasionally a subject of discussion in
                    parliament. The seizure, imprisonment, and confinement of Lord Pigot, by a
                    faction in the council of Madras—the conduct of Mr Hastings in respect to
                    several of the native powers—and the grand question of sovereignty, relative to
                    the territorial possessions of the Company in Asia—had all at different times
                    excited the attention of the nation. Accordingly, when Mr Fox and his friends
                    came into power, he brought in a bill to remedy the various abuses in the
                    government of British India. Of this bill Mr Burke is well known to have been in
                    a great measure the author; and when it was introduced into parliament, he
                    defended its principles and provisions with all the zeal of a parent.
                    Notwithstanding much opposition both within and without, this celebrated bill
                    was carried triumphantly through the House of Commons; but in the House of Peers
                    it experienced a far different fate, and with it fell the power and consequence
                    of its authors, framers, and supporters.</p>
                <p>In the course of the next year, 28th February 1785, he made a splendid speech
                    relative to the nabob of Arcot’s debts; and depicted one of his creditors, who
                    had taken an active share in the late elections, “as a criminal who long since
                    ought to have fattened the region kites with his offal; the old betrayer,
                    insulter, oppressor, and scourge of a country (Tanjore), which had for years
                    been an object of an unremitted, but unhappily an unequal struggle, between the
                    bounties of Providence to renovate, and the wickedness of mankind to destroy.”
                    But there appeared to Mr Burke to be a still greater delinquent; and accordingly
                    lie resolved to sacrifice, if possible, the powerful offender himself at the
                    shrine of national vengeance. This was Mr Hastings; and, soon after his arrival
                    in England, the orator gave notice of his intentions. On the 17th of February
                    1785 he opened the accusation by a most eloquent speech, in which he depicted
                    the alleged crimes of the ex-governor-general in the most glowing and animated
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> colours. This trial, however, turned out in the
                    event very different from what had been expected; whilst the length of it failed
                    not to involve both Mr Burke himself and his party in reproach.</p>
                <p>During the debate on the commercial treaty with France, 23d January 1787, Mr
                    Burke, then member for Malton, exhibited an undiminished versatility of talents,
                    and pointed his ridicule with no common success at Mr Pitt, who, according to
                    him, contemplated the subject with a narrowness peculiar to limited minds:—“He
                    seems to consider it,” said he, “as an affair of two little counting-houses, and
                    not of two great nations. He seems to consider it as a contention between the
                    sign of the <hi rend="italic">fleur-de-lis</hi> and the sign of the old <hi
                    rend="italic">red lion,</hi> for which should obtain the best custom.”</p>
                <p>The next public event of importance in which we find Mr Burke engaged, occurred
                    in consequence of his majesty’s indisposition. On this occasion he took an
                    active part in the debates of the House of Commons, and is supposed to have
                    penned a letter for one, and a speech for another branch of the royal family.
                    When Mr Pitt moved his declaratory resolutions relative to the provisional
                    exercise of the royal authority, Mr Burke attacked him with much asperity of
                    language, and was particularly severe on the manner in which the royal assent
                    was to be given to all future acts of parliament. The men who held most of the
                    high places under the government were treated as jobbers, old hacks of the
                    court, and the supporters and betrayers of all parties; and he declared that it
                    was a mock crown, a tinsel robe, and a sceptre from the theatre, lackered over
                    and unreal, which were about to be conferred on the prince of Wales.</p>
                <p>The opposition, diminished indeed by a few occasional desertions, had hitherto
                    acted as a great public body, supposed to be united in general principles for
                    the common welfare and prosperity of the state; but the French revolution
                    thinned their ranks, dispelled their consequence, and, by solving jealousy
                    between the chiefs, spread consternation and dismay among their followers. It
                    was on the 2d of March 1790, when Mr Fox moved for leave to bring in a bill to
                    repeal the corporation and test acts, that this disunion became evident; and
                    soon afterwards Mr Burke declared that his honourable friend and he were
                    separated in their politics for ever.</p>
                <p>The ministry now seemed anxious to provide for their new associate; and he, on
                    his part, certainly appeared deserving of some remuneration at their hands, for
                    he had abandoned all his old friends, and not a few of his old principles. In
                    addition to this, his <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the Revolution in
                    France</hi> had afforded some degree of counte-nance, and even popularity, to
                    the measures of administration; and, not content with his own exertions, he had
                    enlisted his son on the same side, and even sent him to Coblentz. The royal
                    munificence at length gratified his warmest wishes; for by a warrant, dated 24th
                    September 1795, he received a pension, made to commence from the 5th January
                    1793, of L.1200 for his own life and that of his wife, on the civil list; whilst
                    two other pensions of L.2500 a year for three lives, payable out of the four and
                    a half per cent, fund, dated 24th October 1795, were made to commence from the
                    24th July 1793. Honours as well as wealth now seemed to await him, for he was
                    about to be ennobled, when the untimely death of an only child put an end to his
                    dreams of ambition, and contributed not a little to hasten his own, which
                    occurred at his house at Beaconsfield on the 9th of July 1797.</p>
                <p>Thus died, in the sixty-eighth year of his age, Edmund Burke, one of the greatest
                    orators, statesmen, and authors <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742372"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2372-0716"/>of his age; a man whose name will long continue to
                    be celebrated; and one who, had he fallen during the meridian of his fame and
                    character, would have scarcely been considered as second to any man, either of
                    ancient or modern times.</p>
