                    defeated the English in several battles, raised the glory of the Scots to an

                    >James,</hi> F. R. S. a celebrated traveller, was born at Kinnaird House in the
                    county of Stirling, Scotland, on the 14th of December 1730. The Bruces of
                    Kinnaird are a very ancient family, being descended from a younger son of Robert
                    de Bruce; and they have been in posses-sion of that estate for upwards of three
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>Mr Bruce was instructed in grammatical learning at the school of Harrow on the
                    Hill, in Middlesex, where he acquired a considerable share of classical
                    knowledge. Returning to Scotland, he applied to the study of the laws of his
                    country; but soon contracting a dislike to this pursuit, he determined to push
                    his fortune in the East Indies, and for that purpose went to London. While in
                    the metropolis soliciting permission from the directors of the East India
                    Company to go out and settle under their auspices as a free trader, he was
                    introduced to a Miss Allan. This lady was the daughter of Mrs Allan, the widow
                    of an opulent wine merchant. Her beauty and amiable temper soon gained the
                    affections of Bruce; and on the proposal of a marriage, he was induced to forego
                    his East India speculations, and take a share in the wine trade, which he did on
                    marrying Miss Allan. She soon, however, fell into a bad state of health, and
                    Bruce, in hopes that the genial climate of the south of France would benefit
                    her, proceeded thither. But she died on the journey, within a year after her
                    marriage.</p>
                <p>Bruce returned to his business in London, but the bond which had connected him
                    with it was now broken; and giving up the principal management of the concern to
                    his partner, he applied himself to studies calculated to dispel the grief which
                    had settled on his mind. For two years he laboured at the Spanish and Portuguese
                    languages, which he learned to pronounce with great accuracy. He also
                    assiduously practised several styles of drawing. His business having afforded
                    him an opportunity of visiting the Continent, he proceeded thither, and
                    travelled first through Portugal, and afterwards through Spain. In the latter
                    country, the traces of oriental manners still visible, the desolate palaces of
                    the caliphs, and the tales of chivalry, interwoven with the Moorish wars,
                    awakened in his mind that spirit of romantic enterprise which afterwards led him
                    to the fountains of the Nile. At Madrid he proposed to explore the collections
                    of Arabic manuscripts which were buried in the monastery of St Lawrence, and in
                    the library of the Escurial∙ But the jealousy of the Spaniards disappointing him
                    in this, he proceeded to France, and afterwards to Holland, where the news of
                    his father s death reaching him, he returned to England. .</p>
                <p>By the demise of his father he succeeded to an inheritance which, though
                    respectable, was inadequate to the wants of his growing ambition. From the
                    period of his return in 1758, to the. year 1761, he <hi rend="italic"
                    >intently</hi> employed himself in the acquisition of the eastern language .
                    circumstance had occurred which introduced him to Mr Htt While at Ferrol in
                    Galicia, there was a rumour of a war between Great Britain and Spain. It
                    immediately occurred to the fertile of Bruce ⅛t a ⅛^t ^&gt;</p>
                <p>Spain at this point could scarcely fail of bem <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> s^ss™
                    He boldly resolved to submit his project to M Pitt, through his friend Mr Wood,
                    under secretary of state, to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193740941"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-0941-0606"/>whom he fully explained the circumstances on which
                    he had formed his opinion. Mr Pitt sent for him, and after a conversation upon
                    the subject, Bruce, at the minister’s suggestion, drew up a memorandum of his
                    project. He was then informed by Mr Wood, that Mr Pitt intended to employ him
                    upon a particular service; that he might, however, go down and settle his
                    affairs in his own country, but by all means to be ready upon a call. No time
                    was lost on his part; but just after he received orders to return to London, Mr
                    Pitt resigned.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this disappointment, which he very sensibly felt, his hopes
                    promised to be yet realized. The memorandum which he drew up for Mr Pitt had
                    been laid before the king, and strongly recommended by Lord Halifax. The Earl of
                    Egremont and Mr Greville had several meetings with Mr Bruce upon the subject,
                    but the death of Egremont put an end to his expectations for the present. Lord
                    Halifax, however, had appreciated Bruce’s character. He proposed to him a
                    journey to the coast of Barbary, which had as yet been but partially explored by
                    Dr Shaw. The discovery of the source of the Nile also formed a subject of
                    conversation; and it is unnecessary to state that the enterprising mind of Bruce
                    eagerly caught up the idca.</p>
                <p>“Fortune,” says he, “seemed to enter into this scheme. At the very instant Mr
                    Aspinwall, very cruelly and ignominiously treated by the dey of Algiers, had
                    resigned his consulship, and Mr Ford, a merchant, formerly the dey’s
                    acquaintance, was named in his place. Mr Ford was appointed, and dying a few
                    days after, the consulship became vacant. Lord Halifax pressed me to accept of
                    this, as containing all sorts of conveniences for making the proposed
                    expedition.”</p>
                <p>This favourable event determined him. After providing a large apparatus of
                    instruments, he set out for Italy through France. On his arrival at Rome he was
                    ordered to proceed to Naples, there to await his majesty’s commands. From Naples
                    he again returned to Rome, and from thence proceeded to Leghorn, where he at
                    last embarked for Algiers, and arrived there on the !5th of March 1762.</p>
                <p>“After a year spent at Algiers, constant conversation with the natives while
                    abroad, and with my manuscripts within doors, had qualified me to appear in any
                    part of the continent without the help of an interpreter. Ludolf had assured his
                    readers that the knowledge of any oriental language would soon enable them to
                    acquire the Ethiopic; and I needed only the same number of books to have made my
                    knowledge of that language go hand in hand with my attainments in the Arabic. My
                    immediate project of setting out on my journey to the inland parts of Africa had
                    made me double my diligence; night and day there was no relaxation from these
                    studies, although the acquiring any single language had never been with me
                    either an object of time or difficulty.”</p>
                <p>At Algiers Mr Bruce was detained longer than he expected, in consequence of a
                    dispute with the dey concerning Mediterranean passes. This being adjusted, he
                    proceeded to Mahon, and from Mahon to Carthage. He next visited Tunis and
                    Tripoli, and travelled over the interior parts of these states. At Bengazi, a
                    small town on the Mediterranean, he suffered shipwreck, and with extreme
                    difficulty saved his life, though with the loss of all his baggage. He
                    afterwards sailed to the isles of Rhodes and Cyprus, and proceeding to Asia
                    Minor, travelled through a considerable part of Syria and Palestine, visiting
                    Hassia, Latakca, Aleppo, and Tripoli, near which last city he was again in
                    imminent danger of perishing in a river. The ruins of Palmyra and Baalbec were
                    next carefully surveyed and sketched by him; and his drawings of these places
                    are deposited in the king’s library at Kew, “the most magnificent present in
                    that line,” to use his own words, “ever made by a subject to his sovereign.’ Mr
                    Bruce published no particular account of these various journeys; but Dr Murray,
                    in the second edition, introduced from Bruce’s MSS. some account of his travels
                    in Tunis.</p>
                <p>In these various travels some years were passed; and Mi Bruce now prepared for
                    the grand expedition, the accomplishment of which had ever been nearest his
                    heart,—the discovery of the supposed sources of the Nile. In the prosecution of
                    that dangerous object he left Sidon on the lôth of June 1768, and arrived at
                    Alexandria on the 20th of that month. He proceeded from thence to Cairo, where
                    he remained till the 12th of December following, when he embarked on the Nile,
                    and sailed up the river as far as Syene, visiting in the course of the voyage
                    the ruins of Thebes. Leaving Kenne on the Nile on the 16th February 1769, he
                    crossed the desert of the Thebaid to Cosseir on the Red Sea, and arrived at
                    Jidda on the 3d of May. In Arabia Felix he remained, not without making several
                    excursions, till the 3d of September, when he sailed from Loheia, and arrived on
                    the 19th at Masuah, where he was detained near two months by the treachery and
                    avarice of the naybe of that place. It was not till the 15th of November that he
                    was allowed to quit Arkeeko, near Masuah; and he arrived on the 15th of February
                    1770 at Gondar, the capital of Abyssinia, where he ingratiated himself with the
                    most considerable persons of both sexes belonging to the court. Several months
                    were employed in attendance on the king, and in an unsuccessful expedition round
                    the lakeofDem-bea. Towards the end of October Mr Bruce set out for the sources
                    <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> Bahr el Azrek, which he supposed to be the
                    principal branch of the Nile, though it is now generally agreed that this rank
                    ought to be assigned to the Bahr el Abiad. At this long-desired spot he arrived
                    on the 14th of November; and his feelings on the accomplishment of his wishes
                    cannot be better expressed than in his own words:</p>
                <p>“It is easier to guess than to describe the situation of my mind at that moment,
                    standing in that spot which had baffled the genius, industry, and inquiry of
                    ancients and moderns for the course of near three thousand years. Kings had
                    attempted this discovery at the head of armies; and each expedition was
                    distinguished from the last only by the difference of the numbers which had
                    perished, and agreed alone in the disappointment which had uniformly and without
                    exception followed them all. Fame, riches, and honour, had been held out for a
                    series of ages to every individual of those myriads whom princes commanded,
                    without having produced one man capable of gratifying the curiosity of his
                    sovereign, or wiping off this stain upon the enterprise and abilities of
                    mankind, or adding this desideratum for the encouragement of geography. Though a
                    mere private Briton, I triumphed here in my own mind over kings and their
                    armies; and every comparison was leading nearer and nearer to the presumption,
                    when the place itself where I stood, the object of my vain-glory, suggested what
                    depressed my short-lived triumphs. 1 was but a few minutes arrived at the source
                    of the hde, through numberless dangers and sufferings, the least of which would
                    have overwhelmed me, but for the continu goodness and protection of Providence;
                    I was, however, but then half through my journey, and all those dangers which 1
                    had already passed awaited me again on my return-found a despondency gaining
                    ground fast upon me, an blasting the crown of laurels I had too rashly woven or
                    myself.”</p>
                <p>When he returned to rest on the night of that discovery, repose was sought for in
                    vain. “Melancholy reflections <pb break="no" facs="nls:193740954"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-0954-0607"/>upon my present state, the doubtfulness of my
                    return in safety, were I permitted to make the attempt, and the fears that even
                    this would be refused, according to the rule observed in Abyssinia with all
                    travellers who have once entered the kingdom; the consciousness of the pain that
                    I was then occasioning to many worthy individuals, expecting daily that
                    information concerning my situation which it was not in my power to give them;
                    and some other thoughts, perhaps, still nearer the heart than those, crowded
                    upon my mind, and forbade all approach of sleep.</p>
                <p>“I was, at that very moment, in possession of what had for many years been the
                    principal object of my ambition and wishes; indifference, which, from the usual
                    infirmity of human nature, follows, at least for a time, complete enjoyment, had
                    taken place of it. The marsh and the fountains, upon comparison with the rise of
                    many of our rivers, became now a trifling object in my sight. I remembered that
                    magnificent scene in my own native country, where the Tweed, Clyde, and Annan
                    rise in one hill; three rivers, I now thought, not inferior to the Nile in
                    beauty, preferable to it in the cultivation of those countries through which
                    they flow; superior, vastly superior, to it in the virtues and qualities of the
                    inhabitants, and in the beauty of the flocks, crowding its pastures in peace,
                    without fear of violence from man or beast. I had seen the rise of the Rhine and
                    Rhone, and the more magnificent sources of the Saône; 1 began, in my sorrow, to
                    treat the inquiry about the source of the Nile as a violent effort of a
                    distempered fancy. Grief and despondency now rolling upon me like a torrent,
                    relaxed, not refreshed, by unquiet and imperfect sleep, I started from my bed in
                    the utmost agony. I went to the door of my tent. Every thing was still; the
                    Nile, at whose head I stood, was not capable either to promote or to interrupt
                    my slumbers; but the coolness and serenity of the night braced my nerves, and
                    chased away those phantoms that while in bed had oppressed and tormented me.</p>
                <p>“It was true, that numerous dangers, hardships, and sorrows, had beset me through
                    this half of my excursion; but it was still as true, that another guide, more
                    powerful than my own courage, health, or understanding, if any of them can be
                    called man’s own, had uniformly protected me in all that tedious half. I found
                    my confidence not abated, that still the same guide was able to conduct me to my
                    wished-for home. I immediately resumed my former fortitude, considered the Nile
                    as indeed no more than rising from springs as all other rivers do, but widely
                    differing in this, that it was the palm for three thousand years held out to all
                    the nations of the world as a <hi rend="italic">detur dignissimo,</hi> which, in
                    my cool hours, I had thought was worth the attempting at the risk of my life,
                    which I had long either resolved to lose, or lay this discovery as a trophy, in
                    which I could have no competitor, for the honour of my country, at the feet of
                    my sovereign, whose servant I was.”</p>
                <p>The object of Mr Bruce’s wishes being now gratified, he bent his thoughts on his
                    return to his native country. He arrived at Gondar on the 19th November 1770,
                    but found, after repeated solicitations, that it was by no means an easy task to
                    obtain permission to quit Abyssinia. A civil war in the mean time breaking out,
                    several engagements took place between the king’s forces and the troops of the
                    rebels, particularly three actions at a place called ^erbraxos, on the 19th,
                    20th, and 23d of May 1771. In each of these Mr Bruce acted a considerable part,
                    and for bis valiant conduct in the second, received, as a reward from the king,
                    a chain of gold. At Gondar, after these engagements, he again preferred the most
                    earnest entreaties to be allowed to return home, entreaties which were θ∏g
                    resisted; but his health at last giving away, from the anxiety of his mind, the
                    king consented to his departure, on condition of his engaging by oath to return
                    to him in the event of his recovery, with as many of his kindred as He could
                    engage to accompany him.</p>
                <p>After a residence of nearly two years in that wretched ^™ <hi rend="superscript">
                    tr</hi> y’¥ <hi rend="superscript"> r 3</hi> i <hi rend="superscript"> -uce
                    left</hi> θθndar on the 16th of December 17/1, taking the dangerous way of the
                    desert of Nubia instead of the more easy road of Masuah, by which lie entered
                    Abyssinia. He was induced to take this route, from his former experience of the
                    cruel and savage temper of the naybe of Masuah. Arriving at Teawa on the 2lst
                    March 1772, Mr Bruce had the misfortune to find the sheikh Fidele at Atbara, the
                    counterpart of the naybe of Masuah in every bad quality. By his intrepidity and
                    prudence, however, he obtained permission to depart next day, and he arrived at
                    Sennaar on the 29th of the same month.</p>
                <p>Mr Bruce was detained upwards of four months at that miserable and inhospitable
                    place, the inhabitants of which he thus describes: “War and treason seem to be
                    the only employment .of these horrid people, whom Heaven has separated by almost
                    impassable deserts from the rest of mankind, confining them to an accursed spot,
                    seemingly to give them an earnest in time of the only other state worse which he
                    has reserved to them for an eternal hereafter.” This delay was occasioned by the
                    villany of those who had undertaken to supply him with money; but at last, by
                    disposing of nearly the whole of his gold chain, the well-earned trophy of
                    Serbraxos, he was enabled to make preparations for his dangerous journey through
                    the deserts of Nubia.</p>
                <p>He left Sennaar on the 5th of September, and arrived on the 3d of October at
                    Chendi, which he quitted on the 20 th, and travelled through the desert of Gooz,
                    reaching the village of that name on the 26th of October. On the 9th of November
                    he left Gooz, and entered upon the most dreadful and dangerous part of his
                    journey. All his camels having perished, Mr Bruce was under the necessity of
                    abandoning his baggage in the desert, and with the greatest difficulty reached
                    Assouan upon the Nile on the 29th of November. After some days’ rest, having
                    procured fresh camels, he returned into the desert, and recovered his baggage,
                    among which was a quadrant of three feet radius, supplied by Louis XV. from the
                    military academy at Marseilles.</p>
                <p>On the 10th of January 1773, after more than four years’ absence, he arrived at
                    Cairo, where, by his manly and generous behaviour, he so won the heart of
                    Mahomet Bey, that he obtained a firman, permitting the commanders of English
                    vessels belonging to Bombay and Bengal to bring their ships and merchandise to
                    Suez, a place far preferable in all respects to Jidda, to which they were
                    formerly confined. Of this permission, which no European nation could ever
                    before acquire, many English vessels have since availed themselves; and it has
                    proved peculiarly useful both in public and private dispatches. Such was the
                    conclusion of his laborious∙and memorable journey through the desert.</p>
                <p>At Cairo Mr Bruce’s earthly career had nearly been concluded by a disorder in his
                    leg, occasioned by a worm in the flesh. This accident kept him five weeks in
                    extreme agony, and his health was not re-established till a twelvemonth
                    afterwards, at the baths of Porretta in Italy. On his return to Europe Mr Bruce
                    was received with all the admiration due to his enterprising character. After
                    passing a considerable time in France, particularly at Montbard, with his friend
                    the Comte de Buffon, by whom he was received with much hospitality, and is
                    mentioned with great applause, he at last revisited his native country, from
                    which he had been upwards of twelve years absent.</p>
                <p>It was now expected that he would take the earliest <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193740967" xml:id="kp-eb0705-0967-0608"/>opportunity of giving to the
                    world a narrative of his travels, in which the public curiosity could not but be
                    deeply interested. But several circumstances contributed to delay the
                    publication. “My friends at home,” says he, <hi rend="superscript"> ((</hi> gave
                    me up for dead; and as my death must have happened in circumstances difficult to
                    have been proved, my property became as it were a <hi rend="italic"
                    >hoereditas</hi><hi rend="italic">jacens,</hi> without an owner, abandoned in
                    common to those whose original title extended no further than temporary
                    possession. A number of law-suits were the inevitable consequence of this upon
                    my return. To these disagreeable avocations, which took up much time, were added
                    others still more unfortunate. The relentless ague, caught at Bengazi,
                    maintained its ground, at times, for a space of more than sixteen years, though
                    every remedy had been used, but in vain; and what was worst of all, a lingering
                    distemper had seriously threatened the life of a most near relation (his second
                    wife), which, after nine years constant alarm, where every duty bound me to
                    attention and attendance, conducted her at last, in very early life, to her
                    grave.” Amidst the anxiety and the distress thus occasioned, Mr Bruce was by no
                    means neglectful of his private affairs. He considerably improved his landed
                    property, inclosing and cultivating the waste grounds; and he highly embellished
                    his paternal seat.</p>
                <p>The termination of some law-suits, and of other business, which had occupied much
                    of his time, having at length afforded leisure to Mr Bruce to put his materials
                    in order, his long-expected work made its appearance in 1790, seventeen years
                    after his return to Europe. It consisted of five large quarto volumes,
                    embellished with plates and charts; was dedicated to the king, and introduced by
                    a striking and manly preface. It is unnecessary to enter into any criticism or
                    analysis of this celebrated work. It is universally allowed to be replete with
                    curious and useful information, and to abound in narratives which at once excite
                    our admiration and interest our feelings. The very singular and extraordinary
                    picture which it gives of Abyssinian manners startled the belief of some. One
                    fact in particular which he stated shipwrecked his reputation, and the world of
                    literature from Johnson down to the author of Munchausen ridiculed the statement
                    as unworthy of credit. It was, that the Abyssinians were in the practice of
                    eating raw meat cut out of a living cow. This, though believed in France and
                    other continental countries, was treated as a fable in England. The shafts of
                    ridicule, envy, and malice, were levelled at his devoted head. The great
                    moralist himself went so far as to doubt his ever having been in the country at
                    all. This was too much for a spirit like that of Bruce, proud, and conscious of
                    its own integrity. He had braved the simoom in the burning sands of Nubia; he
                    had perseverance and strength of mind enough to achieve a triumph which had
                    baffled the efforts of mankind for three thousand years; but all that he
                    received at the hands of his contemporaries was obloquy and contempt. Posterity,
                    however, has done him justice. Every succeeding traveller who has visited the
                    country bears testimony to his veracity, and shows that he has in an eminent
                    degree kept faith with his honour and his fame. The most startling statements,
                    in particular, which he made, have since been fully verified. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Abyssinia,</hi> vol. ii. p. 61 of this work.) There are indeed
                    a few errors in dates and other cncumstances, but they are of no great moment,
                    and in no degree deduct from the general authenticity of his travels.</p>
                <p>The language of the work is in general harsh and unpolished, though sometimes
                    animated. Too great a display of vanity runs through the whole; and the apparent
                    ιacihty with which the traveller gained the most familiar access to the courts,
                    and even to the harems, of the sovereigns of the countries through which he
                    passed, is apt to create in readers some doubts of the accuracy of the
                    narration. Yet there appears upon the whole such an air of manly veracity, and’
                    circumstances are mentioned with a minuteness so unlike deceit, that these
                    doubts are overcome by the general impression of truth which the whole detail
                    irresistibly fastens upon the mind. The first impression being almost wholly
                    disposed of within a short time, Bruce had stipulated for a second edition,
                    which was preparing for the press when death removed the author from this
                    transitory stage.</p>
                <p>This event happened on the 26th of April 1794. In the evening of that day, when
                    some company were departing, Bruce attended them down stairs; but on the steps
                    his foot slipped, and he fell down headlong. He was taken up speechless, and
                    remained in a state of insensibility for eight or nine hours, when he expired on
                    the 27th of April 1794, in the sixty-fifth year of his age. He married, for his
                    second wife, at Carronhall, on the 20th May 1776, Mary, eldest daughter of
                    Thomas Dundas of Fingask. Mrs Bruce died in 1784, after a long and lingering
                    indisposition, during which she was attended with the most affectionate
                    assiduity by her husband. By this marriage Mr Bruce had two sons and one
                    daughter.</p>
                <p>The second edition of these travels was published in 1805, in seven vols. 8vo,
                    with a quarto volume of plates, edited by Dr Alexander Murray, who obtained
                    access to all his papers, and illustrated the work with a learning and research
                    which established his fame as an oriental scholar. A third edition was published
                    in 1813, which, we believe, is now out of print.</p>
                <p>There never, perhaps, existed a man better qualified for the hazardous enterprise
                    he undertook, than Bruce. His person was of the largest size, his height
                    exceeding six feet, and the bulk as well as the strength of his body being
                    proportionally great. He excelled in all personal accomplishments, being a
                    hardy, practised, and indefatigable swimmer, trained to exercise and fatigue of
                    every kind, while his long residence among the Arabs had given him a more than
                    ordinary facility in managing the horse. In the use of fire-arms he was so
                    unerring, that in innumerable instances he never failed to hit the mark; and his
                    dexterity in handling the spear and lance on horseback was also uncommonly
                    great. He was master of most languages, understanding the Greek perfectly; and
                    he was so well skilled in oriental literature, that he revised the New Testament
                    in the Ethiopic, Samaritan, Hebrew, and Syriac, making many useful notes and
                    remarks on difficult passages. He had applied from early youth to mathematics,
                    drawing, and astronomy, and had acquired some knowledge of physic and surgery.
                    His memory was astonishingly retentive, and his judgment sound and vigorous. He
                    was dexterous in negociation, a master of public business, animated with the
                    warmest zeal for the glory of his king and country, a physician in the camp or
                    city, a soldier and horseman in the field; whilst, at the same time, his breast
                    was a stranger to fear, though he took every prθ∙ caution to avoid danger. Such,
                    at least, is his own representation of his character; and though an impartial
                    judge would probably make considerable abatement for the natural bias of a man
                    drawing his own portrait, yet it cannot be denied, that in personal
                    accomplishments Bruce equa ∙ led, if he did not excel, most of his
                    contemporaries; that he was distinguished for vigour of understanding, as well
                    as great literary attainments; and that in active and persevering intrepidity he
                    may be classed with the most characters in any age or country. Thus accomplis ıe
                    , Bruce could not but be eminently fitted for an attemp so full of difficulty
                    and danger as that of penetrating into heart of Abyssinia; and no one who
                    peruses his accou <pb break="no" facs="nls:193740980"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-0980-0609"/>of the expedition can fail to pay an unfeigned
                    tribute of admiration to his intrepidity, manliness, and uncommon dexterity in
                    extricating himself out of situations the most dangerous and alarming, in the
                    course of his long and hazardous journey. Not to mention his conduct during his
                    residence in Abyssinia, his behaviour at Masuah, Teawa, and Sennaar, evinces the
                    uncommon vigour of his mind; but it was chiefly during his passage through the
                    Nubian desert that his fortitude, courage, and prudence, appeared to the
                    greatest advantage. Of his learning and sagacity, his delineation of the course
                    of Solomon’s fleet from Tarshish to Ophir, his account of the cause of the
                    inundations of the Nile, and his comprehensive view of the Abyssinian history,
                    afford ample proofs. He expresses throughout all his works a deep and lively
                    sense of the care of a superintending Providence, without whose influence he was
                    convinced of the futility of all human ability and foresight to preserve from
                    danger. He appears to have been a serious believer of the truth of Christianity;
                    and his illustrations of some parts of the sacred writings are original and
                    valuable.</p>
