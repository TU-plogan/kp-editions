                <p><label type="entry">BORING</label>, generally speaking, is the art of perforating
                    a solid body. In the present article we propose to give some account of the
                    boring of <hi rend="smallcaps">Cannon,</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    rend="smallcaps">Wooden Pipes.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Boring of Cannon</hi> is performed by placing the cannon
                    on an axis, which is turned by a very strong power, whilst a steel cutter, in
                    form of a drill, is pressed against the metal, and excavates the cylindrical
                    cavity which is required. Boring may be considered as a branch of the art of
                    turning, which, in general, is the formation of cones, cylinders, and other
                    figures that have an axis, by making a straight line or curve revolve round the
                    axis on which the material is fixed, or by making the material revolve whilst
                    the generating line remains at rest. In turning bodies of no great degree of
                    hardness, and where it is required to take off only a small portion of the
                    surface at once, a small power is sufficient to put the turning machine in
                    motion; and the longer the edge of the cutter which is applied to the metal is,
                    and the harder the metal, the greater force is required to turn the machine.</p>
                <p>Cannon, at first, were frequently made of bars of malleable iron, placed
                    longitudinally, and these bars covered with iron hoops, the whole welded or
                    brazed together. Ordnance of this construction was not sufficiently strong to
                    resist the explosion of the powder, and did not admit of the cylindrical cavity
                    being formed with much accuracy. Its use was, therefore, gradually laid aside,
                    and guns of cast-metal were employed. And before the casting of cannon became
                    general, guns of cast-metal were reserved for the most important situations;
                    thus the ships of the admiral and vice-admiral alone had cast-metal cannon, the
                    other ships of war being armed with wrought-iron guns only.</p>
                <p>Copper, without mixture, has been employed to cast guns, as appears from two
                    large cannon made in the time of Henry VIII. and bearing his name, in the
                    armoury of the Tower of London. But the only two materials now used for cannon
                    are bronze, which is a mixture of copper and tin, and cast-iron. In modern times
                    the use of cast-iron cannon has become more general, as that metal has the
                    advantage of not being softened by the heat of the inflammation of the powder;
                    whereas brass guns, when fired many times in rapid succession, become heated so
                    nearly to the melting temperature of the metal, that the muzzle of the gun
                    droops.</p>
                <p>The first cannon made of cast-metal were cast hollow, with a cavity as nearly
                    cylindrical as could be executed by casting. The surface of this cavity was then
                    smoothed on a boring machine by steel cutters set in a copper head, and disposed
                    so as to describe a cylinder terminated by a half spheroid. These cutters (in
                    French <hi rend="italic">alezoirs,</hi> and the operation <hi rend="italic"
                    >alézer)</hi> are represented in the French <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedic—</hi>
                    planches, <hi rend="italic">Ponte.</hi> This method of making guns has long been
                    laid aside on account of the holes and inequalities in the cavity thus formed,
                    and the difficulty of casting the cavity so as that its axis shall coincide with
                    the axis of the piece. Cannon are now always cast solid, and the cylindrical
                    cavity is formed by boring in this solid mass.</p>
                <p>The power employed for boring cannon ought to be in proportion to the hardness of
                    the metal of which they are composed, and to the size of the pieces. For the
                    boring of guns of brass, as it is called, that is, a metal composed of ten parts
                    of copper, one of tin, and two of brass, or of these metals in other
                    proportions, a metal softer and more easily bored than cast-iron, horses are
                    frequently employed as a moving power; but the strong moving powers of water or
                    steam must be had recourse to for boring large guns of cast-iron, which is the
                    material used for making the largest guns now in use, and is also the hardest
                    substance used in their manufacture. Indeed some kinds of cast-iron are too hard
                    to admit the action of the borer; and for the making of guns it is necessary to
                    melt pig-iron of different qualities together, in order to have a metal that
                    shall possess no more than the required degree of hardness.</p>
                <p>The quality of pig-iron is known by the appearance of its surface, but more
                    decisively by the appearance which its fracture presents. To obtain this
                    fracture, a man takes one end of a pig in each hand, and lifting it as high
                    above his head as he can, throws it with force, so that the middle of the pig
                    shall fall across another pig placed on the ground. In this way the pig thrown
                    down is broken. Soft or grey pig-iron, which is the most valuable, breaks with
                    difficulty, and the surface of its fracture is of a grey colour, composed of
                    pretty large crystalline grains. Hard or white pig-iron breaks easily; the
                    surface of the fracture is white, and not sensibly granulated, the grains that
                    compose it being small. The pig-iron here <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733089"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3089-0002"/>spoken of is that smelted by the coak of pit-coal.
                    Pig-iron smelted with charcoal of wood has a fracture of a different appearance,
                    sometimes lamellar, like the fracture of metallic bismuth. Formerly guns used to
                    be cast from the blast furnace; that is to say, immediately from the ironstone.
                    This was attended with uncertainty in respect to the nature of the metal; for
                    the nature of the metal given by the blast-furnace varies frequently and
                    suddenly, from causes either unknown, or not under the command of the
                    iron-master. For this reason guns are no longer cast from the blast-furnace, but
                    pig-iron already formed is taken, of such qualities and in such proportions as
                    to form a metal neither too soft nor too brittle and hard for guns. The
                    different kinds of pig-iron thus selected are melted together in a furnace,
                    called in iron manufactories an <hi rend="italic">air-furnace,</hi> and by some
                    writers a <hi rend="italic">reverberatory furnace,</hi> by' the flame of
                    pit-coal; the flame being impelled by a strong current of air produced by the
                    rarefaction of the air in a chimney of thirty or forty feet in height. The
                    column of the atmosphere of which the air in the chimney makes a part being
                    lighter than the unrarefied columns of the atmosphere next it, its equilibrium
                    with these columns is destroyed. The neighbouring columns, therefore, rush
                    through the grate of the furnace, which is the only aperture by which they can
                    attain the bottom of the rarefied column; and they carry the flame of the coal
                    against the pig-iron, which is thereby brought into fusion. From the iron thus
                    fused only one large gun is cast at a time, the furnace not being capable of
                    melting more metal than is requisite for that purpose.</p>
                <p>- The gun is cast with two appendages, which are to come off before it is
                    finished and ready for use. The one is a square piece beyond the cascabel, for
                    fixing the gun so as to revolve with the axis of the boring-mill; and the other
                    is the head.</p>
                <p>The head in cast-iron cannon is a mass of cast-iron two or three feet long, and
                    somewhat bell-shaped. It is a prolongation of the mass of metal beyond the
                    muzzle ring, and, in the position in which the gun is cast, the bead is the top
                    of the whole mass, the square beyond the cascabel being the lowest part. 'After
                    the metal has cooled, the upper surface of the head is cavernous, as is the case
                    with the surface that is uppermost during the casting and cooling of any large
                    body of cast-iron. The sides of the cavities in the head are frequently formed
                    of cast-iron crystallized in a fern-leaf form. The intention of the head is to
                    prevent these cavities, which are formed most abundantly at the upper surface of
                    the cooling cast-iron, from forming in the gun itself. But, notwithstanding the
                    precaution of casting the gun with a large head, and of mixing proper kinds of
                    cast-iron in the air-furnace, it frequently happens that small cavities occur in
                    the guns.</p>
                <p>The gun with its head being cast and allowed to cool, it is conveyed to the
                    boring-mill, where the head is to be taken off, the cylindrical cavity or bore
                    is to be formed, and the outside of the gun is to be turned. Formerly the boring
                    of guns was done in an upright position; the gun being placed above the
                    boring-bar, was fixed in a frame sliding vertically in grooves. This frame was
                    suspended on each side by a block and tackle, and the end of each of the two
                    ropes was wound round a windlass. By turning these windlasses the gun might be
                    raised or lowered, and by this means might be allowed either to press with its
                    whole weight on the boring-bit, or with any part of its whole weight. A figure
                    of this apparatus may be seen in the French <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie—</hi>
                    planches, <hi rend="italic">Ponte.</hi> Another vertical apparatus for boring
                    cannon is represented in Rinman, <hi rend="italic">Bergwerks Lexico,</hi>
                    Stockholm, 1789, tab. iv.</p>
                <p>I The practice which has long been followed in this country is to place the gun
                    horizontally in the boring-mill; and it is fixed on the axis of the mill by
                    means of the square piece at the cascabel.</p>
                <p>In a boring-mill constructed by Smeaton, one gun is placed on the horizontal axis
                    of the water-wheel itself, and, consequently, revolves with the same velocity.
                    On this same axis is a toothed wheel with seventy-eight teeth, which works two
                    wheels, one placed on each side of it, and each having twenty-nine teeth. On the
                    axis of each of these a gun is placed; their power is ^ŷths of the power of the
                    centre wheel. (See Smeaton’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> vol. i.) On the
                    axis where the power is least, smaller sized guns are bored; on the axis of the
                    greatest power the large guns are bored. A crane, movable on a vertical axis,
                    with a sweep that extends over all the carriages, with a tackle hanging from its
                    beam, and wrought by a windlass, serves to place the gun on the carriage where
                    it is to be bored, or to remove it from one carriage to another if required; and
                    afterwards, when the gun is bored and turned, the crane serves to remove the gun
                    from the boring-mill.</p>
                <p>The gun, when placed on the. machine, has the square at the cascabel fixed in a
                    square iron box (G, Plate CXI. fig. 5) on the axis. This box has a screw passing
                    through each of its sides, and by the operation of these screws the square of
                    the gun is adjusted, centred, and fixed; the chace of the gun is also fixed in a
                    collar N, in which it is to revolve. (The collar in the figure is represented
                    too near the muzzle ring.)</p>
                <p>The axis on which each gun is fixed maybe set in gear, or put in connection with
                    the revolving axis of the machine, so as to move round with it; or taken out of
                    gear so as to remain at rest, although the other parts of the machine continue
                    in movement. There are various methods of doing this. One is given by Smeaton in
                    the work above cited. After the gun is fixed on the axis, and before beginning
                    the operation of boring, the head, which has been described above, is cut
                    off’near the muzzle ring. For this purpose the gun is set in gear so as to
                    revolve on its axis with the moving power; and a bar of steel, in shape and size
                    like the coulter of a plough, is applied at right angles to the axis of the gun.
                    The narrow side of this bar is sharpened to a cutting edge, so that it has the
                    form of one tooth of a very large saw; and this cutting edge is opposed to the
                    direction of the revolving motion of tfie gun, and held strongly on to the gun
                    by a screw pressing on the bar; the cutter takes off an angular portion at right
                    angles to the axis, till the cylindrical part connecting the head with the gun
                    is so much diminished, that the head is made to fall off by the blow of a hammer
                    applied on it. In brass guns, cast with a core, the head was sawed off by hand
                    with a blade of steel, whose edge was toothed as a saw, while the sides were
                    toothed as files. See the French <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie—</hi> planches,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ponte.</hi></p>
                <p>A great degree of heat is generated by the violent friction of the steel-cutter
                    on the cast-iron during the operation of cutting off the heads of guns. The
                    quantity of this heat has been estimated by Rumford in one of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays on Heat.</hi></p>
                <p>After the head is taken off, the workmen proceed to bore the gun. This is done by
                    exposing the revolving gun to the action of a steel-cutter, fixed on the end of
                    a bar, which bar is placed on a carriage, and impelled continually towards the
                    gun. The operation of boring is done on the same axis on which the head was cut
                    off, if the power be sufficient; if not, the gun is removed, by means of the
                    crane, to an axis, where it is made to revolve by a stronger power.</p>
                <p>The boring-bar is fixed on a carriage sliding in iron grooves, which are truest
                    when made triangular. The carriage, which, in the apparatus represented at fig.
                    5, consists merely of the bar on which the rack is, is pressed <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733102" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3102-0003"/>forward by a pinion P, whose
                    gudgeons are on a fixed frame BB; and this pinion works into a rack R. The axis
                    of the pinion has mortised holes in it, through which one end of a lever L is
                    passed; and the other end of this lever is loaded with a weight W, which causes
                    the pinion to propel the carriage and boring-bar towards the gun. In many
                    boring-machines there are two pinions on the same axis, acting on two racks; in
                    others, the carriage is propelled by two upright levers, on the end of one of
                    which acts a weight, hanging from a rope, that passes over a pulley; the lower
                    end of the upper lever acts on the upper end of the lower, whilst the lower
                    extremity of the lower lever presses forward the carriage. This method, which is
                    free from any inequalities that may arise from the teeth of the rack, is figured
                    by Smeaton in his <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> vol. i. p. 396. Another method
                    of propelling the carriage of the boringbar, is by a screw acting on the end of
                    the carriage. See Meyer in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Academy of
                    Stockholm,</hi> 1782, tab. ix.</p>
                <p>The boring-bar is a very strong piece of wrought iron, of less diameter than the
                    intended calibre of the piece, in order that the boring dust or shavings
                    detached by the cutter may be got out. The boring-bar is increased in diameter
                    near the end, for some inches, see fig. 6, B; in this part there is a
                    superficial groove for receiving the sides of the steel-cutter or bit, which is
                    to be firmly fixed in the bar. The bit T, fig. 6, is made from a rectangular
                    piece of a steel bar, in which the two upper angles are cut off obliquely, so as
                    to form two cutting edges like an obtuse-angled drill; the side of the
                    rectangle, opposite to the point of the drill, is then hollowed out in the form
                    of a pigeon hole; and this hollow fits into and embraces the solid part of the
                    boring-bar, whilst the sides of the pigeon hole fit into the grooves of the bar.
                    The point of this obtuse-angled bit is pressed against the revolving metal of
                    the gun, by the force which propels the boring-bar; and the edges coming in
                    contact with the revolving metal, a conical cavity is produced; so that, by
                    taking off successively a multitude of similar shells or shavings, the
                    cylindrical bore, with a conical termination, is formed. The diameter of the
                    pointed bit first used must be less than the intended calibre of the piece, as
                    the boring is to be repeated again at least once, in order to make the internal
                    cylindrical surface as smooth as possible, by taking off any inequalities that
                    have been left by the first cutter. In finishing the bore, a cross bit may be
                    employed. It is a rectangular piece of steel, ground to a cutting edge at each
                    end, and put through a hole in the boring-bar, in which it is fixed. The edges
                    of this cutter, in revolving, describe a cylindrical surface. After the
                    cylindrical surface of the bore is made sufficiently true, and of the required
                    calibre, a bit without a point, and rounded off to the desired curve, is used to
                    form the bottom of the chamber.</p>
                <p>Some recommend that the boring-bit for cast-iron should have its cutting edges
                    brought to an acute angle, by being filed hollow; but in this case the two edges
                    cannot be brought into one point; for the obtuse-angled edge formed by the
                    thickness of the metal of the bit joins the two cutting edges crossways, and
                    forces itself forwards by being near the centre, requiring, however, a
                    considerable pressure. These hollow-edged bits are not so well adapted to
                    continuance of grinding as the plain ones, but they make amends by their much
                    less frequently wanting sharpening. It does not appear, however, that these
                    hollow-edged bits have been found advantageous in gun-boring.</p>
                <p>The howitzer appears to have had its origin in Germany. This piece of ordnance,
                    the mortar, and the carronade, in all of which the diameter of the chamber for
                    the powder is smaller than the diameter of the rest of the bore, are first bored
                    all through, nearly to the intended calibre of the chamber, and then that part
                    of the bore that requires it is enlarged.</p>
                <p>The cutters in gun-boring become magnetic, in consequence of being continually
                    rubbed in the same direction, so that the boring dust is seen adhering and
                    hanging from their edges when they are withdrawn from the gun. *</p>
                <p>It is required that the bore shall be a Cylindrical cavity whose axis coincides
                    with the axis of the gun: for this purpose, care must be taken to place the axis
                    of the boring-bar, and that of the gun, both in one horizontal line, and it is
                    requisite that these two lines continue in this position during the whole
                    operation of boring. The centring of the boring-bar for this purpose requires to
                    be done by an experienced workman, and an accurately-constructed boring-machine
                    is necessary for the continuance of the right position.</p>
                <p>Whilst on the axis of the mill, the gun has a smooth outer surface given it by
                    turning tools, which are applied in the way usual in turning metals; a wooden
                    gauge, or cut-out profile, of the gun, with its intended mouldings, being
                    applied to know when the turning has been continued to a proper depth. When this
                    is done the gun is taken out of the boring-mill; the square at the cascabel is
                    cut off by the chisel; and the trunions, and other parts which are not
                    susceptible of being turned, are dressed by the chisel. The cyphers and arms
                    which had been cast on the gun are finished by the chisel.</p>
                <p>A cannon is said to constitute the <hi rend="italic">ultima ratio regurn,</hi>
                    the last argument that governments have recourse to; and even this severe kind
                    of argument has sometimes been embellished. Amongst ornamented cannon, the brass
                    three-pounder in the Tower, brought from Malta, is a masterpiece; it is covered
                    with carving in a good taste by a sculptor of Rome.</p>
                <p>The touch-hole is drilled by stock and bit, or by drill and bow; the drill being
                    propelled by a lever placed on a carriage, movable on wheels. A figure of this
                    apparatus is given in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie—</hi> planches, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ponte.</hi> Another apparatus for this purpose is figured in

                    4to, Paris, 1794. This work was published by order of the revolutionary
                    government, and distributed to the iron-masters and founders in different parts
                    of France, for their instruction. It contains, amongst others, figures and
                    descriptions of two kinds of vertical boring machines, of three kinds of
                    horizontal boring machines, of a machine for turning the trunions, of two
                    different machines for boring the touch-hole, of a machine for putting copper
                    boshes in brass guns, and of various instruments for examining and proving
                    guns.'</p>
                <p>Before the gun is sent off, it is examined and proved in various ways. And first,
                    to ascertain whether the bore is free from holes, an instrument is employed,
                    consisting of several elastic steel prongs disposed in a circle, and with their
                    sharp points turned outwards. This being fixed on a pole, is introduced into the
                    bore of the gun, and drawn to and fro; the points of the prongs press against
                    the sides of the bore, and the presence of a hole is known by one of the prongs
                    getting into the hole, and preventing the instrument from being drawn out
                    directly, unless by the use of a ring that is pushed over the prongs to unbend
                    them.</p>
                <p>There is another instrument, composed of a board twice as long as the bore of the
                    piece. Along the middle of the board is a groove proceeding in a straight line.'
                    In this groove a button is movable, and on the button, as a centre, are fixed
                    two radii or arms; the two ends of these arms within the gun describe a line on
                    the inside of thebore when the button is pushed inwards, whilst the extremities
                    of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733115" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3115-0004"/>arms on
                    the outside describe two similar lines on the part of the board that is situate
                    without the bore. In this way the outline of a longitudinal section of the bore
                    is described, and its sinuosities or deviation from the axis are rendered
                    sensible. This instrument is seldom used; it requires to be made by a workman
                    skilled in the construction of mathematical instruments, or in watchmaking.</p>
                <p>A lighted wax-candle is introduced into the gun for the purpose of seeing any
                    defects there may be in the bore, or the light of the sun is reflected into the
                    bore by a mirror. The strength of the gun is proved by firing it with a large
                    charge of powder; and by forcing water into the bore by a powerful forcing pump,
                    the touch-hole being stopped, and also the mouth of the piece, so that water
                    forced in by the mouth cannot return that way.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Boring of Cylinders</hi> for steam-engines, and for
                    blowing machines, and the boring of the working barrels of large pumps, and
                    other hollow cylinders in which pistons are to work, is performed by making the
                    steel-cutters describe a cylindrical surface on the inside of the cylinder,
                    whilst the cylinder remains fixed. The first steamengine cylinders in this
                    country were of brass, or of a mixture of copper and tin. This was the case with
                    the cylinder of the steam-engine erected in the early part of the eighteenth
                    century for lifting water from the colliery of Elphinston in Stirlingshire. But
                    since that period the construction of steam-engines, and the manufacture of
                    cast-iron, have been greatly improved; the uses of both have been much extended;
                    and cast-iron has now for a long time been the only material employed in making
                    cylinders for steam-engines, and other large cylinders in which pistons are to
                    move.</p>
                <p>In the boring of cylinders the steel-cutters are fixed in a cutter-head, which
                    revolves with the boring-bar at the same time that it is impelled along the
                    interior surface of the cylinder by a rack, with a pinion moved by a lever and
                    weight as already described. The axis or boring-bar employed for cylinders is a
                    hollow tube of cast-iron, and has a groove passing through it; the length of
                    this groove being proportioned to the length of the cylinder to be bored. The
                    cutter-head consists of two cast-iron rings, the first of which is accurately
                    fitted on the boring-bar, which is turned truly cylindrical, so that this ring
                    may slide along the boring-bar; the second ring is fixed round the first by
                    wedges, its diameter being proportioned to the diameter of the cylinder to be
                    bored; and on its circumference are eight notches to receive the steel-cutters,
                    which are fixed in by wedges. The firstring is fixed on the boring-bar so as to
                    make the whole cutter-head move round with the boring-bar, by means of two small
                    iron bars, which go through notches in the first ring, and pass through the
                    groove of the boring-bar. These small bars have each a round hole in the part
                    which passes through the geometrical axis of the boring-bar; through these round
                    holes there passes a bolt, which forms the end of the rack; a key is put through
                    the end of the bolt, which prevents the rack from being drawn back by the lever
                    and weight; and by this means the rack, impelled by the lever and weight, pushes
                    forward the cutter-head, which is at the same time revolving with the
                    boring-bar; while the connection of the rack and cutter-head being round, and in
                    the axis of motion, the rack is thereby free from the circular motion of the
                    cutter-head. This mode of constructing the boring-bar was invented in the works
                    of Mr Wilkinson, at the time when accurately-bored cylinders came to be required
                    in consequence of Mr Watt’s improvements in the steamengine. In the machines
                    about to be mentioned the cutters are made to advance by a train of wheels
                    deriving their motion from the power that turns the boring-bar.</p>
                <p>An apparatus of great merit was contrived and describe ed in 1802 by Mr
                    Billingsley, engineer of the BowIing iron-works, near Bradford. (See <hi
                    rend="italic">Repertory of Arts,</hi> second series, vol. ii. p. 322.) According
                    to his method the cylinder is placed with its axis perpendicular to the horizon.
                    The object of this is, <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> that the boring-dust may
                    fall out, and not remain on one side of the cylinder, wearing the cutters; so
                    that in this way the cylinder may be bored through without changing the cutters,
                    by which means a more regular bore is obtained. <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi>
                    That the cylinder may not deviate from its cylindrical form by its own weight, a
                    deviation which is found to take place in large and slender cylinders when laid
                    on their side; the vertical diameter being then less than the horizontal
                    diameter. A similar loss of shape may happen to cylinders that are improperly
                    wedged and strapped down for the purpose of being bored. In this method the
                    cylinder is fixed with screws by the flanges, where it is most capable of
                    resistance, and the screws are disposed so as to press the cylinder equally all
                    round. <hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> That the operation may be sooner
                    completed, which is effected in consequence of less time being employed to fix
                    the cylinder in this method. In the usual mode of propelling the cutters
                    described above, the attendance of a man is necessary to change the position of
                    the bar on the axis of the pinion, and to raise the weight. This attendance is
                    dispensed with in the machine under consideration, the mechanism for propelling
                    the cutters being as follows: A leather strap passing over the boring-bar
                    communicates the revolving motion of the boring-bar to a wheel, which
                    communicates a slow motion by a train of wheels and pinions to an axis, bearing
                    two pinions which work into two racks; and these racks push the boring-head and
                    cutters slowly forward on the boring-bar, at the same time that the boring-head
                    is revolving with the boring-bar. The velocity with which it is required that
                    the cutters shall advance varies as the diameter of the cylinder varies, the
                    moving power remaining the same. And by altering the train of wheelwork, the
                    cutters may be made to advance with any velocity required.</p>
                <p>Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, Plate CXI., are different views of the machine for boring
                    cylinders, invented by Mr Murray of Leeds. Fig. 1 is an elevation, and fig. 2 a
                    plan, of the machine. W, figs. 1 and 2, is the spur wheel, deriving its motion
                    from water or steam, and communicating a revolving motion to the boring-bar. The
                    toothed wheel A, fig. 1, moves round with the boring-bar B on which it is fixed;
                    it gives motion through the wheels D and E, and to the screw S, whose threads
                    act on the two racks, which racks are fixed to the cutter-head H, and revolve
                    with it. The velocity with which the cutter-head is impelled along the cylinder
                    depends upon the number of threads of the screw in a given length, and on the
                    proportions of the wheels A, C, I), and E, to each other. By varying the
                    velocity of the screw, the cutter-head maybe made to move in either direction up
                    or down the cylinder. F is a pinion whose axis ends in a square, which may be
                    wrought by a key, so as to bring the cutter-head out of the cylinder, or push it
                    home by the hand when that is required. The cylinder is fixed in its bed by
                    screws passing through two iron rings, as represented at fig. 4; and in this way
                    the cylinder is equally pressed in the different parts of its circumference.
                    Fig. 3 is a transverse elevation of the collar in which the end of the bar at A,
                    fig. 1, turns; X is the gudgeon in which the spindle X, fig. 1, turns. In fig. 3
                    are also seen the two apertures through which the two racks pass. By this
                    machine also the flanges are turned truly plane, so that the lid of the cylinder
                    may fit on exactly.</p>
                <p>The patent granted in 1799 to Mr Murdoch, engineer, Redruth, for new methods of
                    constructing steam-engines <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733128"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3128-0005"/>(See <hi rend="italic">Repertory of Arts,</hi>
                    vol. xiii.), contains some articles relative to boring. He employs an endless
                    screw, which is turned by the moving power, and works into a toothed wheel,
                    whose axis carries the cutter-head; and this method, he says, produces a more
                    smooth and steady motion than the usual mode of fixing the boring-bar
                    immediately on the axis turned by the moving power.</p>
                <p>Another article in Mr Murdoch’s patent that relates to boring, is his method of
                    forming the cylinder and steamcase. He casts them of one solid piece, and then
                    bores a cylindrical interstice, by means of a boring-tool, made of a hollow
                    cylinder of iron, with steel-cutters fixed to its edge, and acting like a
                    trepan.</p>
                <p>The chambers of brass pumps, whose diameter does not exceed a few inches, are
                    fixed within iron rings, by means of screws, in the manner described above when
                    speaking of Mr Murray’s apparatus. The rings are made accurately cylindrical by
                    turning, as is also the boring-bar. The boring-bar has four cross arms on its
                    outer extremity, to one of which a handle is fixed, whereby a workman makes the
                    boring-bar revolve. The cutter-head is made to advance along the boring-bar by a
                    screw.</p>

                    Rectangular pieces of iron are forged of a proper length and breadth; these are
                    heated in the fire, and the two long edges, which had been previously thinned
                    off, are welded together on a mandril. The barrel thus formed is fixed by a
                    screw on a carriage that moves in iron grooves; this carriage is propelled
                    towards the boringbar by a rope which passes over pullies, and has a weight
                    hanging from its end. The boring-bar is turned by the power of the same mill
                    that turns the grinding-stones for polishing the outside of the barrels. (See
                    <hi rend="italic">Encyclopedic—</hi> planches, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arquebusier;</hi> and Rozier, <hi rend="italic">Introduction aux Observations
                    sur la Physique,</hi> tom. i. p. 157.) Water is thrown on the barrels whilst
                    boring from a trough placed underneath. After the barrel is bored, the interior
                    surface of the bore is polished by the action of the boringbar. The barrel is
                    tried during the operation, by an iron gauge of an inch and a half in length,
                    and of a diameter equal to the intended diameter of the musket. When the barrel
                    is bored, it is held to the light and looked through, and if it contains any
                    flaw, the place of that flaw is marked on the outside with chalk, and the barrel
                    is put on the mandril again, and the defective place heated and hammered; the
                    workman also examines with a gauge whether the barrel is crooked. When the bore
                    has no flaws, the barrel then undergoes the operation of the grinding-mill, to
                    the effect of polishing its exterior surface.</p>
                <p>Rifled barrels are put on a bench twelve feet long. The boring-bar is guided by a
                    matrix or female-screw, whose spiral curve is similar to the spiral of the
                    rifles intended to be made; the boring-bar being fixed to a male-screw, which
                    passes through the female-screw, and fits it exactly. The female-screw is fixed
                    to the bench, and has four threads and as many furrows; and these threads, in
                    general, return to the point of the circumference from which they set out, or
                    make a revolution in the length of two feet. The male-screw, which fits into the
                    female-screw, has at one end an iron bar attached to it, by which it is put in
                    motion; at the other extremity is fixed the boring-bar, which passes through the
                    barrel to be rifled; and the boring-bar has a cutter fixed in it, which forms a
                    spiral furrow in the barrel when the screw is turned by the handle. The number
                    of spiral threads in rifle-barrels is from three to twelve. Sometimes the
                    threads and furrows of the riflebarrel are required to be in straight lines; in
                    which case a straight-lined matrix is used. In order that the threads may be
                    placed at an equal number of degrees of the circumference from each other, the
                    bench is furnished with a brass plate, divided in the same way as the plate of
                    the machine for cutting the teeth of clock-wheels.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Boring of Portland Stone, so</hi> as to form pipes. That
                    kind of calcareous stone called by geologists oolite, which is quarried for
                    building at Portland, Bath, in the neighbourhood of the city of Paris, and other
                    places, admits of being cut by means of an iron blade, acting as a saw, with
                    sand and water. The more compact limestones and marbles are also cut in this
                    way, but not so easily. The other kinds of stone that can be squared for
                    building, namely, sandstone and granite, scarcely yield to the saw, but are
                    formed into the desired shape by the chisel and hammer. A modification of this
                    mode of working Portland stone consists in forming it into pipes. The method of
                    Sir George Wright, proposed in 1805, is as follows: A hole is drilled through
                    the block of stone, in which a long iron bolt is inserted for the saw to work
                    round as a centre; this bolt forms the axis of the cylinder which is to be taken
                    out, and projects considerably beyond the block at both ends. Another hole is
                    drilled in the intended circumference; and into this the blade of the saw is
                    introduced. The frame of the saw is so disposed, that when it is wrought to and
                    fro, the blade is guided, by means of the centre bolt, so as to describe the
                    intended cylindrical circumference. In this way a solid cylindrical core of
                    stone is detached, and a cylindrical cavity or pipe left in the block. Or the
                    saw may be made to describe a circle without drilling a hole in the centre, by
                    drilling a hole in the circumference, and fixing on the surface of the stone two
                    metallic concentric rings, so that the hole shall be included in the interstice
                    between the rings. The saw is then introduced into the hole, and being worked,
                    it cuts in the circular path formed by the interstice of the rings. See <hi
                    rend="italic">Repertory of Arts,</hi> second series, vol. viii.</p>
                <p>Mr Murdoch’s method, for which he obtained a patent in 1810, is preferable in
                    practice to the above-mentioned method. He employs a cylindrical saw to form the
                    pipe. A plug of wood is inserted in the centre of the intended pipe; this plug
                    receives the lower end of a vertical spindle, longer than the intended pipe; and
                    this spindle is square, with sockets sliding on it. On the upper part of the
                    spindle is a pulley or toothed-wheel, by which the spindle is made to revolve.
                    Near the lower end of the spindle is a wheel, having a circumference like a
                    hoop, three inches broad. The diameter of this wheel is somewhat less than that
                    of the pipe to be bored. It regulates the motion, and fits in the inside of a
                    tube of metal attached to the spindle. The diameter of the tube is nearly equal
                    to that of the intended pipe; but its length is greater by two feet. On the
                    lower edge of the tube is a rim of metal, so much thicker than the tube that the
                    groove cut in the stone by the rim may admit the tube to move freely in it. This
                    rim has an edge like that of a stone-cutter’s saw, and in fact performs the
                    office of a saw. The tube is caused to make a reciprocating circular motion
                    round the spindle. There is a cistern placed above the tube, for the purpose of
                    conveying a mixture of sand and water into the cylindrical groove formed in the
                    stone, whilst the machine is working.</p>
                <p>Stone pipes, made in the above described way, have been tried for conveying water
                    in London. They were joined by means of Parker’s cement, which consists of clay
                    ironstone, burnt, and ground to a fine powder. This was the best material that
                    could be got for forming the joints; but these joints cracked and allowed the
                    water to escape, in consequence of the motion of the carriages on the streets
                    under which the pipes were laid; and the adventurers found that they “had hewed
                    out unto themselves broken cisterns, that could hold no water.”</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="smallcaps">Boring of Rocks,</hi> for the purpose of splitting them
                    by means of gunpowder. We have already treated this subject<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733141" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3141-0006"/> under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Blasting,</hi> and shall only add here the mode of boring for this purpose
                    practised in the mines of Germany.</p>
                <p>A boring bar of steel is applied to the stone by its lower end, whilst its upper
                    extremity is struck with a hammer of two pounds in weight. The form of the lower
                    end of the boring-bar is various; some were fashioned like a swallow’s tail,
                    ending in two points; but this form is no longer in use. Another kind has the
                    and formed by the intersection of two wedge-shaped edges, with a point· at each
                    corner, and one in the middle. A third kind has the end composed of four
                    pyramidal points, with cavities between them. A fourth kind, which is that most
                    frequently used, has the end in form of a wedge. (See Rinman, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eergwerhs Lexico.</hi> Stockholm, 1789, tab. ii.) Three sizes of boring bars
                    are employed to make one hole, the first is the shortest and thickest, the
                    second is longer and less in diameter, the third is the longest and the least in
                    diameter. When a hole is to be made, a small opening is first formed with a pick
                    in the place where the boring-iron is to be applied, and all pieces of the rock
                    are removed that might impede the action of the powder. Then the workman uses
                    the first boring-iron, which he drives with blows of the hammer till the
                    boring-iron can reach no farther; he then employs the second and third
                    boring-bars in like manner; and after each stroke of the hammer, the boring-bar
                    is turned round a portion of the circumference. The stone, pulverized by the
                    action of the boring-bar, as it hinders the progress of the operation, must be
                    removed from time to time by means of an iron-rod, terminated at right angles by
                    a small round plate. From the different diameter of the boring-bars, it follows
                    that the end of the hole is of a smaller diameter than that of the beginning.
                    The depth to which the hole is bored is proportioned to the nature of the rock.
                    It varies from 10 to 15 and 20 inches. When the rock is solid a great way round,
                    a deep hole is not used, because the resistance at a considerable depth, in such
                    a situation, is too great; so that the explosion does not split the rock round
                    the powder chamber, but acts upwards against the ramming, where it meets with
                    less resistance. But if the rock be laid bare on one side, a deep hole is
                    advantageous. Water is poured into the hole during the operation, to facilitate
                    the action of the boring-iron. When the hole is perpendicularly downwards, it is
                    kept full of water; when the hole is driven from below upwards, no water can be
                    used. The water must be taken out, and the hole dried, before the cartridge be
                    introduced, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> The most frequent case is, that one man
                    performs the work, holding the boring-iron in his left hand,’ and striking on it
                    with the two-pound hammer in his right. Sometimes two men are set to do the
                    work, one holding the boring-iron, whilst the second strikes it with a hammer of
                    four or five pounds: this is done where it is required to make the hole thirty
                    or thirty-six inches deep. When a still deeper hole is wanted, two men strike
                    alternately with heavier hammers.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="smallcaps">Boring of Wooden Pipes</hi> is done by means of a long
                    auger, beginning with one of small diameter, and proceeding to employ
                    successively spoon-formed augers of larger diameter. Notwithstanding the
                    frequent employment of cast-iron pipes, some wooden pipes are still used for
                    conveying water in London: they are of elm, which is the kind of tree most
                    frequent in the neighbouring country. A pipe is bored out of one trunk of elm,
                    and the bark is left on. When a tree is to be bored, it is fixed on a carriage,
                    with a rack on the under part. This rack fits into a pinion, the axis of which
                    passes through gudgeons on a fixed frame. On the axis of the pinion is a ratchet
                    wheel, moved by two catches, which derive their motion from the wind or water
                    power that turns the auger; and the pinion is moved in a direction that brings
                    the tree towards the auger. See a figure in Belidor, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Architecture Hydraulique,</hi> i. 1, 341. This apparatus is the same as the one
                    employed in saw-mills. In the boring of pipes for the water-works in London, the
                    tree is made to advance by ropes, which pass over a windlass wrought by men,
                    whilst the auger is turned by a horse-mill. Wooden pipes are frequently bored by
                    an auger having at its outer end a wooden drift or handle, which is put in
                    motion by the workman. The trees are placed on tressels, and there are also
                    tressels of a convenient height that support the auger; there is also a lathe to
                    turn one end of the tree conical, so as to fit into a conical cavity in the end
                    of the adjoining tree, and thus form a water-tight joint. The end of the tree
                    which receives the adjoining pipe within it has a surface at right angles to the
                    axis of the pipe. Into this surface is driven an iron hoop, the diameter of
                    which is some inches greater than the diameter of the aperture of the pipe. This
                    precaution prevents the tree from splitting when the conical end of the next
                    tree is driven home. When the tree is crooked, a bore is driven in from each
                    end, and the two bores meet, forming an angle. An auger whose stalk is formed
                    spirally for some way up is figured in Bailey’s <hi rend="italic">Machines of
                    the Society of Arts.</hi> The objects of this is that the chips may be delivered
                    without taking the auger out of the hole.</p>
                <p>There is a patent granted in 1796 to Mr Howell, coalmaster, of Oswestry, for
                    boring wooden pipes by a hollow cylinder made of thin plates of iron, about an
                    inch less in diameter than the hole to be bored. To one end of this cylinder is
                    fixed a flange about a quarter of an inch in breadth, and one part of this
                    flange is divided, so that, being of steel, a cutter is formed thereby. The
                    object of this method is to bore out a solid cylinder of wood, capable of being
                    converted into a smaller pipe, or of being applied to some other use in
                    carpentry. <hi rend="italic">(Repertory of Arts,</hi> vol. ix.) This kind of
                    borer is like the trepan, which is a hollow cylinder of steel, saw-toothed on
                    the edge, and, when made to revolve rapidly on its axis in the hand of the
                    surgeon, it saws or bores out circular pieces of the flat bones of the head. <hi
