                    cardinal, and archbishop of Milan, was the son of Gilbert Borromeo, count of
                    Arona, and of Mary of Medicis, and was born at the castle of Arona, upon the
                    Lago Maggiore, in the Milanese, on the 2d October 1538. When he was about twelve
                    years old, Julius Caesar Borromeus resigned to him an abbacy, which was
                    considered as an hereditary appurtenance of the family; and Charles accepted the
                    benefice, but applied the revenue wholly in charity to the poor. Having acquired
                    a sufficient knowledge of the languages at Milan, he studied the civil and canon
                    law at Pavia; and derived great advantage from the company and conversation of
                    Francis Alciat, one of the most learned men of the age. In the year 1554 his
                    father died, an event which recalled him to his native place, Arona, where,
                    although he had an elder brother, Count Frederick, he was requested by the
                    family to take the management of their domestic affairs, which he at length
                    consented to do.</p><p>After a time however he resumed his studies, and, in the year 1559, being then
                    just twenty-one, he took his doctor’s degree. The promotion of his uncle
                    Cardinal de’ Medicis to the pontificate, by the name of Pius IV. which happened
                    the year following, seemed to have little effect upon him; but he was soon made
                    prothonotary, intrusted with both the public and privy seal of the
                    ecclesiastical state, and created cardinal deacon, and soon after archbishop of
                    Milan. In compliance with the wish of his uncle the pope, he lived in great
                    splendour, having a brilliant retinue and a large number of domestics; yet his
                    own temperance and humility were never brought into question. In order to render
                    even his amusements useful, he established an academy of select and learned
                    persons, each of whom was to write on some chosen subject, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193733284" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3284-0017"/>either.in verse
                    or in prose, and to communicate to the others in frequent conferences the fruits
                    of his studies. The works produced by this society have been published in
                    several volumes, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Noctes Vaticanoe,</hi>
                    printed at Venice in 1748, because these useful assemblies were held at the
                    Vatican, in the evenings, after the business of the day had been concluded.
                    About this time he also formed a design of founding a college at Pavia, and in
                    prosecution of this design raised a large edifice upon the foundations of
                    several houses which belonged to the Borromeo family in that city. He also
                    obtained from the pope several benefices, which he attached to his
                    establishment; he provided it, out of his own private income, with every thing
                    necessary for the young scholars; and he dedicated the college thus founded to
                    Justina, virgin and martyr.</p><p>Upon the death of his elder brother Frederick, his relations, friends, and even
                    the pope himself, advised him to change his state, quit the church, and marry,
                    that his family might not become extinct. Contrary to this advice and the
                    expectations of the world, however, Charles addressed the pope in these terms:
                    “Do not complain of me, holy father, for I have taken a spouse whom I love, and
                    on whom my wishes have long been fixed.” From this time he became more fervent
                    in the exercises of piety, and more zealous for the advancement of
                    ecclesiastical knowledge.</p><p>A very intimate friendship subsisted between Borromeus and Don Barthélemy des
                    Martyrs, archbishop of Prague, and author of a book entitled <hi rend="italic">Stimulus Pastorum.</hi> This work falling into the hands of Borromeus, inspired
                    him with an earnest desire to become a preacher, more especially as he was now
                    convinced that predication was one of the principal duties of a prelate.
                    Multiplicity of business, ill health, a feeble voice, and a difficult
                    pronunciation, formed no inconsiderable obstacles to the success of his design,
                    yet he at length surmounted them all; and although his beginnings were weak,
                    perseverance enabled him ultimately to attain the object of his ambition.
                    Meanwhile a change in the state of his relations with the holy see was at
                    hand.</p><p>Pius IV. died on the 7th of January 1566, and twenty-eight days thereafter
                    Cardinal Alexandrine mounted the papal throne under the title of Pius V., the
                    skill and diligence of Borromeus having very materially contributed to stifle
                    the cabals of the conclave. As soon as this event took place, and tranquillity
                    had been re-established at Rome, which was generally disturbed by such
                    elections, Borromeus gave himself wholly up to the reformation of his diocese of
                    Milan, where the most flagitious irregularities were openly practised, and
                    where, from the ignorance of the secular clergy, the insubordination of the
                    regulars, the superstitious practices introduced into public worship, the
                    scandalous negligence exhibited in the administration of the sacraments, and the
                    gross abuse of all the functions of the holy ministry, matters had fallen into a
                    most deplorable state. The archbishop began by making pastoral visits in his
                    metropolis, where the canons were by no means distinguished for the purity of
                    their manners. By a variety of wise and necessary regulations, he soon restored
                    proper decency and dignity to divine service. In conformity to the decrees of
                    the council of Trent, he cleared the cathedral of the gorgeous tombs, rich
                    ornaments, banners, arms, and in general of all the trophies with which the
                    vanity of man had disfigured the house of God; and in order to give a sanction
                    to his reform by a decisive example, he spared not the monuments of his nearest
                    relations. Nor did his zeal stop here. He divided the nave of the church
                    throughout its whole length into two compartments, so that the sexes, being
                    separated, might perform their devotions without any attention to each other,
                    and with feelings and impressions suitable to the place. From the cathedral he
                    proceeded next to the collegiate churches, and even to the fraternities of
                    penitents, particularly that of St John the Baptist. The duty of this society
                    was to attend criminals to the place of punishment, and to assist, comfort, and
                    prepare them for death; but the spirit of the institution had been forgotten,
                    and the wretches condemned to death were dragged to execution like beasts,
                    without spiritual assistance or consolation. The archbishop revived the original
                    fervour of the order, and persuaded many of the nobility and principal persons
                    of the city to become members of a society appropriated to so eminent a branch
                    of Christian charity. The reformation of the monasteries followed that of the
                    churches; and the vigilance of the archbishop soon extended itself from the city
                    to the country round it, which abounded with irregularities requiring
                    correction. The great abuses which had overrun the church at this time arose
                    principally from the ignorance of the clergy. In order, therefore, to attack the
                    evil at its root, Charles established seminaries, colleges, and communities, for
                    the education of young persons intended for holy orders. He met with many
                    difficulties and much opposition in his endeavours to bring about a reformation
                    of manners; but by an inflexible constancy, tempered with great sweetness of
                    manners, he prevailed against every obstacle, and succeeded in rendering the
                    most important services to the cause of morals as well as religion.</p><p>But the governor of the province, and many of the senators, were apprehensive
                    that the cardinal’s ordinances and proceedings would encroach upon the civil
                    jurisdiction, and become inconsistent with the rights of his Catholic Majesty,
                    to whom the duchy of Milan then belonged. And this proved a fruitful source of
                    remonstrances, representations, and complaints, addressed to the courts of Rome
                    and Madrid; these, however, in as far as concerned the king of Spain, Philip II.
                    were referred entirely to the decision of the pope. But Borromeus had more
                    formidable difficulties to struggle with, in the inveterate opposition of
                    several religious orders, particularly that of the Brothers of Humility. Three
                    provosts of the society entered into a conspiracy to cut him off; and one of
                    their confederates, Jerome Donat, surnamed <hi rend="italic">Farina,</hi> took
                    upon him to carry the design into execution. For this purpose he mixed with the
                    crowd which repaired to the archiepiscopal chapel, where the cardinal spent an
                    hour every evening in prayer with his domestics and other pious persons; and
                    having watched his opportunity, he fired at his eminence a harquebuss, loaded
                    with a ball suited to the calibre of the piece, and with a considerable charge
                    of leaden shot besides. It is said that the ball struck him on the spine, but
                    dropped at his feet without doing any other damage than ruffling his rochet, and
                    that one of the shot penetrated his clothes to the skin, and there stopped,
                    without imprinting any wound; which was considered a miracle, especially as
                    another shot tore away part of a wall, and went quite through a table. Without
                    having recourse to such a solution, his escape is certainly wonderful,
                    considering that the assassin had taken his station at the distance of only five
                    or six paces from his intended victim. At the moment when the shot was fired the
                    choir were chanting the fine old melody, <hi rend="italic">Non turbetur cor
                    vestrum neque formidet;</hi> and it is said, that after the discharge of the
                    piece the cardinal archbishop continued the service without any apparent
                    emotion. The assassin and three of his accomplices were seized, tried,
                    condemned, and executed, notwithstanding every effort of the cardinal to screen
                    them from the punishment which they so well merited.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193733297" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3297-0018"/><p>In the year 1576 the city and diocese of Milan were visited by the plague, which
                    swept away great numbers. On this occasion the behaviour of Borromeus was truly
                    Christian and heroic. He not only continued on the spot, but went about giving
                    directions for accommodating the sick and burying the dead, with <hi rend="italic">a</hi> zeal and attention that were at once ardent and deliberate,
                    minute and comprehensive; and his example stimulated others to join in the good
                    work. He avoided no danger, and he spared no expense; nor did he content himself
                    with establishing proper regulations in the city, but went out into all the
                    neighbouring parishes where the contagion raged, distributing money to the poor,
                    ordering proper accommodations for the sick, and punishing those, especially the
                    clergy, who were remiss in discharging the duties of their calling. But
                    notwithstanding the fatigue and perplexity which he suffered in thus executing
                    his pastoral charge, he abated nothing of the usual austerity of his life, nor
                    omitted any of his stated devotion is; whatever approached to luxury or
                    magnificence he cońsidered as incompatible with the propriety of his character)
                    bread and water constituted his humble and daily fare.</p><p>But continual labours and austerities at last shortened thê life of this
                    remarkable man. Having gone to Vercal to put an end, if possible, to divisions
                    which threatened the most fatal consequences, he there received a message from
                    the duke of Savoy, requesting his presence at Turin, whither he immediately
                    repaired. From Turin he retired to a place called the Sepulchre, on the mountain
                    Va-rais, ŵlicrĉ being seized with an intermittent fever, he returned to Milan,
                    and died there on the 4th of November 1584, the day after his return. Borromeus
                    was canonized on the 1st of November 1610, in the pontificate of Leo XI. Besides
                    the <hi rend="italic">Noctes Vaticanae,</hi> to which he appears to have
                    contributed, the only literary relics of this intrepid’and zealous reformer are
                    some homilies, discourses, and sermons, with a collection of letters. Several
                    lives of him have been published. That by Godeau, however, is too Succinct; that
                    by Touron, a Dominican, is too diffuse; and that by Ribadeneira, a Spanish
                    Jesuit, is filled with incredible and 'ridiculous fables. But through all the
                    mist of absurdity aiid superstition in which the character and actions of
                    Borromeus have been involved, it is easy to discern, that if the Church of Rome
                    had had many such men, religion might have been ' spared some grievous wounds,
                    and the nations of Europe many afflicting and sanguinary convulsions.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
