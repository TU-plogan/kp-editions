                    soldier, statesman, and a poet of no inconsiderable fame in his time. In the
                    year 1522, the 14th of Henry VIII., he attended in a military capacity the Earl
                    of Surrey in his expedition to the coast of Brittany, and commanded the troops
                    in the attack of the town of Morlaix, which he took and burnt. For this service
                    he was knighted on the spot by the earl. In 1529 he was sent ambassador to
                    France, and the year following to Rome, on account of the king’s divorce. He was
                    gentleman of the privy chamber to king Henry VIII. and to his successor Edward
                    VI., in the beginning of whose reign he marched with the protector against the
                    Scots; and, after the battle of Musselburgh, in which lie commanded the light
                    horse, he was made banneret. In 1548 he was appointed chief governor of Ireland,
                    where he married the Countess of Ormond. He died soon afterwards, and was buried
                    at Waterford. He wrote, 1. Songs and Sonnets, some of which were printed with
                    those of the Earl of Surrey and Sir Thomas Wyatt, Lond. 1565; 2. Letters written
                    from Rome concerning the king’s divorce, manuscript.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bryant, Jacob,</hi> a profound scholar, mythologist, and
                    sacred historian, born at Plymouth in 1715. His father had a place in the
                    customs, and was afterwards stationed in Kent, where his son was first sent to a
                    provincial school, from which he was removed to Eton. Here he appears to have
                    remained till 1736, the date of his election to King’s College, Cambridge, and
                    he took his degrees of bachelor and master of arts in 1740 and 1744. He returned
                    to Eton in the capacity of private tutor to the late Duke of Marlborough, then
                    Marquis of Blandford; and the good taste which his pupil showed through life, in
                    the protection of the fine arts, and in the pursuit of science, sufficiently
                    demonstrated the beneficial influence of his instructor’s example. In 1756 he
                    went to the Continent as private secretary to the Duke of Marlborough, then
                    master-general of the ordnance and commander-in-chief of the forces in Germany;
                    and he was rewarded, after his return, for his various services to the family,
                    by a lucrative appointment in the ordnance, which allowed him ample leisure to
                    indulge his literary taste in a variety of refined investigations, and to
                    exercise his zeal for the cause of religion in a multitude of works, calculated
                    for the illustration of the Scriptures, and the demonstration of their
                    authenticity and divine authority.</p>
                <p>1. His first publication was entitled <hi rend="italic">Observations and
                    Inquiries</hi> relating to various parts of Ancient History, containing
                    Dissertations on the wind Euroclydon, and on the island Melite, together with an
                    account of Egypt in its most early state, and of the Shepherd Kings, 1767. In
                    this work he attempts to prove that the Melite on which St Paul was wrecked was
                    not Malta, but one of the Illyrian islands in the Adriatic, now called Melede;
                    and he endeavours to illustrate several points in the early history of the
                    oriental, and especially of the Aramitic nations.</p>
                <p>2. But his most elaborate performance was his <hi rend="italic">New System or
                    Analysis of Ancient Mythology,</hi> wherein an attempt is made to divest
                    tradition of fable, and to reduce truth to its original purity, 3 vols. 4to,
                    1774, 1776. In this attempt the author has equally displayed his deep and
                    extensive learning and his inventive fancy; but it must be confessed that, on a
                    minute examination, the work exhibits much more of a poetical imagination than
                    of a sound judgment; and that, in endeavouring to substitute etymological for
                    historical evidence, he has been completely unsuccessful. Nothing can afford a
                    more satisfactory kind of proof than etymology taken on a large scale, and
                    considered as a mode of tracing the relations of nations to each other, by the
                    affinities of their languages; since the accumulation of a multitude of
                    probabilities, each weak when taken separately, becomes at last equivalent to
                    absolute certainty. But nothing, on the other hand, can be more fallacious, or
                    more liable to controversy, than single etymological inferences, in particular
                    cases, when one of these slight resemblances is magnified into a striking
                    likeness, and even an identity, which is then made the foundation of a
                    magnificent superstructure in mythology or in history. Mr Richardson has shown,
                    in the Preface to his <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> how much Mr Bryant was
                    mistaken in some of his reasoning respecting the signification and derivation of
                    particular words; and even if he had been more correct in these instances, the
                    conclusions which he has deduced from his etymologies would by no means have
                    been perfectly legitimate. Jablonsky seems to have exhibited one of the
                    strongest examples of this dangerous abuse of learning, in which he has been
                    followed not only by Mr Bryant, but by several other modern writers equally
                    visionary, who have commonly been very imperfectly acquainted with the languages
                    on which their conjectures depended, and have been still more deficient in that
                    sort of common sense and correct feeling, confirmed by experience, which
                    constitutes the most essential part of the qualifications of a critic, and the
                    want of which can never be compensated by the most unwearied labour of a mere
                    mechanical commentator.</p>
                <p>3. Some remarks which had been made on particular passages of Mr Bryant’s work
                    led him to publish <hi rend="italic">A t'</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ιη</hi><hi rend="italic">' dication of the Apamean Medal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> of the inscription N∩E, and of another coin, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archceologia∙&gt;</hi> vol. iv. art. *b <pb break="no" facs="nls:193741110"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-1110-0619"/>22, 23. 4. He deviated somewhat more widely from
                    the usual objects of his researches, and apparently without any decided
                    advantage over his adversary, in <hi rend="italic">An Address to Dr
                    Priestley,</hi> on the doctrine of philosophical necessity, 8vo, 1780. 5. He
                    also published in the same year <hi rend="italic">Vindi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cia</hi><hi rend="italic">Flavianoe,</hi> or a vindication of the testimony
                    given by Josephus concerning our Saviour, 8vo.</p>
                <p>6. Unfortunately for the credit of his critical discrimination in matters of old
                    English literature, Mr Bryant was the author of <hi rend="italic">Observations
                    on the Poems of Thomas Rowley,</hi> in which the authenticity of these poems is
                    ascertained, 2 vols. 12mo, 1781. If there could be any excuse for the commission
                    of forgeries like that of Chatterton, it would be found in their serving as a
                    valuable test of the degree of confidence which it is justifiable to place in
                    the decrees of the most powerful critics respecting other questions of a more
                    ambiguous nature.</p>
                <p>7. Mr Bryant contributed to the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Duke of
                    Marlborough'</hi><hi rend="italic">'s</hi><hi rend="italic">Collection of
                    Gems,</hi> the Latin explanations contained in the first volume, fol. 1783. 8.
                    He inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Archoeologia,</hi> vii. 387, some <hi
                    rend="italic">Collections on the Zingara or Gipsey Language,</hi> which has been
                    since sufficiently proved to be one of the many derivatives of the old Sanscrit.
                    9. Some time afterwards he published an anonymous <hi rend="italic">Treatise on
                    the Authenticity of the Scriptures,</hi> and the truth of the Christian
                    religion, 1792. 10. This was succeeded by his <hi rend="italic">Observations
                    upon the Plagues</hi> inflicted upon the Egyptians, 8vo, 1794.</p>
                <p>11. His opinions respecting the existence of the city of Troy, and the veracity
                    of Homer as a historian, raised up against him a host of powerful adversaries;
                    and in a question of this nature, upon which the decisions of mankind are so
                    manifestly influenced by their sensibility to poetical beauty, and their early
                    habits and attachments, a much more cautious attempt to innovate might easily
                    have been unsuccessful. Whatever learning and talents may have been exhibited in
                    this controversy, itwill hardly be believed byan impartial judge,reasoning on
                    the general probabilities of the case, that Homer intended the actions of his
                    heroes, any more than their genealogies, to be historically correct; but, at the
                    same time, it will readily be admitted that he was much more likely to take, for
                    the scene of his poem, a town that had really existed, and, for its subject, a
                    traditional report of a war which had actually been carried on, than to have
                    invented a fabulous city and an imaginary warfare, without any historical
                    foundation whatever. Mr Bryant published on this subject <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on a Treatise entitled Description of the Plain of Troy,</hi> by
                    Mr de Chevalier, 4to, 1795. 12. <hi rend="italic">A Dissertation concerning the
                    War of Troy,</hi> and the expedition of the Greeks, as described by Homer;
                    showing that no such expedition was ever undertaken, and that no such city in
                    Phrygia existed; 4to, 1796. 13. <hi rend="italic">Observations on</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">the Vindication of Homer,</hi> written by J. B. S. Morritt, Esq.
                    4to, 1799.</p>
                <p>14. He had, in the mean time, not discontinued his theological studies, and had
                    published an Essay on <hi rend="italic">The Sentiments of Pliilo Judaeus</hi>
                    concerning the word of God, 8vo, 1797. His last work was a volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertations on various Subjects in, the Old Testament,</hi>
                    which had been nearly completed thirty years before. The subjects which had
                    particularly attracted his attention were the histories of Balaam, Sampson, and
                    Jonah; and besides Philo Judaeus and Josephus, he had endeavoured to illustrate
                    some controverted passages of Justin Martyr, as well as many other departments
                    of religious and historical discussion.</p>
                <p>l’he habits of Mr Bryant’s maturer life were in general completely sedentary;
                    although, in his youth, he had taken his full share in the cultivation of the
                    manly exer cises common to Etonians, and had once the good fortune to save, by
                    his proficiency in swimming, the life of Dr Barnard, afterwards provost of Eton.
                    His conversation was elegant and animated, his manners mild but firm; he exerted
                    himself to please others, and was himself easily pleased. He was much courted in
                    society, and his residence at Cypenham, near Windsor, was not unfrequently
                    visited by persons of the highest possible rank. He never married. He died in
                    bis eighty-ninth year, the 14th November 1804, from the immediate consequence of
                    an accidental blow. He left his library to King’s College, having, however,
                    previously made some valuable presents out of it to the king and to the Duke of
                    Marlborough. He also bequeathed L.2000 to the Society for the Propagation of the
                    Gospel, and L.1000 for the use of the superannuated collegers of Eton school.
