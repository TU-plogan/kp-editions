                    celebrated English astronomer, the third son of William and Jane Bradley, was
                    born at Sherborne in Dorsetshire in the year 1692. He was educated for the
                    university at North Leach by Mr Egles and Mr Brice, who kept a boarding-school
                    there; and from North Leach he was sent to Oxford. His friends intending him for
                    the church, his studies were regulated with that view; and as soon as he was of
                    sufficient age to receive holy orders, the Bishop of Hereford, who had conceived
                    a great esteem for him, gave him the living of Bridstow, and soon after he was
                    inducted to that of Welfrie in Pembrokeshire. But notwithstanding these
                    advantages, from which he might have promised himself still further advancement
                    in the church, he at length resigned his livings, that he might be wholly at
                    liberty to pursue his favourite study of mathematics and astronomy. He was
                    nephew to Mr Pound, a gentleman favourably known to the learned world by many
                    excellent observations, and who would have enriched it with more, if the
                    journals of his voyages had not been burnt at Pulo Condore, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735299" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5299-0172"/>when the place
                    was set on fire, and the English who had settled there cruelly massacred, Mr
                    Pound himself very narrowly escaping with his life. With this gentleman Mr
                    Bradley passed all the time he could spare from the duties of his function; and
                    perhaps he sometimes trespassed upon them. He was then sufficiently acquainted
                    with the mathematics to improve by Mr Pound’s conversation; yet it does not
                    appear that, in this study, he had any preceptor but his genius, or any
                    assistant but his labour and perseverance.</p><p>It may easily be imagined that the example and conversation of Mr Pound did not
                    render Bradley fonder of his profession than he was before. He continued,
                    however, as yet to fulfil the duties of it, though at this time he had made such
                    observations as laid the foundation of those discoveries which afterwards
                    distinguished him as one of the best astronomers of his age. Although these
                    observations were made as it were by stealth, they gained him at first the
                    notice and then the friendship of the Lord Chancellor Macclesfield, Mr
                    (afterwards Sir Isaac) Newton, Mr Halley, and many other members of the Royal
                    Society, into which he was soon elected a member. About the same time the chair
                    of Savilian professor of astronomy becoming vacant by the death of the
                    celebrated Dr Keil, Mr Bradley was elected to succeed him on the 31st of October
                    1721, being then just twenty-nine years old; and he had for his colleague Mr
                    Halley, who was professor of geometry on the same foundation. Bradley, upon his
                    being elected to this professorship, gave up both his livings, and with great
                    joy quitted a situation in which his duty was directly at variance with his
                    inclination. From this time he applied himself wholly to the study of his
                    favourite science; and in the year 1727 he published his <hi rend="italic">Theory of the Aberration of the Fixed Stars,</hi> which is allowed to be one of
                    the most useful and ingenious discoveries of modern astronomy. Three years after
                    this discovery, by which Mr Bradley acquired great reputation, he was appointed
                    lecturer in astronomy and physics, at the Museum of Oxford.</p><p>He pursűed his studies with equal application and delight; and in the course of
                    his observations, which were innumerable, he discovered that the inclination of
                    the earth’s axis upon the plane of the ecliptic was not always the same, but
                    that it varied backwards and forwards some seconds, and that the period of these
                    variations was nine years. This period seemed altogether unaccountable, as it
                    could not be supposed to have any thing in common with the revolution of the
                    earth, which is performed in one year. Mr Bradley, however, discovered the cause
                    of this phenomenon in the Newtonian system of attraction, and published his
                    discovery in 1737; so that in the space of about ten years he communicated to
                    the world two of the finest discoveries in modern astronotny, which will for
                    ever form an epoch in the history of that science.</p><p>Mr Bradley always preserved the esteem and friendship of Mr Halley, who, being
                    worn out by age and infirmities, thought he could do nothing better for the
                    service of astronomy than procure for Mr Bradley the place of regius professor
                    of astronomy at Greenwich, which he had himself held for many years with great
                    reputation. With this view he wrote many letters, which have been since found
                    among Mr Bradley’s papers, desiring his permission to apply for a grant of the
                    reversion of it to him, and even offering to resign in his favour, if it should
                    be thought necessary; but before Mr Halley could bring this kind project to
                    bear, he died. Mr Bradley, however, obtained the place afterwards, by the favour
                    and interest of Lord Macclesfield, who was subsequently president of the Royal
                    Society. As soon as the appointment of Mr Bradley to this place became known,
                    the university of Oxford sent him a diploma creating him doctor of divinity. The
                    appointment of astronomer at Greenwich placed Mr Bradley in his proper element,
                    and he pursued his observations with unwearied diligence. However numerous the
                    collection of astronomical instruments at the observatory at Greenwich, it was
                    impossible that so accurate an observer as Dr Bradley should not desire to
                    increase them, as well to answer those particular views, as in general to make
                    observations with greater exactness. In the year 1748, therefore, he took the
                    opportunity of the annual visit made by the Royal Society to the observatory, in
                    order to examine the instruments and receive the professor’s observations for
                    the year, to represent so strongly the necessity of repairing the old
                    instruments, and purchasing new ones, that the society thought proper to
                    represent it to his majesty, and he gave them L.1000 for that purpose. This sum
                    was laid out under the direction of Dr Bradley, who, with the assistance of Mr
                    Graham and Mr Bird, furnished the observatory with as complete a collection of
                    astronomical instruments as the most skilful and diligent observer could desire.
                    Dr Bradley, furnished with such assistance, pursued his observations with new
                    assiduity; an incredible number of which were found after his death, and put
                    into the hands of the Royal Society.</p><p>It has been already observed, that when Dr Bradley was elected to the professor’s
                    chair at Oxford, he gave up his two livings, which were at such a distance that
                    he could not possibly fulfil the duties of them himself; but it happened, that
                    after he was settled at Greenwich, the living of that parish, which is very
                    considerable, became vacant, and was offered to him, as he was upon the spot to
                    perform the duty, and had the claim of uncommon merit to the reward. This,
                    however, Dr Bradley, to his honour, refused, fearing that the duties of the
                    astronomer would too much interfere with those of the divine. His majesty, on
                    hearing of the refusal, was so pleased with it, that he granted him a pension of
                    L.250 a year, in consideration of his great abilities and knowledge in astronomy
                    and other branches of the mathematics, which had proved so advantageous to the
                    commerce and navigation of Great Britain, as is particularly mentioned in the
                    grant, dated the I5th of February 1752. Dr Bradley, about the same time, was
                    admitted into the council of the Royal Society. In the year 1748 he was admitted
                    a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Belles-lettres of Berlin, upon the
                    death of Μ. Crevier, first physician to his Catholic majesty; in the year 1752,
                    a member of the Imperial Academy at Petersburg; and in 1757, of that instituted
                    at Bologna.</p><p>Dr Bradley was still indefatigable in his observations, and every honour he
                    received became an incitement to obtain new distinction; but his corporeal
                    abilities at length declined, though his intellectual suffered no abatement. In
                    the year 1780 he became extremely weak and infirm; and towards the end of June
                    1762 he was attacked with a total suppression of urine, which on the 12th of
                    July following put an end to his life, in the seventieth year of his age. He was
                    buried at Mitchin Hampton, in Gloucestershire, in the same grave with his mother
                    and his wife. In the year 1744 he married Susannah Peach, the daughter of a
                    gentleman of that name in Gloucestershire, by whom he had only one daughter.</p><p>As to his character, he was remarkable for a placid gentle modesty, very uncommon
                    in persons of an active temper and robust constitution; yet, with this
                    untroubled equanimity of temper, he was compassionate and liberal in the highest
                    degree. Although he was a good speaker, and possessed the rare but happy art of
                    expressing his ideas with the utmost precision and perspicuity, yet no man <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735312" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5312-0173"/> was
                    a greater lover of silence, and he never spoke except when he thought it
                    absolutely necessary. He did indeed think it necessary to speak when he had a
                    fair opportunity to communicate any useful knowledge in his own way; and he
                    encouraged those who attended his lectures to ask him questions, by the
                    exactness with which he answered, and the care he took to adapt himself to every
                    capacity. He was not more inclined to write than to speak, for he has published
                    very little. He had a natural diffidence, which made him always afraid that his
                    works would injure his character; and he therefore suppressed many, which
                    probably were well worthy of the public attention. He first became known, as it
                    were, in spite of himself; but the distinction which he avoided followed him. He
                    was acquainted with many of the first persons in this kingdom, eminent for rank
                    as well as abilities; he was honoured by men of learning in general; and there
                    was not an astronomer of any eminence in the world with whom he had not a
                    literary correspondence. Upon the whole, it may be said of Dr Bradley, that no
                    man cultivated eminent talents with more success, or had a better claim to be
                    ranked among the greatest astronomers of his <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> S
