                    Among the more valuable products of the warmer climates and the fertile islands
                    of the Southern Pacific Ocean, is to be ranked the bread-fruit, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Arto-cαrpus incisa</hi> of botanists. Nature has favoured the
                    tropical regions, and those countries in their vicinity, with inexhaustible
                    quantities of the choicest vegetables, while, the inhabitants of the north are
                    restricted to shrivelled berries and meagre roots; and if they have obtained a
                    supply, always precarious, of some of the finer fruits, it is the result of
                    patience, skill, and industry.</p>
                <p>Ever since Europeans frequented the eastern world in commercial enterprise, it is
                    probable that they were acquainted with the bread-fruit. How, indeed, could its
                    properties be unknown to Quiros, who visited Otaheite so long ago as the year
                    1606? Yet the English navigator Dampier seems to have been the first European
                    whose notice was particularly directed towards it, during his circumnavigation
                    in the year 1688; and he expresses himself in these words: “The bread-fruit, as
                    we call it, grows on a large tree, as big and high as our largest apple trees.
                    It hath a spreading head, full of branches and dark leaves. The fruit grows on
                    the boughs like apples; it is as big as a penny-loaf when the wheat is at five
                    shillings the bushel. It is of a round shape, and hath a thick tough rind. When
                    the fruit is ripe it is yellow and soft, and the taste is sweet and pleasant.
                    The natives of Guam use it for bread. They gather it, when full grown, while it
                    is green and hard; then they bake it in an oven, which scorcheth the rind, and
                    makes it black; but they scrape off the outside black crust, and there remains a
                    tender thin crust; and the inside is soft, tender, and white, like the crumbs of
                    a penny loaf. There is neither seed nor stone in the inside, but all of a firm
                    substance like bread. It must be eaten new, for if it be kept above twenty-four
                    hours it becomes dry and eats harsh and choky; but it is very pleasant before it
                    is too stale. This fruit lasts in . season eight months in the year, during
                    which time the natives eat no other sort of food of bread kind. I did never see
                    of this fruit any where but here (Guam). The natives told us that there is
                    plenty of this fruit growing on the rest of the Ladrone Islands, and I did never
                    hear of it anywhere else.” The bread-fruit, however, is found in still greater
                    profusion, and in equal perfection, on many of the groups of islands scattered
                    throughout the Southern Pacific Ocean; nor is it confined to them exclusively,
                    but their soil and climate seem to correspond more intimately with the
                    conditions of its vegetation.</p>
                <p>There are two leading species of this plant, which are characterized by the
                    presence or absence of seeds; the latter being the preferable kind, and that
                    which is cultivated more carefully for its produce. The natives of the South Sea
                    Islands maintain, however, that eight different species, or rather varieties,
                    may be distinguished, and for which they have the respective names of Patteah,
                    Eroroo, Awanna, Mi-re, Oree, Powerro, Appeere, Rowdeah. The leaf of the first,
                    fourth, and eighth, differs from that of the rest; the fourth being more
                    sinuated, and the eighth having a large broad leaf, not at all sinuated. In the
                    first, also, the fruit is rather larger, and of a more oblong form, while in the
                    last it is round, and not above half the size of the others. European observers,
                    however, do not seem -in general disposed to recognise these as essential
                    distinctions, although they admit other varieties.</p>
                <p>As Dampier observes, the bread-fruit is a large tree, growing to the height of
                    forty feet or more. It is thick in the stem, and has a luxuriant foliage. The
                    trunk is upright, the wood soft, smooth, and yellowish; and wherever the tree is
                    wounded, a glutinous fluid exudes. The branches form an ample head, almost
                    globular; the leaves arc eighteen inches long and eleven broad, resembling those
                    of the oak or the fig tree, from their deep sinuosities. The younger leaves,
                    like all the more tender plants of the tree, are glutinous to the touch. The
                    male flowers are among the upper leaves, and the female flowers at the ends of
                    the twigs. But it is the fruit which constitutes the value of the plant, and
                    this is a very large berry, according to botanists, with a reticulated surface,
                    resembling a cocoa-nut or melon in size and form, nine inches in length. It is
                    filled with a white farinaceous fibrous pulp, which becomes juicy and yellow
                    when the fruit is ripe; and the edible portion lies between the skin, which is
                    green, and a core in the centre, which is about an inch in diameter.</p>
                <p>During a considerable portion of the year the breadfruit affords the chief
                    sustenance of the Society Islanders. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> It is
                    prepared after different fashions, and its taste de-ļ pends in a great measure
                    on the mode of preparation. It is insipid, slightly sweet, somewhat resembling
                    wheaten bread mixed with Jerusalem artichokes, and it has been compared to a
                    cake made of flour, egg, sugar, milk, and butter. In general it is cut in
                    several pieces, and roasted or baked in a hole made in the ground, which is
                    paved round with large smooth stones; and then it resembles a boiled potato, not
                    being so farinaceous as a good one, but more so than one of ordinary quality.
                    The stones are previously heated by a fire kindled in the excavation, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193735819" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5819-0212"/> and the
                    bread-fruit, being wrapped in a banana leaf, ĩš laid upon them, and covered with
                    leaves and hot stones. In Otaheite, and in the West Indian Islands, several
                    dishes are made of it, either by thus baking it in an oven entire, when it is
                    considered to equal or surpass any kind of bread, by adding water or the milk of
                    the cocoa nut, by boiling it, or forming it into a paste. This last is
                    accomplished by taking the fruit before it attains complete maturity, and laying
                    it in heaps, closely covered üp with leaves, when it undergoes fermentation, and
                    becomes disagreeably sweet. The core being then drawn out, the fruit or pulp is
                    thrown into a paved excavation, and the whole covered up with leaves, whereon
                    heavy stones are laid: it thus undergoes a second fermentation, and becomes
                    sour, after which it will suffer no change for a long time. A leaven may thus be
                    formed of it, which is baked as occasion requires. In the island of Nukahiwa, an
                    agreeable beverage can be obtained from it; and in the West Indies it can be
                    baked like biscuit, and will keep nearly as long. The fruit is in the greatest
                    perfection about a week before beginning to ripen, which is easily recognised by
                    the skin changing to a brownish cast, and by small granulations formed of the
                    juice. In the West Indies it is soft and yellow when ripe, and is in taste and
                    smell like a very ripe melon.. Hogs, dogs, and poultry then feed on it
                    readily.</p>
                <p>Besides this, the bread-fruit tree proper, there is one that has been long known
                    in India and the eastern islands, of which the fruit contains from forty to a
                    hundred farinaceous seeds, in appearance resembling chestnuts. These when
                    roasted or boiled are more grateful to many persons than the bread-fruit, and
                    the negroes are very fond •of them. The external characters of the tree are
                    scarcely to be distinguished from those of the other, and the chief distinction
                    lies in the fruit, which attains nearly the size of that we have described, and
                    is covered with prickles like a hedgehog. It grows from the seed with rapid
                    vegetation, and attains larger dimensions than the proper bread-fruit tree.</p>
                <p>The natives of those islands producing this useful vegetable collect it with very
                    little trouble; they have only to climb the tree and gather the fruit. Nor is
                    nutriment the sole purpose to which it is converted; for they have a method of
                    fabricating cloth from the bark, the leaves are substituted for towels, and the
                    wood is employed in the construction of their boats and houses. A kind of cement
                    and birdlime is also prepared by boiling the juice exuding from the bark in
                    cocoa-nut oil.</p>
                <p>It appears that there are other vegetables of this class, producing fruit of
                    inferior quality, but on that account receiving less attention. The bread-fruit
                    proper is of easy cultivation in its native soil. In some of the islands it
                    seems an indigenous product, and springs from the root of old trees without any
                    care; in others, it requires simply to be put into the earth. The trees flourish
                    with the greatest luxuriance on rising grounds; and it has been remarked, that
                    where the hills of the Sandwich Islands rise almost perpendicularly in a great
                    variety of peaks, their steep declivities, and the deep valleys intervening, are
                    covered with trees, among which the bread-fruit is particularly abundant. It has
                    also been observed, that although we are accustomed to consider Otaheite as of
                    the greatest fertility in this plant, the trees of the Sandwich Islands produce
                    double the quantity of fruit. Though nearly of the same height, the branches
                    begin to shoot out much lower from the trunk, and with greater luxuriance. In
                    Otaheite, they arc propagated by suckers from the root, which are best
                    transplanted in wet weather, when the earth forms balls around them; then they
                    are not liable to suffer from removal. This valuable plant is widely diffused in
                    the southern and eastern isles, and it is generally found throughout the Great
                    Pacific Ocean. It grows on Amboyna, the Banda Islands, Timor, and the Ladrones;
                    but it is more especially the object of care and cultivation in the Marquesas,
                    and the Friendly and Society Islands, where it vegetates in uncommon luxuriance
                    and profusion.</p>
                <p>The great utility of the bread-fruit as an article of subsistence for mankind
                    has, at different times, led to speculations on the possibility of naturalizing
                    it in places where it is not of spontaneous growth. Μ. de Poive, the philosophic
                    governor of the Mauritius, succeeded in introducing it there, and in the Isle of
                    Bourbon, whither it was conveyed by Μ. de Sonnerat, from Luçon, in the
                    Philippine Islands. Being found in the greatest luxuriance under the same
                    latitudes as the British West India Islands, and in a climate not dissimilar,
                    government deemed the transmission of it thither, both as practicable without
                    much difficulty, and as promising a future store of subsistence for the
                    inhabitants. An expedition was therefore fitted out with particular care, under
                    the command of Captain, then Lieutenant Bligh, who sailed in the Bounty
                    storeship for the South Seas in December 1787. This vessel was prepared so as to
                    receive a great many bread-fruit and other plants, which would have proved a
                    valuable acquisition to the colonists of the West Indies, and some of which were
                    expected to succeed under the culture of the curious in Great Britain. The
                    Bounty arrived in safety at Otaheite, the principal place of her destination,
                    and took on board 1015 bread-fruit plants, besides a great variety of different
                    species of other plants, and after remaining twenty-three weeks, which were
                    busily occupied, set sail on the 4th of April 1789. But it is unnecessary to say
                    more of the expedition, except that it was rendered totally abortive by a mutiny
                    which ensued three weeks subsequently to its departure. The captain and eighteen
                    adherents were barbarously turned adrift in an open boat, wherein they suffered
                    incredible hardships, and, after a navigation of 3600 miles, reached the island
                    of Timor, having lost only one of their number, who was murdered by the savages
                    of an intermediate island. Notwithstanding the unfortunate result of this
                    voyage, the object was still kept in view, and a new expedition planned with
                    still greater precaution than the former; and it has been said that his late
                    majesty, King George III. took a lively interest in conferring so important a
                    benefit on a distant portion of his people. Captain Bligh having arrived in
                    England, was appointed to the command of the Providence and Assistance, two
                    vessels specially fitted out as before; and part of their complement consisted
                    of two gardeners, to take the management of the plants collected. The vessels
                    sailed in August 1791, reached Van Diemen’s Land in February 1792, and anchored
                    at Otaheite in February following. Here they remained above three months, and
                    obtained even a greater store of plants than formerly; for there were now 1281
                    pots and tubs, whereas the first number of the bread-fruit trees, in 1789, did
                    not exceed 887. Captain Bligh, in returning, made a dangerous voyage through
                    Endeavour Straits, the exploring of which was part of his former instructions,
                    and anchored at Coupang in the island of Timor, where he substituted many other
                    plants for those that had died. He then sailed for the West Indies, and touching
                    at St Helena, landed some breadfruit plants, and took on board those of
                    different species. The object of his voyage was at length completed by reaching
                    the island of St Vincent’s in January 1793, where he committed 544 plants, of
                    which 333 were breadfruit, to the care of Dr Anderson, superintendent of the
                    botanical garden, and substituted forthem 467 of different species, designed for
                    his majesty’s garden at Kew. In the next place, Captain Bligh landed 623 plants,
                    of which 347 were bread-fruit, at Port Royal in the island of Jamaica<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193735832" xml:id="kp-eb0705-5832-0213"/>, and replaced
                    them with a further collection for the king, with which he arrived in England on
                    the 2d of August 1793. Five years and eight months had thus been occupied in
                    accomplishing the desirable purpose of these two expeditions. But it belonged
                    especially to Britain, by whom a familiar intercourse with the southern
                    islanders was first opened up, to effect an object of so much importance.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, some have been found inclined to challenge the wisdom of so
                    difficult and expensive an experiment; both because the expectations of those
                    who looked for an inexhaustible source of subsistence were not speedily
                    realized, and because the places best adapted for its culture already possess
                    another vegetable, the plantain, which is much more grateful to the negroes, for
                    whom the bread-fruit was principally designed. It has been argued that the
                    bread-fruit tree requires considerable care in cultivation, that its progress to
                    maturity is slow, though in Britain it would appear extremely rapid. Three years
                    are required to reap the fruit; the plantain demands no care, while it produces
                    its crop in fifteen months; thus giving it a decided preference in the opinion
                    of the colonist, who is always impatient for <hi rend="italic">a</hi> return.
                    Further, it has been said, that wherever any vegetable, already relished by the
                    inhabitants of a district, is completely established, they will always reject
                    what they think less agreeable. These arguments have certainly had considerable
                    weight; probably, however, from not duly appreciating the difficulties attendant
                    on such an experiment as the naturalization of plants. But were we to take a
                    retrospect of all the obstacles which have opposed the cultivation of many
                    species of grain and fruits, at present not uncommon in Britain, it would be
                    very evident that success has resulted only from the most patient and laborious
                    attention. Positive conclusions on this subject are perhaps as yet
                    premature.</p>
                <p>In the year 1777 a premium was offered by the Society for the Encouragement of
                    Arts and Manufactures, to any individuals who should bring the bread-fruit plant
                    from the South Sea Islands in a state of vegetation to the West Indies, and the
                    gold medal was awarded, in 1793, to Captain Bligh accordingly. That society,
                    with the laudable design of promoting its culture, continued to offer further
                    premiums for the greatest number of plants raised in the British settlements;
                    and in consequence a silver medal was awarded to Dr Anderson, superintendent of
                    the botanical garden at St Vincents in 1798; and, in 1802, the gold medal to the
                    Honourable Joseph Robley, governor of the island of Tobago. From the course
                    adopted by these two cultivators, the history of the bread-fruit has received
                    much elucidation, and we shall comprise it in a few observations.</p>
                <p>Mr Robley received three plants from Dr Anderson in June 1793, which he planted
                    in very deep rich soil, and paid them every attention in hopes of procuring
                    shoots. They flourished exceedingly, produced fruit in 1795, and continued to do
                    so until autumn 1801, after which we have no notices respecting them. Being
                    disappointed of obtaining suckers, Mr Robley applied to Dr Anderson, who advised
                    him to lay bare some of the uppermost roots, and to wound them very deeply; and
                    having followed these directions in October 1800, they almost immediately began
                    to put forth shoots in abundance. In December, 120 fine plants were thus
                    obtained, which Mr Robley placed in baskets containing about a gallon of good
                    rich loose soil, and deposited in the shade in the vicinity of water. With this
                    element also they were refreshed when the weather required it. Baskets were
                    preferred to pots for the plants, from being lighter and more easily removed;
                    likewise, because when deposited in the place where they were ultimately to
                    remain, the baskets would speedily rot, and not repress the growth of the plant,
                    which would then extend its roots. European cultivators would do well to attend
                    to the beneficial use of baskets; for it too often happens that a tender plant
                    is wounded in removing it from a pot, or that the earth surrounding it is so
                    deranged and displaced, that no subsequent care can preserve it from
                    destruction. Encouraged by the successful issue of these previous experiments,
                    Mr Robley prepared a point of land of loose sandy soil, bounded by a salt lagoon
                    and the sea, for receiving a large plantation. When the tide filled, brackish
                    water was to be found everywhere at the depth of two feet and a half from the
                    surface; but it had been observed in some of the South Sea Islands, that
                    bread-fruit trees grew in full vigour though brackish water bathed their roots,
                    and the point was otherwise defended from the encroachments of the sea by an
                    artificial bank. The land being ploughed and harrowed twice, was divided into
                    beds stretching across from the sea to the lagoon; the beds were twenty-seven
                    feet in breadth, and the plants put into the earth in the middle of each, and
                    exactly at the distance of twenty-seven feet asunder; thus leaving a large space
                    for their vegetation. Mr Robley’s expectations were not disappointed. In August
                    1801 he had 153 plants in a flourishing condition; and, prosecuting the object
                    still further, he had, in the course of the subsequent year, 371 on the point of
                    land, of which no less than 319 plants were in a flourishing, and some of them
                    in a productive state. He transmitted specimens of the fruit to England
                    preserved in vinegar, as it will not keep above two days after being taken from
                    the tree; as also of the dried leaves and blossom. Other correspondents, nearly
                    about the same time, sent specimens of cakes made from the bread-fruit converted
                    into flour, which were extremely well flavoured; and it seemed that a dry
                    nutritious food, resembling tapioca in appearance and quality, might be prepared
                    from it. The vegetation of this plant is very rapid. Ten of those committed to
                    the care of Dr Anderson in 1793 were about two feet in height and half an inch
                    in diameter; and he observed, that, in the year 1798, most of the trees in the
                    botanical garden at Şt Vincents were above thirty feet in height, and the stem
                    two feet above the ground was from three feet to three and a half in
                    circumference. From the remarks he was enabled to make in this interval on the
                    varieties of the tree in the botanical garden, it appeared that the fruit came
                    out in succession during the greater part of the year, but less of it between
                    November and March than at any other time. The number produced by a single tree
                    was very great, being often in clusters of five and six, and bending the lower
                    branches to the ground. According to the different varieties, the fruit was of
                    various shapes and sizes, weighing from four to ten pounds, some smooth, others
                    rough and tuberculated. When taken from the tree before maturity, the juice
                    appeared of the consistence and colour of milk, and in taste somewhat similar.
                    It issued for above ten minutes in an uninterrupted stream, and thickened into a
                    glutinous and adhesive substance. Three months were required to bring the fruit
                    to perfection, which, as above remarked, is about a week before it begins to
                    ripen. Besides the Otaheitan breadfruit, Captain Bligh left some of the East
                    India bread-fruit in the botanical garden. But this proved of infinitely
                    inferior quality, and a very indifferent substitute for it. It was ill-shaped,
                    of a soft pulpy substance, and, like the other, wanting seeds, and propagating
                    itself by suckers springing from the root.</p>
                <p>A species of fruit bearing considerable analogy to those above described, is
                    found on the Nicoar Islands, but we are unacquainted with the degree of
                    attention it has received, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193735845"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-5845-0214"/>either for the purpose of illustrating its natural
                    history, or for economical uses. It is not less beneficial, however, to the
                    natives. The tree producing this fruit vegetates promiscuously with others in
                    the woods, but prefers a humid soil. Its trunk is straight, thirty or
                    thirty-five feet in height, and from ten inches to two feet in circumference.
                    The roots spring from it above the surface, and do not penetrate deep into the
                    earth. The leaves are disposed like the large calyx of a flower; they are three
                    feet long and four inches broad, of a dark green hue and tenacious substance. A
                    long time elapses before the tree produces fruit, not less than about the period
                    of human life. It then forms at the bottom of the leaves, from which it proceeds
                    as it is enlarged, and, when nearly ripe, its colour changes from green to
                    yellowish. This is the proper period for gathering it, when its weight is
                    between thirty and forty pounds. The exterior surface is cut off, and the fruit
                    is boiled in earthen pots covered with leaves, during several hours, on a slow
                    fire; when, becoming soft and friable, the preparation is sufficient, and the
                    fruit is then exposed to the air, and is next formed into a mass not unlike
                    maize either in taste or colour. It may be preserved for a long time, but
                    exposure to the atmosphere occasions acidity. The plant producing this fruit,
                    however, is not of the same genus as those above described, although its fruit
                    is converted to similar uses, but is rather a kind of palm, which it might be
                    useful to naturalize in the eastern possessions of Britain, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(n. n.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Bread, Sacramental,</hi> in the Protestant
                    churches, is common leavened bread, in conformity to the ancient practice. In
                    the Roman Catholic mass, azymous or unleavened bread is used, particularly in
                    the Gallican church, where a sort is provided for this purpose, called <hi
                    rend="italic">pain a chanter,</hi> made of the purest wheaten flour pressed
                    between two iron plates graven like wafer-moulds, and rubbed with white wax to
                    prevent the paste from sticking. The Greeks observe divers ceremonies in making
                    the eucharist bread. The Abyssinians have an apartment in their churches
                    allotted for this service, being a kind of sacristy. Sirmond, in his
                    disquisition on azymous bread, shows, from the council of Toledo, that anciently
                    there were as many ceremonies used in the Latin church in the preparation of the
                    unleavened bread as are still retained in the eastern churches.</p>
                <p>Ecclesiastical writers enumerate other species of bread allotted for purposes of
                    religion; as, <hi rend="italic">first, Kalendarius,</hi> that anciently offered
                    to the priest at the kalends; <hi rend="italic">secondly, Prebendarius,</hi> the
                    same with <hi rend="italic">capitularis,</hi> that distributed daily to each
                    prebendary or canon; <hi rend="italic">thirdly, Benedictus,</hi> that usually
                    given to catechumens before baptism, instead of the eucharist bread, which they
                    were incapable of partaking of. The <hi rend="italic">panis benedictus</hi> was
                    called also <hi rend="italic">panagium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eulogium,</hi>
                    being a sort of bread blessed and consecrated by the priest, by which the
                    catechumens were prepared for the reception of the body of Christ. The same was
                    used afterwards, not only by catechumens, but by believers themselves, as a
                    token of their mutual communion and friendship. Its origin is dated from the
                    seventh century, at the council at Nantes. In the Gallican church we still find
                    <hi rend="italic">panis benedictus, pain benit,</hi> used for that offered for
                    benediction, and afterwards distributed to pious persons who attend divine
                    service in chapels. <hi rend="italic">Fourthly,</hi> Consecrated bread is a
                    piece of wax, paste, or even earth, over which several ceremonies have been
                    performed with benedictions and other rites, to be sent in an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agnus Bei</hi> or relic-box, and presented for veneration. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fifthly,</hi> with regard to unleavened bread, <hi rend="italic">panis
                    azymus,</hi> the Jews eat no other during their passover; and exact search was
                    made in every house to see that no leavened bread had been left. The usage was
                    introduced in memory of their hasty departure from Egypt, when they had not
                    leisure to bake leavened bread. <hi rend="italic">Lastly,</hi> shew-bread was
                    that offered to God every Sabbath-day, being placed on the golden table in the
