                    rend="smallcaps">Julius,</hi> an ancient Latin writer, who flourished in the
                    time of Augustus. Suetonius, in his work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Illustribus Grammaticis,</hi> says that he was by birth a
                    Spaniard; but some think that he was a native of Alexandria in Egypt. He was
                    originally a slave of Julius Caesar, who brought him to Rome; but having
                    distinguished himself by his literary acquirements, he was emancipated by
                    Augustus, and placed at the head of the library which that sovereign had founded
                    in the temple of the Palatine Apollo. Whilst in this situation, he became
                    intimate with Ovid the poet; and Caius Licinius, a man of consular rank, has
                    informed us that he died very poor, having been supported by the bounty of his
                    friends; but some think that Caius Licinius is a mistake for Caius Asinius, who
                    wrote a history of the civil war, and served as consul with Cneius Domitius
                    Calvinus, in the year of the city 723. It is doubtful whether the works which
                    have been preserved under his name are really the productions of the freedman of
                    Augustus. These are <hi rend="italic">Fabularum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Liber,</hi> a collection of two hundred and seventy-seven fables, principally
                    derived from Greek sources, and which are of great value in mythological
                    inquiries; and <hi rend="italic">Poetico Astronomico,</hi> an astronomical and
                    mathematical work in prose. He is also supposed to have written on the subject
                    of agriculture, and to have composed a book of Genealogies, of which mention is
                    made in the <hi rend="italic">Poetico</hi><hi rend="italic">Astronomico.</hi> Of
                    this last work, the first book treats of the world and the doctrine of the
                    sphere, and the second of the signs in the zodiac; the third contains a history
                    and description of the constellations, and the fourth treats of the several
                    things relating to the planets. But whilst Hyginus describes the constellations
                    in the heavens, and enumerates the stars belonging to each, he takes occasion to
                    explain the fables of the poets from which these constellations were supposed to
                    have originally derived their names, and it is probably owing to this
                    circumstance that the work has been denominated <hi rend="italic">Poetico
                    Astronomico.</hi> It has however come down to us in a very imperfect state; and
                    all that part of it which treated of the month, the year, and the reasons for
                    intercalating the months, has been entirely lost. To the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poetico Astronomico</hi> is usually appended a book of fables, containing a
                    compendium of the heathen mythology; but this is also imperfect, and is moreover
                    suspected to be spurious. <hi rend="italic">Υ</hi><hi rend="italic">∖∖</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">Poetico Astronomico</hi> have been published together at Basle,
                    1555, and at Hamburg, 1674; and separately at Paris, 1578, and at Leyden, 1670.
                    The best editions are those which appeared with the commentary of Muncker, in a
                    collection entitled <hi rend="italic">MythographiLatini,</hi> Amsterdam, 1681,
                    reprinted with new notes by Van Staveren, Leyden, 1763. There are other works
                    under the name of Hyginus, but they all belong to a later age: <hi rend="italic"

                    1607, and reprinted with a learned commentary by Schelius, Amsterdam, 1661, and
                    also by Graevius in his <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus.</hi> Angelo Maio, the
                    learned librarian of the Vatican, has added three new works on mythology to
                    those which we already possessed, and one of these is under the name of Hyginus,
                    but evidently by a writer of the fifth century. Other manuscripts of the same
                    works have since been discovered at Göttingen, Gothe, and Paris; and Dr Bode has
                    published a new edition, with a careful collation of these manuscripts, <hi
