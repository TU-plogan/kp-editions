                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable

                <p><label type="entry">ETTMULLER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Michel</hi></label>, an
                    eminent physician, was born at Leipsic, on the 26th of May 1644. After having
                    studied the learned languages, the mathematics, and philosophy, first in his
                    native town, and afterwards at Wittenberg, he returned to Leipsic, and, having
                    devoted himself wholly to medicine, obtained the degree of bachelor in 1663, and
                    a license or diploma in 1666. But being desirous to extend his acquirements,
                    which were already considerable, he resolved, before taking his last degrees, to
                    visit the countries most celebrated for the cultivation of the sciences; and
                    with this view he commenced an interesting-course of travels in Italy,
                    sojourning for some time in the more remarkable cities of that fine country, as
                    Naples, Rome, Florence, Bologna, Venice, Padua, Pisa, Pavia, Milan, and Turin.
                    He then crossed the Alps and proceeded to Paris, where he remained seven months;
                    after which he passed over into England, and thence repaired to Holland. His
                    intention was to employ an entire winter in attending the prelections of learned
                    professors in the university of Leyden; but his design in this respect was
                    thwarted by his sudden recall to Lcipsic, where, on the 20th of August 1668, two
                    days after his arrival, he received the degree of doctor, a distinction which
                    proved the forerunner of new dignities. The Academy of the Curious in Nature
                    admitted the young doctor one of its members in 1670, and the Faculty of
                    Medicine in 1676. About the same time the university of Leipsic confided to him
                    the chair of botany, and appointed him extraordinary professor of surgery;
                    offices the duties of which he discharged with distinction. But he did not long
                    enjoy his preferment; for, on the 9th of March 1683, he was suddenly cut off, in
                    consequence of a hectic fever, occasioned, as some say, by a chemical
                    experiment. Although Ettmuller only wrote short dissertations and mere <hi
                    rend="italic">opuscula,</hi> he nevertheless enjoyed an immense reputation. His
                    feeblest productions were reprinted, translated, and commented on; nor were his
                    lectures, collected by numerous auditors, sometimes with much inaccuracy, less
                    favourably received by the public. He had the art of interesting and fixing the
                    attention by a ready elocution, and by arguments much more specious than solid.
                    Of this any one may satisfy himself by the perusal of his works, of which the
