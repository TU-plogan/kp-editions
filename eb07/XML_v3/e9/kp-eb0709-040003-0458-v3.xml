                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">EUMENES</label>, a native of Cardia, a city in the Thracian
                    Chersonesus, was born 360 and died 315 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> At a very
                    early age he was employed as private secretary by Philip king of Macedonia, on
                    account of his friendship for his father. On the death of that prince he was
                    confirmed in the same office by Alexander; and it was in this capacity that he
                    accompanied that monarch into Asia. So highly did Alexander esteem him that he
                    gave him in marriage a Persian lady of noble birth, sister to her who had
                    married Ptolemy. Upon the death of Alexander, the provinces and armies were
                    divided amongst his generals, and the countries assigned to Eumenes were
                    Cappadocia and Paphlagonia, with the sea-coast of Pontus as far as Tra∙ pezus;
                    but as they were not yet subdued, Leonatus and Antigonus were commissioned to
                    put him in possession. Antigonus disregarded the orders of Perdiccas, and
                    Leonatus having in vain attempted to induce Eumenes to accompany him to the
                    assistance of Antipater in Europe, made an unsuccessful attack on his life.
                    Eumenes escaped and joined Perdiccas, who assisted him in taking possession of
                    Cappadocia.</p>
                <p>About this time Craterus and Antipater, having reduced Greece, determined to pass
                    into Asia and overthrow the power of Perdiccas. It may be easily imagined that
                    Cappadocia was the first object of their attack; and accordingly Eumenes was
                    appointed commander of all the forces in the neighbouring countries. But to this
                    Neoptolemus, One of the generals, refused to submit; and being defeated by
                    Eumenes, he fled to Antipater and Craterus. The presence of Antipater was
                    required in Cilicia, and the army destined to act against Eumenes was therefore
                    commanded by Craterus and Neoptolemus. They were, however, completely defeated;
                    Neoptolemus was killed, and Craterus died of his wounds, 321 u c. The pride of
                    the Macedonians was hurt by this defeat of two of their generals by a person
                    whom they considered as a stranger; and the news having reached them a few days
                    after the death of Perdiccas, the Macedonian chiefs condemned Eumenes to death,
                    and charged Antipater and Antigonus with the execution of their order. Eumenes
                    was at first successful, but being defeated through the treachery of one of his
                    officers, he fled to Nora, a strong fortress on the confines of Cappadocia and
                    Lycaonia. Here he made a successful resistance, and was afterwards appointed by
                    Olympias to command the army against Antigonus, whose intentions could no longer
                    be misunderstood. He gained a battle against his adversary, but was unlucky
                    enough to lose the baggage and wives belonging to his Macedonian phalanx.
                    Antigonus offered to restore them on condition that the soldiers would surrender
                    Eumenes into his hands, which they were base enough to agree to; and Antigonus
                    immediately murdered his opponent, in the fortieth year of his age. (Plutarch,
                    <hi rend="italic">Life of</hi><hi rend="italic">Eumenes;</hi> Nepos; Diodor.

                    Philotaerus 263 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>, and having engaged in
                    hostilities with Antiochus, king of Syria, defeated him near Sardes. But he fell
                    a victim to his habits of drunkenness 241 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> and was
                    succeeded by his cousin Attalus. (Strabo, xι∏∙ 624; Athenaeus, x. p. 445.)</p>

                    >c-,</hi> and continued to maintain the intimate alliance which it had been his
                    father’s policy to form with the Romans. Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, who
                    at that time <hi rend="superscript"> se</hi> ' cretly meditated contesting the
                    supremacy of the Romans, tried to seduce him by offering one of his daughters in
                    marriage; but Eumenes suspecting the interested intentions of Antiochus,
                    prudently refused the honour of th' <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> alliance. In
                    the war which soon afterwards broke out he proved himself the firm friend of the
                    Romans, and assisted Livius Salinator in his victory over the fleet of Antiochus
                    (191 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>), on which occasion he was greatly
                    distinguished for his bravery. Again, in the decisive batte <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193750471" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0471-0401"/>which was fought at the foot
                    of Mount Sipylus, in which Antiochus was completely defeated (188 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.),</hi> the troops of Eumenes greatly distinguished
                    themselves; and on the conclusion of peace this prince received a great addition
                    to his territories at the expense of Antiochus. He was afterwards attacked by
                    Prusias, king of Bithynia, whose forces were under the command of the celebrated
                    Hannibal, and by Pharnaces, king of Pontus; but the powerful mediation of the
                    Romans compelled all parties to lay down their arms. Having become acquainted
                    with the designs of Perseus against the Romans, Eumenes set out for Rome (172
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.),</hi> to warn the senate of the preparations for war
                    which were making against them. On his return he wished to offer sacrifices to
                    Apollo at Delphi, when he was attacked by a party of assassins stationed by
                    Perseus, and narrowly escaped with his life. He was-then carried by his friends
                    to the island of Aegina, where he remained in concealment for some time. A
                    report of his death having reached his brother, the latter assumed the reins of
                    government, and married Stratonice the wife of Eumenes. When he reappeared, this
                    proceeding does not seem to have changed his conduct towards his brother; and
                    they lived in the same amity as before. His close intimacy with the Romans seems
                    to have been broken off towards the end of his reign, and that people
                    endeavoured to embroil him with the neighbouring princes. In this embarrassing
                    state of affairs he died 157 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> leaving his throne
                    to his brother Attalus II. (See Sevin, <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur les Rois
