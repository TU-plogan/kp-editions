                    the serpent, occasioned the fall, with all its consequences.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">John,</hi> a distinguished naturalist and writer on various
                    subjects, was born at Wotton in Surrey, on the 31st of October 1620. In the
                    fifth year of his age he waa sent to Lewes in Sussex, where he was placed under
                    the superintendence of his grandfather. The latter, however, having died in
                    1627, Evelyn in the following year was sent to learn his “Latin rudiments, and
                    to write.” In 1637, he entered as a student in Baliol College, Oxford; and in
                    1640 he removed to the Middle Temple, London. But his studies were interrupted
                    by the civil commotions of this period; and about a year after his arrival in
                    the Temple, he left England for the Continent. He returned in 1642; but the
                    rupture between the king and the parliament had now assumed a serious aspect;
                    loyalty could no longer be professed with safety; and in the year following,
                    having asked and obtained the kind’s leave of absence, he became an exile, and
                    spent several years in travelling through France and Italy. His powers of
                    observation appear to have been great; and the curious and useful information
                    which he thereby acquired constitutes the charm of many of his works,
                    particularly of his diary. In 1647 he married the only daughter of Sir Richard
                    Browne, the king’s minister at Paris, in whose right he acquired the mansion of
                    Sayes Court, near Deptford. This matrimonial alliance was a happy one. In his
                    wife he possessed a woman of an enlightened mind, and of dispositions congenial
                    with his own. That Evelyn must have conducted himself with more than ordinary
                    prudence and discretion, appears evident; for whilst he thus allied himself with
                    Sir Richard Browne, the ambassador of King Charles II. at Paris, he possessed
                    several personal friends at the court of Cromwell, and in fact returned to
                    England a few months after his marriage. Here he remained till 1649, when he
                    again departed for the Continent; but returned to England in 1651. His manners,
                    we may presume, were very agreeable, for his company was sought by the most
                    eminent foreigners; and during his travels he made acquaintance not only with
                    individuals distinguished for their learning, but with ingenious men belonging
                    to every art and profession.</p><p>After his final settlement in his native country, Evelyn engaged in literary
                    pursuits. His first undertaking was a translation from the French; and from the
                    period of its publication to the close of a long life, he continued to give to
                    the world original works replete with information alike useful, entertaining,
                    and philosophical. These will be afterwards enumerated. After the death of
                    Cromwell he interested himself in the restoration of Charles IL, for which he
                    was much favoured by that monarch, after his resumption of the royal
                    prerogative. In 1660-61 he was nominated by his majesty one of the council, and
                    chosen by the rest of the members a Fellow of the Philosophical Society, which
                    met at Gresham College. This institution formed the basis of the Royal Society,
                    which was established about two years afterwards, and to which Evelyn read a
                    treatise on forest trees. This discourse formed the foundation of his most
                    celebrated production entitled <hi rend="italic">Sylva.</hi> In 1664 Evelyn was
                    appointed one of the commissioners of the sick and wounded, and likewise a
                    commissioner for rebuilding St Paul’s Cathedral. When the board of trade was
                    established by Charles II. Evelyn was nominated one of the members; and on this
                    occasion he drew up a tract on navigation and commerce. In the reign of J ames
                    II. he was one of the commissioners for executing the office of privy seal
                    during the absence of the Earl of Clarendon in Ireland<pb break="no" facs="nls:193750900" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0900-0434"/>. He continued
                    in favour at court even after the revolution, and was made treasurer of
                    Greenwich Hospital, the foundation stone of which he laid in the year 1696. By
                    the death of his elder brother in 1699, he succeeded to the paternal estate, and
                    quitted Sayes Court for Wotton, where he passed the remainder of his life,
                    excepting occasional visits to London, where he died on the 27th of February
                    1705-6, in the eighty-sixth year of his age.</p><p>In his personal character Evelyn was truly amiable. He discharged the relative
                    duties of father, husband, and friend, in an exemplary manner; and during his
                    long and useful, rather than splendid career, numerous offices of trust were
                    reposed in him; nor was this confidence misplaced. His correspondence with
                    foreigners as well as Englishmen was so extensive, that it is surprising he
                    should have found time for examining what was deemed worthy of curiosity or of
                    scientific observation, and for composing the great variety of works which he
                    published. “His life,” says Horace Walpole, “was a course of inquiry, study,
                    curiosity, instruction, and benevolence. The works of the Creator, and the
                    minute labours of the creature, were all objects of his pursuit. He unfolded the
                    perfection of the one, and assisted the imperfection of the other. He adored
                    from examination, was a courtier that flattered only by informing his prince,
                    and by pointing out what was worthy for him to countenance; and really was the
                    neighbour of the gospel, for there was no man that might not have been the
                    better for him. Whoever peruses a list of his works will subscribe to my
                    assertion. He was one of the first promoters of the Royal Society, a patron of
                    the ingenious and the indigent, and peculiarly serviceable to the lettered
                    world; for, besides his writings and discoveries, he obtained the Arundelian
                    library for the Royal Society. Nor is it the least part of his praise that he
                    who proposed to Mr Boyle the erection of a philosophical college for retired and
                    speculative persons, had the honesty to write in defence of active life against
                    Sir George Mackenzie’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Solitude.</hi> He knew that
                    retirement, in his own hands, was industry and benefit to mankind, but in those
                    of others, laziness and inutility.” The principal works of Mr Evelyn are, 1. An
                    Essay on the First Book of Lucretius, in English verse, 8vo; 2. The French
                    Gardener, 12mo; 3. <hi rend="italic">Eumifugium,</hi> or the Inconveniences of
                    the Air and Smoke of London dissipated, 4to; 4. Sculpture, or the History and
