                <p><label type="entry">EPIRUS</label>, a country to the north-west of Greece, along
                    the coast of the Ionian Sea, bounded on the north by the Ceraunian Mountains, on
                    the south by the Ambracian Gulf, and separated on the east and north-east from
                    Thessaly and Macedonia by the lofty range of Pindus. This extensive country was
                    known in the earlier ages of the world under no general name; it was probably
                    the inhabitants of the numerous islands along its coasts who first applied to it
                    the appellation of Epirus, answering to the English term mainland, in order to
                    distinguish it from the islands which they themselves inhabited. It included
                    within its bounds several nations, the most powerful of whom were the Molossi,
                    whose chief town was Dodona, famous for the oracle and temple of Jupiter; the
                    Thesproti, who had for their capital Buthrotum; and the Chaones, who dwelt in
                    the valleys of the Ceraunian Mountains. All these tribes are considered as
                    having been of Pelasgic origin. Though allied by blood with the Greeks, they
                    were always regarded as barbarians, and Ambracia as the last city in Greece. The
                    ancient buildings, institutions, and religious worship of the Epirotes, are also
                    manifestly of Pelasgic origin.</p>
                <p>The kings of Epirus pretended to be descended from Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, who
                    settled in this country after the taking of Troy, and transmitted his kingdom to
                    Molossus, his son by Andromache; but the early history of the kings of the
                    Molossi is involved in much obscurity. Admetus sat on the throne of Epirus, 480
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> at the time of the invasion of Greece by the
                    Persians, and he remained neutral till their defeat, when he solicited an
                    alliance with the Athenians. This was refused chiefly through the persuasion of
                    Themistocles; yet Admetus was generous enough to forget this circumstance when
                    Themistocles was banished, 471 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> by his ungrateful
                    countrymen, and received him with every mark of respect and esteem.</p>
                <p>Admetus was succeeded by his son Tharymbas or Arymbas I. about 429 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> but was still so young that he was placed, by a
                    decree of the people, under the guardianship of Sabylinthus, prince of
                    Atintania. He seems to have been a wise and prudent monarch, who attempted to
                    introduce a regular form of government among a wild and a lawless people.
                    Alcetas is the next king of Epirus mentioned in history, and he reigned about
                    385 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> Being driven from his throne by his
                    subjects, he fled to Syracuse, and with the assistance of Dionysius was soon
                    afterwards re-established. Neoptolemus his son reigned but a short time, and
                    left the crown to his brother Arymbas II. about 360 B. c. who encouraged
                    literature and the arts, governing his kingdom with prudence, equity, and
                    moderation. It was to him that Xenocrates of Chalcedon dedicated the four books
                    which he had composed on the art of go. verning. This prince educated with the
                    greatest care the children of his brother. He married Troas, one of his nieces,
                    and gave the other, Olympias, in marriage to Philip of Macedon, who had by her
                    Alexander the Great. On his death, 342 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> he was
                    succeeded by his nephew Alexander, brother of Olympias. This prince was put in
                    possession of the throne of his uncle by the aid of his brother-in-law Philip,
                    who afterwards gave him in marriage his daughter Cleopatra. It was at the
                    celebration of these nuptials at Edessa that the king of Macedonia was
                    assassinated.</p>
                <p>Alexander was the first prince who raised the character and reputation of his
                    country amongst foreign nations. Having been applied to by the Tarentines for
                    assistance against the Samnites and Lucanians, he passed into Italy with a
                    considerable force, made a descent at Paestum, 332 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi>, a city near the mouth of the river Silarus, and reduced under his
                    dominion several cities of the Lucani and Brutii∙ In his second attack upon
                    Italy he was hurround∙ ed by the enemy, defeated, and slain, near the city
                    Pandosia, in the territory of the Brutii.</p>
                <p>Oeacides the son of Arymbas II. succeeded to Alexander, and espoused the cause of
                    Olympias against Cassander; but his soldiers having mutinied, dethroned him,
                    though he was in a short time reinstated. He was killed the same year, 313 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> in a battle against Philip, brother of Cassander.
                    This prince had by his wife Phthia, the celebrated Pyrrhus, and two daughters,
                    Deidamia and Troas, of whom the former married Demetrius Poliorcetes. His
                    brother Alcetas, who succeeded him, continued the war with Cassander till he was
                    defeated, and his dominions were overrun by the enemy. He was afterwards put to
                    death by his rebellious subjects 295 <hi rend="smallcaps">b c.</hi> The name of
                    Pyrrhus, who now ascended the throne, sheds a lustre on the annals of Epirus,
                    and gives to its history an importance which it would never have otherwise
                    possessed; but for a detailed account of his life we must refer to the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrrhus.</hi></p>
                <p>Alexander, in 272 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> succeeded his father Pyrrhus,
                    when he attempted to seize on Macedonia. He defeated Antigonus Gonatas, but was
                    himself shortly afterwards driven from his kingdom by Demetrius, son of that
                    prince. He recovered it, however, and spent the rest of his reign in peace. At
                    the expiration of two other insignificant reigns the family of Pyrrhus became
                    extinct, upon which the inhabitants of Epirus changed the form of their
                    government, electing annually a praetor in a general assembly of the nation held
                    at Passaron, a city of the Molossi. Epirus imprudently espoused the cause of
                    Perseus in his war against the Romans, when he was defeated and taken prisoner
                    168 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.; and it was exposed to the unrelenting fury
                    of the Romans, who destroyed in one day seventy-three cities, and carried away
                    the principal inhabitants to Rome. It never recovered from this fatal blow. At
                    the dissolution of the Achaean league, 146 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> this
                    country became part of the province of Macedonia under the name of Vetus Epirus,
                    in order to distinguish it from Nova Epirus, which lay to the east.</p>
                <p>On the division of the empire it became the inheritance of the emperors of the
                    East, and remained under them until the taking of Constantinople by the Latins,
                    in 1204&gt; when Michel Comnenes seized on Aetolia and Epirus. 0 <hi

                    were left to his natural children. Amurath II. stripped them of this
                    inheritance. In 1443, Scanderberg, king of Albania, made himself master of a
                    considerable part of Epirus. But on his death it fell into the power of the
                    Venetians, from whom it passed to the Turks, who possess it at present under the
                    name of Albania.</p>
