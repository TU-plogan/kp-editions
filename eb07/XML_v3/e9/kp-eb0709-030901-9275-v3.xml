                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">EPICURUS</label>, one of the most celebrated philosophers of
                    antiquity, was descended of an illustrious family, that of the Philaides, which
                    derived its origin from Philaeus, grandson of Ajax. Neocles, his father, resided
                    in Gargettium, a borough of Attica; but finding himself ill provided in point of
                    fortune, he passed into the island of Samos, when the Athenians sent a colony
                    thither, in the year 352 before Christ. As Diogenes Laertius fixes the birth of
                    Epicurus in the year 341 before Christ, it is therefore probable that the
                    philosopher first saw the light at Samos, and not at Gargettium, as is commonly
                    supposed. In his early youth he is said to have followed his mother, who appears
                    to have been an itinerant sorceress, reading the formularies of exorcism and
                    expiation, whilst she performed the ceremonies usual on such occasions; but as
                    he advanced in years he assisted his father in keeping a school, which the
                    latter had established at Samos. At the age of fourteen Epicurus began to devote
                    himself to philosophy. He at first attended Pamphilus, one of the disciples of
                    Plato, and Nausiphanes, of the school of Democritus; not the disciple of Pyrrho,
                    as Diogenes Laertius affirms, Pyrrho having been the contemporary of Epicurus.
                    But the lessons he received from these teachers did not satisfy his mind; and
                    having applied himself to the study of the writings of Democritus, he made great
                    progress in philosophy, and soon thought himself in a condition to form a new
                    sect. At the age of eighteen he proceeded to Athens, but he sojourned there only
                    a short time, by reason of the troubles which ensued after the death of
                    Alexander. He then repaired to his father’s at Calophon, in Ionia, whence he
                    afterwards went to Mitylene and Lampsacus, where he began to profess his new
                    principles of philosophy. Having attracted a great number of disciples, amongst
                    whom were the three brothers Neocles, Cheredemus, and Aristobulus, he returned
                    with them to Athens in the year before Christ 309; and having there purchased a
                    garden for eighty minae, or L.288 sterling, he immediately commenced teaching
                    his philosophy· All the world was not admitted to his lessons; but is disciples,
                    in imitation of the Pythagoreans, formed a sort of community by themselves.
                    Nevertheless, he did not recommend or encourage a community of goods, which θ
                    considered as calculated to excite distrust; but each paid a portion of the
                    general expense, which, however, <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> as
                    inconsiderable, as they were content with the sim-P est fare. The most perfect
                    union reigned amongst cm, and indeed subsisted undisturbed long after the eath
                    of Epicurus. Cicero says that the Epicureans of his time still lived in common,
                    and in the best understanding with one another. Women were even admitted into
                    this society; and amongst its most celebrated disciples are mentioned Leontium,
                    courtezan of Athens, and Themista, , wife of Leontius of Lampsacus. As Epicurus
                    never taught in public, the sect was little celebrated during his lifetime; but
                    after his death, when his writings became generally known, the doctrine therein
                    taught was warmly attacked by the Stoics, who did not blush even to have
                    recourse to the most atrocious calumnies. Diotimus the Stoic went so far as to
                    fabricate, in the name of Epicurus, fifty letters addressed to courtezans, in
                    which the philosopher is made to express himself in the most obscene manner; but
                    Chrysippus himself bears testimony to the blameless conduct and manners of
                    Epicurus; and although the latter alleged that this was not the result of
                    philosophy, but attributable solely to coldness and insensibility of
                    temperament, it is certain that his life was wholly free from those vices with
                    which his enemies have reproached him. For a short account of the system,
                    canonical, physical, and ethical, taught by this philosopher, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Epicurean Philosophy.</hi> Epicurus died of the stone in the
                    seventy-second year of his age. He was never married; not that he blamed
                    marriage, tor he taught that a wise man ought to marry and have children; but as
                    he was of a feeble constitution, and seldom enjoyed good health, he did not
                    think it incumbent on him to observe the maxim which he inculcated on others. By
                    his will, which Diogenes Laertius has preserved, he bequeathed his garden and a
                    house which he had at Melitus to Hermachus his successor, and to those who
                    should after him be at the head of his school, as long as it should subsist, in
                    order that his followers might assemble on the spot where his system was first
                    taught. His memory was held in veneration by his disciples, among whom the
                    anniversary of his birth was celebrated as a festival; they had his portrait
                    engraved on their rings and on their cups, as well as placed in their chambers;
                    and they never spoke of him but with the greatest respect. In the number of
                    Greek manuscripts discovered at Herculaneum have been found several of the works
                    of Epicurus, the unravelling of which, however, has as yet been only partially
                    effected. Some fragments of the second book of his treatise <hi rend="italic">On
                    the Nature of Things</hi> were published at Naples in 1814. No one has better
                    developed the philosophical system of Epicurus than Gassendi in his <hi
