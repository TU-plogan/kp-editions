                    heroes who were killed in the first Theban war. The war of the Epigoni is famous
                    in ancient history. It was undertaken ten years after the Theban war. The sons

                    fathers, and marched against Thebes, under the command of Thersander, or,
                    according to others, of Alemaeon the son of Amphiaraus, about 1307 years before
                    Christ. The Argives were assisted by the Corinthians and the people of Messenia,
                    Arcadia, and Megara. The Thebans had engaged all their neighbours in their
                    quarrel as in one common cause. The two hostile armies met on the banks of the
                    Glissas, and a battle ensued. The combat was obstinate and bloody; but victory
                    declared for the Epigoni, and some of the Thebans fled to Illyricum with
                    Leodamas their general, whilst others retired into Thebes, where they were soon
                    afterwards besieged and forced to surrender. In this war Aegialeus was the only
                    person of note who was killed; and in the former his father Adrastus was the
                    only individual of this description who escaped alive. This whole war, as
                    Pausanias observes, was written in verse; and Callinus, who quotes some of the
                    verses, ascribes them to Homer, an opinion which has been adopted by many
                    writers. “For my part,” continues the geographer, “I own, that next to the Iliad
                    and Odyssey of Homer, I have never seen a finer poem.” The <hi rend="italic">Epigoniad</hi> of Wilkie is a modern poetical celebration of the same story.
                    The descendants of the veteran Macedonians, who served under Alexander the
                    Great, and who had children by Asiatic women, were also called Epigoni.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
