                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> all the applications of algebra, it is not the
                    magnitudes concerned that we immediately consider, but merely their proportions.
                    In every class of quantities of the same kind, one being adopted as the unit of
                    comparison, all the rest are referred to this standard, and are represented by
                    the proportions they bear to it. The letters of the alphabet, or other symbols,
                    used in algebra, are not, therefore, properly speaking, the representatives of
                    magnitudes; they denote ratios, or abstract numbers, viewed, as in the fifth
                    book of Euclid, in the most general manner, and independently of any particular
                    system of arithmetic or numeration.</p>
                <p>The ancient geometry follows a different procedure. In that science the attention
                    is in every case confined to the magnitudes under actual consideration. A
                    general property of triangles is established, by showing that it is true of any
                    particular triangle that comes under the proposed hypothesis. The geometer
                    contemplates particular instances, presenting for the most part relations not
                    very complex,and easily kept in view. On this account he carries on his
                    investigations with the greatest clearness, and is in no danger of falling into
                    contradiction or paradox. But his science is little susceptible of general
                    methods. If any. process within the compass of the ancient geometry be entitled
                    to that appellation, it is what is called the method of exhaustion. Every
                    geometer perceives that all the demonstrations under this head have the closest
                    analogy. Yet, after a hundred applications, it is still necessary, in my new
                    case, to pursue the reasoning through all its details, without deriving
                    assistance from any general conclusion previously obtained.</p>
                <p>Algebra possesses a great advantage over geometry in generalizing its processes.
                    Problems relating to magni·· cudes of the most different kinds, nevertheless,
                    lead to similar expressions in numbers. Questions in geometry, m mechanics, or
                    concerning mercantile business, are made to depend on the same rules for their
                    solution. It may be said that algebra and the modern analysis accomplish, for
                    ill the mathematical sciences, the project, entertained by some ingenious men,
                    of an universal and philosophical language, which, being founded on an exact
                    scrutiny into the nature of things, and on what they possess in common, might
                    greatly facilitate the acquisition and the extension )f our knowledge.</p>
                <p>The spirit of generalization peculiar to algebra is no-vhere more conspicuous
                    than in the doctrine of equations. Every determinate problem that can occupy the
                    attention of the mathematician, is ultimately reduced to the finding )f such
                    numbers as are necessary to determine the unknown quantity or quantities, by
                    means of the equations that subsist between those numbers, and others which are
                    ζiven in the question. A wide field of mathematical investigation is thus
                    brought under a limited number of algebraic expressions.</p>
                <p>In treating of equations, it will not be necessary to begin with laying down a
                    formal definition. We confine ourselves, in this article, to the consideration
                    of such equations as contain only one unknown quantity. We further suppose that
                    the elementary operations preparatory to solution are already performed; so that
                    the unknown quantity is clear of radical signs, and is nowhere found in ε
                    denominator of a fraction; likewise that all the separate terms are brought to
                    one side of the sign of equality, and arranged in such a manner that the first
                    term, which must always be positive, and have unit for its index, contains the
                    highest power of the unknown quantity, or <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> the second
                    term contains the next highest power, and so on, the term which does not contain
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> being placed last. This arrangement must always be
                    understood when any term is distinguished by the order it stands in; but it will
                    sometimes be convenient to write the terms in an inverted order, arranging them
                    according to the indices of the unknown quantity.</p>
                <p>Equations are divided into different classes or orders, according to the highest
                    power of the unknown quantity found in their terms.</p>
                <p>An equation of the first degree, or a simple equation, is one which contains <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> only, without any of its powers, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >x—</hi> A - 0.</p>
                <p>A quadratic equation, or one of the second degree, contains the square of <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A = 0, orae <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — Aae
                    + B = 0.</p>
                <p>A cubic equation, or one of the third degree, contains the cube, or third power
                    of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A=0, or x <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>A biquadratic equation, or one of the fourth degree, contains the fourth power,
                    or biquadrate of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A—0, or <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> Aae <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> + Brc <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    — <hi rend="smallcaps">Cλi+D=0.</hi></p>
                <p>And, in general, an equation of the w <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> degree
                    contains the w <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> power of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> and the powers inferior to the n <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi>, such
                    as</p>
                <p>/-A/“<hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> + <hi rend="italic">Bx</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">~</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    2</hi> __ Mcc+N=0.</p>
                <p>A root of an equation is a value of the unknown number <hi rend="italic">x.</hi>
                    Thus, if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> represent a number, and if its powers, <hi
                    rend="italic">a, a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">,
                    a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> when they
                    are substituted in the equation for <hi rend="italic">x, χ</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">, x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> &amp;c. produce an equality between
                    the positive and negative terms, then <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a root of the
                    equation, and it is a positive root; but if, for ae, ae <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>, cc <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, &amp;c. we must substitute —α, « <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, — α <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, &amp;c. which
                    are the powers of — α, in order to obtain the like equality, then <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is a negative root of the equation.</p>
                <p>What we have here called roots are more generally named <hi rend="italic">real
                    roots,</hi> to distinguish them from those expressions to which the appellation
                    of <hi rend="italic">imaginary or impossible roots</hi> has been given. As it
                    will conduce to perspicuity, we shall always use the word root in the sense here
                    defined, unless when imaginary or impossible roots are expressly mentioned.</p>
                <p>From the definitions laid down, it follows that the negative roots of the
                    equation,</p>
                <p>0 = N + Mae + Lx <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + Ka <hi rend="superscript">
                    3</hi> +, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>are the same with the positive roots of the equation,</p>
                <p>0 = N — Mae + Lar — Kcc <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> +, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>in which the signs only of all the terms containing the odd powers of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> are changed. For the same result is obtained, whether we
                    make <hi rend="italic">x</hi> equal to — <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in the first
                    equation, or to + <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in the second.</p>
                <p>2. A great advantage has resulted from the practice introduced by Harriot, of
                    writing all the terms of an equation on one side of the sign of equality. The
                    polynomes formed by all the terms thus brought together are rational and
                    integral functions of the unknown quantity; and the question is, to find in what
                    circumstances such expressions are equal to zero. The most likely way of
                    succeeding in this research, is to resolve the functions into their most simple
                    component factors. Harriot supposed that every rational function can be produced
                    by the continued multiplication of binomial factors, and in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193749418" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9418-0320"/>this he has been followed by
                    succeeding algebraists. The modern theory of equations is entirely founded on
                    this supposition, which, although it has not been demonstrated, has yet, in some
                    measure, been verified in the progress of the science, and by the admission of
                    those artificial expressions called imaginary or impossible quantities. But
                    there is a distinction between the real and impossible binomial factors of a
                    rational polynome; for the first are expressions complete and significant by
                    themselves, without reference to other quantities; whereas one impossible factor
                    necessarily supposes the existence of another, the two related expressions being
                    such that their multiplication produces one real factor of the second degree.
                    Thus, every pair of impossible factors is equivalent to a real quadratic factor;
                    and, by an unavoidable consequence of the forced supposition made by Harriot,
                    the attention of algebraists has been drawn to the two impossible expressions,
                    instead of the real one which they compose. In order to place the doctrine of
                    equations and the theory of impossible roots on a solid foundation, it appears
                    necessary to attempt the resolution of rational functions into their component
                    factors by a rigorous analysis, free from arbitrary suppositions.</p>
                <p>To resolve the rational function <hi rend="italic">f (x)</hi> into its component
                    factors, we must begin with inquiring whether it can be divided without a
                    remainder, by a division such as <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">a,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">x + a.</hi> If it can, the
                    proposed function will be equal to (a=ρ <hi rend="italic">a) × f' (x),</hi>
                    where/ <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi><hi rend="italic">(x),</hi> the quotient of
                    the division, is a function similar to y (a), but of an order one degree lower.
                    In like manner, it may be possible to reduce/*' (a?) to a degree still lower, by
                    means of one or more divisors of the same form; and, in certain cases, the first
                    function may be entirely exhausted by successive binomial divisors. When this
                    happens, the divisors <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a, x</hi><hi rend="italic">— b,</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">c,</hi> &amp;c. will be equal in number to
                    the exponent of the highest power of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and their
                    continued product will be equal to <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (a). It is evident,
                    that by multiplying together a proper number of such factors, an algebraic
                    expression may be formed similar to any rational and integral function, and the
                    co-efficients of this product will likewise contain as many quantities to be
                    determined at pleasure as there are co-efficients in the given function. But we
                    should reason badly if, from this process of composition, we should infer that a
                    product arising from the multiplication of a certain number of simple factors
                    may have any given co-efficients, or will coincide with any proposed polynome of
                    the same degree. This is a point that can be ascertained only by a process of
                    analysis or resolution, and by seeking all the binomial divisors any given
                    function admits of. In faet, the cases are extremely rare in which an algebraic
                    function can be completely exhausted by real binomial divisors. There are many
                    polynômes which have not a single divisor of this kind; and, in the progress of
                    resolution, we generally arrive at a function which cannot be further divided.
                    When this is the case, it must be tried whether a quadratic divisor, as ŕ + <hi
                    rend="italic">mx</hi> + «, will not be successful in lowering the function. But
                    here it must be observed that such divisors are of two kinds; one, as <hi
                    rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> g) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    — <hi rend="italic">τ</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> which can be resolved into two binomial factors; and one, as (a — f) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, which cannot be
                    so resolved without introducing imaginary or impossible expressions. Now, to
                    divide by a divisor of the first kind is the same thing as to divide by the two
                    binomial factors of which it is composed; and, therefore, it is the second kind
                    of quadratic factors only that need be tried, or that can succeed, in lowering a
                    function already deprived of all its simple divisors. After quadratic divisors,
                    those of the third degree would naturally come to be considered; but this is
                    unnecessary, because algebraists have found that every rational function may be
                    completely exhausted by simple, and quadratic factors.</p>
                <p>What has now been said naturally distributes the subject under two heads; one
                    treating of the simple or binomial factors, and the other of the quadratic or
                    trinomial factors, of algebraic equations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Binomial Eactors.</hi></p>
                <p>3. The first object of inquiry must be to find the conditions necessary, in order
                    that a binomial quantity, as <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">x + a,</hi> shall divide a rational
                    polynôme without a remainder. Suppose that <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> is a divisor of the polynome, <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> η</hi> + Aa” <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> + Ba” <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + Ma + N, which
                    we shall denote by <hi rend="italic">f (x)</hi>: then we shall have y (a) = N +
                    Ma + La <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + Ka <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> +,
                    &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">f(a) -</hi> N + Mα + Lα <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    + Kα <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> +, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>wherefore, by subtracting and dividing by a — <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> we get a—
                    <hi rend="italic">a x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> a—
                    <hi rend="italic">a x</hi><hi rend="italic">— a x—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi><hi rend="italic">’</hi></p>
                <p>Now, it is known that the difference between any like powers of two numbers is
                    exactly divisible by the difference of those numbers: hence all the quantities
                    on the right-hand side of the sign of equality form an integral expression. But
                    as <hi rend="italic">f (a)</hi> does not contain a, it cannot be divisible by a—
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it follows, therefore, that <hi

                <p>Here again all the divisions on the right-hand side of the sign of equality can
                    be exactly performed; and we must, therefore, conclude that <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Now <hi rend="italic">xz=ţ=.a</hi> being a divisor of <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    (a), the quotient, which we may denote by <hi rend="italic">f'</hi> (a), will be
                    a polynome of (n— 1) dimensions, or one degree lower than <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> (a); and we shall have</p>
                <p>/ (a) = (a=p∕) × <hi rend="italic">f’</hi> (a).</p>
                <p>From this equation it appears that every value of <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> that
                    makes <hi rend="italic">f' (x)</hi> equal to zero, will likewise make <hi
                    rend="italic">f (x)</hi> equal to zero; consequently every binomial divisor of
                    the first function will likewise be a divisor of the second. And ií <hi

                <p>It is evident we may continue to reason in the same manner either till, after
                    successive divisions, we come at last to a binomial quotient, in which case the
                    original polynome <hi rend="italic">f (x)</hi> will be completely resolved into
                    binomial factors; or till we come to a quotient that has no roots, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193749431" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9431-0321"/> .in which case/
                    <hi rend="italic">(x)</hi> will have no binomial factors except those previously
                    found. We may therefore conclude that “a rational polynome has as many binomial
                    factors as it has roots, and no more; every positive root producing a factor of
                    the form <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    and since the number of binomial factors can never be greater than the
                    dimensions of the polynôme, its roots cannot exceed the same number.”</p>
                <p>4. There are very few cases in which it can be known immediately and by
                    inspection that an equation has one or more roots. These cases depend upon the
                    following propositions, viz. “If <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> (a?) denote a rational
                    polynôme, having <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> or some integral power of <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> in every one of its terms, and likewise having the term
                    that contains the greatest power of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> positive, a value
                    of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> may be found that will make <hi rend="italic">φ
                    (x)</hi> equal to any positive quantity,</p>
                <p>»</p>
                <p>as s.</p>
                <p>Suppose, first, that all the terms of <hi rend="italic">φ (x)</hi> are positive;
                    then <hi rend="italic">χ</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> being the
                    first term, or that in which <hi rend="italic">x</hi> rises to the highest
                    power, if s = <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> and λ&gt;i, it is manifest that <hi rend="italic">ĩ&gt;

                <p>Therefore, while <hi rend="italic">x</hi> increases from 0 to be equal to λ, the
                    function <hi rend="italic">(χ)</hi> increases from 0 to be greater than s; and
                    as the variations of <hi rend="italic">φ (x),</hi> however irregular they may
                    be, are connected by the law of continuity, the function will pass through every
                    gradation of magnitude between 0 and the greatest limit p (λ). Consequently,
                    there is a value of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> between 0 and λ, that will make <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;p (x)</hi> equal to <hi rend="smallcaps">λ</hi></p>
                <p>When the terms of <hi rend="italic">φ (x)</hi> are not all positive, let all the

                    to zero when a? has some intermediate value; therefore the polynome has one root
                    between 0 and X, and one binomial divisor corresponding to that root, contrary
                    to the hypothesis.</p>
                <p>It may be observed, that the converse of this proposition is not true; for a
                    polynome of even dimensions, that has such factors as (a?—α) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, (a?—α) <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi>, (a?—α) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2z</hi> ", may never become negative, although it is capable
                    of being equal to zero.</p>
                <p>5. The properties demonstrated in the last section lead to this general
                    proposition relating to the number of roots in any equation, viz. “In any
                    equation the number of all the roots is even when the dimensions are even, and
                    odd when the dimensions are odd.”</p>
                <p>For every equation has as many binomial divisors as it has roots; and if we
                    suppose an odd number of roots in an equation of even dimensions, or an even
                    number in one of odd dimensions, the last quotient, after dividing successively
                    by all the divisors, would be a polynome of odd dimensions, having at least one
                    root, which would likewise be a root of the proposed equation. Therefore the
                    number of all the roots of an equation cannot be even when the dimensions are
                    odd, nor odd when the dimensions are even.</p>
                <p>And again, since every polynome is equal to the continued product of all its
                    binomial divisors, and the quotient last found, after dividing by them all
                    successively, we obtain the following proposition, viz.: “Every rational
                    polynome is equal either to the continued product of as many binomial factors as
                    it has dimensions; or to the con- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193749444"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-9444-0322"/>, tinued product of an even or odd number of such
                    factors, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> according as the dimensions of the
                    polynome are even or &lt; odd, and a polynome of even dimensions, which, having
                    no binomial factors, is always positive, whatever value be substituted for the
                    unknown quantity.”</p>
                <p>6. When several of the binomial factors of an equation are equal to one another,
                    it is said to have so many equal roots. In this case the equation can be divided
                    a number of times successively by the same binomial divisor. Thus, an equation
                    which is twice divisible by <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> or, which is the same thing, once by <hi rend="italic"
                    >(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> α) ʹ <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>, has two
                    roots equal to <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if it can be
                    divided by <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >a~)</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> it has
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> roots equal to <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></p>
                <p>The most obvious way of finding the conditions on which the equality of the roots
                    depends would therefore be to expand the divisor (a? — <hi rend="italic"
                    >a)</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi> by the binomial theorem, and then
                    divide the equation by it; for, after the integral quotient is obtained, the
                    required conditions will be found by making the several parts of the remainder
                    sé-parately equal to zero. The number of the conditions found in this manner is
                    equal to the exponent of the divisor; for of so many parts will the remainder of
                    the division consist. But, in a complex operation, it is difficult to ascertain
                    the remainder; and, besides, it is not necessary to consider all the equations
                    obtained by this process, because both the number and the value of the equal
                    roots can be found by means of two of them only.</p>
                <p>The inconveniences just mentioned will be avoided by proceeding in the following
                    manner: Let the equation be <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">+ Ax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                    = 0; then, if it be divisible by <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic">a)</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi><hi

                    >n</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi> dimensions; and we may

                <p>In these expressions, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> may have any value whatever; and
                    therefore the equality between them will still subsist if we substitute <hi

                    being any arbitrary number; therefore the expression</p>
                <p>(a?+z) <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> + A(ae + ø <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> —

                <p>We may therefore lay down the following rule for finding all the double, triple,
                    &amp;c. divisors of any given polynôme X: “Find R, the greatest common measure
                    of X and Y, and resolve it into its elementary factors; then each of these
                    factors will be contained in X once more than in R.”</p>
                <p>7. If it be required to find how many of the roots of an equation are positive,
                    and how many are negative, we have for this purpose the rule first published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Geometry</hi> of Descartes. This celebrated rule seems to
                    have been discovered by induction; at least its author gave no demonstration of
                    it, and disputes arose about its true import. It was demonstrated for the first
                    time by Du Gua, in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Paris</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but many other demonstrations of it have
                    since appeared, of which that of Segner, in the <hi rend="italic"

                    not only the most simple, but probably the most simple that will ever be
                    invented.</p>
                <p>Segner deduced the rule of Descartes from the following analytical proposition,
                    viz.</p>
                <p>“If any rational polynome be multiplied by <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi

                    the changes from one sign to another, from + to—1, and from — to + 1, will be at
                    least one more in the product than in the given polynome; and if it be
                    multiplied by <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">+ a,</hi> the
                    successions of the same sign, of + to + and of— to — 1, will be at least one
                    more.”</p>

                    will have the same signs with the respective terms of the proposed polynome,
                    except when a co-efficient in the second line is greater than the one above it,
                    and likewise has a contrary sign; the sign of the last term of the product being
                    always the same with the sign of the last term of the second line. Now,
                    beginning on the left hand, pass over the terms of the first line, so long as
                    they have the same si&lt;ms with the terms of the product. When this ceases to
                    be the case, the signs in the product will be the same as in the second line,
                    and contrary to those in the first line; wherefore descend to the second line,
                    and pass along its terms till the signs in the product are again the same as
                    those in the first line, and then ascend to that line. Continue thus descending
                    and ascending alternately till all the terms in both lines are taken in. At the
                    conclusion, it is evident that the descendings are always one more than the
                    ascendings, because the passing from one line to another both begins and ends
                    with descending.</p>
                <p>If we descend from r±z <hi rend="italic">Ax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    n</hi> in the first line, to =p <hi rend="italic">Aax</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in
                    the second line, it is evident that the signs of ∑±= Aae <hi rend="superscript">
                    n</hi> and ≡±z <hi rend="italic">Bx</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> in
                    the first line will be the same, both being contrary to the sign of rq= <hi
                    rend="italic">Aax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >~∙</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> in the second line. Therefore, in
                    the given polynome, the first and second terms have the same sign. But in the
                    product the like terms have contrary sighs; for the second term of the product
                    has the same sign with ∑±∑ <hi rend="italic">Ax</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> n</hi> in the first line, and the third term of the product has
                    the same sign with =p <hi rend="italic">Aax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    n</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in the second line.
                    Thus it appears that a variation from one sign to another is introduced in the
                    product, instead of a continuation of the same sign that takes place in the
                    given polynome; and the same thing will happen at every descending.</p>
                <p>In ascending from the second line to the first, there may either be a
                    continuation of the product instead of a variation in the given polynome, or the
                    contrary; but one of these two must take place.</p>
                <p>Now, so long as we keep on the first line, the signs in the product are the same
                    with those of the given polynôme; and, so long as we keep on the second line,
                    the signs in the product are contrary to those in the polynôme. In both cases,
                    therefore, the variations from + to —-1, and from — to + 1, are the same in the
                    product and in the polynome. Every descending introduces a variation in the
                    product, instead of a continuation that takes place in the polynome; and
                    although it be supposed that every ascending introduces a continuation in the
                    product instead of a variation that exists in the polynome, yet, on the whole,
                    the variations introduced must be one more than the continuations, because the
                    descendings are one more than the ascendings.</p>
                <p>Again, if the given polynome be multiplied by <hi rend="italic">x + a,</hi> the
                    product will be the sum of these two lines, viz.</p>

                    have the same signs; and, as before, the signs in the product will be the same
                    with the signs of the proposed polynome, unless when a co-efficient m the second
                    line is greater than the one above it, and ιkewise has a contrary sign; the sign
                    of the last term of t e product being always the same with the sign of the ast
                    term in the second line. Now, if we pass along all e terms of both lines,
                    descending from the first line to e second, when the signs in the product change
                    from <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> *ng the same with those in the given
                    polynome, to be l’r <hi rend="superscript"> nt</hi> l’ <hi rend="superscript">
                    ar</hi> y <hi rend="superscript"> t0</hi> them; and ascending from the second
                    line to <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> rst, when the signs in the product change
                    from being con rary to those in the polynome, to be the same with them; it is
                    evident thatthe descendings will be one more than the ascendings, as in the
                    former case.</p>
                <p>If we descend from =±= <hi rend="italic">Ax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    n</hi> in the first line, to <hi rend="italic">∙A=,Aax</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> in the second line, the two
                    terms r±∑Ax <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> and ∑±r <hi rend="italic">Bx</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in the first
                    line will have different signs; for, on account of the descending, =±z <hi
                    rend="italic">Bx</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> has a contrary sign to the term ±
                    <hi rend="italic">Aax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> below it, and, consequently, to <hi
                    rend="italic">→=,Ax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> in the first line.
                    Therefore the second and third terms in the polynome have different signs. But
                    the like terms in the product have the same sign; for the second term in the
                    product has the same sign with →- A .τ- <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> in the
                    first line; and the third term of the product has the same sign with r±∑ <hi
                    rend="italic">Aax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in the second line. Thus there is a
                    continuation of the same sign introduced in the product, instead of a variation
                    from one sign to another that takes place in the polynome; and the same thing is
                    true at every descending.</p>
                <p>In ascending from the second line to the first, there may either be a variation
                    in the product instead of a continuation that exists in the polynome, or the
                    contrary. But one of these two must take place.</p>
                <p>Now it is evident that, except at the descendings and ascendings, there is the
                    same number of continuations of the same sign, and the same number of variations
                    from one sign to another, in the product and in the given polynome. Every
                    descending introduces a continuation in the product instead of a variation
                    existing in the polynome. And even if we suppose that every ascending introduces
                    a variation in the product instead of a continuation that takes place in the
                    polynome, yet, on the whole, there will be one continuation more in the product
                    than in the polynome, because the descendings are one more than the ascendings.
                    .</p>
                <p>In the preceding demonstration, it is supposed that all the ascendings have a
                    contrary effect to the descendings, by which means there is introduced in the
                    product the least possible number of variations from one sign to another in the
                    one case, and the least possible number of continuations of the same sign in the
                    other. But if, in the first case, we suppose that, at one ascending, there is a
                    variation in the product, and a continuation in the polynome, this will add one
                    to the variations in the product, and one to the continuations in the polynome;
                    so that the variations in the product will now exceed those in the polynôme by
                    three, namely, by two more than in the circumstances supposed in the
                    demonstration. And if we extend the like reasoning to two, three, &amp;c.
                    ascendings, the variations in the product will exceed those in the polynome
                    respectively by five, seven, &amp;c. The like conclusion is evidently true of
                    the second case, <hi rend="italic">mutatis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mutandis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence the preceding proposition, when
                    it is generalized as much as it can be, may be thus enunciated: “If any rational
                    polynome be multiplied by <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> the variations from one sign to another in the product
                    will exceed those in the polynome by one, or three, or five, or by some odd
                    number; and if it be multiplied by <hi rend="italic">x + a,</hi> the
                    continuations of the same sign in the product will exceed those in the polynome
                    by one, or three, or five, or by some odd number.”</p>
                <p>Now, if we conceive that any rational polynome is resolved into its binomial
                    factors, there will be a factor of the form <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> for every positive root, and one of
                    the form <hi rend="italic">x + a</hi> for every negative root; and when all the
                    factors are multiplied together in order to reproduce the polynome, it follows,
                    from what has been proved, that the product will contain at least one change
                    from + to —∙, or from — to + 1, for every factor of the form <hi rend="italic"
                    >χ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a,</hi> or for every positive
                    root; and at least one succession of + to + , or of — to — 1, for every factor
                    of the form <hi rend="italic">χ + a,</hi> or for every negative root. Hence this
                    rule, viz. “An <pb break="no" facs="nls:193749470" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9470-0324"
                    />equation cannot have more positive roots than it has variations from one sign
                    to another, nor more negative roots than it has continuations of the same
                    sign.”</p>
                <p>In general, this rule merely points out limits which the number of the positive
                    and negative roots of an equation cannot exceed. But it gives no criterion by
                    which we can certainly know that an equation has even one positive or one
                    negative root, much less does it ascertain the exact number of each kind.</p>
                <p>But if the proposed equation can be completely resolved into real binomial
                    factors; in which case the total number of its rootswill be equal to its
                    dimensions, and consequently to the sum of all the variations from one sign to
                    another, and of all the continuations of the same sign; it is evident that the
                    number of the positive roots will be precisely equal to that of the variations,
                    and the number of the negative roots precisely equal to . that of the
                    continuations. In this case, therefore, and in this case only, the rule of
                    Descartes is perfect, ascertaining the exact number of each kind of roots in the
                    proposed equation.</p>
                <p>We subjoin some consequences that result from the principles laid down.</p>
                <p>“If a polynome <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (a?) of <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    dimensions be multiplied by <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">x + a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and, in the first case, if the number of variations from one sign to another be
                    augmented by the odd number <hi rend="italic">2i</hi> + 1; or, in the second
                    case, if the number of continuations of the same sign be augmented by <hi
                    rend="italic">2i</hi> + 1; then the total number of the roots, positive and
                    negative, of the proposed polynome, cannot be greater than <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 2?’.”</p>
                <p>For, when the multiplier is <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> let <hi rend="italic">m</hi> denote the number of the

                    (x)</hi>; then <hi rend="italic">m + 2i</hi> + 1 will be the total number of
                    variations in the product (a?— <hi rend="italic">a) × f (x)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> consequently the total number of continuations in <hi

                    But a polynome cannot have more negative roots than it has continuations of the

                    >(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a) × f</hi> (a?) cannot be
                    greater than <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 2z. Now, the two polynomes <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> (a?) and <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a) × f (x)</hi> have the same negative roots; and hence the number
                    of the negative roots of <hi rend="italic">f (χ)</hi> cannot exceed <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> 2z. But the number of the positive roots <hi rend="italic"
                    >off (x)</hi> cannot exceed <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    consequently the total number of the roots of <hi rend="italic">f (x)</hi>
                    cannot be greater than <hi rend="italic">m + n</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">2i</hi><hi

                    >—</hi> 2z. And the proposition may be demonstrated in a similar manner when the
                    multiplier is <hi rend="italic">x + a.</hi> “It one or several consecutive terms
                    of an equation be wanting, and if the next terms on each side of those wanting
                    have the same sign, the equation cannot have as many roots as it has
                    dimensions.”</p>
                <p>Let the equation be P + Q = 0, P and Q denoting the two parts on each side of the
                    terms wanting. Having multiplied P + Q by <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the product will be <hi
                    rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a)</hi> P + <hi
                    rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a)</hi> Q; and it
                    is evident that we may consider P, Q, (a? — α) P, (a? — <hi rend="italic"
                    >a)</hi> Q as separate polynomes; hence, in each of the polynômes <hi
                    rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a)</hi> P and <hi
                    rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a)</hi> Q, there
                    will be at least one more variation from one sign to another than there is in P
                    and Q. Again, in the polynome P + Q, there will be a continuation of the same
                    sign in passing from P to Q; because the last term of P is supposed to have the
                    same sign with the first term of Q. On the other hand, because the last term of
                    <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> α</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> P has a contrary sign to the last
                    term of P; and the first term of <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> ae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a)</hi> Q, the same
                    sign with the first term of Q, it follows that, in the polynome <hi
                    rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a) P + (x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi>
                    Q, there will be a variation from one sign to another in passing from <hi
                    rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a)</hi> P to (a?
                    — α) Q. Therefore, on the whole, there will be at least three variations from
                    one si&lt; <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> n to another in <hi rend="italic"
                    >(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a)</hi> P + <hi rend="italic"
                    >(x</hi> — <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi>) Q, <hi rend="subscript"> mo</hi> re
                    than there is in P + Q. Consequently, by the last proposition, the num-: ber of
                    all the roots of the proposed equation must be at least two less than its
                    dimensions.</p>
                <p>8. An important inquiry is, to find how many roots, that] is, real roots, there
                    are in any proposed equation. Muchι has been written on this subject, but not
                    very successful.! ly. No general method has been found that is practically <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> useful. Many <hi rend="italic">criteria</hi> have
                    been contrived, by means of which we can certainly discover that roots are
                    wanting ⅛ an equation, although we cannot infer the existence of the roots when
                    the same criteria fail. But great value cannot be attached to such rules, since
                    they are neither sufficient guides in practice, nor have much tendency to throw
                    light on the theory.</p>
                <p>Waring first, and nearly about the same time Lagrange, proposed a method which is
                    successful in finding the conditions necessary in order that an equation have as
                    many roots as it has dimensions, and which in all cases points out a limit that
                    the number of the roots cannot exceed. This is effected by an auxiliary
                    equation, and merely by the signs of its co-efficients, without requiring the
                    computation of any of its roots. This procedure answers very well for equations
                    of the third and fourth degrees; and it has even been extended by Waring to
                    those of the fifth degree; but in this last case the calculation is very long,
                    and would be altogether impracticable in the higher orders of equations. It is
                    also not a little probable that this rule employs more conditions than are
                    absolutely necessary for determining the point in question; there being great
                    reason to think that some of them are implied in the rest, and are deducible
                    from them. The method here alluded to depends upon the theory of trinomial
                    divisors; and as it is much referred to by algebraists of the present day, we
                    shall, in a subsequent part of this article, briefly explain the principles on
                    which it is founded.</p>
                <p>There is also another way of finding the number of real roots in an equation,
                    which is general for all orders, and requires the solution of such equations
                    only as are of lower dimensions than the one proposed. As to practical utility,
                    indeed, this method is of little avail in equations passing the third and fourth
                    degrees, or at most the fifth degree; but it is nevertheless not without
                    interest, both because it is founded on the principles essential to the inquiry,
                    and because it leads to some useful properties. Algebraists differ from one
                    another in their exposition of this method. Some derive it from the theory of
                    Harriot, namely, that every rational polynome is the product of as many binomial
                    factors as it has dimensions; in which manner of proceeding the impossible roots
                    are the occasion of uncertainty and embarrassment. Others, again, deduce it from
                    the variations of magnitude which a rational polynome undergoes when the unknown
                    quantity is made to pass through all possible degrees of increasing and
                    decreasing. This last mode of investigation seems greatly to deserve the
                    preference, being in reality the only one that is entirely unexceptionable, and
                    requires no principles foreign to the research.</p>

                    equation X' = 0 has no equal roots.</p>
                <p>The relations which the variations of the polynome X bear to the variations of
                    <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> depend upon the functions X', X" &amp;c. and
                    principally upon the first of these. If X' be positive, X will decrease as <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> decreases; if X' be negative, X will increase as a?
                    decreases; and if X ’ pass from being positive to become negative, or the
                    contrary, then <hi rend="italic">x</hi> continuing to decrease, X will change
                    from decreasing to increasing, or the contrary; that is, it will attain a
                    minimum or a maximum value. What is here said is the foundation of the method
                    taught in the differential calculus, for finding the maxima and minima of
                    algebraic quantities.</p>
                <p>Now, when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> has a value great enough, the polynome X' will
                    have the same sign with its first term, that is, it will be positive; and it
                    will continue positive so long as a? is greater than α', the greatest root of
                    the equation X' = 0; after which it will become negative. Hence, while <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> decreases to the limit <hi rend="italic">a',</hi> the
                    polynome <hi rend="italic">f (x),</hi> which is positive when <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> is sufficiently great, will continually decrease; and when <hi
                    rend="italic">x— a', f</hi> (&lt;r) will pass from decreasing to increasing, or
                    it will have a minimum value. Now if this minimum <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (α')
                    be positive, <hi rend="italic">f (x)</hi> has not decreased to zero, and the
                    given equation will have no root greater than <hi rend="italic">a'.</hi> If <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> (α') = 0, then, because the two equations X = 0 and X' = 0,
                    take place at the same time, the given equation will have two roots equal to α'.
                    (Sect. 6.) <hi rend="italic">Lastly,</hi> if∕(a') be negative, the polynôme <hi

                <p>But if we can find the roots of the equation X' = 0, which is always one degree
                    lower than the proposed equation, we can thence discover exactly both the number
                    and the limits of the roots of this last. For let α', <hi rend="italic">β',
                    γ',</hi> &amp;c. be substituted in the polynome <hi rend="italic">f (x),</hi>
                    and let the results be arranged in order, viz.</p>
                <p>∕(∞')√(n∕(7 ’)√(δ'λ&lt;X-c.=</p>
                <p>— + — +</p>
                <p>if these quantities are alternately negative and positive; the first, third,
                    fifth, &amp;c. which are all minima, having the sign <hi rend="italic"
                    >minus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the second, fourth, &amp;c. which are
                    all maxima, having the sign <hi rend="italic">plus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    then the proposed equation <hi rend="italic">f(x)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 0
                    will have just one root more than the equation X' = 0. When some of the
                    conditions fail, the roots of the proposed equation will fall short of the
                    number specified. If one maximum have the sign <hi rend="italic">minus,</hi> or
                    one minimum the sign <hi rend="italic">plus,</hi> two roots will be wanting in
                    the proposed equation; and in general as many roots will disappear, as there are
                    consecutive minima and maxima that have the same sign deducting one; unless the
                    minima and maxima precede the greatest root, or come after the least root, in
                    which cases there will be as many roots wanting as there are minima and maxima
                    that have the same sign.</p>
                <p>Since the series of functions, X, X', X", &amp;c. are derived similarly from one
                    another, we may prove, as has been done with respect to the two first, that the
                    roots of any one are contained between the roots of that which follows it.
                    Hence, if the given equation have as many roots as dimensions, every equation in
                    the series will likewise have as many roots as dimensions; and if there be roots
                    wanting in any one, there will be at least as many wanting in every equation
                    preceding it in the series.</p>
                <p>The connected equations necessarily terminate in one of the first degree, which
                    gives a limit between the two roots of the quadratic immediately before it; in
                    like manner, the roots of the quadratic are the limits of the roots of the cubic
                    preceding it; and in this manner, by going through all the successive equations,
                    we shall finally arrive at the limits of the roots of the proposed equation.
                    This process has been called <hi rend="italic">La Methode des Cascades</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but the length of the calculations renders it useless in
                    practice.</p>
                <p>The procedure explained above would enable us to find the number of roots in an
                    equation of any order, if we were in possession of rules for solving equations
                    of the inferior degrees. For want of such rules, the practical advantage that
                    can be derived from it is very limited. Mathematicians have therefore turned
                    their attention to determine the point in question in a way that should not
                    require the resolution of equations. They have sought to investigate rational
                    functions of the co-efficients, which, by means of the signs they are affected
                    with in every particular case, might indicate the number of roots the equation
                    possesses. Of this nature is the method which Du Gua has given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">de Paris,</hi> 1741, for finding
                    the conditions necessary in order that an equation have as many roots as
                    dimensions. By a process analogous to that of Du Gua, M. Cauchy, in an excellent
                    <hi rend="italic">Me-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193749496"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-9496-0326"/><hi rend="italic">moir,</hi> published in the
                    sixteenth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Journal de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l’Ecole Polytechnique,</hi> has shown not only that the total number of the
                    roots may in every case be discovered, but likewise that the numbers of the
                    positive and negative roots may be separately ascertained. The principles of
                    both these methods are to be found in the theory explained above; but as many
                    considerations of some intricacy are involved in them, a particular account of
                    them would exceed the limits of this article.</p>
                <p>In what goes before, we have supposed that all the roots of the equation X' = 0
                    are unequal; and in order to complete the theory, it remains to notice the
                    consequences that follow when the case is otherwise. Suppose, then, that X <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">= (x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> λ)
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × Q: And, in the first place, if λ be a root of
                    the equation <hi rend="italic">f (x) =</hi> 0, there will in reality be no
                    exception to the general conclusion; because in this case it is known that the
                    polynome <hi rend="italic">f (x)</hi> will be divisible by <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(íc</hi> —λ) <hi rend="superscript"> l+ 1</hi>. (Sect. 6.) Now, the case just
                    mentioned being set aside, if <hi rend="italic">i</hi> be an even number, the
                    polynome X', or <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> λ) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ζ</hi>. Q, will be equal to zero when <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> λ; but it will not change its sign when <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> from being less, comes to be greater than λ. Hence the
                    polynome <hi rend="italic">f (x^)</hi> will neither attain a maximum nor a
                    minimum value at the same limit; and it will have no root, either between λ and
                    the next greater root of the equation X ’ = 0, or between λ and the next less
                    root of the same equation. It appears, therefore, that when <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> is even, the number of the roots of the equation <hi rend="italic">f (x)
                    =</hi> 0, and their limits, will depend entirely upon the equation Q = 0. Again,
                    when <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is an odd number, the polynome X ʹ will be equal
                    to zero when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = λ, and it will likewise change its sign
                    when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is taken on contrary sides of that limit:
                    Consequently, when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = λ, the polynome <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> (a?) will be a maximum or a minimum; and the nature of its roots will
                    depend upon the equation <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> λ) Q
                    = 0. It is evident that we may extend the same conclusions to any two adjacent
                    equations in the series,</p>
                <p>X = 0, X' = 0, X" = 0, X'* = 0, &amp;c. provided the one which stands lower in
                    the series is reducible to the form <hi rend="italic">(x</hi> — X) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> Z</hi> Q; and that <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> λ is not a common divisor of both. We may likewise draw this general
                    inference from the principles that have been explained, viz. “If, in the series
                    of connected equations, any one be found which is divisible by <hi rend="italic"
                    >(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> λ) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ζ or (a? — λ)
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2t +1</hi>, at the same time that <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> λ is not a divisor of the equation immediately
                    preceding, there will be at least <hi rend="italic">2i</hi> roots wanting in
                    this last equation, and in all that stand before it in the series.”</p>
                <p>The following not inelegant proposition is a consequence of what has just been
                    proved: “The number of the roots of an equation of <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    dimensions, in which <hi rend="italic">2i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">2i</hi> + 1,
                    consecutive terms, are wanting, cannot be greater than <hi rend="italic"
                    >η</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 2?.”</p>
                <p>Let the equation be represented by</p>
                <p>P+ Q —0; supposing that <hi rend="italic">2i,</hi> or 2f + 1 terms, are wanting
                    between P and Q. Therefore, if the first term of Q contain <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> m</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> the last
                    term of P will contain <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ηi+2t+1</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> m + 2l + 2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"
                    > Now,</hi> in the series of equations, we shall at length arrive at one from
                    which all the quantities of Q are exterminated; which equation, if we use the
                    notation of the differential calculus, is equivalent to rf <hi
                    rend="superscript"> w+1</hi> P</p>
                <p>TT=θ5</p>
                <p>z *∙V∙ 1</p>
                <p>and it is divisible by <hi rend="italic">x</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">x</hi>: And
                    as the one im∙ mediately preceding it in the series, viz.</p>

                    rend="italic superscript"> m</hi><hi rend="italic">dx</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> m</hi><hi rend="italic">’</hi> is not divisible by <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> it follows, from what has been shown that there will be at
                    least <hi rend="italic">2i</hi> roots wanting in this last equation, and in all
                    those that stand before it; consequently the proposed equation cannot have more
                    than <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">2i</hi>
                    root⅛</p>
                <p>From this we learn that it is not always possible, a least by any operations with
                    real quantities, to transforn an equation into another in which any proposed
                    numbet of the intermediate terms shall be wanting. For the terms to be taken
                    away may be such that the transformée equation could not have the same number of
                    real roots a the one given; but it is impossible, without introducing imaginary
                    quantities, to transform an equation with a certain number of real roots into
                    another with a differen number of such roots.</p>
                <p>9. In what goes before, we have sought for the root and binomial divisors in the
                    nature of the polynome. We are now to take an inverted view of the subject, and
                    to consider a rational polynome as produced by the continued multiplication of
                    as many binomial factors as it ha-dimensions; from which source there arises an
                    interestiι set of properties.</p>
                <p>If we take the words root and binomial factor strictl; in the sense in which we
                    have hitherto used them, and as denoting real quantities only, nothing is more
                    certain than that all polynomes cannot be generated by binomial factors. But it
                    will afterwards be proved that every rational polynome can be completely
                    exhausted by binomial and trinomial divisors; and if we admit the resolution of
                    every trinomial divisor into two imaginary factors, we shall arrive, with all
                    the rigour of which the investigation is capable, at the genesis of equations
                    supposed by Harriot, which represents them as entirely composed of binomial
                    factors, possible or impossible. Besides, in extending to all equations the
                    conclusions obtained from the manner of generating them, it may be observed that
                    the properties so obtained, being ultimately expressed in functions of the
                    co-efficients from which the roots and generating factors have disappeared, are
                    in a manner independent of the method of investigation. Such is the structure of
                    the language of algebra, that the conclusions to which it leads, although
                    deduced by reasoning from a hypothesis not strictly general, are nevertheless
                    true in all cases, when they are finally disengaged from what is peculiar in the
                    analysis.</p>
                <p>Suppose a polynome, as <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> ^- A&lt; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>)√'- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> + A&lt;¾ <hi

                    rend="italic">n</hi> factors,</p>
                <p>(a? — <hi rend="italic">a) . (x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">β)
                    (x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">γ)(j</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> δ), &amp;c. then, by actually multiplying the factors, and equating the
                    like terms of the equivalent expressions, we shall get</p>
                <p>A^ŋ — α + ∕3 + y + d+ , &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A^“) <hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">as + aγ</hi> +, &amp;c. + <hi
                    rend="italic">βγ</hi> +, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A&lt; <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>) = <hi rend="italic">aβγ + aβο</hi> +,
                    &amp;c. + <hi rend="italic">βγδ</hi> + , &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A^) <hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">aβγδ</hi> +, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>&amp;c.</p>
                <p>Hence it appears that the co-efficient of the second term of the polynome, or —
                    A^ŋ, is equal to the sum of all the roots with their signs changed; the
                    co-efficient o the third term, or + A^ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∖ to the
                    sum of all the products of every two roots; the co-efficient of the fourth term,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193749509" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9509-0327"/><hi

                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi>), to the sum of all the products of every three roots
                    with their signs changed, and so on, the signs of the roots being always changed
                    in the products of an odd number; and finally, the last term is the product of
                    all the roots with their signs changed or not, according as their number is odd
                    or even.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the ultimate product of the binomial factors will always be
                    the same, in whatever order they ire multiplied; and hence the có-efficients of
                    the polynôme will consist of the same products, however the roots be
                    interchanged among one another. Expressions of the kind just mentioned, which
                    have constantly the same value, whatever change is made in the order of the
                    quantities they contain, are called <hi rend="italic">invariable functions</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">sym-metrixal functions·</hi> The .co-efficients of an
                    equation are the most simple symmetrical functions of the roots, from which it
                    may be required, on the one hand to deduce all other functions of the like kind,
                    and on the other to go back to the roots themselves. Most inquiries relating to
                    equations are connected with one or other of these two sroblems; of which the
                    first, like most direct methods, is attended with little difficulty, and has
                    been completely solved; while the other, past equations of the fourth decree,
                    has eluded all the attempts of algebraists.</p>
                <p>After the co-efficients of the polynome, the next most simple symmetrical
                    functions of the roots are the sums of the squares, cubes, &amp;c. In the
                    universal arithmetic of Sir Isaac Newton, a very elegant rule is given for
                    computing the sum of any proposed powers of the roots; and as this rule is a
                    fundamental point in the theory of equations, we subjoin an elementary
                    investigation of it.</p>

                <p>for if we multiply the series on the right-hand side of the sign of equality, by
                    the denominator of the fraction on the other side, and then equate the
                    co-efficients of the product to the like co-efficients of the numerator, we
                    shall obtain the very formulae set down above. Hence the sums of the powers of
                    the roots expressed in terms of the coefficients of the polynome will be found
                    by developing the fraction in a series. In effecting the development different

                <p>ducing a general formula for the sum when the products contain any proposed
                    number of different powers; but this would lead to calculations incompatible
                    with the length of this article; and it may be doubted whether the use of such a
                    formula is preferable in any cases likely to occur in practice, to the
                    application of the principles here laid down.</p>
                <p>The theory of symmetrical functions is of the most extensive use in every branch
                    of the doctrine of equations. Thus, if it be required to form an equation, the
                    roots of which shall be any combinations of the roots of a given equation; it is
                    manifest that the co-efficients of the equation sought will be symmetrical
                    functions of the roots of the given equation; and hence they may be found by
                    calculating these functions in terms of the co-efficients of the given
                    equation.</p>
                <p>The theory of symmetrical functions is also of use in approximating to the roots
                    of numerical equations. Sir Isaac Newton seems to have had this application in
                    view in giving his rule for computing the sums of the like powers of the roots.
                    He observes that the powers of a great number increase in a much higher ratio
                    than the same powers of less numbers; and hence the 2r <hi rend="superscript">
                    th</hi> power of the greatest root of an equation will approach nearer to the
                    sum of the 2r <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> powers of all the roots as <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> is greater. Wherefore, neglecting the distinction between
                    positive and negative roots, if we calculate Ss <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>,
                    and then extract its 2r <hi rend="superscript"> th</hi> root, we shall have an
                    approximation to the root of the equation greatest in point of magnitude; and
                    the approximation will be so much more accurate as <hi rend="italic">τ</hi> is
                    greater.</p>
                <p>But there is a more convenient way of approximating to the greatest and least
                    roots of an equation, by means of symmetrica! functions. For, since</p>
                <p>S,, <hi rend="subscript"> +l</hi> =√ + <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">r a</hi></p>
                <p>Now, a being the greatest root, the fraction on the righthand side will approach
                    to unit when <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is sufficiently</p>
                <p>S i large, in which case will be nearly equal to a.</p>
                <p>Hence, if we compute a series of consecutive sums, viz. S, &gt; S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r+1</hi>, S <hi rend="subscript"> r+2</hi>, &amp;c.; the

                <p>In like manner, if we take the sums of the negative powers of the roots, we shall

                <p>But the mode of investigation we have followed is rigorous; and it has the
                    advantage of leading to the true import of the imaginary sign, and of putting in
                    a clear light its real effect in analytical operations. The real use of this
                    sign may be shortly described by saying that it performs for even and odd
                    functions the same office that the negative sign does for ordinary functions; in
                    other words, when, by means of the ordinary operations of analysis, it has been
                    proved that an even or odd function of an indeterminate quantity is equal to
                    zero, it is by means of the impossible sign that the same equation is extended
                    to the case when the square of the indeterminate quantity is negative. Every
                    function of the indeterminate quantity <hi rend="italic">x</hi> may be thus
                    represented, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">&lt;p (x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> z</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">) ∑±∑</hi><hi rend="italic">χ</hi> Y (a? <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>); and the substitution of xV ʹ —1 in place of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    has no other effect than to change the preceding expression into the one
                    following, viz.</p>
                <p>p ( — a?) ∑±z <hi rend="italic">χ</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> 1 . Ψ (—a <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>); and from this it is obvious,
                    that the same operations which in the one case, lead us to the equations p (⅛r
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) = 0and χψ(r) = 0, will, in the other,
                    necessarily conduct us to the equations <hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic

                    (— <hi rend="italic">χ</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> z</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">) =</hi> 0. It i <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> t <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> be observed, too, that the truth of the two latter
                    equations is involved in that of the former. For the former equations cannot be
                    generally true for all values of <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> unless they are identical, or
                    consist of equal quantities with opposite signs that mutually destroy one
                    another; in which case the latter equations will also be identical. The sign of
                    impossibility, as it has been called, is therefore one as truly significant as
                    any other in analysis. It has, indeed, no consistent meaning when we consider it
                    as only affecting <hi rend="italic">χ,</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> the
                    indeterminate quantity to which it is joined; but it becomes perfectly
                    intelligible when we contemplate the real changes produced by it in the
                    functions of even and odd dimensions, in which its conclusions are always
                    ultimately expressed. When the true import and real effect of the imaginary sign
                    are clearly apprehended, the truth of its conclusion is no longer doubtful or
                    mysterious, but follows as a necessary consequence of a fundamental principle of
                    analytical language. Proceeding on this principle, we may even lay aside the
                    imaginary character; and, in every particular case, with the assistance of a
                    proper notation, arrive, by the ordinary operations, at the same conclusion to
                    which it leads, as has been done in the preceding instance. It is to be observed
                    further, that the imaginary arithmetic is not merely a short method of
                    calculation convenient in practice, and that it may be dispensed with; it is
                    strictly a necessary branch of analysis, without which, or some equivalent mode
                    of investigation, that science would be extremely imperfect. The equations <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;ţ&gt;</hi> (a? <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) = 0 and <hi
                    rend="italic">xi</hi> (x&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) = 0, are
                    unchangeable by any operations with the signs commonly received, by the use of
                    which alone it is impossible to deduce, in a direct manner, the related
                    equations <hi rend="italic">φ (</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">) =</hi> 0 and <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> Y (— x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) = 0: although the
                    latter are equally true, of as frequent occurrence, and as extensive
                    application, as the former. Without the impossible sign the operations of
                    algebra would, therefore, be defective; since there are analytical truths that
                    could not be investigated in a direct manner by means of thy elementary signs
                    usually admitted. It is to supply this defect that the imaginary arithmetic has
                    been introduce, and has grown up to be an extensive branch of analysis,
                    advancing at first by slow steps, because the true inψ <hi rend="superscript">
                    ρr</hi> of the character it employs, and the real effect of its ope rations,
                    were neither clearly perceived nor fully <hi rend="superscript"> on er</hi>
                    stood. But having premised what is conducive to our present purpose, we proceed
                    to the investigation o <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> trinomial divisors of
                    rational functions. .</p>
                <p>11. Every polynome of odd dimensions having at easθ one binomial factor, it may,

                <p>The most interesting proposition in the branch of the subject under
                    consideration, is to prove that every polynome of even dimensions has a
                    quadratic divisor, either the form <hi rend="italic">(u</hi> + α) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — <hi rend="italic">τ</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> which admits two real binomial
                    factors, or of the form (w — α) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + τ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, which has two ιaginary factors. By the preceding
                    transformation this ’ oposition is brought under two cases, according as <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> is affected with the sign <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">plus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the quadratic divisor being
                    always of the form (w + α) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> 2</hi> in the first
                    case, and always of the form (w — α) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + τ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> in the other case; a distinction that agrees with
                    what was before proved, Sect. 8.</p>
                <p>Now the first of these cases is attended with no difficulty. For two values of
                    <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> one negative and one positive, ay be found that will
                    satisfy the equation, Sect. 4.</p>

                    than <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.</hi> And it is evident that the polynome will be
                    negative for every value of λ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> that lies between
                    any odd root and the next even root, that is, for every value between these
                    limits, viz.</p>
                <p>λ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> &gt; tan. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>

                <p><hi rend="italic">n</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, an indefinite number of values of λ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> may be
                    found that will make the polynome negative.</p>
                <p>Having assumed such a value of λ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, let any positive
                    number whatever be substituted for <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> and N will be
                    converted into a rational function of α; the greatest power of α, or α <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2s 1</hi>, being odd, and having a negative co-efficient;
                    and the term which does not contain <hi rend="italic">a</hi> being positive.
                    Wherefore at least one positive value of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> may be found
                    that will satisfy the equation N — 0; and, as has already been observed, this
                    value of α will be such as to make λ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> α <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — sa positive quantity. It is possible indeed that,
                    in the equation N = 0, there may be several values of α for every assumed value
                    of <hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but we here confine our
                    attention to the least positive value, which is distinguished by this
                    circumstance, that it vanishes with the absolute term of the equation, or with
                    <hi rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whereas, when ∙s is equal to
                    zero, all the other roots of the equation N = 0 have finite values depending
                    upon the given co-efficients.</p>
                <p>Now, if we suppose 5 to increase from zero to infinity, and assume two values, s,
                    and s + <hi rend="italic">os,</hi> very near one another, according to what has
                    been proved, we shall have the corresponding values α and α + δa, such, that the
                    equation N = 0 will be satisfied by substituting both <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    and α, and likewise s + os and α + δα. Hence, because N = 0, and δN = 0, we get
                    t∕N <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>, dN „ <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi> ——. oα + ——.
                    os = 0, aa <hi rend="italic">ds</hi></p>
                <p>A and, fe = —∕&lt;∕N∖ χ <hi rend="superscript"> rf</hi> 2L, V⅛7 *</p>
                <p>Again, if we substitute first 5 and α, and then <hi rend="italic">s</hi> ψ <hi
                    rend="italic">į</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a

                <p>The quantity s remaining invariable, if we make α = 0, the function N will be

                    function will continue positive, while α increases from zero to the least root
                    of the equation N = 0. At this limit N is first equal to zero, and then becomes
                    negative; it must, therefore, be decreasing, and conse∙ quently -~~ is negative.
                    It may indeed happen, that, for particular values of <hi rend="italic">s,</hi>
                    the co-efficients of N may be such, <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> JVΓ</p>
                <p>that N and —=— shall be both equal to zero at the same <hi rend="italic">da</hi>
                    time; but, in such cases, it will readily appear that and δM will likewise be
                    equal to zero. Wherefore δM will be negative; at least, if it become equal to
                    zero for any particular values of s and α, it cannot become positive. It
                    follows, therefore, that the function M itself will be in· variably negative,
                    while <hi rend="italic">s</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> increase together
                    from zero to be infinitely great.</p>
                <p>Now assume a series of values of 5 increasing from zero without limit, viz.</p>

                <p>and having substituted these in the function N, find, by means of the equation N

                <p>In the preceding demonstration it is supposed that M increases without limit, as

                    will coincide nearly with the terms containing the highest powers of s and α,
                    when these quantities are very great; and ultimately the functions may be

                <p>By a similar mode of reasoning, we may likewise prove the former case of the
                    proposition, when <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is negative. In this case the
                    quadratic divisor is (u — α) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — τ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; and if we proceed as before, or, which is the same
                    thing, if <hi rend="italic">we</hi> hange the signs of <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    and r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> in the equations (C) already obtained, and

                <p>N = 0.</p>
                <p>Now, by pursuing the steps of the foregoing analysis, we may prove, first, that,
                    for every assumed value of τ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, a negative value of
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> may be found, which will satisfy the equation N = 0;
                    and, secondly, that when the values which satisfy the equation N = 0 are
                    substituted in the function M, the results will be invariably positive; whence
                    it follows that a positive value of τ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and a
                    negative value of <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> may be found that will satisfy both
                    the equations, whatever be the magnitude of <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> The
                    analogy between the two cases is thus placed in a strong light; and a little
                    reflection will even bring us to this conclusion, that in reality the one case
                    is a necessary consequence of the other. For since α and r <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> depend only upon <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and the given co-efficients of the polynome,
                    they will be functions of <hi rend="italic">y;</hi> wherefore, in the equations
                    of the first case, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi> + M = 0,</p>
                <p>N = 0,</p>
                <p>α being negative, and r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> positive, we may suppose —
                    α <hi rend="italic">= y&lt;l&gt; (y)</hi> and τ <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">— y</hi> these values being such as to render each of
                    the equations identical; and then the quadratic divisor <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(m</hi> —α) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — τ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    will become f ∙ ì <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>ļ w + <hi rend="italic">y&lt;p(y)&gt;</hi>-ŵ)·</p>
                <p>But, because the foregoing equations become identical by the substitution of the
                    values mentioned, it is a necessary consequence that the equations of the second
                    case, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">y</hi> + M = 0,</p>
                <p>N = 0, in which the signs of <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, are
                    contrary to what they were in the former equations, will likewise be identical,
                    when — α = <hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">y&lt;p (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">y)</hi> and r <hi rend="superscript">

                    >∙y)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the quadratic divisor, (w — α) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, will now
                    become</p>
                <p>•I“ —7p(- <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕)1 <hi rend="italic">+ yv(-y)∙</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, when the quadratic divisor of the first case is expressed in terms of <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> we have only to change the sign of that quantity, in order
                    to have the quadratic divisor of the second case. It is not difficult to
                    perceive, that what has now been proved is nothing more than another application
                    of the principle employed in Sect. 10; a principle which is the real foundation
                    of the imaginary arithmetic, with the processes of which the preceding
                    investigations are intimately connected. None but real quantities have occurred
                    in the analysis we have pursued, because we have sought to investigate r <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, which is always rational; whereas, if we had
                    proposed to find <hi rend="italic">τ,</hi> we should inevitably have been led to
                    the real quantity √ <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in the one case, and to the
                    impossible quantity √— <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in the other. These few
                    observations are made for the purpose of throwing light upon a part of analysis
                    which is certainly obscure in its principles, although there is no question that
                    it is a useful, and even a necessary branch of the art of calculation. A fuller
                    elucidation of the subject would be unsuitable to this place; but enough has
                    been said to show that we must seek in the principles of analysis itself for the
                    explanation of the operations it employs; and we may with great probability
                    conclude that no satisfactory account of the imaginary calculus will ever be
                    obtained by having recourse to fanciful geometrical constructions, or to the
                    analogy between the circle and the hyperbola, or to the metaphysical
                    proposition, that all processes with general symbols, whether signifì- <pb

                    are equally entitled to be considered as demonstrative.</p>
                <p>13. Having now proved, in a rigorous manner, that every polynome of even
                    dimensions has at least one quadratic divisor of the one kind or the other, it
                    follows that it may be reduced by division to another polynome two degrees
                    lower: in like manner, this last polynome will admit of being lowered two
                    degrees more; and by repeating the same process, the first polynome will at
                    length be completely exhausted by quadratic divisors. If, therefore, we
                    recollect, that every polynome of odd dimensions has one binomial divisor, we
                    shall arrive at this general conclusion, “That every rational polynome can be
                    completely exhausted by binomial and trinomial divisors; and, consequently, that
                    it is equal to the product of a certain number of factors of the two first
                    degrees.”</p>
                <p>It appears also that the binomial factors of any polynome are such only as arise
                    from the resolution of the quadratic divisors; and they are, therefore, either
                    real or imaginary. And thus we finally obtain the following proposition, which
                    was assumed by Harriot, and is the foundation of the received theory of
                    equations, namely, “Every rational polynome has as many binominal factors, and
                    as many roots, real and imaginary, as it has dimensions.”</p>
                <p>The necessity of confirming, by a general demonstration, the assumed theory of
                    the impossible roots of equations, was early felt; and accordingly, this point
                    has engaged the attention of all the great mathematicians to whom analysis is

                    has explained and commented upon the various modes of investigation that have
                    been proposed. It will be sufficient to observe here, that all the
                    demonstrations that have appeared are either calculations with impossible
                    quantities, or they proceed upon the assumption that every equation has as many
                    roots as dimensions, and thus involve the very thing to be proved.</p>
                <p>14. The general cases in which mathematicians have been successful in resolving
                    rational functions into their trinomial factors, are confined to the theorem of
                    Cotes, and to a more general proposition of a similar kind, for which we are
                    indebted to De Moivre. These instances are of great importance in analysis, and
                    we shall therefore subjoin an investigation of them, because they are deduced in
                    a very direct manner from the method we have followed.</p>

                <p>By eliminating 5 we shall obtain an equation, viz.</p>
                <p>A = 0, in which α is the unknown quantity. As the process of elimination is
                    independent of the particular values of the co-efficients of <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> (ai), the degree of the resulting equation will be the same when the
                    polynôme <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (a?) has as many real roots as dimensions, and
                    when the case is otherwise. But when/(#) is equal to the product of <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> real binomial factors, the multiplication of every two of
                    them will form a quadratic factor. The number of such factors will,</p>
                <p>72 1</p>
                <p>therefore, be equal to <hi rend="italic">η</hi> ×—-—, which expresses all the
                    combinations made with <hi rend="italic">n</hi> things taken two and two.
                    Consequently, there will be just so many different values of α that will satisfy
                    the equation A = 0, which will, <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> 22, ļ</p>
                <p>therefore, have its exponent equal to <hi rend="italic">n</hi> × —ğ—. It thus
                    appears that the equation A = 0 rises in its dimensione very rapidly above the
                    given polynome, on which account little advantage is derived from this
                    procedure.</p>

                <p>Again, by eliminating α from the same two equations, we shall obtain one,
                    viz.</p>
                <p>S =0, in which <hi rend="italic">s is</hi> the unknown quantity. This equation,
                    which has already been alluded to (Sect. 8), rises to the same dimensions with
                    the former equation, A = 0; but it is possessed of some useful properties,
                    derived chiefly from the consideration that every positive root gives a
                    quadratic factor of the form <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>

                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + τ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> in the same
                    polynome.</p>
                <p>The quadruple of 5 is equal to the square of the difference of the two binomial
                    factors of (a ’ — α) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whence it follows that the quadruples of the

                    of the roots of <hi rend="italic">f (x) =</hi> 0. If, therefore, we put <hi

                    from this it is manifest that the co-efficients of the same equation will be

                    ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> &amp;c. or of the roots off <hi rend="italic">(x)
                    =</hi> 0. The rules formerly explained may, therefore, be employed for
                    calculating the co-efficients of S = 0; and this method of forming the equation
                    is not only more convenient than the process of eliminating, but it likewise has
                    the advantage of enabling us to find any one co-efficient separately without
                    computing the rest. Thus, if we put</p>

                <p>If we suppose the given equation <hi rend="italic">f (x) =</hi> 0 to be possessed
                    of as many real roots as dimensions, or to have <hi rend="italic">η</hi> real
                    binomial factors, the product of every two of these will be a quadratic factor
                    <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> α) <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> — <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> in which 5 is positive; wherefore, the roots
                    of S = 0 will be all real and all positive. On the other hand, when the given
                    equation <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (a ’) = 0 has not as many real roots as
                    dimensions, it will be divisible by one or more quadratic factors not resolvable
                    into real binomial factors, and in which 5 is negative; consequently, the
                    equation S = 0 will have one or more negative roots. It is, therefore, a
                    property of the auxiliary equation S — 0, that when the roots are all real they
                    are all positive, and when they are not all real some of them are negative. Now
                    the rule of Descartes will enable us to find whether the roots are all positive
                    or not; and by this means we shall discover whether the roots of the given

                    this rule: “The proposed equation/ <hi rend="italic">(χ) =</hi> 0 will have all
                    its roots real when the auxiliary equation S = 0 has as many variations from one
                    sign to another as it has dimensions, or when its terms are alternately positive
                    and negative; otherwise the proposed equation will have one or more quadratic
                    factors of the form <hi rend="italic">(x</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> α) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + <hi rend="italic">v-,</hi> but the number of such
                    factors cannot exceed the continuations of the same sign in the auxiliary
                    equation.”</p>
                <p>Again, in the equation S = 0, the polynome S is equal to a certain number of
                    binomial factors of the forms <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> —αl and <hi rend="italic"
                    >x + a,</hi> multiplied into a supplementary polynorne of even dimensions,
                    which, not being capable of having a negative value, will have its last term
                    positive (Sect. 5). It is manifest, therefore, that the last term of S = 0 will
                    be positive or negative, according as the number of factors of the form <hi
                    rend="italic">χ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> is even or
                    odd, that is, accordingas the equation has an even or odd number of real and
                    positive roots. But every two real roots in the equation ∕ <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ae) =</hi> 0 give one real and positive root in the subsidiary equation S — 0;
                    wherefore, if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> denote the number of real roots in the

                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is either one or three. In the first case, the equation
                    S = 0 will have no positive roots, and the last term will be positive; in the
                    second case, it will have three real and positive roots, and the last term will
                    be negative. Now the dimensions of S — 0 being odd, the function K^) w ill be
                    negative in the first case and positive in the second. Wherefore the given cubic
                    equation will have one real root, or three, according as the function K^ <hi

                    cases the last term is positive. In the second case the same equation has only

                    facs="nls:193749639" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9639-0337"/>numbers, we may investigate
                    the numerical value of any one root separately, by first seeking the limits
                    between which it lies, and then narrowing those limits to any required degree of
                    approximation. But this process is not what is meant by the general solution of
                    algebraical equations, which supposes that the co-efficients are denoted by
                    general symbols, and consists in finding such a function of those quantities as
                    shall, by the multiplicity of its values, represent all the roots. An
                    algebraical expression is susceptible of many values, by means of the different
                    radical quantities it contains; but these radical quantities being themselves
                    the roots of an equation, it follows that the general formula for the solution
                    of any proposed equation can be nothing more than a function of the given
                    coefficients combined with the roots of another equation.</p>
                <p>The solution of quadratic equations has been known since the origin of algebra;
                    it is found in the work of Diophantus, the first treatise on the science extant,
                    if it be not the very first that was written. The Italian mathematicians, who
                    are the founders of the modern algebra, discovered the solution of cubic and
                    biquadratic equations. The rules they invented for this purpose are, however,
                    rather the result of particular artifices than deductions from any profound
                    views of the structure of the equations they considered. In the course of the
                    last and the present centuries, the general solution of equations has been the
                    subject of almost innumerable researches by all the mathematicians of the first
                    rank; but their labours have not been successful in advancing this branch of the
                    science beyond the steps made by the first algebraists.</p>
                <p>The rules usually given for the solution of cubic and biquadratic equations are
                    to be found in all the elementary books, and it would be superfluous to repeat
                    them here. An account of the attempts that have been made to obtain a general
                    theory for solving algebraic equations would greatly exceed the limits we must
                    prescribe to ourselves. What has most impeded the progress of algebraists in
                    their researches on this subject, is the difficulty of treating it by a perfect
                    analysis, or of arriving at general conclusions by a process of reasoning
                    founded solely on the principles of the inquiry, and disengaged from particular
                    artifices of calculation, and from particular suppositions. In what follows, we
                    shall endeavour to lay before our readers the general principles on which is
                    founded all that has been successfully accomplished in this theory.</p>

                    b, c;</hi> and having interchanged these letters among one another, in all
                    possible ways, we shall get the six permutations following, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">abe, cab, bea, acb, bae, chu.</hi> the combinations that stand
                    first on the left are formed by prefixing the same letter to the permutations
                    made "ιth the other two; and those on each line are derived from one another by
                    making the last letter of one stand first in that which follows, while the other
                    two letters preserve the same order.</p>

                <p>The preceding investigation, as well as all other methods that have been proposed
                    for cubic equations, leads to the same result with the rule invented by Cardan;
                    and, like that rule, it becomes in some cases insufficient for arithmetical
                    computation, on account of the imaginary quantities that appear in the
                    expressions of the roots. What is now mentioned is not an accidental
                    circumstance, but a necessary consequence of the method of investigation
                    pursued, and of the introduction of the imaginary roots of the equation <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1 = 0. When <hi rend="italic">a, b,
                    c,</hi> are real quantities, the value of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and s will be
                    both imaginary, be-</p>
                <p>_l + √-Z3^ —1—√≡3 cause they involve <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and g <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, or — and ģ</p>
                <p>In this case, therefore, although the three roots of the proposed equation are
                    all real, yet the algebraic expressions of them are all imaginary, and useless
                    for the purpose of numerical calculation; and the former circumstance is
                    precisely the reason of the latter. On the other hand, when one root <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is real and the other two imaginary, the impossible
                    quantities destroy one another in the expressions of <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> which are, therefore, real quantities; and in this
                    case the algebraic formulae answer for finding the numerical values of the
                    roots. T <hi rend="underline">he distin</hi> ction here pointed out depends on
                    the radical V ’ <hi rend="italic">&lt;f</hi> —p <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>,
                    which is real or imaginary, according as the equation has one or three real
                    roots, because <hi rend="italic">q</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    3</hi> is always positive in the first case and negative in the second.</p>
                <p>Much labour and thought have been bestowed in order to free the formulae for the
                    roots of cubic equations from the imaginary expressions that render them unfit
                    for arithmetical computation. In particular instances the difficulty disappears;
                    namely, when the radical quantities are perfect cubes, in which cases the
                    impossible parts of the cube roots destroy one another, so as to leave none but
                    real quantities in the expressions of the roots of the equation. And, by
                    expanding the radical quantities, we may in all cases obtain the roots of a
                    cubic equation in series of an infinite number of terms free from the imaginary
                    sign. But when it is required to transform the formulae for the case of a cubic
                    equation with three real roots, into finite expressions free from impossible
                    quantities, and to do so without employing any other than the received notations
                    of algebra, all attempts to solve the problem have led to equations in the same
                    circumstances with the one proposed, and have ended in bringing back the same
                    difficulty; in so much that equations of the description mentioned are said to
                    be in the irreducible case.</p>
                <p>It is, however, possible to transform the formulae for the roots of a cubic
                    equation in the irreducible case into real expressions, although not so as to
                    fulfil all the conditions above mentioned. Let <hi rend="italic">q</hi><hi

                <p>The difficulty attending the irreducible case arises from a real distinction
                    between the two subordinate classes of cubic equations, and is insurmountable by
                    the ordinar operations of algebra. There is no permanent distinctions of
                    equations belonging to the same order, when we consider their roots as positive
                    or negative; because, m any proposed equation, all the roots, or as many of th
                    <hi rend="superscript"> em</hi> as we plcase, can be changed from positive to
                    negat"' <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> &gt; by the simple artifice of increasing
                    or diminishing th <hi rend="superscript"> em</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193749665" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9665-0339"/>all by a given quantity. But
                    the case is otherwise when we consider the roots of an equation in their
                    character of real or imaginary quantities. No transformation can change an
                    equation with one real root into another with three real roots, without
                    involving the operations of the impossible arithmetic. If, therefore, we lay
                    down this condition, namely, that the formulae for the roots of equations must
                    be in a shape fit for numerical calculation, we may conclude that in fact there
                    is no resolution of equations except what consists in reducing all those of the
                    same class to some one of that class, the most simple and convenient in its form
                    that can be found. If we examine the preceding investigation, it will appear
                    that it is merely an attempt to reduce all cubic equations to the form &lt; <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> 3- A=0; and this readily succeeds without impossible
                    operations, when the proposed equation, and that with which it is compared, have
                    their roots of a similar description; and it as surely fails when the case is
                    otherwise.</p>
                <p>In geometry, where the relations of the magnitudes under consideration are never
                    lost sight of, there is no tendency to refer the solution of a problem to a
                    class to which it does not belong. The ancient geometer could never be in danger
                    of applying the problem for finding two mean proportionals to a case that can be
                    constructed only by the trisection of an angle. The modern analyst, dismissing
                    the original magnitudes of his problem, and reducing all possible relations to
                    equations in abstract numbers, is apt to overlook distinctions, and sometimes to
                    waste his labour, in seeking to accomplish what a due separation of cases would
                    show to be impossible. There is the same distinction between the class of cubic
                    equations with one real root, and that with three real roots, that there is
                    between the two geometrical problems alluded to above; and the algebraist who
                    attempts, by means of the ordinary operations of his art, to transform Cardan’s
                    formula so as to make it apply to the irreducible case, is precisely in the same
                    situation with the geometer who should set about trisecting an angle by finding
                    two mean proportionals.</p>
                <p>The power and force of the algebraic method does not consist in breaking down
                    real distinctions, but in connecting, by sure and general principles, many
                    truths which in geometry are joined only by vague analogies, and even have no
                    affinity at all. This advantage is derived chiefly from the doctrine of negative
                    quantities, and from the impossible arithmetic. By means of the first, a formula
                    which is obtained by considering only one state of the lata of a problem,
                    applies, necessarily and by the very structure of analytical language, to the
                    same problem in all possible conditions of the data. On the other hand, when the
                    relations of the data vary, the geometer is obliged to subdivide his problem
                    into cases, or into other subordinate problems; and although it may be perceived
                    that great similitude prevails among all the subdivisions, yet it is impossible
                    to reduce the analogy between them to determinate rules, as is done in algebra.
                    But in the whole compass of geometry there is nothing that bears any resemblance
                    to the imaginary arithmetic. When the geometer has fixed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >determination</hi> of his problem, or ascertained the limits within which it is
                    possible, he has drawn Mine that must be the boundary of his investigation. .
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 0w</hi> it is to truths lying beyond this line that the

                <p>Again, from every one of the six foregoing combinations, four others are derived
                    by circulating the letters continually from the last place to the first; and in

                <p>In applying these formulae, it is necessary to observe, that as the quantities
                    <hi rend="italic">t, t’, f,</hi> are found by extracting ⅛ <hi rend="subscript">
                    e</hi> square root, they may each have either the sign p] <hi rend="subscript">
                    us 0r</hi> the sign minus prefixed. But all ambiguity from this cause will be
                    taken away, if it be observed that the expressions of <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,
                    d,</hi> will always give the same results, provided the signs of <hi
                    rend="italic">t, t’, t",</hi> be so determined as to satisfy the equation,</p>
                <p>⅛⅛''=(α + 6 + c+iZ) <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> + 8∑ . <hi rend="italic"

                <p>For, if we suppose that the signs of <hi rend="italic">t, t’, t’,</hi> are so
                    determined as to satisfy the equation mentioned, they cannot be varied so as
                    still to satisfy the same equation, unless two of them be changed together; for,
                    if one sign only be changed, or if all the three be changed together, the
                    product <hi rend="italic">ttt"</hi> will have an opposite sign towhat it had
                    before, and the equation will no longer be satisfied. But the expressions of <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b, c, d,</hi> give the same set of values when the signs of any
                    two of the letters <hi rend="italic">t, t', t’',</hi> are changed together; so
                    that, in order to have the true values of the quantities sought, no other rule
                    for the signs of <hi rend="italic">t, t’, t’,</hi> is necessary than that they
                    must be such as to satisfy the equations alluded to.</p>
                <p>To apply the preceding investigation, we may take the equation a4 +jtxr <hi

                    noticed by M. Bret, in the second volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corre-pondance</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ĩ</hi><hi

                <p>It may not be improper to notice briefly some of the other rules for biquadratic
                    equations. These are chiefly two; the method of Descartes, which resolves the
                    given equation into two quadratic factors; and the oldest method of all,
                    invented by Louis Ferrari, a pupil of Cardan, which proceeds by transforming the
                    given equation, so as to make it equal to the difference of two complete
                    squares, and then extracting the square roots. However different from one
                    another these two methods may at first seem, they are at bottom the same; and
                    they are so far connected with that already investigated, that all the three
                    lead to the same cubic equation.</p>
                <p>Suppose that α, <hi rend="italic">b, c, d,</hi> are the roots of the biquadratic

                    (c+&lt;Z) ^+c√=0, are two quadratic factors, the product of which is equal to
                    the given equation. Now,</p>

                    co-efficients of the product to the co-efficients of the given equation, we

                <p>And it is to be observed that, on account of the first two of these equations,

                <p>The first of these equations is a cubic, of which the root is &amp;; and it is
                    precisely the same with the cubic of the former method. As the last term of this
                    equation is essentially positive, it follows that there is always one positive
                    value of <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> and one real value of <hi rend="italic">t;</hi> wherefore,
                    in consequence of what has been proved, the values of <hi rend="italic">p</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> derived from the positive value of <hi

                    practical application of the method.</p>
                <p>If we wish to follow the process of Louis Ferrari, we may assume <hi
                    rend="italic">p, t, y,</hi> so as to render the expression <hi rend="italic"
                    >(*</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi

                    is no more than the product of the two quadratic factors of the last method, the
                    quantities to be determined will be found by the formulae already given.</p>
                <p>The theory of permutations, which is successful in solving cubic and biquadratic
                    equations, applies likewise to those of the fifth and higher orders. But, to use
                    the words of Lagrange, “Passé le quatrième degré, la méthode, quoiqu’ applicable
                    en général, ne conduit plus qu’à des equations résolvantes de degres supérieurs
                    à celui de la proposée.” Thus, in the case of equations of the fifth degree, the
                    theory leads to a biquadratic equation, of which the co-efficients are to be
                    found by resolving an equation of the sixth order.</p>
                <p>There is, however, no doubt that the doctrine of permutations contains the
                    principles from which we are to expect the resolution of equations of the higher
                    orders, if the problem be possible. It may be alleged, with great probability,
                    that the theory succeeds in the less complicated cases, because when the number
                    of the roots is small, their permutations are soon exhausted, and we speedily
                    arrive at those combinations of them which remain invariable, whatever be the
                    order of the quantities combined. But when the number of the roots is greater
                    than four, their permutations are very numerous, and at the same time the
                    functions produced by combining them are very complicated; on which accounts it
                    is difficult to conduct the investigation so as to arrive at a satisfactory
                    conclusion, either accomplishing the intended purpose, or proving that the
                    undertaking is impossible.</p>
                <p>In the twelfth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Italian Society,</hi> and in a
                    work published at Modena in 1813, Μ. Paolo Ruffini has proved that no function
                    of five letters can exist that is susceptible of only three or four different
                    values when the letters are interchanged among one another in all possible ways.
                    Μ. Cauchy, in the sixteenth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Journal de ĩ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ecole Polytechnique,</hi> has demonstrated that a function of <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> letters, unless it have no more than two different values,
                    cannot have a number of different values less than the prime number next below
                    <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> On these grounds it has been inferred that the
                    resolution of equations of the fifth degree is in reality an impossible problem.
                    (Lacroix, <hi rend="italic">Compt. des Elem. d'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Algèbre,</hi> p. 61.) And if it be admitted that, in the process of resolution,
                    no equations can occur except such as have symmetrical functions of the five
                    letters for their co-efficients, the inference founded on the labours of the
                    eminent mathematicians we have mentioned would be indisputable. But it is not
                    impossible that the resolution of equations of a high order must be effected by
                    gradually depressing an equation at first of great dimensions; and in this
                    procedure we may arrive at equations, the co-efficients of which, although
                    functions of the roots of the proposed equation, are not symmetrical functions,
                    but partial expressions, susceptible of several values, according as the order
                    of the letters that denote the roots is made to vary. On this supposition, the
                    resolution of equations above the fourth order, by means of equations inferior
                    in degree, would not be inconsistent with what has been proved.</p>
                <p>17. A method for solving equations of one order may: be generalized so as to
                    extend to a certain class in all 1 orders. Thus De Moivre has found a species of
                    equations*</p>

                <p>An equation may be depressed to a lower order when it is known that the roots
                    have a given relation to one another. An instance of this has already occurred
                    in the case of equal roots; for, the equal roots having been first found, the
                    equation can be lowered by division. Reciprocal equations furnish another
                    example of depression to a lower order, on account of a relation subsisting
                    among the roots. A reciprocal equation is one of even dimensions, such that half
                    the roots are respectively the reciprocals of the other half, in which case no
                    alteration is produced in the equation when is substituted for a;. In equations
                    of this kind, the same co-efficients occur in the same order, and with the same
                    signs, reckoning from either end; a description that likewise applies to some
                    equations of odd dimensions, which, however, do not constitute a new class,
                    being merely reciprocal equations, as defined above, multiplied by the factor
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> + 1. A reciprocal equation may always be depressed to
                    half the dimensions, by transforming it so that the new unknown quantity shall
                    be equal to !..</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">X + -.</hi> It is sufficient to have mentioned these cases, <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> which are fully treated of in all the elementary books.</p>
                <p>Equations with only two terms, as <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ρ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1 =0, are the most extensive class
                    that have been resolved by a general method. The successful application of
                    analysis to this class of equations is extremely interesting, both in itself,
                    and likewise because it is connected with the division of the circle into equal
                    parts, and has occasioned the discovery of some curious and unexpected results
                    respecting that problem. For these reasons, it appears proper to lay before our
                    readers a short view of this branch of the doctrine of algebraic equations.</p>
                <p>We have already shown, that, admitting the theory of angular sections, every

                    common use. If we put <hi rend="italic">φ =</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">P</hi>

                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ρ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1 = 0 has
                    one real root equal to 1; and when <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is even, it has two
                    real roots equal to z±= 1; and in both cases the remaining roots are all
                    impossible, and are found from the formula <hi rend="italic">X</hi> = cos. <hi
                    rend="italic">h &lt;ρ</hi> + sin. <hi rend="italic">h &lt;ρ . V</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> 1, by making <hi rend="italic">h</hi> equal to all the
                    integral numbers less thanp in the one case, and less than <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1 in the other. Nothing, therefore, can be more
                    simple than the computation of the roots of such equations by means of the
                    trigonometrical tables. But in seeking a general solution, it is required to
                    investigate the roots without resorting to. the properties of the circle, unless
                    in so far as this may be necessary for solving similar equations inferior in
                    degree to the one proposed. In this view the resolution of the equation <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> ρ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> 1 = 0, is equivalent to the division of the circle into <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> equal parts, granting the like division for all numbers
                    less than/). And in order to render the investigation of the problem as simple
                    as possible, it may be further observed, that it will be sufficient to consider
                    the case when the exponent is a prime number; because from this case, the other,
                    when it is a composite number can be readily deduced.</p>
                <p>It will be proper to premise here a property of the roots of equations with only
                    two terms, to which we shall have occasion continually to refer. The property in
                    question depends upon this theorem, namely, when <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is any
                    number not a multiple of the prime number/), the remainders of the terms of the
                    series</p>
                <p>1 <hi rend="italic">× h,</hi> 2 × <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> 3 × <hi rend="italic"
                    >h . . . (ρ</hi> — 1) × <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> when each is divided by/), are
                    all different from one another; and, consequently, without regard to the order,
                    they will coincide with the numbers 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. less than ∕). If,
                    therefore, we take any one of the impossible roots of the equation <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ρ</hi><hi rend="superscript">

                    regard to the order, with the like powers of any other impossible root of the
                    same equation: because, whatever number <hi rend="italic">h</hi> stands for, the
                    arcs are all different from one another, and, neglecting whole circumferences,
                    constitute the same series of terms, although in different orders. Wherefore,
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> being a prime number, if <hi rend="italic">r</hi> be
                    one of the impossible roots of the equation <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ρ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1 = 0, all the roots

                    that they are all different from one another.</p>
                <p>When ∕) is a composite number, the same property does not belong to all the roots

                    cases all the powers of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> are roots of the equation <hi

                <p>If the equation <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> p</hi><hi

                    >x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1 = 0,
                    which is reduced to a cubic; but, by the same procedure, the equation next in
                    order, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193749717" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9717-0343"/><hi

                    be lowered only to the fifth degree, for equations of which class there is no
                    rule. Nevertheless this last equation has been solved by Vandermonde, to whom,
                    and to Lagrange, we are mainly indebted for disengaging the resolution of
                    equations from the complicated jperations of algebra, and for substituting, in
                    their place, reasonings founded on the doctrine of combinations. The author has
                    not explained particularly the process by which his solution was obtained; he
                    gives it as a result of his theory, which, although it fails in general for
                    equations above the fourth degree, succeeds in this instance on account of
                    particular relations between the roots. Similar relations subsist between the
                    roots of any other binomial equation when the exponent is a prime number; and,
                    in consequence, a like mode of investigation will apply, as indeed the author
                    has expressly said. But this procedure would unavoidably be attended in every
                    new instance with very long calculations; and it appears hardly possible to
                    arrive in this way at any general method that would apply to all equations of
                    the class in a regular manner, and without considerations drawn from each
                    particular case.</p>
                <p>Μ. Gauss, in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Disquisitiones</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Arithmeticae,</hi> replete with original and important matter,
                    applied a property of prime numbers to the solution of binomial equations, which
                    removed every difficulty, and led to a theory that unites simplicity and
                    generality. If we suppose that <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is a prime number, and
                    resolve/» — 1 into its component factors, so that <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">1 = a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    λ</hi><hi rend="italic">.b</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> fi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">.c</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> γ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >.</hi> &amp;c., <hi rend="italic">a, b, c,</hi> &amp;c. being prime numbers, Μ.
                    Gauss has proved that the solution of the equation <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ρ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1—0, or, which is the
                    same thing, the division of the circle into <hi rend="italic">p</hi> equal
                    parts, can be effected by solving successively λ equations of <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> dimensions, <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> equations of <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> dimensions, <hi rend="italic">γ</hi> equations of c dimensions, &amp;c.
                    Thus, if <hi rend="italic">p</hi> = 13, then, because 13 — 1 — 3 × 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, the roots of re <hi rend="superscript"> 13</hi> — 1
                    = 0 can be found, or a polygon of 13 sides can be inscribed in a circle, by
                    solving a cubic and two quadratic equations in succession. In certain cases,
                    when a prime number comes under the form 2”+ 1, as 17, 257, &amp;c. the division
                    of the circle will require the solution of equations no higher than the second
                    order; whence this unexpected consequence has resulted from the theory of Μ.
                    Gauss, that the inscription of a polygon of 17, or 257 sides in a circle, which
                    are problems that have always been understood to transcend the limits of the
                    elementary geometry, can, nevertheless, be constructed by the operations
                    admitted in that science.</p>
                <p>A work replete with so many interesting discoveries as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Disquisitiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Arithmeticae</hi> could not fail to excite
                    the attention of mathematicians. Legendre, in republishing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essayon the Theory of Numbers,</hi> has added to it an exposition of Μ. Gauss’s
                    theory of binomial equations; and the same theory is the subject of the 14th
                    note in the second edition of Lagrange’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Numerical
                    Equations.</hi> ho part of the mathematics could pass through the hands of men
                    of so much ability without receiving great improvement. Lagrange has shown that
                    it is not necessary to go through the several intermediate equations that make
                    so essential a part in the investigation of Μ. Gauss; and, by this means, he has
                    reduced the solution of equations with ⅛o terms to the utmost simplicity of
                    which it is capable. But, in one respect, it must be admitted that the procedure
                    of the illustrious geometer is imperfect. Although t arrives, by a short
                    investigation, at the partial quantities that by their additions form the
                    expressions of the roots sought, it leaves indeterminate the order in which they
                    <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> re to be combined. Μ. Gauss has avoided ambiguity
                    in this respect by deducing from one of the quantities all the °ther parts of
                    the same expression; but, amidst a multiplicity of different systems of values
                    that may be deduced from the partial quantities, Lagrange has given no clue to
                    guide to the true one.</p>
                <p>In laying before our reader some account of this interesting branch of the theory
                    of algebraic equations, we shall view the subject in a light somewhat different
                    from that in which it has hitherto been placed. Instead of seeking directly the
                    roots of binomial equations, we shall apply the principles of Μ. Gauss’s theory
                    immediately to the division of the circle into equal parts, by taking the arcs
                    of the circumference in that order to which the method owes all its success.
                    This procedure is attended with some advantages. In the first place, the
                    algebraic expres-sions of the quantities sought, represented by cos. , are more
                    simple than those of the imaginary roots of the corresponding binomial equation;
                    and, in the second place, the same expressions, having always real values, are
                    better fitted for application than the roots of binomial equations, which
                    require to be further reduced to prepare them for calculation.</p>
                <p>Before entering on the principal problem, it is necessary to say something of
                    that property of numbers on which the whole theory depends. Supposing <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> to be any prime number, Euler has distinguished by the name
                    of a <hi rend="italic">Primitive Root</hi> any number less than <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1, such that, if we take the series
                    of all its powers with indices less than <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and in each
                    power reject the multiples of/» it contains, the several remainders are all
                    different from one another, and,· consequently, paying no regard to the order,
                    they will coincide with the numbers 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. less than <hi rend="italic"
                    >p.</hi> It has been proved that, for every prime number, there are as many
                    primitive roots as there are numbers less than <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> 1, which have no common divisor with it. The existence of
                    such numbers in every case is therefore demonstrated; but no direct method of
                    finding them has yet been published with which we are acquainted.</p>
                <p>We gladly seize the present occasion of laying down a rule for finding the
                    primitive roots of a prime number. But first we must premise, that when any
                    proposed number is said to satisfy the equation <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> m</hi> + I = 0, it is always understood that the
                    multiples of the prime number <hi rend="italic">p</hi> are rejected; and the
                    meaning is, that, when the given number is substituted for <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> the whole result is divisible by <hi rend="italic">p</hi> without any
                    remainder.</p>
                <p>Now, let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be a prime number, and 2, <hi rend="italic">a,
                    b, c,</hi> &amp;c. the</p>
                <p>λ <hi rend="italic">-1JJb</hi> V. prime divisors of <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> 1, so that/»— 1 — 2 <hi rend="italic">. a .lf . c .
                    &amp;c.</hi>: then every primitive root will satisfy the first of the following
                    equations without satisfying any of the rest, viz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="underline">P —</hi><hi rend="superscript underline"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> +1 = 0, <hi
                    rend="underline">p— 1</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 2α</hi> +1 = 0, <hi rend="underline">P—I</hi></p>
                <p>2δ i ι — <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi> +1=0,</p>
                <p>1 . *</p>
                <p><hi rend="underline">Ρ—</hi><hi rend="superscript underline"> 1</hi> *</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2c</hi> +1 = 0,</p>
                <p>&amp;c.</p>
                <p>And, on the other hand, every number not a primitive root, which satisfies the
                    first equation, will at the same time satisfy one, or more, or all, of the other
                    equations.</p>
                <p>But the numbers which satisfy the first equation are exclusively those which are
                    not found among the remainders of the series of square numbers divided by <hi
                    rend="italic">p.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193749730" xml:id="kp-eb0709-9730-0344"/>
                <p>Wherefore, setting aside the first equation, if we seek among the non-residual
                    numbers for such as satisfy none of the remaining equations, the numbers so
                    found will be the primitive roots sought.</p>
                <p>When one primitive root is found by this method, all the rest may be directly
                    obtained from it. For, if 1, <hi rend="italic">w, id, id',</hi> &amp;c. . . .

                <p>Let/? = 31; then —-—- = 3 × 5; and we have two equations of exclusion, viz.</p>

                <p>Of these numbers the first, viz. 3, is a primitive root, since it satisfies
                    neither of the two equations; and as the numbers less than 30, and prime to it,
                    are 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29; all the primitive roots of 31 are as follows:

                    numbers, it will be found on trial that the first equation is satisfied by 6 and
                    26; the second by 15, 23, 27, 29; and both equations by 30.</p>
                <p>We are now prepared to enter upon the solution of the proh’em for dividing the

                    I. If we conceive a polygon of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> sides, to be inscribed
                    in a circle, it will be admitted that the centre of gravity of the polygon
                    coincides with the centre of the circle. Wherefore, if perpendiculars be drawn
                    to any diameter of the circle from all the angles of the polygon, it follows,
                    from the nature of the centre of gravity, that the sum of the cosines lying on
                    one side of the centre of the circle will be equal to the sum of the cosines
                    lying on the other</p>
                <p>360° <hi rend="subscript"> ; c 1</hi> side. Let <hi rend="italic">&lt;p =</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">——</hi> —; and put <hi rend="italic">u</hi> for the arc
                    intercepted between the diameter and any angle of the polygon, then we shall
                    have this equation, viz.</p>
                <p>0=cos.w + cos.(p + w) + cos.(2p + zz).... <hi rend="smallcaps">+cos.(2w∕+m),</hi>
                    which is no more than the analytical expression of the geometrical property just
                    mentioned. Now, suppose that the diameter passes through one of the angles of
                    the polygon; then <hi rend="italic">u</hi> = 0, and the equation becomes</p>
                <p>0 = 1 + cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> + cos. <hi rend="italic">2&lt;p</hi> + cos.

                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be one of the primitive roots of the prime number
                    <hi rend="italic">p;</hi> then rejecting multiples of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi>
                    and paying no regard to the order, the terms of the geometrical progression, <hi

                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> a <hi rend="superscript"> 2n</hi>, will be equal to
                    the several numbers less than/?. Wherefore, in the two series of arcs, <hi

                    progression, or will differ from it by a whole circumference, or circumferences.
                    Hence the cosines of the first series of arcs may be substituted in the last
                    equation for the cosines of the other series; and thus we have</p>
                <p>— 1 = cos. <hi rend="italic">a&lt;p</hi> + cos. <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">φ</hi> + cos. <hi

                    the remainder of a square divided by that number, we have α <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> + 1 = a multiple of/?; and consequently <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    + λ</hi> + α <hi rend="superscript"> λ</hi> = a multiple of /?. It follows,
                    therefore, that <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>From this it appears that the cosines in the last equation maybe distributed into
                    two equal sums; one containing the cosines of all arcs from <hi rend="italic"

                <p>In what follows, we shall have continual occasion to consider the expression

                    cos. <hi rend="italic">3ţ&gt; . .</hi>. + N cos. <hi rend="italic">2np.</hi>
                    Now, if we suppose the function we are considering to be such, that it retains
                    the same value when any of the multiple arcs 2p, 3p, &amp;c. is substituted for
                    <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> the transformed expression will be possessed of the
                    same property. But if we actually substitute the arcs 2ç&gt;, 3ç&gt;, &amp;c.
                    for <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> in the foregoing expression, it will become
                    successively</p>
                <p>A + B cos. <hi rend="italic">2&lt;ţ&gt;</hi> + C cos. 4p + D cos. 6p +,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>A + B cos. 3p + C cos. 6ç&gt; + D cos. 9p +, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>each line containing the same cosines, although in a different order, because the
                    series of arcs is the same when whole circumferences, or the multiples of <hi
                    rend="italic">pφ,</hi> are rejected; and all these expressions cannot have the
                    same value unless B = C = D =: &amp;c.; that is, unless the expression be of
                    this form, viz.</p>
                <p>A + B (cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> + cos. <hi rend="italic">2&lt;ρ</hi> + cos.
                    3p ... + cos. <hi rend="italic">2nţ&gt;),</hi> which, in consequence of what was
                    before proved, is equal toA-β. It is therefore demonstrated that every rational
                    and integral function of cos. <hi rend="italic">&lt;ρ,</hi> cos. <hi
                    rend="italic">2&lt;ρ,</hi> cos. 3p, &amp;c., which remains unchanged when any of
                    the multiple arcs 2p, 3ç&gt;, &amp;c. is substituted for <hi rend="italic"
                    >&lt;ρ,</hi> has for its value an expression without cosines, and depending only
                    upon the ιature of the function.</p>
                <p>If we introduce the arcs in geometrical instead of those ∏ arithmetical
                    progression, it is obvious that the substĩ-ution of the multiple arcs <hi
                    rend="italic">2&lt;ρ,</hi> 3ç&gt;, &amp;c., for ç&gt;, is equivalent <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi>. <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> changing of <hi

                    function of the cosines of <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and its ∏ultiples, which
                    remains invariable when <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> is changed <hi

                    from which ıe cosines are eliminated.</p>
                <p>ιat has now been proved will enable us to appreciate θ a vantage arising from the
                    introduction of the arcs in metrical in place of those in arithmetical
                    progression, in which principally consists the improvement that this theory owes
                    to M. Gauss. The solution of the problem turns upon finding those functions of
                    cos. ç&gt;, cos. <hi rend="italic">2φ,</hi> cos. 3p, &amp;c. which have
                    determinate values independent of the cosines; which functions, it has been
                    proved, remain invariable when any of the multiple arcs 2p, <hi rend="italic"
                    >3φ,</hi> &amp;c. is substituted for <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> Now, although the
                    substitution of any multiple arc, in place of the arc itself, always reproduces
                    the same series of cosines, yet the order is irregular, and varies with every
                    different multiple arc; and this circumstance makes it difficult to investigate
                    what change the substitution will effect in a given function. On the other hand,
                    by introducing the arcs in geometrical progression, the same order is still
                    preserved, whatever substitution be made; and by this means every facility
                    possible is obtained for investigating the functions sought.</p>
                <p>The following properties are deducible from what has been proved. First, if <hi
                    rend="italic">nι, m', m",</hi> &amp;c. be any numbers, none of which is equal to
                    zero, or a multiple of <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and such that their sum is
                    equal to <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> or to a multiple of <hi rend="italic">n,</hi>
                    the product <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (o, <hi rend="italic">m) × f (o, m') ×
                    f</hi> (o, <hi rend="italic">m"),</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>will be independent of the cosines of <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and its multiples,
                    or will be an expression containing only the powers of <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    multiplied by numeral co-efficients.</p>
                <p>For by the formula (B) we have <hi rend="italic subscript"> e</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">λm</hi><hi rend="subscript"> χ</hi> yγ <hi

                <p>&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Therefore, by multiplying and observing that e <hi rend="superscript">
                    λwι</hi><hi rend="italic">× e</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> λm</hi><hi

                    because λ × <hi rend="italic">(rn ∙</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∙m' + m''</hi> + , &amp;c.) is a multiple of <hi rend="italic"
                    >η,</hi> we get</p>
                <p>∕(o, <hi rend="italic">m) ×f(ο, m')</hi> × ∕(o, rn"), &amp;c. =∕(λ, <hi
                    rend="italic">m)</hi> × ∕(λ, <hi rend="italic">m') × f</hi> (λ, <hi
                    rend="italic">m"),</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>which shows that the product in question is not altered when <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> is changed into <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    λ</hi><hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> Consequently, according to what was before
                    proved, the product is independent of the cosines.</p>
                <p>It follows, as a corollary, that the product ∕(o, <hi rend="italic">m) ×
                    f(o,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">in)</hi> is independent of
                    the cosines.</p>
                <p>Next, if <hi rend="italic">in, m', m'',</hi> &amp;c. be any numbers, and <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">m + m' + m",</hi>
                    &amp;c.; and if neither <hi rend="italic">s</hi> nor any of the numbers <hi
                    rend="italic">m, m', in!',</hi> &amp;c. be a multiple of <hi rend="italic"
                    >n,</hi> we shall have <hi rend="italic">f (o, m) × f (o, m') × f (o, m"),</hi>
                    &amp;c. = M × <hi rend="italic">f (o, s),</hi> the quantity M being independent
                    of the cosines, and containing only the powers of <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    multiplied by numeral co-efficients.</p>
                <p>For, by the property already demonstrated, and its cor-rollary, we have <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> (o, <hi rend="italic">m) × f</hi> (o, <hi rend="italic">nü)
                    × f (p, m") × f</hi> (o, — s) = A ∕(o,s) ×∕(o,- <hi rend="italic">s) =</hi>
                    A';</p>
                <p>A and A' being quantities independent of the cosines. Therefore, by exterminating
                    <hi rend="italic">f(p,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> s), we get <hi rend="italic"
                    >f(o, m) × f(o, m') × f(o, m")</hi> ×, &amp;c. = <hi rend="italic">-f (ο,
                    s).</hi></p>
                <p>The foregoing properties are the foundations of the theory. But it is not enough
                    to establish the principles by a general demonstration; it is also necessary to
                    be able· to compute the numerical values that occur in the application to
                    particular problems. Therefore, supposing that <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">m'</hi> are two numbers, and <hi rend="italic">s = m + m',</hi>

                    rend="italic">n,</hi> it is proposed to find the value of A in the equation</p>
                <p>∕(o, <hi rend="italic">m)</hi> ×∕(o, m') = A × <hi rend="italic">f (o,
                    s).</hi></p>
                <p>. For this purpose, set down the several terms of∕ ’ (o, <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,y</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> in their

                    placing first any term, as e <hi rend="superscript"> awi</hi> cos. α <hi

                <p>Now, let every term in the lower line be multiplied into that which stands above

                    common to each product, let the symbol <hi rend="italic">e^</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>If we repeat this operation, so as to make every term of the lower line stand
                    first in succession, it is evident that, by this means, every term of <hi

                <p>On the whole, the preceding analysis brings us to the following formulae, which

                    this last case, the quantity - × (—D ’ X±∕i, must be added, prefixing to <hi

                    in the value of P <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>The solution of the problem is thus reduced to the computation of the functions
                    (I, 2), (1, 3), &amp;c. which requires no more than the substitution of 1 for
                    <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and of 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. successively for <hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> in the expression of A, equation (2).] The half of these
                    functions that have negative indices are deduced from the other half, merely by
                    changing the signs of the several indices of e, or by means of equation (4). All
                    the cosines sought are found by substituting <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> 1,2,3
                    &amp;c. successively for g. Although the function P is susceptible of <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> different values, represented by <hi rend="italic">x,
                    ex,</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> e</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> χ</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> &amp;c.; yet
                    the same cosines are deduced from any one of these values. By this means all
                    ambiguity is avoided with regard to the system of values that represent the
                    cosines; but the numerical value that must be attached to each particular cosine
                    remains quite indeterminate, because <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi>, <hi
                    rend="subscript"> c</hi> 360° „ , 360° <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> 360°</p>

                    c</hi>,</p>
                <p>The adaptation of the numerical quantities to the geometrical cosines must be
                    made out by means of their relative magnitudes; the largest number answering to
                    the greatest cosine. But when the value of one cosine is fixed, the rest are
                    unambiguously determined by means of their indices.</p>
                <p>In the formula for cos. <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;p</hi> all the terms in which two quantities are
                    combined have real values, although their forms are imaginary. But it is not
                    difficult to transform them into equivalent quantities without the imaginary
                    sign.</p>
                <p>It is manifest that the functions (1, 2) and (— 1, — 2) are of this form,

                <p>But, on account of equation (4), we may assume</p>
                <p>(1, 2) = Ä (cos. <hi rend="italic">β</hi> + sin. ∕3√ — 1),</p>

                <p>By the preceding analysis the division of the circle into <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> equal parts is accomplished, when <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is a prime

                <p>by dividing a given arc into <hi rend="italic">η</hi> or —-— equal parts. And
                    this conclusion agrees with the general proposition of Μ. Gauss. For the roth
                    part of a given arc is found by bisecting as often as <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    is divisible by 2, trisecting as often as it is divisible by 3, and so on. When
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is a power of two, as in the case of the polygon of 17
                    sides, the solution is effected by repeated bisections, and thus comes under the
                    elementary geometry. Supposing the division of the circle to be accomplished, we
                    must further resolve the quadratic equation</p>

                    first place, we may take the case of∕&gt; = 11 equivalent to find-ıg the roots
                    of the equation <hi rend="italic">x</hi> “<hi rend="italic">—</hi> 1 = 0, which
                    was first SO ved by Vandermonde, and has been considered both by Lagrange and
                    Legendre. Here, n = 5; Ä = ^V <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 11; <hi

                    primitive root of 11, we may suppose α — 2. In order to find the numbers A(λ)
                    and ∕i'(λ), write down the series 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. as far as <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> or 5; and, above each number, write the power of <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> equal to it when the multiples of 11 are rejected, taking always the
                    least remainder, whether positive or negative: thus,</p>

                <p>In this arrangement of the powers of <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> it is evident
                    that, λ denoting any index, 7ι(λ) is the next on the right • hand, and A'(λ) the
