                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">DEMETRIUS</label>, a son of Antigonus and Stratonice,
                    surnamed <hi rend="italic">Poliorcetes,</hi> or the Taker of Cities. At the age
                    of twenty-two he was sent by his father against Ptolemy, who had invaded Syria,
                    and he was defeated near Gaza; but he soon repaired his loss by a victory which
                    he obtained, over one of the generals of the enemy. He afterwards sailed with a
                    fleet of two hundred and fifty ships to Athens, and restored the Athenians to
                    liberty, by freeing them from the power of Cassander and Ptolemy, and expelling
                    the garrison which had been stationed there under Demetrius Phalereus. After
                    this successful expedition he besieged and took Munychia, and defeated Cassander
                    at Thermopylae. His reception at Athens, after these victories, was attended
                    with the greatest servility, and the Athenians were not ashamed to raise altars
                    to him as a god, and to consult his oracles. This uncommon success roused the
                    jealousy of the successors of Alexander; and Seleucus, Cassander, and
                    Lysimachus, united to destroy Antigonus and his son. The hostile armies met at
                    Ipsus, 299 years before the Augustan age: Antigonus was killed in the battle;
                    and Demetrius, after sustaining a severe loss, retired to Ephesus. This reverse
                    of fortune raised him many enemies; and the Athenians, who had lately adored him
                    as a god, refused even to admit him into their city. But he soon afterwards
                    ravaged the territory of Lysimachus, and reconciled himself to Seleucus, to whom
                    he gave his daughter Stratonice in marriage. Athens now laboured under tyranny,
                    but Demetrius relieved it, and pardoned the inhabitants their former misconduct.
                    The loss of his possessions in Asia recalled him from Greece, and he established
                    himself on the throne of Macedonia by the murder of Alexander the son of
                    Cassander. But here he was continually at war with the neighbouring states; and
                    the superior power of his adversaries obliged him to leave Macedonia, after he
                    had sat on the throne for seven years. He passed into Asia, and attacked, with
                    various success, some of the provinces of Lysimachus; but famine and pestilence
                    destroyed the greater part of his army, and he retired to the court of Śeleucus
                    to seek support and assistance. Here he met with a kind reception; but,
                    nevertheless, hostilities soon broke out; and after he had gained some
                    advantages over his son-in-law, Demetrius was totally forsaken by his troops in
                    the field of battle, and became an easy prey to the enemy. But although he was
                    kept in confinement by his son-in-law, yet he maintained himself like a prince,
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756476" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6476-0708"/> and passed
                    his time in hunting, and in every laborious exercise. Ηis son Antigonus offered
                    Seleucus all his possessions, and even his person, in order to procure his
                    father’s liberty; but all proved unavailing, and Demetrius died in the
                    fifty-fourth year of his age, after a confinement of three years, about 286
                    years before Christ. His remains were given to Antigonus, honoured with a
                    splendid funeral at Corinth, and thence conveyed to Demetrias. His posterity
                    remained in possession of the Macedonian throne till the time of Perseus, who
                    was conquered by the Romans. Demetrius rendered himself famous by his fondness
                    for dissipation when amongst the dissolute, and by his love of virtue and
                    military glory in the field of battle. He has been commended as a great warrior;
                    and his ingenious inventions, his warlike engines, and stupendous machines in
                    the war with the Rhodians, justify his claims to that character. He has,
                    however, been blamed for his voluptuous indulgences; and his biographer observes
                    that no Grecian prince had more wives and concubines than Poliorcetes. His
                    obedience and reverence to his father have been justly admired; and it has been
                    observed, that Antigonus ordered the ambassadors of a foreign prince
                    particularly to remark the cordiality and friendship which subsisted between the
                    parent and his child.</p>

                    and Peripatetic philosopher, was the scholar of Theophrastus. He acquired so
                    much authority at Athens, that he governed the city for ten years, and ruled
                    with so much wisdom and virtue that they set up thirty-six statues in honour of
                    him. By the slanders of some malicious persons in his absence, he was, however,
                    condemned to death, and his images were pulled down; but when Demetrius heard
                    it, he remarked, they could not pull down that virtue in honour of which those
                    images had been set up. He escaped into Egypt, and was protected by Ptolemy
                    Lagus. This king, it is said, asked his advice concerning the succession of his
                    children to the throne, whether he ought to prefer those whom he had had by
                    Eurydice, to Ptolemy Philadelphus, whom he had had by Berenice; and Demetrius
                    advised him to leave his crown to the former. This displeased Philadelphus so
                    much, that when his father died, he banished Demetrius; and the unfortunate
                    exile was afterwards killed by the bite of an asp. Demetrius composed more works
                    in prose and in verse than any other peripatetic of his time; and his writings
                    consisted of poetry, history, politics, rhetoric, harangues, and accounts of
                    embassies. But none of them are extant except his rhetoric, which is usually
                    printed among the <hi rend="italic">Rhetores</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    disciple of Apollonius Tyanaeus, who lived in the age of Caligula. The emperor
                    wished to gain the philosopher to his interest by a large present; but Demetrius
                    refused it with indignation, and said, “If Caligula wishes to bribe me, let him
                    send me his crown.” Vespasian was displeased with his insolence, and banished
                    him to an island. The Cynic derided the punishment, and bitterly inveighed
                    against the emperor. He died in a great old age; and Seneca observes, that
                    nature had brought him forth to show mankind that an exalted genius can live
                    securely, without being corrupted by the vices of the world.</p>
