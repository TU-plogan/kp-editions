                <p><label type="entry">DEMOSTHENES</label>, the famous Athenian orator, was born at
                    Athens in the year <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 381. He lost his father at
                    the early age of seven, and was placed under the conduct of guardians, who
                    robbed him of his substance and neglected his education. But Demosthenes
                    repaired this loss by his love of eloquence and his extraordinary abilities. He
                    became the disciple of Isaeus and Plato, and applied himself to study the
                    orations of Isocrates. At the age of seventeen he gave an early proof of his
                    eloquence and abilities in a suit against his guardians, from whom he obtained
                    the restitution of the greater part of his estate. His rising talents were,
                    however, impeded by various natural defects; but these were at last conquered by
                    dint of resolution and unwearied attention. He declaimed by the sea-shore, that
                    he might become habituated to the noise of a tumultuous assembly, and with
                    pebbles in his mouth, that he might correct a defect in his speech. He practised
                    at home with a naked sword hanging over his shoulder, that he might check an
                    ungraceful motion to which he was subject. He also confined himself in a
                    subterraneous cave, in order to devote himself more closely to studious
                    pursuits; and in order to eradicate all curiosity of appearing in public, he
                    shaved one half of his head. In this solitary retirement, by the help of a
                    glimmering lamp, he composed the greater part of those orations which have been
                    the admiration of every succeeding age; though his contemporaries and rivals
                    inveighed against them, and observed that they smelt of the lamp. His abilities
                    as an orator raised him to consequence at Athens, and he was soon placed at the
                    head of the government. In this public capacity he roused his countrymen from
                    their indolence, and animated them against the encroachment of Philip of
                    Macedonia; but in the battle of Cheronaea, the hero of the Agora betrayed his
                    pusillanimity, and saved his life by an ignominious flight. After the death of
                    Philip, he declared himself warmly against Alexander his son and successor; and
                    when the Macedonians demanded of the Athenians to give up their orators,
                    Demosthenes reminded his countrymen of the fable of the sheep, which delivered
                    up their dogs to the wolves. By the prevalence of party, however, he was forced
                    to retire from Athens; and in his banishment, which he passed at Troezen and
                    Aegina, he lived with more effeminacy than became his character. When Antipater
                    made war against Greece after the death of Alexander, Demosthenes was publicly
                    recalled from his exile, and a galley was sent to fetch him from Aegina. His
                    return was attended with much splendour, and all the citizens crowded to the
                    Piraeus to see him land. But his triumph and popularity were shortlived.
                    Antipater and Craterus were near Athens, and demanded that all the orators
                    should be delivered into their hands. Demosthenes fled to the temple of Neptune
                    in Calauria; and when he saw that all hopes of safety were vanished, he took a
                    dose of poison, which he had always carried in a quill, and expired on the day
                    on which the Thesmophoria were celebrated, 322 years before Christ. The
                    Athenians raised a brazen statue to his honour, with an inscription, setting
                    forth, that if his actual means had equalled his mental resources, Greece would
                    not have bowed to the Macedonian.</p>
                <p>Demosthenes has been deservedly considered as the prince of orators. Indeed no
                    orator had ever a finer field than Demosthenes in his Olynthiacs and Philippics,
                    which are his principal orations; and undoubtedly to the greatness of the
                    subject, and to that integrity and public spirit which breathe in them, these
                    productions owe a large portion of their merit. The subject is, to excite the
                    indignation of his countrymen against Philip of Macedon, the public enemy of the
                    liberties of Greece; and to guard them against the treacherous measures by which
                    that <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756502" xml:id="kp-eb0707-6502-0710"/>crafty
                    tyrant endeavoured to lull them into a neglect of their danger. In order to
                    attain this end, we see him using every proper means to animate a people
                    distinguished for justice, humanity, and valour, but who had in many respects
                    become corrupt and degenerate. He boldly accuses them of venality, indolence,
                    and indifference to the public good; whilst, at the same time, he reminds them
                    of their former glory and of their present resources. His contemporary orators,
                    who had been bribed by Philip, and who persuaded the people to remain at peace,
                    he openly reproaches as traitors to their country; and he not only prompts to
                    vigorous measures, but teaches how these are to be carried into execution. His
                    orations are strongly animated, and full of impetuosity and ardour of public
                    spirit. His composition is not distinguished by ornament and splendour. It is an
                    energy of thought peculiarly his own, which forms his character, and raises him
                    above all others. He seems not to attend to words, but to things. We forget the
                    orator, and think only of the subject. He has no parade and ostentation, no
                    studied introductions; he is like a man full of his subject, who, after
                    preparing his audience by a sentence or two for the reception of plain truths,
                    enters directly on business.</p>
                <p>The style of Demosthenes is strong and coneise, though occasionally, it must be
                    confessed, somewhat harsh and abrupt. His words are highly expressive, and his
                    arrangement firm and manly. Negligent of lesser graces, he seems to have aimed
                    at that sublime which consists in sentiment. His action and pronunciation are
                    said to have been uncommonly vehement and ardent; which, from the manner of his
                    writings, we should readily believe. His character appears to have been of the
                    austere rather than of the gentle kind. He is always grave, serious, passionate;
                    never degrading himself, nor attempting any thing like pleasantry. If his
                    admirable eloquence have any fault, it is that it sometimes borders on the hard
                    and the dry. He maybe thought to want smoothness and grace, which is attributed
                    to his imitating too closely the manner of Thucydides, who was his great model
                    for style, and whose history he is said to have transcribed eight times with his
                    own hand. But these defects are more than counterbalanced by that force of
                    masculine eloquence which, as it overpowered all who heard it, cannot in the
                    present day be read without emotion.</p>
                <p>Cicero calls him a perfect model, and such as he himself wished to be. These two
                    great masters of eloquence have been often compared, but the judgment hesitates
                    to which the preference should be given. The Arehbishop of Cambray, however,
                    seems to have stated their merits with great justice and perspicuity in his
                    Refleetions on Rhetoric and Poetry. “I do not hesitate,” says he, “to declare
                    that I think Demosthenes superior to Cieero. I am persuaded no one can admire
                    Cieero more than I do. He adorns whatever he attempts; he does honour to
                    language; he disposes of words in a manner peculiar to himself; his style has
                    great variety of character. Whenever he pleases he is even coneise and vehement;
                    for instance, against Catiline, against Verres, against Antony. But ornament is
                    too visible in his writings; his art is wonderful, but it is perceived. When the
                    orator is providing for the safety of the republic, he forgets not himself, nor
                    permits others to forget him. Demosthenes seems to escape from himself, and to
                    see nothing but his country. He seeks not elegance of expression, unsought for
                    he possesses it. He is superior to admiration: he makes use of language, as a
                    modest man does of dress, only to cover him. He thunders, he lightens: he is a
                    torrent which carries every thing before it. We cannot criticise, because we are
                    not ourselves. His subject enchains our attention, and makes us forget his
                    language. We lose him from our sight: Philip alone occupies our minds. I am
                    delighted with both these orators; but I confess that I am less affected by the
                    infinite art and magnificent eloquence of Cieero, than by the rapid simplicity
                    of Demosthenes.”</p>
