                <p><label type="entry">DECLAMATION</label>, a speech made in public, in the tone and
                    manner of an oration, uniting the expression of action to propriety of
                    pronunciation, in order to give the sentiment its full impression upon the mind.
                    According to the manners and customs of the present age, public harangues are
                    made only in the pulpit, in the senate, council, or other public assembly; by
                    public professors; or in the theatre.</p>
                <p>1. With regard to the declamation of the pulpit, the dignity and sanctity of the
                    place, and the importaňce of the subject, require that the preacher shall exert
                    the utmost powers of his voice, in order to produce a pronunciation which is
                    perfectly distinct and harmonious, and that he shall observe a deportment and
                    action which are expressive and graceful. No man, therefore, who is destitute of
                    a voice should ascend the pulpit, and there act the part of a pantomime or
                    posture-master before his audience. The preacher should not, however, bellow
                    like a common crier, and rend the ear with a voice of thunder; for such kind of
                    declamation is not only without meaning and without persuasion, but highly
                    incongruous with the meek and benignant genius of the gospel. He should likewise
                    take particular carc to avoid monotony; his voice should rise from the
                    beginning, as it were, by degrees, and its greatest strength should be exerted
                    in the application. Each inflection of the voice should be adapted to the
                    phrase, and to the meaning of the words; and each remarkable expression should
                    have its peculiar inflection. The dogmatic requires a plain, uniform tone of
                    voice only; but the menaces of the gospel demand a greater force than its
                    promises and rewards; the latter should not be pronounced in the soft tone of a
                    flute, nor the former with the loud sound of a trumpet. The voice should still
                    retain its natural tone in all its various inflections. Happy indeed is that
                    preacher to whom nature has given a voice which is at once strong, flexible, and
                    harmonious. An air of complacency and benevolence, as well as devotion, should
                    be constantly visible in the countenance of the preacher. But every appearance
                    of affectation must be carefully avoided; for nothing is so hateful in itself,
                    or disgusting to an audience, as even the semblance of dissimulation. An air of
                    affected devotion infallibly destroys the efficacy of all that the preacher can
                    say, however just and important it may be. On the other hand, he must avoid
                    every appearance of mirth or raillery, or of that cold unfeeling manner which is
                    so apt to freeze the hearts and chill the feelings of his hearers. In a word,
                    declamation is an art that the sacred orator should study with the utmost
                    assiduity. The design of a sermon is to convince, to affect, and to persuade.
                    The voice, the countenance, and the action, which are to produce this triple <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> effect, are therefore the objects to which the
                    preacher should particularly apply himself.</p>
                <p>2. The declamation of a minister or statesman in the senate, in council, or in
                    any other public assembly, is of a more unconfined nature. To persuade, to move
                    the passions, and to gain an ascendency in a public assembly, the orator should
                    himself feel the force of what he says, and the declamation should only express
                    that internal sensation. But nothing should ever be carried to excess. A suavity
                    in the tone of voice, a dignity of deportment, a graceful action, and a certain
                    tranquillity of countenance, should constantly accompany the statesman when he
                    speaks in public, even when he is most earnestly engaged in debate, or when he
                    is addressing his sovereign in person. A pleasing tone of voice and a distinct
                    pronunciation prejudice the hearers greatly in the speaker’s favour. A young man
                    may improve these qualifications to a surprising degree. Demosthenes, who had a
                    natural impediment· in his speech, was accustomed to go to the sea-shore, and
                    partly filling his mouth with pebbles, to declaim with a loud voice against the
                    breaking billows. The stones by degrees gave a volubility to his tongue, and the
                    roaring of the waves reconciled him insensibly to the noise of a popular
                    assembly.</p>
                <p>3. The principal object of a public professor is the instruction of the studious
                    youth; for which purpose it is his business to convince and persuade. Every tone
                    of voice, every expression of the countenance, or action of the body, which can
                    produce this .effect by enforcing the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755904"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-5904-0664"/>words, should therefore be employed by those whose
                    duty it is to teach the science. There is, moreover, one very essential
                    reflection which every professor ought to make, namely, that the chair from
                    which he harangues is surrounded by young students, naturally possessed of great
                    vivacity, not unfrequently alive to a sense of the ludicrous, and for the most
                    part previously instructed in the preparatory sciences. They are therefore
                    constantly inclined to criticise, to jest, and to ridicule; for which reason the
                    professor should endeavour to inspire them with respect and attention, by a
                    grave, commanding, and venerable countenance, carefully avoiding all appearance
                    of grimace in his action, and every kind of affectation in his discourse, that
                    he may not afford the least opportunity for indulging in pleasantry.</p>
                <p>4. With regard to theatric declamation, this was very different among the
                    ancients from what it is and ought to be among us, both from the nature of the
                    thing itself, and from the difference of circumstances. Numberless passages in
                    Quintilian, and other ancient historians, critics, grammarians, and
                    commentators, evidently prove that the ancient dramatic declamation was
                    subservient to the rules of the musical rhythmus; and by this, according to
                    Aristides, their action, as well as recitation, was regulated. But to explain
                    this seeming paradox, it will be necessary here to make some preliminary
                    remarks. The ancients gave a much more extensive signification than we do to the
                    word <hi rend="italic">music,</hi> which they derived from the muses, or at
                    least from some of them. It is for this reason that Aristides and Quintilian
                    both defined it to be an art which teaches all that relates to the use of the
                    voice, and the manner of performing every motion of the body with grace: <hi
                    rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi rend="italic">decoris</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vocibus et motibus.</hi> Poetry, declamation, dancing, pantomimes,
                    and many other gestures and exercises, were therefore subservient to this
                    art.</p>
                <p>That part of general music which taught the art of declamation and gesture
                    according to the rules of an established method, and which we perform by
                    instinct, or at most by the aid of common sense, was distinguished by the name
                    <hi rend="italic">hypocritic music</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this musical
                    art was called by the Greeks <hi rend="italic">orchesis,</hi> and by the Romans
                    <hi rend="italic">saltatio.</hi> It was so far, however, from being an advantage
                    to the ancients to have had this art, which we have not, that it was, on the
                    contrary, a mark of great imperfection. For, in the first place, it was an
                    instance of great absurdity to represent a tragedy or comedy before an audience
                    of twenty thousand people, the far greater part of whom could neither hear nor
                    see what passed to any good purpose, unless they were possessed of organs which
                    we have not. The theatres of London and Paris can conveniently contain at the
                    most only a few thousand persons, and that is found sufficient in the most
                    populous cities, where there are several places of entertainment on the same
                    day, and where the people are reasonable enough to succeed one another in their
                    diversions. As the features of the face could not be distinguished at so great a
                    distance, and still less the expression of the countenance, so, in order to
                    represent the different passions, they were obliged to have recourse to <hi
                    rend="italic">masks,</hi> a wretched and childish invention, which destroyed all
                    the strength and variety of expression. Their action became extravagant, and at
                    the same time subservient to a regular mechanism, which prevented all the
                    refinement, and all the pleasure of surprise, in the performance, and must have
                    had an effect horribly disagreeable to those who had the misfortune to be placed
                    near the stage.</p>
                <p>The peculiar nature of their language too, which consisted of syllables long and
                    short, the duration of which was determined by a set measure of time, and their
                    manner of tuning these syllables, after the method of the orchesis of the
                    Greeks, was another disadvantage; for by this means they determined, by notes or
                    characters placed after the long and short syllables, not only the nature, but
                    the duration of each action. Now nothing could be more affected, more
                    constrained and disgusting, than such a method of declaiming. In this respect
                    the moderns, who consult nature alone in their theatric declamation, who can
                    make the audience hear each sigh, who can accompany it with a proper attitude,
                    who can incessantly vary their action, who can seize the lucky moment, and make
                    the countenance fully express the sensations of the mind, possess an immense
                    superiority over the ancients. Nature does all here; but art, infinitely
                    inferior to nature, did all among the ancients. Our actors learn their art
                    without art, from nature herself, assisted by reflection; and they arrive at a
                    degree of excellence infinitely greater than that of the ancients, by a method
                    far more simple, and by efforts incomparably more easy.</p>
                <p>We do not precisely know what the theatric declamation of the ancients really
                    was, nor what were the musical instruments which accompanied that declamation.
                    The proem to the Eunuch of Terence says, for example, that Flaccus, the freedman
                    of Claudius, composed the music of that piece, in which he employed the two
                    flutes, the right and the left; and these flutes, it is likely, gave the tone to
                    the actor, which must have had a very odd effect on the audience. Most of the
                    ancient pieces have similar notices prefixed to them. They who desire to be
                    particularly informed of the art of declaiming among the Greeks and Romans, may
                    read to advantage the Critical Reflections on Poetry and Painting by the Abbé du
                    Bos. The third part of that work consists entirely of learned researches and
                    ingenious reflections on this practice of the ancients. But as the art has
                    happily no place in modern declamation, and can at best serve only to make a
                    parade of erudition, we shall say no more of it in this place.</p>
                <p>We think there is good reason to believe, moreover, that the most polished
                    nations of modern Europe do not accompany their discourses in general with so
                    many gesticulations as did the Greeks, the Romans, and other inhabitants of warm
                    climates. They appear to have found the method of animating a discourse, and
                    giving it an expression, by the simple inflections of the voice, and by the
                    features of the countenance; which is far more decent, as well as juster and
                    more rational, than all those contortions which perpetually derange the natural
                    attitude of the body and its members, and give to the speaker the air of a
                    harlequin.</p>
                <p>Expression, therefore, forms at once the essence and the end of declamation; and
                    the means of producing it consists in a pronunciation that is sonorous,
                    distinct, and pleasing, supported by an action that is decent and proper to the
                    subject. If the best dramatic poet has need of a good declaimer or actor to make
                    his writings produce their proper effect, the actor has likewise need of a good
                    poet to enable him to please and affect by the action; for it is to little
                    purpose that he endeavours to charm his auditory by uniting with nature all the
                    powers of art, if the poet has not furnished him with sentiments which are
                    rational and affecting.</p>
