                    a ceremony originally used in the druidícal worship, and retained in many places
                    down to a very late period, as a civil ceremony towards persons of particular
                    distinction. The temples of the ancient Britons were all circular; and the
                    druids, in performing the public offices of their religion, never neglected to
                    make three turns round the altar, accompanied by all the worshippers. This
                    practice was so habitual to the ancient Britons, that it continued in some
                    places many ages after the druids and their religion were both destroyed. In the
                    Scottish islcs, the vulgar never come to the ancient sacrificing and
                    fire-hallowing cairns, but they walk three times round them, from east to west,
                    according to the course of the sun. This sanctified tour, or round by the south,
                    is called <hi rend="italic">deiscal,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">deas</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">dess,</hi> the right hand, and <hi rend="italic">soil</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">sul,</hi> the sun; the right hand being ever next the heap or
                    cairn. In the same isles it is the custom and fashion of the people to testify
                    their respect for their chieftains, the proprietors of their several isles, and
                    other persons of distinction, by performing the deiscal round them in the same
                    manner. A gentleman giving an account of his reception in one of the Western
                    Islands, of which he was proprietor, describes the ceremony of the deiscal in
                    this manner: “One of the natives would needs express his high esteem for my
                    person, by making a turn round about me, sun-ways, and at the same time blessing
                    me, and wishing me all happiness. But I bid him let alone that piece of homage,
                    telling him I was sensible of his good meaning towards me. But this poor man was
                    very much disappointed, as were also his neighbours; for they doubted not but
                    this ancient ceremony would have been very acceptable to me; and one of them
                    told me that this was a thing due to my character from them as to their chief
                    and patron, and that they could not, and would not, fail to perform it.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
