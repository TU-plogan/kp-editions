                <p><label type="entry">DAVY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Humphry</hi></label>. This
                    truly eminent man was born on the 17th of December 1778, in the small town of
                    Penzance, in Cornwall, of very respectable parents, in the humbler walks of
                    life. In that place he received the elements of his education, until 1793, when
                    he was removed to the grammar-school of Truro, then under the direction of the
                    Rev. Dr Cardew. There is scarcely any thing worthy of record in the early years
                    of Davy, except the facility with which he appears to have gleaned the substance
                    of any book that happened to engage his attention, and his early predilection
                    for poetry.</p>
                <p>No biography of Davy should omit the disinterested friendship of Mr Tonkin, a
                    respectable medical practitioner of Penzance. This amiable man had adopted the
                    mother of Davy and her sisters, under circumstances of deep distress; and his
                    kindness was extended to all her children, particularly Humphry, whose intended
                    professional career was probably influenced by that of his friend and
                    patron.</p>
                <p>In 1794 Davy lost his father, and his mother found herself under the necessity of
                    becoming a milliner in Penzance, whilst young Davy was, in 1795, apprenticed to
                    Mr Borlase, then practising as a surgeon-apothecary, but who afterwards became a
                    physician in that place.</p>
                <p>While yet very young, our philosopher had exhibited traces of an ardent,
                    inquisitive mind, an inclination for devising experiments, and for examining the
                    productions of nature. On entering the service of Mr Borlase, his attention was
                    turned to chemical investigations, which he pursued with a characteristic
                    enthusiasm, to the neglect of the humbler art of compounding medicines. His
                    chief laboratory at that time was the garret of his friend Mr Tonkin, who was
                    occasionally alarmed and annoyed by unexpected explosions. His defective
                    apparatus was supplied by the fertile resources of his own ingenuity. It was
                    during this period that he attempted to investigate the nature of the air
                    contained in the vesicles of sea-weed; and his ingenuity in supplying his want
                    of more perfect instruments is well illustrated in the facility with which he
                    contrived to supply the place of an air-pump, by an old French injecting
                    syringe, which accident put into his hands. With this he made several
                    experiments, and actually employed it as an air-pump, in his first original
                    paper on the Nature of Heat and Light.</p>
                <p>Davy was not of a temperament or cast of mind tQ remain long in obscurity. The
                    panting after scientific renown had early taken possession of his soul; and
                    while still the apothecary’s apprentice, and regarding medicine as his future
                    means of support, he felt aspirations after distinction in the paths of
                    philosophical discovery; but he was in some degree indebted for an earlier
                    emergence from the obscurity of his native place, to the accidental notice of Mr
                    Davies Giddy Gilbert. The attention of that gentleman had been arrested by the
                    strange contortions of countenance of an ungainly boy, whom he observed hanging
                    over the hatch-gate of Mr Borlase’s house; and on being informed that the boy
                    was “a son of Davy the carver, and very fond of making chemical experiments,” he
                    sought the acquaintance of young Davy, and was ever afterwards his steady
                    friend.</p>
                <p>Another accidental acquaintance was not without its influence on the fortunes of
                    Davy. The late Mr Gregory Watt, long an invalid, had been recommended by his
                    physicians to try the mild air of Cornwall, and took up his lodgings in the
                    house of Mrs Davy. Their first intercourse was not cordial. Watt was taciturn
                    and reserved; and young Davy, with that want of tact which is not uncommon at
                    his age, instead of endeavouring to recommend himself by showing his knowledge
                    of any branch of experimental or natural philosophy which he had studied, sought
                    to make an impression on the valetudinarian inmate of his mother’s house by
                    crude and flippant metaphysical speculations. Watt was disgusted, and retired
                    within himself, until an incidental remark of Davy on the imperfection of the
                    French theory of combustion and calcination arrested the attention of the
                    former. They then began to discuss questions congenial to the minds of both, and
                    soon became attached friends.</p>
                <p>It was through these two gentlemen that the subject of our memoir was introduced
                    to Dr Beddoes, who had visited Cornwall on a geological tour, in company with
                    his friend and philosophical opponent Professor Hailstone of Cambridge. The
                    abilities of Davy were favourably shown during the friendly contentions of these
                    rival geologists; and their judgment being advantageously impressed by the
                    encomiums of Gilbert and Watt, Davy was soon afterwards engaged by Dr Beddoes to
                    superintend a pneumatic medical institution, which that able but eccentric man
                    had just then established at Bristol, for the treatment of diseases.</p>
                <p>After some negociation, Davy, much to his own satisfaction, received the
                    appointment of superintendent, and repaired to Bristol in 1798, before he had
                    completed his twentieth year. Mr Borlase readily gave up Davy’s indenture; but
                    this removal was a severe disappointment to Mr Tonkin, who had placed his
                    fondest hopes on seeing his young friend settled as a practitioner in
                    Penzance.</p>
                <p>Davy was now placed in a sphere where his genius could expand; he associated with
                    men engaged in similar pursuits; he was provided with suitable apparatus; and he
                    speedily entered upon that brilliant career of discovery which has rendered his
                    name illustrious among philosophers. It was not his original intention to
                    abandon the study of medicine; but after his engagement with Dr Beddoes had
                    terminated, he had intended to prosecute his medical studies at Edinburgh; a
                    plan which he was induced to abandon by the all-engrossing interest of his
                    chemical discoveries.</p>
                <p>Soon after his removal to Bristol, his speculations on <hi rend="italic">Heat,
                    Light, and Respiration,</hi> appeared in Beddoes’s “West-Country Contributions.”
                    In that essay, written before he left Cornwall, he endeavoured to prove the
                    immateriality of heat, by showing its generation from the friction of two pieces
                    of ice under the exhausted receiver; but his reasoning on this point was
                    inconclusive, and his mode of insulating the ice very imperfect; whilst it is
                    well known that heat will radiate through the most perfect vacuum. His
                    speculations on Light and Respiration are extravagant, and savour little of the
                    spirit of philosophical induction. It was unfortunate for Davy that he had not a
                    more judicious adviser than Beddoes, a man totally devoid of philosophical
                    caution, and easily led astray by the loosest analogy.</p>
                <p>Davy’s first scientific discovery was the detection of siliceous earth in the
                    epidermis of the cannae, reeds, and grasses. Though the chain of induction be
                    simple, yet the steps give a favourable specimen of his method of investigating
                    phenomena. A child had accidentally discovered, that on rubbing together two
                    pieces of <hi rend="italic">bonnetcane,</hi> a faint light was emitted; on
                    examining the fact, he found, that on striking them together, vivid sparks were
                    produced, like those emitted by the collision of flint and steel. On stripping
                    off the epidermis the luminous property was lost, and analysis showed that the
                    epidermis contained silex. The shining appearance of the stems of reeds, corn,
                    and grasses, induced him to examine them also, and he found that they all
                    yielded silex, even in larger quantity than the cane.</p>
                <p>About the same period he made his first gaseous discovery, the respirability of
                    <hi rend="italic">nitrous oxide.</hi> The first intimation of its intoxicating
                    qualities is given in a letter to <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755566"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-5566-0638"/>his friend Mr Gilbert, dated April 16, 1799. Soon
                    after, he examined its properties more accurately, administered it to various
                    individuals, and published an account of his discoveries in a volume entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Researches Chemical and Philosophical, chiefly concerning
                    Nitrous Oxide and its</hi><hi rend="italic">Respiration.</hi> This essay
                    breathes a very different spirit from his first. It exhibits good models of
                    cautious induction from ingeniously contrived experiments, and shows a happy
                    talent for analyzing the different circumstances which influence the chemical
                    changes observed.</p>
                <p>Fortunately for Mr Davy, while the impression from this publication was still
                    fresh on the public mind, the establishment of the Royal Institution in London,
                    under the auspices of Count Rumford, had taken place; and a lecturer of talent
                    was wanting to fill the chemical chair. Dr Hope of Edinburgh has the merit of
                    thus early discovering the high talents of Davy, and of introducing him to the
                    notice of the count; and he was, in the beginning of 1801, chosen lecturer to
                    the institution, and director of the laboratory.</p>
                <p>It has been said, that on his first appearance in London, his ungainly exterior
                    had prejudiced Rumford and some other directors against him; but when he began
                    to lecture, he won the approbation of all. His lectures became a fashionable
                    lounge; his ingenuity and happy facility of illustration gained him a high
                    reputation; his company was courted by the choicest society of the metropolis;
                    and soon his presence was regarded as an indispensable requisite in the soirees
                    of the gay, the fair, and the noble. Adulation paid to talent became
                    fashionable; and at the early age of twenty-two Davy had triumphed over
                    considerable personal defects, and found himself the idol of an admiring
                    capital.</p>
                <p>Those who had enjoyed an opportunity of observing him at Bristol, had remarked
                    the simplicity of his mind and manner at that period; and they had noticed his
                    talent for discussing difficult questions, even where his information was
                    exceedingly defective. That the extravagant adulation of the metropolis, so soon
                    after his appearance there, should have been injurious to his native simplicity
                    of manner, is far less surprising, than that it did not entirely destroy that
                    ardour in research which conducted him to fame.</p>
                <p>Davy’s style of lecturing was well adapted to command the attention of his
                    audience; it was animated, clear, and impressive, notwithstanding the naturally
                    unharmonious tones of his voice; whilst the ingenuity of his happily devised
                    experiments, and the neatness of their execution, were calculated to fix the
                    attention of his hearers. How much these circumstances are calculated to affect
                    the usefulness and popularity of a teacher, is well illustrated by the different
                    impression made on nearly the same audience by the no less original but more
                    profound lectures of Dr Thomas Young, which were discontinued by the committee
                    of the Royal Institution two years after the appearance of Davy.</p>
                <p>The young chemist was fortunate in the time of his commencing his metropolitan
                    career. Experimental chemistry was beginning to be the fashion of the day, and
                    it was a very general topic of conversation among the upper circles. Voltaic
                    electricity had just been found to possess the most extraordinary powers of
                    effecting decompositions of chemical compounds; and innumerable experimental
                    chemists, aware of the field of discovery which this powerful instrument
                    promised to open to these researches, were most anxious to possess a powerful
                    galvanic battery. The liberality of the committee of the Royal Institution
                    supplied what few private individuals could afford; and early in his first
                    course as <hi rend="italic">professor</hi> of chemistry, Davy was put in
                    possession of a battery of four hundred five-inch plates, and one of forty
                    plates a foot in diameter. With these his early and most brilliant
                    investigations were conducted; and their liberality and his ingenuity were
                    rewarded by the discovery of the metallic bases of the alkalies.</p>
                <p>The first communication of Davy to the Royal Society was “an account of some
                    galvanic combinations formed by an arrangement of <hi rend="italic">single</hi>
                    metallic plates and fluids,” which was read in June 1801. This paper is the
                    first of that series of electro-chemical investigations which have immortalized
                    his name. In all hitherto constructed piles, the series had consisted of not
                    less than two metals, or of one plate of metal, another of charcoal, and some
                    interposed fluid. He showed in this paper, that the usual galvanic phenomena
                    might be energetically exhibited by a single metallic plate and two strata of
                    different fluids, or that a battery might be constructed of one metal and two
                    fluids, provided one of the fluids was capable of causing oxidation on one of
                    the surfaces of the metal. Between this communication and his next paper on
                    galvanic phenomena five years elapsed; a period during which many interesting
                    discoveries were made by other philosophers; but Davy had not been idle. In 1802
                    he was appointed professor to the board of agriculture; and, in addition to the
                    duties of his situation in the Royal Institution, to which that of joint editor
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> had been added, he gave a course of
                    lectures on the connection between agriculture and chemistry, which was annually
                    continued for ten successive years. In 1803 he was admitted a member of the
                    Royal Society, of which he became first the secretary, and ultimately the
                    president; and he continued to enrich the transactions with numerous memoirs on
                    different branches of experimental philosophy for twenty-five years. Indeed his
                    most valuable productions arc contained in the Philosophical Transactions; and
                    it is on these detached papers that his claims to celebrity almost entirely
                    rest. Of his other publications, the Elements of Chemical Philosophy was a
                    signal failure, and only the first volume ever saw the light. His Elements of
                    Agricultural Chemistry had some popularity, though they have scarcely added any
                    thing to our previous stock of knowledge; but there is scarcely one of his
                    communications to the Royal Society which does not announce some new and
                    important fact, or does not elucidate some general principle of experimental
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>He had undertaken to deliver some lectures on the principles of the art of
                    tanning, and had been furnished with the means of obtaining practical and
                    experimental knowledge on the subject. In the course of his preparation for
                    these lectures he discovered some new facts, which were first noticed in the
                    journals of the institution, and afterwards embodied in.an elaborate
                    communication to the Royal Society, entitled <hi rend="italic">An account of
                    some experiments and observations on the constituent parts of certain astringent
                    vegetables, and their operation in tanning,</hi> read in February 1803.</p>
                <p>In 1805 he read two papers to the Royal Society. The first was <hi rend="italic"
                    >An account of some analytic experiments</hi> on the Wavellite, which he
                    affirmed to consist of alumine and water. In this analysis he overlooked the
                    presence of fluate of alumine, which was detected in it by the Rev. William
                    Gregor; and still more unaccountably did both the British chemists fail to
                    detect in the mineral phosphate of alumine, which was found afterwards by
                    Berzelius to constitute one third of it. The second paper of Davy, <hi
                    rend="italic">On the method of analysing stones containing α fixed alkali, by
                    boracie acid,</hi> is really an important addition to analytic chemistry. His
                    method is founded on the strong affinity of that acid for different earths at
                    the point of incandescence, and on the ease with which these borates are
                    decomposed by the mineral acids.</p>

                <p>We now approach the period of Davy’s great discoveries.</p>
                <p>The power of the pile to effect decompositions was made in 1800 by Nicholson and
                    Carlisle, and immediately extended by Cruickshank. The appearance of alkalies
                    and acids at opposite poles of the battery had been noticed by different
                    philosophers, but it was reserved for Davy to connect these discoveries by one
                    general law, and to illustrate his theory of Voltaic action by some most happily
                    devised experiments, in the Bakerian lecture, read to the Royal Society in
                    November 1806. It will be sufficient to state, that he satisfactorily showed
                    that the liberation of acid at the positive pole, and of alkali at the negative
                    pole, proceeded entirely either from the decomposition of the vessels used in
                    the experiment, the impurity of the water subjected to analysis, or from the
                    elements of the atmosphere uniting with the hydrogen or oxygen of the water to
                    form ammonia or nitric acid. By a series of very elegantly conducted
                    experiments, he showed that in all Voltaic decompositions the tendency of the
                    electric action was to collect the acid of the compound at the positive wire,
                    and its bases, whether alkaline, earthy, or metallic, at the other pole. He
                    proved that such transfers were not confined to the immediate neighbourhood of
                    the poles, but extended through the whole galvanic circuit which connected them;
                    and that even an acid might be conveyed from one ware to the other, <hi
                    rend="italic">through</hi> an alkaline, earthy, or metallic solution, without
                    entering into union with it, provided the substance transferred did not form an
                    insoluble compound with the interposed solution. When it did form an insoluble
                    compound, it was withdrawn from the Voltaic action, and consequently its
                    transference was stopped. After examining a great number of such phenomena, he
                    generalized the results by stating, that hydrogen, the alkalis, earths, metals,
                    and certain oxides, are attracted by negatively electrified, and repelled by
                    positively electrified metallic surfaces; that oxygen and acids are attracted by
                    positively, and repelled by negatively electrified metallic surfaces.</p>
                <p>After these practical elucidations, Davy proceeded to investigate the law of
                    electro-chemical action. In repeating and extending the researches of Bennet,
                    Cavallo, and Volta, on the electricity evolved by the contact of bodies, Davy
                    showed, that substances capable of chemical union exhibited unequivocal symptoms
                    of opposite electrical states; that the mutual chemical attraction of the
                    elements of a compound are subverted by inducing an electrical state opposite to
                    that natural to them; while their chemical union is promoted by increasing their
                    natural electric energies. Hence he drew the inferences, that electro-chemical
                    combinations and decompositions are referable to the law of electric attractions
                    and repulsions, and that both “chemical and electrical attractions are produced
                    by the same cause, acting in the one case on the particles, in the other on the
                    masses.”</p>
                <p>The whole of this beautiful memoir is a happy example of most admirably devised
                    experiments, legitimate deductions, or ingenious inferences. What is fully
                    established, is carefully discriminated from what rests on probable conjecture;
                    and it raised the reputation of Davy to the highest pitch. It procured for him
                    not only the willing homage of his own countrymen, but it was crowned by the
                    French Institute with the medal of three thousand francs, founded by the first
                    consul for the encouragement of discoveries in galvanism; a proud triumph of
                    scientific reputation over national jealousy, and the implacable acrimony of our
                    then national hostility.</p>
                <p>Davy’s next discovery was the most brilliant of all, though it may be questioned
                    whether it is that which places his talents in the highest point of view. The
                    decomposition of the alkalies by galvanism had been a favourite speculation with
                    several philosophers; but the want of a sufficient power had always opposed an
                    obstacle to success. Davy had the command of vast galvanic power, and applied it
                    to this problem. His first attempts were made on solutions of potash, without
                    effect; his next efforts were made on fused potash placed on a disc of platina,
                    connected with the negative pole, and having its upper surface in contact with
                    the positive wire. The potash began to fuse; strong effervescence took place at
                    the positive wire, while metallic globules appeared at the other, which
                    continued to form, and speedily to burn and explode with a very bright flame. He
                    soon discovered a method of repressing their combustibility, by investing them
                    with a film of naphtha; by which means he was enabled to collect the metallic
                    globules for examination.</p>
                <p>He found that they were so light as to float in every fluid except recently
                    distilled naphtha; that they had the brilliancy of mercury; that at the ordinary
                    temperature of the air they are malleable, and so soft as to be spread out with
                    a knife; that this metal melts at about 150° Fahrenheit, but at 32° it is a hard
                    crystalline solid, brittle, and extremely splendent; and that in all its states
                    it is a perfect conductor of electricity; in short, that it possessed every
                    general property hitherto recognised in metals, except its extremely low
                    specific gravity. The metallic globules were soon converted into potash in the
                    air; and when brought into contact with water, or even with ice, instantly took
                    fire and burnt, giving rise to potash. The effervescence at the opposite pole he
                    ascertained to be owing to the evolution of oxygen gas. To the metal thus
                    obtained he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">potassium.</hi> The rapidity and
                    energy with which potassium attracts oxygen from almost all bodies, showed that
                    it is a valuable instrument of analysis in the hands of the chemist. Davy
                    pursued a similar process with pure soda, and obtained from it a metal of
                    analogous properties, to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sodium.</hi></p>
                <p>This splendid discovery appears to have been made in October 1807, was read in
                    November of that year to the Royal Society; and in the following year the
                    results of Davy were fully confirmed by Gay-Lussac and Thénard, who succeeded in
                    decomposing potash by iron filings in a red-hot gun-barrel. In the Bakerian
                    lecture of 1807, Davy mentions the probability of the earths having also
                    metallic bases; but his discoveries were suspended, and very nearly closed for
                    ever, by a severe illness, attended with fever and delirium, which attacked him
                    soon after the reading of his second Bakerian lecture, the consequence of severe
                    bodily exertion and high mental excitement. In March 1808 hewasable to resume
                    his labours; but during this interval, baryta and lime had been decomposed by
                    Berzelius and Pontin, who obtained the result by negatively electrifying mercury
                    in contact with portions of the pure earths. Their oxygen was thus driven off,
                    and their bases united into amalgams with the mercury.</p>
                <p>These experiments were communicated to Davy, who, in June 1808, read a memoir on
                    that subject to the Royal Society. His paper then describes the amalgamation of
                    strontia, and his process for obtaining the amalgam from magnesia. He also
                    stated that he had succeeded in obtaining the metal of barytes from the amalgam;
                    that it was white like silver, of a higher specific gravity than water, and
                    fluid below a red heat. He attempted unsuccessfully to decompose argil, silex,
                    and zircon, though the results showed a high probability of their having
                    metallic bases. The curious experiment of amalgamating ammonia had occurred to
                    Berzelius and Pontin, and they had communicated the result to Davy. This new
                    subject he pursued with eagerness, and confirmed their results, but <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194755592" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5592-0640"/> could not succeed
                    in distilling off, as he seems to have expected, the compound metallic basis; an
                    idea founded on analogy, but not very probable. It is needless to discuss the
                    various conjectures on the nature of the new metals of the alkalies and earths,
                    to which the discoveries of Davy gave rise; some of the ablest chemists of the
                    day considered them as probable compounds of <hi rend="italic">hydrogen,</hi>
                    with some unknown bases. This opinion has not derived any confirmation from
                    subsequent research; and, with regard to the ammoniacal amalgam, it is now
                    generally regarded, not as a true metallic alloy, but as a species of mechanical
                    mixture of ammonia, or its elements, with mercury.</p>
                <p>The third Bakerian lecture, read in December 1808, and its appendix of next
                    spring, contain an account of various attempts to effect the decomposition of
                    certain bodies which had not been resolved into their elements. The subjects
                    discussed in this paper were handled with his usual ingenuity; but his success
                    did not equal his own or the public expectation. The only certain result was the
                    proof that hydrogen could not be obtained by any known means from potassium, and
                    that therefore we ought to consider it as a simple body.</p>
                <p>In his experiments on ammonia, by the medium of potassium, he obtained an
                    olive-coloured substance, which he considered as an amalgam, and appears to have
                    been sanguine in the idea that he had decomposed nitrogen in this process; but
                    was afterwards compelled to admit his failure. His next inquiries were into the
                    nature of sulphur, phosphorus, and carbon, which he suspected to contain
                    hydrogen, and his experiments led him to believe that these substances contained
                    minute quantities of both; but his conclusions are now considered as erroneous,
                    and the minute portion of hydrogen obtained is regarded as due to the presence
                    of water in the inflammables, or to the obstinacy with which some of them absorb
                    and retain different gases. The third subject discussed was the nature of
                    boracic acid, from which he obtained a basis, by him then considered as of a
                    metallic nature; but he was anticipated on this subject by Gay-Lussac and
                    Thenard, who investigated the subject more completely, established the analogy
                    of the radicle of boracic acid with carbon, and the substance is now called <hi
                    rend="italic">boron.</hi> The other subject of inquiry, “The Nature of Muriatic
                    and Oxymuriatic Acids,” is remarkable as an ingenious defence of a theory of
                    their formation, which he mainly contributed some time afterwards to
                    overthrow.</p>
                <p>It may be interesting to remark, that the original 500 plate batteries of the
                    institution were so worn in the course of Davy’s experiments as to be
                    unserviceable; but a liberal voluntary subscription among the members, in July
                    1808, put him in possession of the most powerful Voltaic battery ever
                    constructed, consisting of 2000 double plates, with a surface equal to 128,000
                    square inches. The results, however, produced with this stupendous power did not
                    add one new fact of any importance to science. All Davy’s splendid Voltaic
                    discoveries were made before it was in use, and it only served to show the
                    phenomena of galvanism with greater brilliancy.</p>
                <p>The fourth Bakerian lecture, read in November 1809, contained the same views, and
                    added little to scientific discovery, though every part of it exhibits the
                    talent and ingenuity of the author; but in his researches on oxymuriatic acid,
                    and on the elements of muriatic acid, we find Davy overturning the theory he had
                    laboured to defend in former Bakerian lectures, adducing new proofs of the
                    oxymuriatic acid being a simple body, and muriatic acid a compound of that body
                    and hydrogen.</p>
                <p>It had indeed been previously shown by Cruickshank, that the mixture of
                    oxymuriatic acid and hydrogen, in equal proportions, produces common muriatic
                    acid; and the same fact had been more thoroughly investigated by Gay-Lussac and
                    Thenard, who proved that no water is formed during the process, and that, in all
                    cases where oxygen is evolved from oxymuriatic acid, water is always present,
                    and muriatic acid invariably appears. Davy not only confirmed and extended the
                    experiments of these philosophers, but, as it appears to us, has an undoubted
                    claim to priority in deducing from the facts the legitimate consequence, viz.
                    that oxymuriatic acid is, as Scheele, its discoverer, had supposed, a simple
                    body; and that muriatic acid is a compound of hydrogen and that body, for which
                    he proposed the name of <hi rend="italic">chlorine.</hi></p>
                <p>In his Bakerian lecture in 1810, and in his essay read February 1811, he
                    considers the changes which these views render necessary in chemical
                    nomenclature, and announces the discovery of a compound of chlorine and oxygen,
                    to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">euchlorinx, a</hi> term which has
                    been since changed for the more appropriate appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >protoxide of chlorine,</hi> to distinguish it from another compound of these
                    substances, which he discovered while in Italy in 1815, and which is termed the
                    <hi rend="italic">peroxide of chlorine.</hi> While on this subject, we may <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> remark, that this latter was discovered while engaged
                    in a controversy with Gay-Lussac on the nature of <hi rend="italic">chloric
                    acid,</hi> the discovery of the latter; in which, we are compelled to say,
                    neither the temper nor the philosophic dignity of our countryman appear to
                    advantage.</p>
                <p>The reputation of Mr Davy was now at its zenith; and he was invited by the Dublin
                    Society to give a course of lectures on <hi rend="italic">electro-chemical
                    science,</hi> which he commenced on the 8th November, and concluded on the 29th
                    of that month, in 1810, and for which he received 500 guineas. The Dublin
                    Society, in the íbllowing year, invited him to give two courses, one on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of Chemical Philosophy,</hi> and the other on <hi
                    rend="italic">Geology,</hi> for which he was remunerated by a sum of L.750; and
                    the Provost and Fellows of Trinity College did themselves honour by investing
                    Davy with the degree of LL. D.</p>
                <p>In 1811 our author was employed to adopt some means for ventilating the House of
                    Commons; a task which he seems to have undertaken without any previous study of
                    the subject; for his attempts were a signal failure, from a miscalculation of
                    the diameter of the pipes necessary to carry off the vitiated and to supply
                    fresh air to so large a building, and became a source of considerable
                    mortification to himself, as well as of malignant pleasantry to the witlings of
                    that period.</p>
                <p>In the following year, the connection between Davy and the Royal Institution was
                    dissolved, by his giving his farewell lecture on the 9th April 1812.</p>
                <p>On the preceding day, he had received the honour of knighthood from the hands of
                    the prince regent; and on the 11th of that month he was married to Mrs Apreece,
                    daughter and heiress of Charles Kerr, Esq. of Kelso, and the possessor of an
                    ample fortune.</p>
                <p>This important step is admitted by his warmest friends to have produced a change
                    in the deportment of Davy. From that time he seemed to regard patrician rank,
                    and the adventitious distinctions of society, with no philosophic indifference;
                    and he is alleged to have lowered his ambition to meaner objects than were to be
                    won on the fields of scientific investigation.</p>
                <p>During the next two or three years, Sir Humphry Davy produced little important to
                    science; and we find him rather following than directing the steps of others. He
                    made two communications to the Royal Society in 1812. The first was on <hi
                    rend="italic">Some Compminds of Phosphorus and Sulphur,</hi> in which the most
                    important matters are two new definite compounds of phosphorus and chlorine, and
                    a proposition to name all the precipitates from aqueous solutions <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194755605" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5605-0641"/><hi rend="italic"
                    >hydrats,</hi> because he found them to contain water in definite proportion.
                    The name was unfortunate, especially as in the same paper he had proposed the
                    prefix <hi rend="italic">hydro</hi> for compounds into which hydrogen entered as
                    a definite ingredient. In the second paper he described a detonating compound of
                    chlorine and nitrogen, but which had been some time before discovered in France.
                    The first, and, as it proved, the only volume, ever published of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of Chemical Philosophy</hi> appeared in 1812; and in the
                    following year he published his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Agricultural
                    Chemistry,</hi> the substance of the lectures which he had some years before
                    delivered to the Board of Agriculture. His paper on fluoric acid read in 1813 to
                    the Royal Society, was little more than a confirmation of the analytic
                    experiments of Ampere, who established that the base of fluoric acid unites with
                    oxygen to form that acid, and that acid with boron to form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >βuoboric acid.</hi></p>
                <p>In the latter part of 1813, Sir Humphry Davy obtained the permission of the
                    French emperor to travel in France; and in October of that year he went, with
                    his lady and Mr Faraday, to the Continent. His visit to Paris brought him
                    personally acquainted with the principal French <hi rend="italic">savans,</hi>
                    among whom he particularly singled out Ampere as his chosen friend; but this
                    feeling was at a subsequent period, we are grieved to say, changed into one of
                    bitter hatred on the part of Davy; who so far forgot himself as to exert all his
                    influence to prevent Ampere’s election as a foreign member of the London Royal
                    Society.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable circumstance arising out of Davy’s visit to Paris was the
                    proof it afforded of his utter want of any relish for the sublimest productions
                    of the pencil and the chisel, with which the French capital then abounded. He
                    was well received by the French philosophers; he was honoured by their
                    flattering attentions; but we are constrained to say that he returned their
                    courtesies with an arrogance and ridiculous affectation of superiority, which
                    justly offended, and tended much more to lower English philosophy than to
                    elevate Davy in their estimation. This was peculiarly unfortunate; for every
                    little feeling of national jealousy seems to have been banished from their
                    minds, and we fear that the odium of want of cordiality must rest with our
                    countryman. But another act of ill-judged interference completed the disgust
                    which his absurd conduct in other respects had excited. Before the time of
                    Davy’s visit to France, Courtois had discovered <hi rend="italic">iodine,</hi>
                    and Gay-Lussac and Thenard were engaged upon its properties. Some of that
                    substance was given to Davy by Ampere, and he immediately began to examine it.
                    On the 11th of December he offered to the Institute a general view of its nature
                    and relations, and transmitted to London an account of its properties, which was
                    read to the Royal Society on the 20th of January 1814. This paper is introduced
                    with the remark that “Gay-Lussac is still engaged in experiments on this
                    subject; and from his activity and great sagacity a complete chemical history of
                    it maybe anticipated.” This priority of occupation ought to have prevented Davy
                    from the ungenerous anticipation.</p>
                <p>From Paris Davy proceeded, in the end of December, to Montpellier, and from
                    thence to Italy by the Col de Tende. At Genoa and Florence he continued his
                    experiments on iodine, which he obtained from the ashes of various fusci. At the
                    latter place he made experiments also on the combustion of the diamond with the
                    great lens in the cabinet of natural history; and he discovered that, after the
                    diamond has been once ignited, it will continue to burn with splendour in pure
                    oxygen, though the source of heat has been withdrawn. Thence he proceeded by
                    Rome to Naples, where he was engaged on observations on the phenomena of
                    Vesuvius, and collected specimens of the colours used by the ancients in their
                    pictures, which formed the subject of a memoir to the Royal Society. The most
                    interesting part of this paper is, that the fine blues of the ancients were
                    formed of silex, soda, and copper; and that they may be exactly imitated by
                    strongly heating together three parts of copper filings, fifteen parts of
                    carbonate of soda, and twenty of powdered flint, for two hours. After spending
                    the winter in Italy, he returned on the 23d of April to London.</p>
                <p>The year 1816 is memorable in the history of Sir Humphry Davy, as that in which
                    he turned his attention to a method of preventing the dreadful accidents from
                    explosions of fire-damp in coal-mines. The frequent accidents in the Newcastle
                    and Sunderland collieries from such explosions had given rise to the formation
                    of a society for ascertaining how they could be prevented; and the Reverend Dr
                    Gray, the president, requested Davy’s opinion. After he had visited the mines,
                    specimens of fire-damp were transmitted to him in London. He began by an
                    analysis of the gas, and by ascertaining the limits of its exploding properties.
                    He found that it would not explode when mixed with less than six times, or with
                    more than fourteen times its volume of atmospheric air; that air rendered impure
                    by the combustion of a candle will not explode firedamp, though the candle will
                    still burn for a time; that if a candle be burnt in a close vessel, with small
                    apertures only above and below the flame, no explosion will take place, even in
                    an exploding mixture; that in this case the flame within will be enlarged, but
                    no explosion will reach outward; and that the gas from mines will not explode in
                    a tube less than one eighth inch in diameter.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This last fact was discovered, however, long
                    before by Grotthus, and was by the late Dr Murray of Edinburgh applied, at the
                    very time Davy was engaged on the subject, to the construction of a safety-lamp
                    for mines, which may be seen in the Edinburgh Philosophical
                    Transactions.</p></note> From these principles, Davy proposed several different
                    lamps, some of which strongly resemble the contemporary inventions of Murray and
                    Clauny; but all were finally superseded by the simple lamp of Davy, in which a
                    small oil light was covered by a cylinder of wire gauze.</p>
                <p>The introduction of this beautiful invention was for a time violently opposed by
                    prejudice and passion; but the experience of the miners of Britain, Belgium, and
                    other countries, has confirmed its utility and comparative safety. This triumph
                    of Davy’s genius, exerted as it was in the cause of suffering humanity, is the
                    noblest monument to his fame; and the debt of gratitude is enhanced by the
                    disinterested manner in which his discovery was freely communicated, without any
                    idea of a pecuniary reward. The coal-owners of Newcastle and its vicinity,
                    impressed with the important services conferred on them by Davy’s discovery,
                    presented him with a superb service of plate, embellished with a suitable
                    inscription.</p>
                <p>The succeeding years of the life of Sir Humphry Davy, though they do not present
                    any remarkable discoveries, were by no means spent in inactivity. The world is
                    usually unjust in its anticipations from those who have done much, and is apt to
                    feel disappointment at any symptom of relaxation in those who have contributed
                    most to the public excitement.</p>
                <p>In 1815, 1816, and 1817, he read various communications to the Royal Society on
                    the subject of fire-damp, and on the nature of flame, for which he received the
                    Rumford medals. In 1818 and 1819 he produced four memoirs “On the fallacy of the
                    experiments in which Water is said to have been produced by the decomposition of
                    Chlorine,” on “Some Combinations of Phosporus,” “Observations<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194755618" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5618-0642"/> on the Formation of Mists
                    over Lakes and Rivers,” “On Electro-magnetism.” In 1818 Sir Humphry, who had
                    made some previous experiments on unrolling the papyri of Herculaneum, was sent
                    by the British government to examine the manuscripts in the Neapolitan museum,
                    in order to attempt on the spot their evolution. He soon satisfied himself that
                    these papyri had not been charred, but altered by the percolation of water, or
                    merely by the application of tuffaceous ashes. His remarks on them, contained in
                    his paper to the Royal Society in 1821, are highly ingenious, but no success
                    attended his labours, probably front the unfortunately irremediable condition of
                    the Herculanean papyri; but he also hints at obstructions thrown in his way by
                    the persons employed in the museum. During this excursion, he published at
                    Naples an account of the thermal baths of Lucia, from the waters of which are
                    deposited silica and oxide of iron, which he conjectures to have been held
                    together in solution in the bowels of the earth; and he inferred that the oxide
                    of iron was held in solution as a <hi rend="italic">protoxide</hi> by silica,
                    which, with Berzelius, he conceived to act the part of an acid.</p>
                <p>In 1820 Davy returned to England, and on the death of Sir Joseph Banks, in that
                    year, was elected President of the Royal Society. The opinions of members were
                    divided between him and Dr Wollaston; but the latter peremptorily refused to be
                    put in nomination, and lent all his influence to support the pretensions of the
                    former. It is doubtful how far Sir Humphry’s pursuits and temperament qualified
                    him for filling this station with advantage to the society. With regard to his
                    high claims to the distinction, there can only be one opinion; but unfortunately
                    he lent himself to the petty cabals of a coterie during his possession of the
                    chair. His ill-concealed partiality for the aristocracy of birth over that from
                    which he alone drew his own rank, the <hi rend="italic">aristocracy of
                    talent</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the preposterous assumption in his own
                    person, on some occasions, of a patrician haughtiness, and a neglect of the
                    ordinary courtesies of society, procured him many enemies; and when he resigned
                    the chair, he had become one of the most unpopular presidents that bad for years
                    ruled the society.</p>
                <p>In the year 1821-22, he continued to make some experiments on electro-magnetism,
                    and electricity m <hi rend="italic">vacuo,</hi> but in his results he was
                    anticipated by other observers; and in his memoir on electrical phenomena <hi
                    rend="italic">in vacuo,</hi> he has not arrived at any definite conclusion,
                    except that electric light, and attractions and repulsions, may be exhibited in
                    the most perfect vacuum we can form. In his paper on the fluids contained in the
                    cavities of natural crystals, Davy showed that these cavities were filled with
                    fluids less dense than those under atmospheric pressure; and he thence inferred
                    that such crystals must have had an igneous origin. In most of his experiments
                    the fluid seems to have been water; but in some later investigations,
                    particularly in those of Dr Brewster, the fluids in crystals appear to be more
                    varied in their nature.</p>
                <p>In 1823 the interesting discovery by Mr Faraday, of the condensation of certain
                    gases by mechanical pressure, induced Sir Humphry Davy to repeat the experiment;
                    and he succeeded, by heating them in strong sealed tubes, to convert sulphurous
                    acid and prussic acid gases into liquids. His paper on this subject contains
                    some rather fanciful conjectures on the probable application of these condensed
                    gases as mechanical powers.</p>
                <p>In the same year he investigated the cause of the rapid decay of copper sheathing
                    on ships. The subject was proposed by the admiralty to the president and council
                    of the Royal Society, and Sir Humphry undertook the investigation of the cause,
                    and its remedy. It occurred to him, that as sea-water only acts on the copper
                    when it is in a <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> state of electricity; if he
                    could render it slightly <hi rend="italic">negative,</hi> it would be defended
                    from the action of sea-water. For this purpose he attached to plates of copper
                    portions of iron or of zinc, and he had the satisfaction of finding that they
                    remained unchanged on immersion in sea-water. He therefore communicated to
                    government, in January 1824, his discovery of a remedy for the defects of copper
                    sheathing; and immediate orders were given to put his scheme into practice on a
                    cutter, while models were fitted up and floated in sea-water at Somerset House.
                    These trials appeared so perfectly satisfactory, that immediately orders were
                    issued to apply plates of iron, or <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >protectors'</hi> as they were called, to many ships belonging to the royal
                    navy; and many merchant-men were fitted out with the same.</p>
                <p>A short experience however showed, that though the copper was protected from
                    corrosion, an unlooked-for evil of another kind speedily arose. The bottoms of
                    the “protected” ships soon became extremely foul. The negative state of the
                    copper sheathing favoured the deposition of the calcareous matter from
                    sea-water, the growth of seaweeds, and the adhesion of enormous <hi
                    rend="italic">lepades</hi> and <hi rend="italic">balani</hi> everywhere to the
                    copper; so as most seriously to impede the sailing of the ships. This was
                    proved, not only in the navy, but extensively in the merchant service in London,
                    Liverpool, and other sea-ports; so that in spite of the ridiculous attempts of a
                    <hi rend="italic">clique</hi> of the pretended friends of our philosopher at
                    first to deny, and afterwards to conceal the facts, orders were everywhere given
                    to remove the protectors. This was a severe mortification to Davy, whose temper
                    it appears greatly to have ruffled. He had read an elaborate memoir on the
                    subject to the society in June 1825, and the navy order for the discontinuance
                    of the protectors followed in July. The infirm state of Sir Humphry’s health
                    probably increased his irritability; and much of what has been placed to the
                    mortification of unsuccessful exertion, and sensibility to ill-applied and
                    unjust sarcasm on this occasion, ought, in all probability, to be ascribed to
                    the approaches of disease, that was undermining the constitution of the
                    philosopher. In 1826 his health had visibly declined, and his friends began to
                    perceive that he was with difficulty able to indulge in his favourite sports of
                    angling and shooting. On returning to London from Somersetshire he was unable to
                    attend the anniversary dinner of the Royal Society. In January 1827 he published
                    his six anniversary discourses on awarding the royal and Copley medals. Early in
                    1827 he went abroad, and soon reached Ravenna, where he seemed to derive some
                    intermission of his ailments, which he describes as arising “from determination
                    of blood to the brain; at last producing the most alarming nervous symptoms, and
                    threatening the loss of power and life.” In the summer, to avoid the heats, he
                    removed to Salzburg, from which city he sent in his resignation of the
                    president’s chair of the Royal Society, from a conviction of the necessity of
                    mental and bodily repose. In the end of autumn he returned to England, and
                    removed to London in the winter, where he published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salmonia</hi> in the spring of 1828. This work, though inferior in interest to
                    the delightful pages of Isaac Walton, in imitation of which it is written, is
                    yet an interesting performance.</p>
                <p>Shortly before Davy quitted England, he communicated to the Royal Society his
                    paper on Volcanoes, chiefly from observations made on Vesuvius in 1820; in which
                    he advocates the idea that volcanic phenomena depend on the oxidation of the
                    bases of the alkalies and earths (an opinion which was before maintained by
                    Humboldt), while Davy at the same time thinks that there are strong proofs, in
                    the increasing temperature as we descend in mines, of a central fire.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755631" xml:id="kp-eb0707-5631-0643"/>
                <p>In 1828 Sir Humphry Davy quitted his native country for the last time, and spent
                    the summer and autumn in his favourite amusement of angling and in shooting near
                    Laybach. In the winter he descended into Italy, and fixed his residence at Rome,
                    whence he sent his last communication to the Royal Society, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Remarks on the Electricity of the Torpedo,</hi> which was written in Illyria in
                    October. The chief peculiarity of this paper is his finding that the electricity
                    of the torpedo has no effect on the most delicate galvanometer, which he
                    ascribes to the torpedo’s influence being exerted, not in a continued stream,
                    but in instantaneous and successive shocks; an idea confirmed by the same want
                    of magnetic influence in moderate shocks from the Leyden phial.</p>
                <p>Sir Humphry had suffered from a previous paralytic attack; at Rome he had
                    another, which greatly alarmed his friends, and made his wife and his brother
                    hasten to his assistance. They were soon with him; and he having become eager to
                    quit Rome for Geneva, the party set out by easy journeys for the latter place.
                    On the 28th May he slept at Chambery, and at three next afternoon arrived at
                    Geneva, dined heartily at four o’clock, and was unusually cheerful. During the
                    night an attack of apoplexy came on, and he expired at three o’clock in the
                    morning of the 30th May 1829. His remains were deposited, with all the honours
                    which a public funeral could bestow, in the State where he had breathed his
                    last.</p>
                <p>A posthumous work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Consolations</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >in Travel, or the Last Days of a Philosopher,</hi> shows a high degree of
                    fancy, and an almost poetic inspiration; and, whether we regard the matter or
                    the manner, is an evident offspring of a bold imagination.</p>
                <p>We have sufficiently characterized the various productions of this eminent man in
                    our review of his life. We have alluded to those little infirmities which mix
                    themselves with the aspirations of genius with no unfriendly intention. They are
                    specks on its bright mirror, which they do not obscure; but as every thing
                    connected with such a man belongs to history, they should not be passed over in
                    silence; for while the example of his great qualities are held up to animate the
                    exertions of unfriended talent struggling with obscurity, the consequences of
                    his infirmities may become valuable lessons to check the presumption of
                    successful genius. (ι. ι. ι.)</p>
