                    extensive and rich district in the eastern quarter of the province of Bengal,
                    situated principally between the twenty-third and twenty-fourth degrees of north
                    latitude. It is bounded on the north by Mymunsingh, on the south by Tipperah and
                    Backergunge, on the east by Tipperah, and on the west by Rajshahy and Jessore.
                    Prior to the arrangement adopted in 1800, by which this province was separated
                    from the Backergunge jurisdiction, it was one of the largest and most valuable
                    in Bengal, stretching as far south as the sea, and reaching north to the Garrow
                    Mountains. The country is divided into a great number of valuable zemindaries or
                    estate^, and is extremely productive in rice, being esteemed the granary of
                    Bengal. It is intersected by the Ganges and Brahmaputra, two of the largest
                    rivers in the world, which, with their branches crossing the country in all
                    directions, form a complete inland navigation, every town and village having its
                    canal or river, and the general mode of travelling or conveying goods being by
                    water. By the confluence of these two great rivers rushing impetuously to the
                    sea, great changes are often made in the boundaries of estates, the river
                    encroaching on some parts and abandoning others. Hence it almost invariably
                    happens that as much is gained on one side as is lost on the other by the
                    operation of the current and the opposing tides; whilst repeated overflowings,
                    with rich deposits of mould washed down by the stream, give extraordinary
                    fertility to the extensive inundated borders of the river. But notwithstanding
                    this advantage, there is no district in Bengal where there is a greater quantity
                    of waste land, the whole of which is claimed by individuals who, though they do
                    not cultivate it themselves, always exact a recompense for the use of it from
                    others. Rice is the great staple product of the land, of which the abundance and
                    cheapness is extraordinary, being sold in years of plenty at the rate of 640
                    lbs. per rupee. Its other productions are betel nut; a species of cotton
                    necessary to form the stripes of the finest muslins, for which the city of Dacca
                    has long been celebrated; and also tobacco.</p><p>This province is distinguished for its various and extensive fabrics of cotton.
                    It has manufactures of plain as well as flowered, striped, or chequered muslins;
                    and the beautiful fabrics of Dacca surpass in fineness the produce of any other
                    country. Yet the natives assert that the art has fallen off, and that when the
                    Mogul court was in full splendour, pieces were made so fine that they could only
                    be woven under water, and when spread on the grass could scarcely be
                    distinguished from the morning dew. But the demand for these finer muslins has
                    now fallen off so much, that many of the families who possess by hereditary
                    instruction the art of making these fabrics, have desisted, on account of the
                    difficulty which they experience in finding a market for them. In many parts of
                    India the native fabrics are rivalled by the manufactures of Britain, which
                    being chiefly the produce of machinery, can, after bearing the expense of a long
                    voyage, be sold cheaper in India than the produce of domestic industry. Dimities
                    of various kinds and patterns, and cloths resembling diaper and damask linen,
                    are also made. The export of all these articles has, however, greatly decreased.
                    This country is entirely alluvial, and in the rainy season is mostly overflowed,
                    exhibiting the appearance of an inland sea, with towns and villages rising out
                    of the water. The principal towns of this district are Dacca, Narraingunge,
                    Sunergong, and Rajanagur. During the Mahommedan government this district was
                    ruled by a deputy of the nabob, called the naib nazim. The last person who held
                    the office was Jessarut Khan, who having been ordered by Cossim Ali Khan in the
                    year 1763 to put all the English at Dacca to death, very humanely sent them
                    under the protection of a trusty guard <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754825" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4825-0581"/>to Calcutta,
                    for which service he afterward? received a pension, which was continued to his
                    descendants. The population is estimated at about one million, the majority of
                    whom are Mahommedans.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dacca,</hi> the capital of the above district, a large city,
                    and for eighty years the capital of Bengal, of which it is still the third city
                    in point of extent and population. It is situated beyond the principal stream of
                    the Ganges, on the northern bank of a very large branch of that river, called
                    the Boor Gunga, or Old Ganges, at the distance of a hundred miles from the mouth
                    of the Ganges, or four, hundred by the winding course of the river. Its position
                    is admirably well adapted for inland trade, as the river which flows past it
                    communicates with all the other inland navigations by a direct course. Dacca
                    succeeded to Sunergong as the provincial capital of the eastern quarter of
                    Bengal. The present town covers a great deal of ground, extending, if the
                    suburbs be .included, six miles along the banks of the river, though it is not
                    of proportional breadth. The houses of the wealthy are built of brick, but there
                    are many thatched houses, with very narrow and crooked streets; the bazars are
                    only tiled or thatched; and as every vacant spot is covered with trees, the town
                    looks from a distance like a grove. The ancient citadel was situated on the
                    western side of the town; but it is now in ruins, great part of the wall having
                    been washed away by the river. An extensive and magnificent palace, built by
                    Azim Ushaun, Aurungzebe’s grandson, who resided here towards the end of the
                    seventeenth century, is also in ruins.</p><p>In Dacca and the vicinity are manufactured the most beautiful muslins, which are
                    exported to all quarters of the world, and which have been long famed for their
                    delicacy and beauty. The same violent heats do not prevail here as in Benares,
                    Patna, and other places in Bahar. This is owing to the low lying situation of
                    the surrounding country, which is always covered with verdure, even during the
                    dry months. The unhealthy season is in autumn, from the 20th of August to the
                    10th of October, when the rivers and the inundation are subsiding. During the
                    remainder of the year the city and its vicinity is salubrious and pleasant,
                    though the climate is more relaxing than that of the northern or western
                    provinces.</p><p>Dacca is comparatively a modern city, its name not being mentioned in the Ayeen
                    Acberry In 1608 the seat of government was removed from Rajemul to the city of
                    Dacca; and in compliment to the reigning emperor, Jehangire, its name was
                    changed to Jehangire Nuggur. During the Mogul government, a large establishment
                    of war and state boats, consisting of 768 armed cruizers, was maintained at
                    Dacca, for the purpose of defending the country against the Mughs and the people
                    of Assam, and occasionally to add splendour to the ceremonies of religion or the
                    parade of the court. For the support of this marine the land revenue of several
                    districts was assigned, amounting to about L.45,000 per annum; the gunners
                    belonging to it were principally Portuguese, of whose descendants a number still
                    reside in the town and neighbourhood.</p><p>The houses of Dacca being formed of combustible materials, it suffers frequently
                    by conflagrations, which, when they break out, as they do once or twice a year,
                    spread rapidly. The inhabitants look with the utmost indifference on the
                    destruction of their habitations, and throwing the few valuables which they
                    possess into earthen pots sunk in the floor, they easily procure mats, thatch,
                    and bamboos, which are abundant, and soon replace their houses in their former
                    condition. There was formerly at Dacca one of those curious and enormously large
                    guns which were to be seen in the Deccan and in the south of India, which
                    weighed 64,814 pounds, and which would have required a ball weighing 465 pounds.
                    This city still continues very populous; the number of its inhabitants exceeds
                    150,000, of whom more than one half are followers of Mahommed. It is the
                    head-quarters of the court of circuit for the eastern division of Bengal.
