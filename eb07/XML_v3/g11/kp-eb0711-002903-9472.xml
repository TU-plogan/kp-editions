                    on the west coast of Africa, commencing at Cape Mesurado, in 10° 45' west
                    longitude, and terminating with the river Lagos, in about 5° east longitude.
                    Limits different from these are occasionally assigned to Guinea, but the above
                    are those adopted by the best geographers. This immense territory has been
                    divided into four portions, namely, the Grain Coast, the Ivory Coast, the Gold
                    Coast, and the Slave Coast. We shall briefly describe the characteristic
                    features of each of these divisions, without any allusion to the slave trade,
                    which will be treated of in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Slave
                    Trade.</hi></p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Grain</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Malaghetta Coast</hi>
                    extends from the Mesurado to Cape Palmas, a distance of about two hundred and
                    fifty miles. This coast owes its name to a small parasitical plant, the fruit of
                    which, resembling a fig, is found to contain aromatic grains of pepper. Upon its
                    introduction into Europe, this spice received the dignified appellation of
                    grains of paradise. When the finer species of India, however, became known, the
                    production of Guinea fell into disrepute; and as the coast afforded no other
                    article worth being exported, it has been less frequented than any other part of
                    Guinea. It possesses two rivers, the Sestro and Sangwin, which are rather of
                    considerable size. They are situated near the middle of the coast, and their
                    banks are said to be fertile and populous. The Portuguese had formerly
                    settlements in this part of Africa, which they do not now possess; but many of
                    their posterity still reside there mixed with the natives.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Ivory Coast,</hi> commencing at Cape Palmas, stretches as
                    far as Cape Apollonia, a distance of about three hundred and fifty miles. This
                    part of Africa is named from the quantities of ivory obtained there. The tusks
                    are of good quality, and so large as sometimes to weigh two hundred pounds. Gold
                    is also found here in considerable quantities; it is brought down from the
                    countries behind the Gold Coast. There are no European settlements on this part
                    of the shore, excepting an English fort at Apollonia, which perhaps more
                    properly belongs to the Gold Coast. The Ivory Coast is populous and thickly set
                    with villages, but it does not contain any town of much consideration.
                    Navigation here is very dangerous, on account of a heavy surf which breaks
                    continually upon a beach, flat, and destitute of any conspicuous land-mark.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Gold Coast</hi> commences at Cape Apollonia, and extends to
                    the Rio Volta, a distance of about two hundred and fifty miles. For a long
                    period this coast was frequented by European traders, particularly English and
                    Dutch, both to obtain the precious metal from which it derives its name, and to
                    procure slaves as long as human beings were a marketable commodity. A forest of
                    immense thickness, only partially cleared and cultivated, presents itself on the
                    coast. Near the sea the soil is arenaceous, and, unfit for raising any important
                    tropical product except cotton. Some miles inland, however, it becomes richer,
                    and were it carefully cultivated, it might be made to produce sugar, and the
                    other products of the West Indies. The gold, which forms the staple commodity,
                    is brought down from mountainous districts situated·far in the interior. The
                    vegetable productions are chiefly maize, millet, some rice, yams, pulse,
                    plantains, bananas, and other tropical fruits. A variety of excellent timber is
                    produced, of which the palm-tree is most highly prized by the natives, as they
                    distil from it their favourite beverage. The capital of the British settlements
                    is at Cape Coast Castle, which is built upon a rock, and defended by a strong
                    wall mounted with cannon. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Coast Castle, Cape.</hi></p><p>The country round has been cleared to some extent, and laid out in pleasure
                    grounds by the British, to whose health, however, the climate is exceedingly
                    unpropitious. Other British settlements lie to the east, but Fort James at Aera,
                    together with Cape Coast, are now the only places where garrisons are
                    maintained. The capital of the Dutch settlements is El-Mina, or the Castle,
                    which was taken from the Portuguese, the founders of it, in 1637. It is situated
                    in an open country, about fifteen miles west of Cape Coast. The fort is well
                    built, on a high situation, and is regularly garrisoned. Besides this
                    establishment, they have a number of others scattered along the coast; and the
                    Danes also have two. For an account of the country which lies behind the Gold
                    Coast, and the people who inhabit it, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ashantee.</hi></p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Slave Coast</hi> commences at Rio Volta, and stretches as
                    far as the river Lagos, a distance of about two hundred and thirty miles. It was
                    so named because the slaves obtained here were of a docile and tractable temper.
                    This country is traversed by two considerable rivers,. called the Jakin and the
                    Euphrates, which run parallel with each other to the sea, and preserve
                    everywhere a convenient water communication. This part of the coast had been
                    cleared of forests by the natives, and carefully cultivated. A luxuriant and
                    almost perpetual vegetation sprung up under the busy hand of industry, and the
                    country became crowded with a dense population. Amid this abundance the Whidans,
                    such was the name of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193639485" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9485-0030"/>the people, having become luxurious and
                    effeminate, were attacked by the warlike power of Dahomey, which subdued the
                    people, and reduced their country almost to a desert. For an account of Dahomey,
                    which predominates over both the coast and the interior, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Dahomey.</hi></p><p>Whidah, now commonly called Griwhee, has been designated the port of Dahomey,
                    from which a route of about an hundred miles reaches through Favies and Foro, to
                    Abomey, the capital. The country around Griwhee is fertile and well cultivated,
                    and is abundantly supplied with the necessaries of African life. The inhabitants
                    have been estimated by Captain Adams at about 7000. Ardrah is a larger and more
                    flourishing place. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Ardrah.)</hi> Beyond
                    Lagos lies a large tract of country, of a peculiar character, which has been

                    current in Britain. The value or rate of guineas has varied. It was first struck
                    on the footing of twenty shillings; from the scarcity of gold it afterwards
                    advanced to twenty-one shillings and sixpence, but it subsequently sunk to
                    twenty-one shillings. The pound weight troy of gold is cut into forty-four
                    partsand a half, and each part makes a guinea. This coin took its denomination
                    of <hi rend="italic">guinea,</hi> because the gold of which the first was struck
                    had been brought from that part of Africa called Guinea; and for the same reason
                    it likewise bore the impression of an elephant.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
