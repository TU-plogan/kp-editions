                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">GYMNASIUM</label>, in Grecian antiquity, a place fitted for
                    performing exercises of the body. The word is Greek, being formed from <hi
                    rend="italic">γυμνός,</hi> naked; because the youth anciently put off their
                    clothes, to practise with the more freedom.</p>
                <p>Gymnasia, according to Potter, were first used at Lacedaemon, but were afterwards
                    common in all parts’of Greece, from which the institution was transferred to
                    Rome, where it was much improved. There were three principal gymnasia at Athens;
                    the academy where Plato taught; the Lyceum, noted for Aristotle’s lectures; and
                    the Cynosarges, allotted for the populace.</p>
                <p>Vitruvius describes the structure and form of the ancient Gymnasia (lib. v. cap.
                    11). They were so called, because several of the exercises were performed naked;
                    they derived the name of <hi rend="italic">paloestrae,</hi> from wrestling,
                    which was one of the most usual exercises there; and the Romans sometimes
                    denominated them <hi rend="italic">thermae,</hi> because the baths formed a
                    principal part of the building. It appears that in the time of Homer they did
                    not perform their exercises quite naked, but always in drawers; which were not
                    laid aside before the thirty-second Olympiad. Orsip-pus is said to have been the
                    first who introduced this prac*∙ tice; for having been worsted in consequence of
                    getting entangled by his drawers, he threw them aside; and others afterwards
                    imitated his example. The Gymnasia were not single edifices, but a knot of
                    buildings united, being sufficiently capacious to contain many thousands of
                    people at once, and having likewise room enough for philosophers, rhetoricians,
                    and professors of all other sciences to read their lectures, as well as for
                    wrestlers, dancers, and all others who had a mind to exercise, without the least
                    disturbance or interruption. They consisted of a great many parts. Vitruvius
                    mentions no fewer than twelve, namely,</p>
                <p>1. The exterior porticos, where the philosophers, rhetoricians, mathematicians,
                    physicians, and other virtuosi, read public lectures, and where they also
                    disputed and rehearsed their performances; 2. the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ephebeum,</hi> where the youth assembled very early, to learn their exercises
                    in private, without any spectators; 3. the <hi rend="italic">coryceum,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">apody-terion,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gymnasterion,</hi> a kind
                    of ante-chamber, where they stripped, either to bathe or exercise; 4. the <hi
                    rend="italic">claeothesium,</hi><hi rend="italic">alipterion,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">unctuarium,</hi> appointed for the unctions, which either preceded
                    or followed the use of the bath, wrestling, pancratia, &amp;c.; 5. the <hi
                    rend="italic">conisterium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">conistra,</hi> in which they
                    covered themselves with sand or dust, to dry up the oil or sweat; 6. the <hi
                    rend="italic">palaestra,</hi> properly so called, where they practised
                    wrestling, pugilation, pancratia, and other exercises; 7. the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sphaeristerium</hi> or tennis-court, reserved for exercises in which balls were
                    used; 8. large unpaved alleys, which comprehended the space between the porticos
                    and the walls with which the edifice was surrounded; 9. the <hi rend="italic"
                    >xysti,</hi> or porticos for the wrestlers in winter or bad weather; 10. other
                    <hi rend="italic">xysti</hi> or open alleys, allotted for summer and fine
                    weather, some of which were quite open, and others planted with trees; 11. the
                    baths, consisting of several different apartments; and, 12. the <hi
                    rend="italic">stadium,</hi> a large space of a semicircular form, covered with
                    sand, and surrounded with seats for the spectators.</p>
                <p>For the administration of the Gymnasia, there were officers, the principal of
                    whom were, 1. the <hi rend="italic">gymnasiarcha</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> who was the director and superintendent of the whole;</p>
                <p>2. the <hi rend="italic">xystarcha,</hi> who presided in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >xystus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">stadium;</hi></p>
                <p>3. the <hi rend="italic">gymnasta,</hi> or master of the exercises, who
                    understood their different effects, and could accommodate them to the different
                    complexions of the athletae; 4. the <hi rend="italic">paedο-triba,</hi> whose
                    business was mechanically to teach the exercises, without understanding their
                    theory or use. Under these four officers there were a number of subalterns,
                    whose names distinguished their different functions.</p>
                <p>The gymnastic exercises may be reduced to two general classes; those which depend
                    on the action of the body alone, and those requiring external agents or
                    instruments. The latter consisted chiefly in mounting the horse, driving the
                    chariot, and swimming. The former were chiefly <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640317" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0317-0094"/>of two kinds, <hi
                    rend="italic">orchestice</hi> and <hi rend="italic">palaestrice.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">orchestice</hi> comprehended, 1. dancing; 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >cubistice,</hi> or the art of tumbling; 3. <hi rend="italic">sphoeristice</hi>
                    or tennis, including all the exercises with pilae or balls. The <hi
                    rend="italic">palaestrice</hi> included all exercises under the denomination <hi
                    rend="italic">paloestroe,</hi> as wrestling, boxing, pancratia, hoplomachia,
                    running, leaping, throwing the discus, the exercise of the javelin, and that of
                    the hoop, denominated by the Greeks <hi rend="italic">τζyχpς,</hi> which
                    consisted in rolling an iron hoop five or six feet in diameter, beset with iron
                    rings, the noise of which apprising the people to give way, afforded them also
                    an amusement. Both strength and skill were requisite in directing this hoop,
                    which was driven with an iron rod. To these must also be added the exercises
                    belonging to the medicinal gymnastics; as, walking, vociferation or shouting,
                    and restraining one’s breath. Hoffman enumerates no fewer than fifty-five sorts
                    of exercises which werepractised in the Gymnasia.</p>
