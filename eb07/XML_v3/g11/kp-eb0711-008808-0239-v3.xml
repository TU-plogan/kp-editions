                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable
                    word.</change>

                <p><label type="entry">GUY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, an eminent
                    bookseller, founder of the hospital for sick and lame in Southwark which bears
                    his name, was the son of Thomas Guy, lighterman and coal-dealer in Horsley-down,
                    Southwark. He was put as apprentice, in 1660, to a bookseller in the porch of
                    Mercer’s Chapel; and set up trade with a stock of about L.200, in the house
                    which formed the angle between Cornhill and Lombard Street. The English bibles
                    being at that time very badly printed, Mr Guy engaged with others in a scheme
                    for printing them in Holland, and importing them; but this being put a stop to,
                    he contracted with the university of Oxford for their privilege of printing
                    them, and carried on a trade in bibles for many years to a considerable
                    advantage. The bulk of his fortune, however, was acquired by purchasing seamen’s
                    tickets during Queen Anne’s wars, and by South-Sea stock in the memorable year
                    1720. To show what great events spring from trivial causes, it is asserted that
                    the public owe the dedication of the greater part of his immense fortune to
                    charitable purposes, to the indiscreet officiousness of his maidservant in
                    interfering with the mending of the pavement before his door. Guy, it seems, had
                    agreed to marry her, and, preparatory to his nuptials, had ordered the pavement
                    before his door, which was in a neglected state, to be mended, as far as a
                    particular stone which he pointed out. The maid, whilst her master was out,
                    innocently looking on the paviers at work, observed a broken place they had not
                    repaired, and mentioned it to them; but they told her <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640252" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0252-0089"/>that Mr Guy had directed them
                    not to go so far. “Well,” said she, “do you mend it; tell him I bade you, and I
                    know , he will not be angry.” It happened, however, that the poor girl presumed
                    too much on her influence over her careful lover, with whom a few extraordinary
                    shillings of expense turned the scale totally against her. The men obeyed; Guy
                    was enraged to find his orders exceeded; his matrimonial scheme was renounced;
                    and, instead of marrying, he built hospitals in his old age. In the year 1707 he
                    built and furnished three wards on the north side of the outer court of St
                    Thomas’s Hospital in Southwark, and gave L.100 to it annually for eleven years
                    preceding the erection of his own hospital; and, some time before his death, he
                    erected the stately iron gate, with the large houses on each side, at the
                    expense of about L.3000. He was seventy-six years of age when he formed the
                    design of building the hospital which bears his'name, contiguous to that of St
                    Thomas’s; and he lived to see it roofed in, having died in the year 1724. The
                    charge of erecting this vast pile amounted toL.18,793, and he left L.219,499 to
                    endow it; a much larger sum than had ever before been dedicated to charitable
                    uses by any one man in this kingdom. He erected at Tamworth in Staffordshire,
                    the place of his mother’s nativity, and of which he had been representative in
                    parliament, an alms-house, with a library, for fourteen poor men and women; and
                    for their pensions, as well as for putting out poor children as apprentices, he
                    bequeathed L.125a year. Lastly, he bequeathed L.1000 to every one who could
                    prove himself related to him in any degree, however remote.</p>

                    it is hoisting or lowering, particularly when the ship is shaken by a

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Guy</hi> is likewise a large slack rope, extending from the
                    head of the main-mast to the head of the fore-mast, and having two or three
                    large blocks fastened to the middle of it. This is chiefly employed to sustain
                    the tackle used to hoist in and out the cargo of a merchant ship, and is
                    accordingly removed from the mast-head as soon as the vessel is laden or
                    delivered.</p>

                    Warwickshire, a great cliff on the west side of the Avon and the north side of
                    Warwick, where in the time of the Britons there was an oratory, and in that of
                    the Saxons an hermitage, and where Guy, earl of Warwick, is said to have retired
                    after being fatigued with the toils and pleasures of the world, to have built a
                    chapel, and cohabited with the hermit. This hermitage was kept up till the reign
                    of Henry VI. when Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, established there a
                    chantry, which derived its name from the king-maker, and, in memory of the
                    famous Guy, erected a large statue in the chapel, eight feet in height, at the
                    same time raising a roof over the adjacent springs.</p>
