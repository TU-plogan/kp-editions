                    tactics, was born at Montauban, on the 12th of November 1743. Before he had
                    completed his fourteenth year, he accompanied to Germany his father, who acted
                    as major-general to the army commanded by Marshal de Broglie, and he served,
                    either as captain in the regiment of Auvergne, or as an employe in the staff,
                    during the six campaigns of the war of 1756. At an age when little could be
                    expected but the ardent valour which is natural to that period of life, he
                    attracted notice by the superiority of his dispositions and the justness of his
                    observations; and from the experience he then acquired, he was enabled to lay
                    the foundation of the theory to which he was afterwards indebted for his
                    reputation as a military writer. During the interval between this war and that
                    of Corsica, he devoted the whole of his time to that species of study for which
                    he felt an increasing predilection. At the conclusion of the combat of
                    Ponte-Nuovo, which secured to France the conquest of the island of Corsica, he
                    received the cross of St Louis, and shortly afterwards a colonel’s commission,
                    although as yet he was not more than twenty-four years of age. He also displayed
                    great zeal in raising and training the Corsican legion, of which he was
                    appointed colonel-commandant in 1772. The year following he published his <hi rend="italic">Essai</hi><hi rend="italic">General</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Tactique.</hi> But not wishing to abide, in his own country, the explosion which
                    such a work was calculated to produce, he set out for Germany, which opened to
                    him a vast field of instruction, and repaired to Prussia, whither a species of
                    celebrity had preceded him. Here, however, he had considerable difficulties to
                    encounter. It was, above all, necessary to overcome certain prepossessions of
                    Frederick, who judged severely the theoretical attainments and views of the
                    young tactician, and who besides was not by any means satisfied with what
                    Guibert had published in his book on the subject of the Prussians. With this
                    view he addressed a letter, in explanation and in defence, to the Prussian
                    monarch, who was so well pleased with the composition that he received the
                    writer with particular distinction. Ever since the year 1772, Guibert had
                    conceived the design of also entering on the career of literature; and, from
                    year to year, after his return from Prussia, compositions of his, either in the
                    shape of tragedies, or of panegyrics on the great men of France, procured him
                    much reputation in the saloons, where they were generally read by the author. An
                    ardent and enthusiastic temperament; considerable talent, with not a little of
                    pretension; great facility and an astonishing memory; an anxiety to occupy the
                    attention of the public, and “march to glory by every road ;” sincerity and
                    hardihood; elevation of sentiment, and a desire to promote the general good;
                    these, united with an active and craving ambition, formed the principal elements
                    in the character of Guibert. He mistook for genius the gifts which he had
                    received from nature, and persuaded himself that he not only could, but should
                    undertake every thing. Laharpe, who appears to have disliked him, alleges that
                    he contemplated nothing less than <hi rend="italic">a remplacer</hi><hi rend="italic">Turenne, Corneille,</hi><hi rend="italic">et Bossuet;</hi> but
                    little importance is to be attached to those sallies of enthusiasm, under the
                    immediate influence of which he may perhaps have said and even believed, that a
                    single individual might, in our time, be at once a Turenne, a Corneille, and a
                    Bossuet. Guibert was recalled to his original occupation, by the appointment of
                    the Count de Saint-Germain to the department of war; and having been honoured
                    with the confidence of that minister, he had the rare merit of not abandoning
                    him in his disgrace. In 1776 he was made colonel-commandant of the regiment of
                    Neustrie; in 1782, brigadier-general; in 1788, <hi rend="italic">marechal-de-camp,</hi> or major-general; and next inspector of infantry in the
                    province of Artois. When his father was appointed governor of the Hôtel des
                    Invalides, he did all in his power to second him in his administration, and
                    spared neither pains nor travel to extend to all parts of France the succours
                    and consolations due to the veteran or disabled defenders of the state. In 1787
                    he was appointed member and reporter of the council of administration in the
                    department of war. But as Guibert, in the discharge of his functions, combined
                    his own peculiar ideas with those which the deliberations of the council
                    rendered common, the whole appeared to emanate<pb break="no" facs="nls:193639420" xml:id="kp-eb0711-9420-0025"/> from the
                    reporter, whose proper duty it was merely to give expression to the views of the
                    council; and it was consequently against him that all the complaints and
                    accusations of the discontented were directed. People judged without any
                    indulgence the imperfection of the work and its results; the faults of the
                    moment rendered them blind to the advantages which might afterwards be expected;
                    and at length the projects and their author became involved in the same
                    proscription. In a memoir addressed to the public and to the army on the
                    operations of the council of war, Guibert undertook to prove, that, like the
                    other members, he had only his opinion and his voice in the council; and that
                    consequently he did not deserve the abuse and animadversion of which he had been
                    made the sole object. But his reclamation seems to have convinced few, and to
                    have silenced none of the malcontents; and the unlucky organ of the council
                    continued as before to bear the opprobrium of all its unpopular acts. We have
                    already seen that no species of ambition was foreign to Guibert; but in him,
                    nevertheless, ambition was blended with the desire of doing good, and being
                    useful to his country; Accordingly, in ]789, he aspired to become a member of
                    the states-general of the kingdom, and thereby prepared for himself the
                    bitterest mortification which he had ever yet experienced. His pretensions, both
                    as a military man and a writer, had provoked censure, and even excited
                    hostility. He was accused of having attempted to subject officers to
                    imprisonment in irons; proposed to introduce the cane as an instrument for
                    chastising the common soldiers; and recommended the detestable barbarity of
                    hamstringing deserters. Guibert replied by a most formal denial of these
                    imputations, which he declared to be atrocious falsehoods, as, we have no doubt,
                    they were. But his disclamation met with no credit; and in the assembly of the
                    bailliage of Bourges, the people went so far as to refuse him a hearing. Forced
                    to retire, he printed, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Precis</hi><hi rend="italic">de ce qui</hi><hi rend="italic">s'</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">passe</hi> á <hi rend="italic">mon égard</hi><hi rend="italic">a l'</hi><hi rend="italic">Assemblée</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Eerri,</hi> a defence which, however, failed to excite the interest he had
                    fondly hoped it would inspire. Whilst matters were in this state, the Count de
                    Fontette-Sommery had the courage openly to take the part of the oppressed, and
                    to publish the <hi rend="italic">Opinion dun</hi><hi rend="italic">Gentilhomme
                    de Bourgogne sur ce qui s est passé a</hi><hi rend="italic">l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Assemblée de la Noblesse du Berry, relativement à Μ. le Comte de
                    Guibert, en mars</hi> 1789. But no salutary effect resulted from this generous
                    interposition. The fatal blow had been struck; public opinion refused to
                    acknowledge itself in error; and the innocent victim was accordingly immolated.
                    Inconsolable at this injustice, Guibert retired from public life, and, after a
                    short illness, died on the 6th of May 1790, in the forty-seventh year of his
                    age. His works are, 1. Essai General de Tactique, already mentioned, Liège,
                    1773, in one vol. 4to and two vols. 8vo; 2. Eloge de Catinat, Edinburgh (Paris),
                    1775, in 8vo; 3. Connétable de Bourbon, a tragedy; 4. La Mort des Grecques, a
                    piece in three acts; 5. Anne de Boulen, the best of his dramas; 6. Eloge
                    Historique de Michel de l’Hôpital, Chancelier de France, 1777; 7. Défense du
                    Système de Guerre Moderne, ou Réfutation complète du Système de Μ. de

                    in 8vo, the last production which he acknowledged; 12. Journal d’un Voyage en
                    Allemagne fait en 1773 par Guibert, Paris, 1803, in two vols. 8vo; 13. Oeuvres

                    of Eloges, including that of Claire-Francoise de l’Espinasse, Paris, 1806, in
                    8vo. But of all the works of Guibert, that by which he is best known is his
                    Essay on Tactics, so often quoted and referred to under the head <hi rend="smallcaps">Army.</hi> Its extraordinary success may be attributed, partly
                    to the enthusiasm of military glory which appears to have dictated it, and
                    partly to the freedom of thought and expression for which it is distinguished;
                    and although some of the projects which it recommends are now ascertained to be
                    pregnant with danger, yet it is consulted and appreciated by all military men
                    who know their profession; and even its errors conduce towards the instruction
                    of those who are capable of estimating its merits. We learn from contemporary
                    authority, that the preliminary discourse produced a great sensation, and gave
                    an exaggerated idea of the author. This discourse, in which the young tactician
                    assumed a <hi rend="italic">tranchant</hi> and decisive tone towards the
                    sovereigns of Europe, at the same time that he depreciated the government of his
                    own country, was read with avidity by the women, cried up by the men of letters,
                    circulated in the army, and at length known in all Europe. Amidst all its
                    warmth, and, as some think, extravagance, it developes important truths, which
                    had escaped ordinary observation, and suggests matter for reflection to those
                    who are accustomed to weigh opinions before adopting them. We may add, that
                    Voltaire, after having read the work, addressed to the author, through Μ.
                    d’Argental, some beautiful verses, in which, amidst other flattering things, he
                    says to Guibert,</p><p>Digne peut-être</p><p>De commander déjà dans l’art dont il est maitre.</p><p>In a word, of all the productions of Guibert, his Treatise on Tactics is that
                    which will most certainly survive the generation to which it was more
                    immediately addressed. It constantly affords aliment for thought, and may be
                    considered as the first grand step towards the formation of a scientific and
                    effective system of tactics. Much may also be gathered from his <hi rend="italic">Defense</hi><hi rend="italic">du Systeme</hi><hi rend="italic">de Guerre</hi><hi rend="italic">Moderne,</hi> in which he attacks the <hi rend="italic">ordre profond</hi> of Folard, and ably analyses some of the finest
                    operations of Turenne, Luxembourg, and the king of Prussia, all of whom were
                    opposed to the system promulgated by the celebrated çom-mentator on Polybius.
