                    the sides and angles of triangles, these being expressed by numbers. It is
                    therefore a theory formed by the union of arithmetic and geometry, and it treats
                    of a particular class of geometrical figures, namely, triangles.</p><p>There are two kinds of triangles considered in trigonometry; <hi rend="italic">plane triangles,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spherical triangles.</hi> The
                    former are figures on a plane, and the latter on the surface of a sphere; hence
                    we have <hi rend="italic">plane trigonometry</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spherical trigonometry,</hi> the principles of which will be explained in
                    succession. In a triangle there are six things which may be considered, viz. the
                    three sides, and the three angles. The main object of the theory is to give
                    rules by which, when some of these are given, the others may be found.</p><p>2. The application of numbers to express the sides and angles of triangles has
                    given rise to several terms which require to be defined before we proceed
                    further.</p><p>DEFINITIONS.</p><p>I. Since angles at the centres of equal circles have to each other the same ratio
                    as the arcs on which they stand, the arcs may be taken as representatives or <hi rend="italic">measures</hi> of the angles to which they are proportional. Thus,
                    let ACB be any angle contained by the lines AC, BC: if about C as a centre, with
                    any distance or <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> AC, a circle ABE be described, the
                    arc AB, intercepted between the lines CA, CB, is the measure of the angle
                    ACB.</p><p>II. The circumference of every circle is supposed to be divided into 360 equal
                    parts called <hi rend="italic">degrees,</hi> and again each degree is subdivided
                    into 60 equal parts called <hi rend="italic">minutes,</hi> and each minute into
                    60 equal parts called <hi rend="italic">seconds;</hi> and an angle is said to be
                    of as many degrees, minutes, seconds, &amp;c. as there are degrees, and minutes,
                    and seconds in its measure. The degrees in any arc or angle are indicated by the
                    character <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> placed over their number, the minutes
                    by an accent ', and the seconds by two accents ". For example, an angle of 25
                    degrees 12 minutes and 14 seconds is expressed thus, 25° 12' 14''—A right angle
                    is measured by one fourth part of the circumference, or a quadrant, and it
                    contains 90°.</p><p>III. The <hi rend="italic">complement</hi> of an arc or angle is the difference
                    between it and a quadrant, or 90°. Thus, supposing AD to be a quadrant, the arc
                    BD is the complement of the arc AB, and the angle BCD is the complement of the
                    angle ACB.</p><p>IV. The <hi rend="italic">supplement</hi> of an arc or angle is its difference
                    from half the circumference, or 180°. Let ADE be a semicircle; the arc BDE is
                    the supplement of the arc AB; and the angle BCE is the supplement of the angle
                    ACB.</p><p>V. The <hi rend="italic">sine</hi> of an arc or angle is the perpendicular drawn
                    from one extremity of the arc, on the diameter, that passes through the other
                    extremity. The line BF is the sine of the arc AB, or of the angle ACB.</p><p>VI. The <hi rend="italic">versed sine</hi> is the segment of the diameter between
                    its sine and the arc which measures the angle. The line AF is the versed sine of
                    the arc AB, or the angle ACB, and EF the versed sine of the angle BCE.</p><p>VII. The <hi rend="italic">tangent</hi> is a straight line that touches the arc
                    at one end, and is limited at the other end by a straight line drawn from the
                    centre of the circle through the other extremity of the arc. The line AH is the
                    tangent of the arc AB, or the angle ACB.</p><p>VIII. The <hi rend="italic">secant</hi> is the straight line drawn from the
                    centre to the extremity of the tangent. The line CH is the secant of the arc AB,
                    or angle ACB.</p><p>IX. The sine, tangent, and secant, of the complement of any arc or angle, are
                    called by abbreviation its <hi rend="italic">cosine</hi>, <hi rend="italic">cotangent,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cosecant.</hi> Thus, BG = CF, the sine of
                    the arc BD, is the cosine of the arc AB; and DK, the tangent of the arc BD, is
                    the cotangent of AB; and CK, the secant of BD, is the cosecant of AB.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Trigonometrical Notation.</hi></p><p>The sine of an angle whose measure is A, is expressed thus, <hi rend="italic">sin. A</hi>; its cosine by <hi rend="italic">cos. A</hi>; its tangent by <hi rend="italic">tan.</hi> A; its cotangent by <hi rend="italic">cot.</hi> A; its
                    secant by <hi rend="italic">sec.</hi> A; its cosecant by <hi rend="italic">cosec.</hi> A; its versed sine by <hi rend="italic">ver. siri.</hi> A; and its
                    coversed sine by <hi rend="italic">co. ver. sin.</hi> A.</p><p>The radius of a circle, when it is supposed the unit of numbers, requires no
                    symbol: sometimes it is represented by the abbreviation <hi rend="italic">rad.</hi> and also by the letter R.</p><p>3. There are two ways in which the theories of trigonometry have been
                    established. One is by employing a process of reasoning purely geometrical, such
                    as has been followed in our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry.</hi> In this
                    way the early writers on the subject constructed their treatises, and it served
                    very well for plane triangles, but was less convenient for spherical triangles,
                    by reason of the intricate diagrams required to represent circles lying in
                    different planes; and also by the complicated relations of the things to be
                    discussed, which could not easily be expressed by words. The second, which is
                    the more convenient way, is by the symbolic reasoning of algebra. The section in
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Algebra</hi> on the Arithmetic of Sines is a specimen of
                    this way of treating the subject; and it is worthy of remark, that the great
                    extension that has been given to the subject is in no small degree due to the
                    simple and convenient way of representing the sines and tangents, &amp;c. of
                    angles, by the abbreviations, <hi rend="italic">sin. A, tan.</hi> A, &amp;c.
                    instead of referring to the geometrical lines themselves. As a consequence of
                    this, geometrical constructions are avoided, and even diagrams are hardly
                    necessary.</p><p>4. In applying the notation and doctrines of modern analysis to trigonometry, we
                    regard the measures of angles, and their sines, tangents, &amp;c. as endowed
                    with the properties of variable quantity; in particular, we ascribe to them the
                    quality of being <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> or <hi rend="italic">negative.</hi> The consequences of this hypothesis have been fully detailed in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic of Sines</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Algebra),</hi> to which we refer the reader. By this the properties of
                    triangles are expressed by general formulae, which comprehend all particular
                    cases. This way of considering the numeral measures of trigonometrical lines has
                    greatly simplified spherical trigonometry, and all applications of both
                    trigonometries to astronomy and geodetical inquiries.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Trigonometrical Table.</hi></p><p>5. The basis of all trigonometrical calculations is a table which exhibits in
                    parts of the radius the numeral values of the sine, tangent, and secant, of each
                    arc in a series pro <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=391" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0391-0371"/>ceeding from 0 to a quadrant, the common difference of the terms being an
                    angle of one minute, or some smaller angle.</p><p>The radius being considered as an unit, the sines are expressed as decimal
                    fractions of that unit. The quadrant is generally divided into degrees and
                    minutes, this being sufficient for most purposes; but tables have been
                    calculated which give the sines, and tangents, and secants, to every tenth
                    second.</p><p>6. The Elements of Euclid show how to inscribe regular polygons of three, four,
                    five, six, and fifteen sides in a circle. The sides of these polygons may be
                    expressed in numbers by calculations derived from the geometrical constructions.
                    Now, the side of an equilateral triangle in a circle, is the chord of 120°,
                    which is twice the sine of 60°; and the side of the inscribed square is the
                    chord of 90°, which is twice the sine of 45°; and the side of the equilateral
                    pentagon is the chord of 72°, which is twice the sine of 36°; and the side of
                    the hexagon is the chord of 60°, which is twice the sine of 30°; and the side of
                    the quindecagon is the chord of 24°, which is twice the sine of 12°. These sines
                    may therefore be all deduced from the properties of polygons inscribed in a
                    circle, as delivered in the Elements. And since the sum of the squares of the
                    chord of an arc and the chord of its supplement is equal to the square of the
                    diameter <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geom.</hi> 17 of 2 and 13 of 4), the chords of
                    the supplements, and thence the sines of their halves, may be found. It was in
                    this way the trigonometrical table was first constructed by the early
                    mathematicians, Purbach, Miiller, Copernicus, G. Joachimus Rhaeticus, and
                    others. The theory of inscribed polygons was extended by Vieta into that of
                    angular sections, chiefly with a view to the construction of the table. This has
                    again been wrought up into the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">calculus of Sines,</hi> the formulae of which afford great
                    facility in the construction of the table. As an example, we shall resolve this
                    problem.</p><p>7. <hi rend="smallcaps">Problem. To</hi> find the sines of one fifth, two fifths,

                    Trigonometry.</hi></p><p>13. In contemplating a plane triangle as a figure formed by three straight lines,
                    we distinguish the sides of the triangle, the angles at their intersections, and
                    the space or area which they comprehend. In trigonometry we abstract from the
                    area, and consider only the sides and angles. There are in all six angles, viz.
                    the three interior and their adjacent exterior angles. Each of the exterior is
                    the sum of two interior angles, and of these any two determine the third; so
                    that in fact the independent elements of a triangle are five, viz. its three
                    sides, and any two of its three interior angles; and of these any three being
                    given, the remaining two may be found.</p><p>14. The sides and angles are dissimilar in their nature, and therefore do not
                    admit of being directly compared: the measures of angles, being arcs of a circle
                    described with a given radius, are lines, and therefore expressible by the
                    sides. It is however more convenient and easy to use the sines and tangents, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> of angles than the angles themselves, in
                    trigonometrical calculations, the rules of which are to be deduced from the

                    calculation. The foundation, as has been already observed, is a table which
                    shows, in parts of the radius, the lengths of the sine, and tangent, and secant,
                    to every minute or smaller division of the quadrant. The most extensive table of
                    this kind is that of G. Joachimus Rhaeticus, published in 1596. It gives the
                    sines, &amp;c. to every ten seconds. The invention of logarithms has in a great
                    measure superseded the use of the <hi rend="italic">natural sines,</hi> as they
                    are called, and, except for particular purposes, the logarithms of the natural
                    sines, called <hi rend="italic">logarithmic sines,</hi> only are used. Of tables
                    containing these, there are innumerable varieties, according as they are of
                    greater or less extent. The <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica Logarithmica</hi> of
                    Briggs, published in 1628, by Adrian Viacq, in two folio volumes, is the most
                    extensive. His tables give the logarithms of 100,000 numbers, and logarithmic
                    sines and tangents to every ten seconds and to ten places of decimals. Hutton’s
                    Tables give the natural sines, and tangents, and secants; also their logarithms
                    to every minute and to seven figures. Callet’s <hi rend="italic">Tables
                    Portatives</hi> give the logarithmic sines and tangents to every ten seconds;
                    and Taylor’s Tables, in a large quarto, give the same to every second. For
                    general use, Callet’s are the most convenient. Tables which give the logarithms
                    of numbers and sines, &amp;c. to six, and even to five figures, are also useful.
                    Of the former, we recommend Tables of six-figure Logarithms, superintended by
                    Richard Farley of the Nautical Almanac Office (printed for Longman and Co.
                    1840); and of the latter, Tables of Logarithms, under the superintendence of the
                    Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (Taylor and Walton, 1839). Those
                    who perform many calculations find it convenient to have tables of different
                    extent. The size of our work, and the form of its pages, make it quite
                    unsuitable for a useful logarithmic table, which should be as portable as it can
                    be made. Accordingly we have given none.</p><p>17. It is customary to treat first of right-angled triangles, and next of such as

                    proportion has been found by subtracting the logarithm of the first term from
                    the sum of the logarithms of the second and third. Now, in every case, when one
                    number <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is to be subtracted from another number <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> we may obtain the result required by adding the difference
                    between <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> any number, and
                    then subtracting the number <hi rend="italic">n</hi> from the result. Thus,
                    instead of subtracting 7 from 12, we may add 3, the difference between 7 and 10,
                    to 12, and then rejecting 10 from 15, the sum, obtain 5 for the difference
                    between 12 and 7. The reason of this may be easily understood, and it is evident
                    from algebraic subtraction; for A — <hi rend="italic">a — b</hi> + (n — <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) — <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> When <hi rend="italic">a</hi>,
                    the number to be subtracted, is less than 10, then <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is
                    conveniently assumed = 10, and when <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is between 10 and
                    20, then <hi rend="italic">n</hi> may be taken = 20. Thus, if 17 is to be
                    subtracted from 63, the remainder, 46, is found by adding 3 ( = 20 — 17) to 63,
                    and rejecting 20 from the sum.</p><p>Hence, in trigonometrical calculation, instead of subtracting the log. of the

                    order to obtain the log. of the fourth term, we may add into one sum the logs,
                    of the second and third terms, and the difference between the log. of the first
                    and 10, and rejecting, mentally, 10 from the sum, we have what is required.</p><p>The difference between a logarithm and 10·00000, &amp;c. is called the <hi rend="italic">arithmetical complement</hi> of that logarithm; and it is most
                    readily obtained by subtracting every figure, beginning at the left hand, from
                    9, and the last significant figure from 10; thus, the arithmetical complement of

                    the introduction of the arithmetical complements of logarithms, fewer figures
                    are required in calculations; for, with a little practice, it will be found as
                    easy to read the arithmetical complements of logarithms from the table as the
                    logarithms themselves. We have now this rule for finding a fourth proportional
                    to three given numbers. Add together the arithmetical complement of the
                    logarithm of the first term, and the logarithms of the second and third terms;
                    the sum is the logarithm of the fourth.</p><p>***As an example, take the above proportion:</p><p>Sin.

                    Τrigονομετrυ.</hi></p><p>1. In our treatise on <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry</hi> we have defined a <hi rend="italic">pyramid</hi> (Sect. xi. Der. 6). The most simple solid of this
                    kind is the <hi rend="italic">triangular</hi> pyramid, or <hi rend="italic">tetraedron,</hi> contained by four plane triangles, or <hi rend="italic">faces,</hi> each of which has a side common with the other three. The angles of
                    these form four solid angles. Each of the solid angles presents for our
                    consideration six plane angles; namely, the three angles about the solid angle,
                    and the three angles made by the planes of the faces, which are so related, that
                    any three of them being given, the other three may be found. The investigation
                    of formulae which furnish rules by which this may be accomplished, forms the
                    object of what is to follow.</p><p>2. In the calculus of sines, the things considered are plane angles. If two of
                    these be inward angles of a triangle, and the third the outward and opposite
                    angle, our formula for the sines, tangents, &amp;c. of the sum and difference of
                    two angles <hi rend="smallcaps">(Algebra)</hi> will express relations among the
                    angles of a plane triangle. We are now to investigate formulae analogous to
                    these, which shall involve the angles of a pyramid. Although the calculus which
                    treats of angles made by straight lines in a plane may be established
                    independently of a circle, yet it is conducive to perspicuity to employ arcs of
                    circles as the measures of angles. This has led to the measuring of the angles
                    of a pyramid by arcs of circles on the surface of a sphere whose centre is the
                    vertex; then the angles made by the planes of its faces will be shown by the
                    angles contained by tangents to the circles at their points of intersection.</p><p>3. In treating of spherical trigonometry, we shall begin by explaining some
                    properties of the sphere which depend on principles purely geometrical.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definitions.</hi></p><p>I. A <hi rend="italic">sphere</hi> is a solid figure generated by the revolution
                    of a semicircle about a diameter which remains unmoved.</p><p>II. The diameter about which the semicircle turns, is the <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> of the sphere; and the point which is the middle of that diameter is
                    the <hi rend="italic">centre</hi> of the sphere.</p><p>III. A straight line drawn from the centre to any point in the surface of a
                    sphere, is a <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> of the sphere. It is evident that all
                    the radii are equal.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem I</hi>. Every section of a sphere made by a plane is
                    a circle.</p><p>Let ADBE be a sphere, and DHE the curve line which is the common section of its
                    surface and any plane. From O, the centre of the sphere, draw OF perpendicular
                    to the plane DHE, and draw FH to any point in the curve DHE and join OH. In the
                    triangle OFH, the angle OFH is a right angle; therefore FH = ^∕(OH- — OF’). Now
                    the lines OH and OF are invariable for all points in the curve DIIE, therefore
                    FH is invariable, and the curve DHE is the circumference of a circle whose
                    radius is FH.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> IV. The common section of a sphere and any plane
                    that passes through its centre, is a great circle of the sphere. Let ADBE be a
                    sphere whose centre is O; the circle DFE, in which any plane passing through O
                    meets the sphere, is a great circle.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. All great circles of the sphere are equal; and
                    any two great circles mutually bisect each other.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 2. A great circle may pass through any two
                    assigned points on a sphere, which are not the extremities of a diameter. For if
                    straight lines be drawn from the centre to the points, a plane may pass along
                    these lines, and only one plane, whose common section with the sphere will be a
                    great circle.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Der.</hi> V. The pole of a great circle is a point on the
                    surface of the sphere, from which all straight lines drawn to the circumference
                    of the circle are equal.</p><p>Let DEE be a great circle, and O its centre; take D and F any points in its
                    circumference, join OD, OF, and draw OA perpendicular to the plane of the
                    circle, meeting the surface of the sphere in A, and join AD, AF; because AO is
                    perpendicular to the plane DEE, the angles AOD, AOF are right angles; therefore
                    AD = AF, hence A is the pole of the circle DFE.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> Since a perpendicular to the plane of the circle
                    DFE through its centre must meet the sphere in two points; a great circle has
                    two poles, A, B, which are the extremities of a diameter of the sphere
                    perpendicular to the plane of the circle, and it can have no more.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> II. The arcs of a great circle between the

                    other great circle that passes through A and B and meets the circle DFE in E:
                    Because the poles of the circle DEF are at the extremities of AB, the diameter
                    of the sphere that is perpendicular to its plane, the angles AOD, BOD are right

                    intersection: it is identical with the angle made by two straight lines in the
                    planes of the circles which touch them at their intersection; and it is also the
                    same as the angle made by the planes of the circles.</p><p>Let AEB, AFB, be two great circles that intersect each other at A and B (Fig. 2).

                    AQ, will touch the circles at A, and form an angle PAQ, which is the spherical
                    angle at A; and since PAQ is equal to EOF <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geometry,</hi>

                    surface of the sphere comprehended by three arcs of great circles, each of which
                    is less than a semicircle.</p><p>If planes be supposed to pass along the arcs AB, BC, AC, which are the sides of
                    the triangle; these will pass through O, the centre of the sphere, and form at

                    ii).</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Τηεοrεμ</hi> III. Any two sides of a spherical triangle are
                    together greater than the third; and the sum of the arcs which are its sides is
                    less than the circumference of a great circle.</p><p>The arcs AB, AC, BC, arc the measures of the plane angles AOB, AOC, BOC, about
                    the solid angle O. Now, any two of these plane angles are greater than the third
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geometry,</hi> Part ii. 16, 1), therefore any two sides of
                    the spherical triangle ABC is greater than the third: and because the sum of the
                    plane angles about the solid angle is less than four right angles (17);
                    therefore the sum of the sides of the spherical triangle, which are their
                    measures, must be less than the sum of four quadrants, that is, less than the
                    circumference of a great circle.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> IV. If about the angular points of a spherical
                    triangle, as poles, there be described three great circles on the sphere; these
                    by their intersections will form a triangle which is said to be <hi rend="italic">supplemental</hi> to the former; and the two triangles are such,
                    that the sides of the one are the supplements of the arcs which measure the
                    angles of the other.</p><p>Let ABC be a spherical triangle; let EF be an arc of a great circle whose pole is
                    A, and FD an arc of a great circle whose pole is B, and DE an arc of a great
                    circle whose pole is C; these three arcs forming the triangle DEF. Let DB be an
                    arc of a great circle passing through the points D, B, and DC an arc of a great
                    circle passing through the points D, C. Because B is the pole of the arc DF, the
                    arc BD is a quadrant (<hi rend="smallcaps">Th</hi>. II.), and because C is the
                    pole of the arc DE, the arc CD is a quadrant. Since then the arcs BD, CD, are
                    both quadrants, D is the pole of a great circle that passes through the points
                    B, C; but only one great circle can pass through two points on the sphere not
                    directly opposite, therefore D must be the pole of the arc BC. In the same way,
                    it will appear that E is the pole of the arc AC, and F the pole of the arc AB.
                    Produce the arcs AB, AC, if necessary, till they meet the arc EF in G and H; the
                    point A being the pole of the arc GH, the angle A will be measured by GH. Now EH
                    and FG being both quadrants, EH + FG = 180°; but EH + FG = EF + GH, therefore EF
                    + GH = 180°, that is, EF, a side of the triangle DEF, is the supplement of GH,
                    the measure of the angle A. In the very same way, it will appear that DF is the
                    supplement of the angle B, and DE the supplement of the angle C; and because the
                    triangle ABC may be formed from the triangle DEF exactly in the same way that
                    DEF is constructed from ABC, namely, by describing great circles about the
                    angles D, E, F, as poles, the triangles and their relations to each other may be
                    interchanged. Hence it appears that BC, AC, AB, the sides of the triangle ABC,
                    are the supplements of D, E, F, the angles of the triangle DEF.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theorem</hi> V. The three angles of any spherical triangle
                    arc greater than two right angles, but less than six.</p><p>In the triangle ABC (fig. 4), the measures of the angles A, B, C, together with
                    DE, EF, DF, the sides of the supplemental triangle DEF, make six right angles.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(Τη.</hi> IV.) Now the sum of the sides of the triangle DEF
                    is less than four right angles (Tn. III.), therefore the sum of the three angles
                    A, B, C, is greater than two right angles; and because the three inward angles
                    of any triangle, together with the adjacent exterior angles, are equal to six
                    right angles, therefore the inward angles alone are less than six right
                    angles.</p><p>4. We might proceed in this way, establishing the whole doctrine of spherical
                    trigonometry by a series of synthetical demonstrations; such was the practice of
                    the earlier writers on this subject. This however has now given way to a more
                    convenient and elegant method of proceeding, which dispenses with complicated
                    diagrams representing on a plane surface circles on a sphere. It deduces by the
                    angular calculus the whole theory of spherical trigonometry (including also the
                    theorems already here demonstrated) from a single proposition, in a manner
                    probably first followed out by Bertrand of Geneva in his <hi rend="italic">Développement nouveau de lu Partie Elémentaire des Mathématiques</hi> (Geneva,
                    1778). Lagrange seems to have overlooked this work, for in his elegant memoir,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Solutions de quelques Problèmes relatifs aux

                    attributed the theorem to De Gua, who also gave it in the Memoirs of the Academy
                    of Sciences for 1783.</p><p>5. Our article on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Arithmetic of Sines (Algebra,</hi>
                    sect 25) is an example of what may be done by the power of anaiysis alone in
                    deducing an extensive theory from a few simple geometrical principles. Such is
                    the way in which Lagrange and later writers treat of spherical trigonometry. We
                    shall also follow the method of Delambre, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Astronomie Théorique et Pratique,</hi> chap. x., instead of numerous rules
                    deduced from geometrical constructions, for determining when angles or arcs are
                    less or greater than quadrants, considers their sines and cosines as positive or
                    negative quantities, according to the principles of analytic geometry, as
                    explained at article 225 in <hi rend="smallcaps">Algebra.</hi> From what has

                    quadrant of the circle, because the sine and cosine are both positive; it is <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> in the second, because the sine is positive and the
                    cosine negative; it is <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> in the third quadrant,
                    because the sine and cosine are both negative; lastly, it is negative in the
                    fourth quadrant, because the sine is negative and the cosine positive. The
                    tangent is = 0 when the arc is 0 or 180°, and <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi>
                    when the arc is 90° or 270°.</p><p>(5.) When the arc is known, we can always give the tangent the proper sign. If
                    the arc <hi rend="italic">X</hi> is not known, and we have simply tan. <hi rend="italic">x = a,</hi> it cannot be known whether the are be positive or
                    negative; if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be a positive number, the tangent belongs
                    alike to two arcs, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and 180° + <hi rend="italic">x.</hi>
                    If <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be negative, tan. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> belongs
                    to an arc between 90° and 180°, or between 270° and 360°. The problem therefore
                    admits of two solutions.</p><p>***But if tan. <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = -, and that the two terms of the
                    fraction <hi rend="italic">n</hi> are positive, then <hi rend="italic">x ∙κ</hi>
                    90°. If <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be positive and <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    negative, <hi rend="italic">x ≥..</hi> 90 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi>; when

                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> tan.«</p><p>(7.) The rule for the signs of secants is the same as that for cosines, seeing
                    that sec. <hi rend="italic">x=—-—.</hi></p><p>COS. <hi rend="italic">X</hi></p><p>(8.) The rule for cosecants is the same as for sines, since 1</p><p>cosec. <hi rend="italic">X = -</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">x</hi></p><p>(9.) When an arc is known, the sign of its sine is known; but when <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> an unknown arc, is to be found from sin. <hi rend="italic">x — a,</hi> the sine belongs alike to <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and 180° — <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be positive; or to 180° + <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and 360° — <hi rend="italic">x, if a</hi> be negative.</p><p>(10.) When an arc <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is known, the sign of its cosine is
                    known; but if we have cos. <hi rend="italic">x = b,</hi> we do not know whether
                    <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be in the first or fourth quadrant if <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is positive, or whether it be in the second or third when <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is negative. The problem therefore has also, in this case,
                    two solutions. The nature of the problem may however determine that which the
                    algebraic rule leaves ambiguous. Delambre, in his Astronomy, says, “These rules
                    are general, and easily remembered, and never mislead a calculator; while, on
                    the contrary’, the rules with which most writers have complicated trigonometry,
                    are so perplexing that there is hardly an author that has not given false ones.”
                    The rule of the signs was long neglected by astronomers, on the known principle
                    that improvements come slowly into general use.</p><p>6. *****Let ABC be a spherical triangle, and let O be the centre of the sphere;

                    analytically our fourth theorem, which has been demonstrated in article 3, from
                    considerations purely geometrical. This theorem, which has been known for two
                    centuries past, may be expressed thus: <hi rend="italic">Any spherical triangle
                    may be changed into another of which the sides and angles are respectively the

                    (8), (9) (10), are sufficient for resolving all cases of spherical triangles.
                    When one of the angles is a right angle, they become more simple. We shall now

                    continual use in astronomy. It is therefore desirable that they should be
                    comprehended in the fewest number possible of practical rules, simple and easily
                    remembered. Such were found by Napier, the inventor of logarithms, and are known
                    by the name of <hi rend="italic">Napiers Rules of the circular Parts.</hi> They
                    are not new propositions, but are merely enunciations, which, by a particular
                    arrangement and classification of the parts of a triangle, include all the six
                    proportions. They are perhaps the happiest example of artificial memory that is
                    known.</p><p>In a right-angled spherical triangle ABC, setting aside the right angle A, there
                    remain the sides AC = <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and AB = <hi rend="italic">c</hi>
                    about the right angle; the hypotenuse BC = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and the two
                    oblique angles B, C. The first two of these, viz. the sides <hi rend="italic">b,
                    c,</hi> and the complements of the remaining three, viz. 90° — a, 90° — B, 90° —
                    C, are called the five <hi rend="italic">circular</hi> parts. They are called
                    circular, because, when taken in their order, they go round the triangle.</p><p>14. When one of the five circular parts is taken as the <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> part, the two next to it, one on each side, are called the <hi rend="italic">adjacent</hi> parts; and the other two, each of which is separated
                    from the middle by an adjacent part, are called the <hi rend="italic">opposite</hi> parts.</p><p>Thus, if 90° — <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the middle part. 90° — C and 90° — B
                    are the adjacent parts, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and c the opposite parts;
                    if 90° — B be the middle part, 90° — <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> are the adjacent parts, and 90° — C and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are the opposite parts; and if c be the middle part, 90° — B and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are the adjacent parts, and 90°— <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    and 90° —C the opposite parts; and so on.</p><p>This arrangement being made, the rule of the circular parts is contained in the
                    following proposition:</p><p><hi rend="italic">The rectangle under radius and the sine of the middle part is
                    equal to the rectangle under the tangents of the adjacent parts; also to the
                    rectangle under the cosines of the opposite parts.</hi></p><p>It may assist the memory if we represent the middle part by the letter M, the
                    adjacent parts by the letters A, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, and the opposite
                    parts by the letters O, <hi rend="italic">o</hi>; the rule will stand thus:</p><p>****R∙sin. M = tan. A ∙ tan. <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> R ∙ sin. M — cos. O ∙ cos.

                    hypotenuse, be the middle part; then 90° — C, and 90° — B will be the adjacent,

                    right-angled triangles than to apply Napier’s rules. In astronomy, the sun’s
                    longitude ( ) is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, of which the right
                    ascension (<hi rend="italic">A</hi> R) and declination (D) are the sides about
                    the right angle, the obliquity of the ecliptic (<hi rend="italic">ω</hi>) is one
                    of the oblique angles. Let the other oblique angle be denoted by A, then the six
                    formulae for right-angled spherical triangles adapted to astronomical
                    calculation will stand thus:</p><p>***Sin. D = sin. <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> sin. Q, tan. .4R = cos. <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> tan. 0, tan. D = tan. <hi rend="italic">u</hi> sin. All,

                    cos. Q — cot. a, cot. A, cos. A = sin. ω cos. AR.</p><p>The practical astronomer, who has continual occasion to use the first four of
                    these formulae, will find no difficulty in retaining them in his memory. But
                    Napier’s rules will probably be most easily remembered by students of that
                    science.</p><p>17. The general formulae, I., II., III., IV., serve for all spherical triangles;

                    removed the defect, and, in addition, deduced the first and second formulae from
                    the third and fourth by the theorem here demonstrated in art. 11. Thus he is
                    entitled to share with Napier in the honour of having discovered these very

                    also be = 0. This requires that B = C. The converse follows from the same
                    formula.</p><p>III. Any two sides of a spherical triangle are together greater than the
                    third.</p><p>It appears from article 17, that</p><p>****. sin. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">c</hi> cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi> A</p><p><hi rend="superscript"> 2y</hi> ~ <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> sm.⅜(α -I- <hi rend="italic">b</hi>-fc)</p><p>The second side of this equation is always a positive quantity, therefore the

                    This proposition has been otherwise proved geometrically, Theorem III.</p><p>IV. We have found (article 21) that</p><p>Cos. ½ (<hi rend="italic">b</hi> + <hi rend="italic">c</hi>) sin. ½A = cos. ½ (B
                    + C) cos. ½ <hi rend="italic">a</hi>.</p><p>Now sin. ½A and cos. ½ <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are always positive, because each
                    arc is less than a quadrant. Therefore cos. ½(<hi rend="italic">b</hi> + <hi rend="italic">c</hi>) and cos. ½ (B + C) have always the same sign; and hence ½
                    <hi rend="italic">(b</hi> + <hi rend="italic">c)</hi> and ½ (B + C) are of the
                    same affection, and B + C, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> + c, either both less than a
                    semicircle, or both equal to it, or both greater.</p><p>V. The hypotenuse <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of a right-angled spherical triangle
                    is less or greater than 90°, according as the sides <hi rend="italic">b, c,</hi>
                    about the right angle A, are of the same affection, or of different affection;
                    that is, in the former case, both less or both greater than 90°; and in the
                    latter, one less and the other greater than 90°.</p><p>This follows immediately from the formula cos. <hi rend="italic">a ≡</hi> cos.
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> cos. <hi rend="italic">c</hi> (art. 12); for if <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> be both less than 90° or both
                    greater, they have like signs, and their product has the sign +, which indicates
                    that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is less than 90°. If one of the two <hi rend="italic">b, c</hi> be less and the other greater than 90°, they will have
                    different signs, and the sign of their product will be —, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> must be greater than 90°.</p><p>VI. The same rule applies to each of the sides <hi rend="italic">b, c</hi>; for
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will be less than 90° if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> be of the same affection, but greater than 90° if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and c are of different affection.</p><p>VII. The formula cos. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = cot B cot. C shows that the
                    hypotenuse <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will be less than 90° when B and C are of
                    the same affection, but greater than 90° if they be of different affection.</p><p>VIII. Also, that either of the angles B, C, will be less than 90° if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the other angle be of the same affection, but greater
                    than 90° if they be of different affection.</p><p>IX. The formula cos. B = cos. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">c</hi> shows that the angle B and the opposite side <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    are always of the same affection.</p><p>X. The formula tan. <hi rend="italic">c</hi> = tan. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> cot
                    B shows that the hypotenuse <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and either side c are of
                    the same affection if the angle they contain be acute, but of different
                    affection if the angle be obtuse.</p><p>XI. Lastly, the formula tan. <hi rend="italic">b =</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">c</hi> tan. B proves that the side and the opposite angle are always of the
                    same affection.</p><p>XII. In any spherical triangle ABC, draw AD an arc of a great circle
                    perpendicular to the base BC, thus forming two right-angled triangles ADC, ADB,
                    which have <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=404" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0404-0384"/>a common side AD. We have (art. 13) tan. AD = tan.
                    C sin. CD = tan. B sin. BD; hence the angles ACD, ABD, are either both acute or
                    both obtuse. If therefore ACB and ABC be of the same affection, the
                    perpendicular falls within the triangle ABC; but if the angles ACB' and AB'C are
                    of contrary affection, the perpendicular falls without the triangle AB’C.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Solution of Right-Angled Triangles.</hi></p><p>A spherical triangle may have one right angle, or it may have two, or three. If
                    it have two right angles, the sides opposite to these will be quadrants, and the

                    be equilateral, and its sides quadrants. We shall set aside these cases, and
