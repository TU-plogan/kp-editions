                <p><label type="entry"><hi rend="smallcaps">Tatta</hi></label>, an ancient and
                    celebrated city, and capital of the above district, situated near the banks of
                    the Indus, about 130 miles by the course of the river from the sea. It was
                    formerly a rich and commercial city, but is now greatly decayed, exhibiting,
                    instead of the bustle and animation of its ancient trade, long streets of
                    ruinous and uninhabited houses. The situation is in a valley formed by a range
                    of low rocky hills, which, during the freshes of the Indus, is inundated; but
                    being placed on an eminence, apparently formed by ancient ruins, Tatta has the
                    appearance of an island when the adjacent flat is inundated by the rains. The
                    streets are narrow and dirty; but the houses are superior to the low huts
                    commonly seen in native towns. They are built on a peculiar plan. The walls are
                    made hollow by <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=110"

                    inches long, being nailed across each other, from the outer edges of a small
                    frame of wood. They are placed diagonally, and thus form a strong frame on both
                    sides, which is plastered over with mud or mortar, and afterwards has the
                    appearance of a solid wall. They are frequently four stories high, with heavy
                    flat roofs. Many of the better sort are built with brick and mortar on a frame
                    of timber; and all, from the governor’s house to the lowest hovel, have a sort
                    of ventilators like chimneys, down which the wind blows cool and refreshing in
                    the most sultry weather; at which time every aperture is shut to exclude the hot
                    wind and the dust. The old English factory purchased by the company in 1751
                    still remains, and may be reckoned the best house in the place. To the
                    southward, within the town, are the remains of an old fort.</p>
                <p>The town was formerly defended by a strong brick wall with round towers. These
                    are now heaps of ruins; and the mosques and pagodas that remain exhibit symptoms
                    of rapid decay. The town is, however, estimated by Colonel Pottinger to be still
                    six miles in circumference, exclusive of the ruins, which extend a great way on
                    either side. No trace exists of the origin of this city, or by whom it was
                    founded. The earliest mention of it occurs in the year 677, when it was
                    fortified, and made some slight resistance to the victorious armies of the
                    caliphs of Bagdad. Its site is supposed to be that of the Pattala of the Greeks;
                    but the lower districts of Sinde have undergone such remarkable changes even
                    within the memory of man, that all such conclusions rest on mere conjecture. The
                    native princes of Sinde, when they shook off the Arab yoke, fixed on Tatta as
                    their capital, which, from its favourable situation between India on the east,
                    and Asia to the north and west, became a great commercial emporium, and one of
                    the richest cities of Asia. No labour or expense was spared in beautifying the
                    city with handsome buildings and the establishment of fine gardens; while the
                    more important objects were attended to of affording facility to trade by
                    cutting canals from the Indus, which runs four miles to the east of the town;
                    through which goods were brought and landed from boats at the very doors of the
                    merchants’ houses. All traces of these ornamental improvements are now almost
                    entirely obliterated, and the only aqueduct that yet remains is choked with
                    rubbish, and is nothing superior to a common drain. The decline of this city may
                    be dated from its subjection to the empire of Hindustan; still, at the time that
                    it was visited by Nadir Shah on his return from Delhi, it was estimated to
                    contain 40,000 weavers of calicoes and silk stuffs, with artisans of every other
                    class and description to the number of 20,000 more; besides bankers,
                    money-changers, shop-keepers, and sellers of grain, who were estimated at
                    60,000. The population has now dwindled down to less than 20,000; and the annual
                    revenue of the city does not exceed one lac of rupees, or L. 12,500, which is
                    not equal to the monthly collections during the period of its former grandeur.
                    The only manufactures now carried on in Tatta are a few white cloths, and
                    coloured loongees, which are cloths for sashes, turbans, &amp;c. of silk or
                    cotton. The streets are deserted; the few shops that remain open are scarcely
                    worthy of the name, and the whole bazaar exhibits a deplorable picture of
                    poverty and depressed commerce. The chief exports are ghee, bdellium, potash,
                    oil, raisins, saltpetre, aniseed, musk, chintzes, shawls from Shikarpoor,
                    carpets, and a variety of drugs. The imports are cocoa-nuts, pepper, cardamoms,
                    betel-nuts, nutmegs, cinnamon, silk raw and manufactured, cochineal, broad
                    cloth, quicksilver, tin, iron, steel, copper, lead, black wood, sandal wood, and
                    sandalwood oil. The Indus is in general shoal opposite to Tatta; and in
                    consequence trading boats lie off a small village named Begurah, distant five
                    miles, with generally two, but sometimes four fathoms of water, and the breadth
                    of the river about one mile. The boats used here on the Indus are generally
                    square at both ends, low forward, high abaft, flat-bottomed, and drawing only a
                    few inches of water; they are either pushed along with poles, or dragged, and
                    when the wind is fair sails are used. There are four routes from Tatta to
                    Hyderabad, two by land, and two by water; the shortest of which may be estimated
                    at fifty-three miles. The country around Tatta, with the exception of the hill
                    of Mukulee, about three miles to the west, is a perfect level. These hills, as
                    well as the plain, are covered with a thick jungle, principally of the tamarisk
                    and a species of bastard myrtle. The heat, when Colonel Pottinger was at Tatta,
                    was excessive, the thermometer ranging from 91° to 102°; but towards the middle
                    of July the atmosphere was refreshed by copious rains, and by strong southerly
                    gales, which rendered the air cooler towards the middle of July. The hill of
                    Mukulee, already mentioned, is covered with a number of graves and mausoleums,
                    the habitations of the dead, the only remaining melancholy memorials of ancient
                    magnificence, greatly exceeding those of the living. The tomb of Mirza Eesa
                    Toorkhan, which is supposed to have been erected in 1622, is uncommonly
                    magnificent and well executed. It consists of a large building, eighty-five feet
                    square, and two stories high, with a cupola seventy feet high, partly hid by two
                    balconies, the fronts of which are supported by pillars. It is enclosed by a
                    high wall, the stones of which are neatly engraved and inlaid. The whole is of a
                    yellow freestone; and inside, under the centre of the dome, is a mound of black
                    stone, on which are engraved the names of the inmates of this gloomy dwelling.
                    Several tombs are built of the same kind of stone; and there are others highly
                    ornamented with enamelled tiles of beautiful green, purple, and blue colours;
                    but “the exquisite engraving,” says Pottinger, “of chapters of the Koran on the
                    stone door-frames, surpassed every tiling else that we found worthy of
                    observation in these sepulchres.” On the southern side of the hill there is also
                    dug out of the solid rock a very remarkable well, with a chamber all round it,
                    about twelve feet below the surface, to which the descent is by spiral steps.
                    The water of this well has a strong medicinal taste. On the banks of the Indus,
                    seven miles above Tatta, is another hill covered with white mosques and tombs of
                    deceased Mahommedans, some of the latter of considerable size. Travelling
