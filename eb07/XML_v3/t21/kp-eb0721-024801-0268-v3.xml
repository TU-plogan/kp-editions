                <p><label type="entry">THOMSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a poet of
                    great eminence, was born in the parish of Ednam and county of Roxburgh, on the
                    11th of September 1700. His father was minister of that parish, which is
                    contiguous to Kelso. The maiden name of his mother was Beatrix Trotter, and she
                    was co-heiress of a small demesne in the county. In Dr Johnson’s life of the
                    poet she is called Hume; a mistake which is pointed out by Boswell, who supplied
                    the great biographer with some materials for his narrative, which he either
                    forgot or neglected. Mrs Thomson presented her husband with nine children, whose
                    maintenance and education may have been a pleasing, but could not be a light
                    burden, to parents circumstanced as they were. At an early age James showed
                    great aptitude for learning; and Mr Riccarton,<note anchored="true"

                    may perhaps be doubted whether this was not the same individual whose works were

                    Riccaltoun, Minister of the Gospel at Hobkirk." Edinb. 1771-2, 3 vols. 8vo. The

                    upon himself the chief direction of his studies. The elementary branches of
                    knowledge Thomson acquired at Jedburgh school. There he was inoculated with the
                    love of versifying; but how his thoughts were directed into that channel, does
                    not appear. Mediocrity is easily satisfied with its own attainments, and
                    cherishes its mean performances with pious care. After the first gaze of
                    parental fondness, the <hi rend="italic">mens divinior</hi> turns from its
                    offspring with indifference or aversion, and endeavours to breathe life into a
                    more perfect progeny. On the first day of every year, Thomson committed to the
                    flames all the poetical effusions of the preceding twelvemonth. The master could
                    perceive in his pupil no indications of superior capacity; but schoolmasters are
                    not unfrequently the most fallible of all prophets. One youth, who was to enter
                    upon a career of glory, often dwindles into insignificance; and another, who has
                    been consigned to perpetual obscurity, as often covers his oracular preceptor
                    with confusion by arriving at distinction.</p>
                <p>From Jedburgh school Thomson was removed to the university of Edinburgh. After he
                    had prosecuted his studies there for two years, he received a hasty summons to
                    attend his father in his last extremity, but did not arrive in time to receive
                    his dying benediction. His mother now removed with her family to Edinburgh; and
                    in order to carry this arrangement into effect, it became necessary for her to
                    raise money by the mortgage of her little estate. Although somewhat of an
                    enthusiast in religious matters, she conducted her domestic affairs with great
                    prudence and economy, and lived to see her son distinguished by the favour of
                    the great. The friends of Thomson were desirous that he should direct his views
                    towards the church; but he does not appear to have had any great predilection
                    for the clerical profession. At college he remained unnoticed, until Mr
                    Hamilton, the professor of divinity, bestowed a mixture of praise and censure
                    upon a probationary exercise of his, explanatory of one of the psalms. The
                    professor commended the fervour of his sentiments and the majesty of his
                    diction; but added, that if he wished to be of any use as a preacher of the
                    gospel, he must descend to the level of vulgar understandings. Whether the
                    commendation was cold, and the reproof warm, or whether Thomson had anticipated
                    unqualified applause, and was disgusted by the modification with which it was
                    administered, he now abandoned all thoughts of continuing his theological
                    studies. His discourse had been censured as too poetical; and the poems which he
                    handed about at this time were condemn <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=269" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0269-0249"/>ed
                    by some small critics of the city, upon what ground it is unnecessary to
                    inquire. That his youthful productions were not without their faults, it is very
                    easy to conceive, and these were pointed out with laborious minuteness; but
                    their beauties, of which it is improbable that they were entirely destitute,
                    passed unobserved. Finding that his countrymen had formed a standard of
                    composition, both in prose and verse, which he was unable to reach, Thomson
                    resolved to submit his productions to a tribunal of strangers. But although the
                    former were insensible to his merits when their favour might have been of some
                    use to him, they did not fail to praise him when their praise was of little
                    value; nor did they neglect the accustomed tribute of lamentation when all tears
                    were vain. Long after the tomb had closed over his remains, a society of
                    gentlemen in the Scotish metropolis was formed for the purpose of celebrating
                    his birth-day by a musical entertainment. These tuneful associates, who
                    continued their union for several years, were pleased to call themselves the
                    Knights Companions of the Cape.</p>
                <p>Thomson now repaired to London, carrying with him letters of recommendation to
                    various individuals of influence; but of these credentials he had the misfortune
                    to be robbed. They were tied up in a handkerchief, and when he was staring at
                    the wonders of the metropolis, he was eased of his bundle by a pickpocket, who
                    was probably as much chagrined by what he had gained, as Thomson was by what he
                    had lost. To London it is said that he was allured by the hopes excited in him
                    by Lady Grizzel Baillie, who promised much, and performed nothing. For the
                    supply of his numerous wants, and among others that of a pair of shoes, his sole
                    dependence was upon his poem of Winter, which the booksellers manifested little
                    eagerness to purchase. At last he sold it for a trifling sum, but it was ong in
                    finding admirers, and the publisher, “J. Millan, at Locke’s Head in Shug-Lane,”
                    had some misgivings that his parsimony savoured of rashness. It however fell in
                    the way of some persons of taste and discernment, who spread its fame, and it
                    was finally received with very general applause. It appeared in 1726, with a
                    prose dedication to Sir Spencer Compton.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Winter; a Poem. By James Thomson, A. Μ. Lond. 1726,
                    fol.</p></note> ' At this period of his history, the indigent bard was much
                    indebted to the friendship of Mallet, who was then tutor to the sons of the duke
                    of Montrose. Mallet was a man of consummate dexterity, and very well qualified
                    to enlighten his countryman in the art of pushing his fortune. In his zeal for
                    the dignity of letters, Dr Johnson remarks that Thomson at this time “obtained
                    the notice of Aaron Hill, whom, being friendless and indigent, and glad of
                    kindness, he courted with every expression of servile adulation.” Hyperbolical
                    encomium can expect little sympathy from those who have never been obliged,
                    anymore than raving resentment from those who have never been injured; but
                    surely the eloquence of gratitude is not so frequently heard as to create
                    disgust. It appears from the interchange of high-flown compliments in the
                    correspondence between Hill and Richardson, that flattery seldom came amiss to
                    either; yet Hill was an ingenious and benevolent man, upon whom much praise
                    could be conscientiously bestowed. He was also a man of spirit, as Pope had
                    occasion to ascertain, when he provided him with a niche in the Dunciad. A proof
                    of all these qualities now appeared in his conduct to the young poet. Of the
                    dedication Sir Spencer Compton took no notice, until there appeared in the
                    newspapers a copy of complimentary verses, addressed by Hill to Thomson,
                    lamenting the miseries of genius, and condemning the paltry Maecenases of the
                    age. The result of this memento was an interview with Thomson, in which Sir
                    Spencer, with much of the grace and delicacy of one bestowing alms upon a
                    mendicant, made the poet a present of twenty guineas. The successful author of
                    the present day has reason to be thankful that the multiplicity of readers has
                    placed him above dependence upon any other patronage, whether private or
                    political. A second impression of <hi rend="italic">Winter</hi> was now called
                    for, and the author’s friends began rapidly to increase. Among these was Dr
                    Rundle, afterwards bishop of Derry, who introduced him to the Lord Chancellor
                    Talbot. In 1727 appeared <hi rend="italic">Summer,</hi> which was followed by “A
                    Poem sacred to the Memory of Sir Isaac Newton." To this production he was
                    enabled, by the instruction of his friend Mr Gray, to impart a philosophic
                    spirit, worthy of the departed sage. This year also produced <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia,</hi> in which was echoed the general cry against the ministry for
                    remissness in vindicating the national honour, which had been insulted by the
                    maritime depredations of the Spaniards. In 1728 was published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spring,</hi> dedicated to the countess of Hertford, afterwards duchess of
                    Somerset, by whom the poet was invited to pass some time at the family-seat. The
                    countess was herself addicted to the muses, and regaled her visitor by reciting
                    to him many of her poetical lucubrations. This species of pastime, however,
                    Thomson found somewhat insipid, and sought relief so frequently in the jovial
                    company which surrounded his lordship’s table, that he forfeited the favour of
                    his learned hostess, and this invitation to become her guest, which was the
                    first, was also the last that he ever received. In 1729, the tragedy of
                    Sophonisba was acted at Drury Lane; and in the following year, by the addition
                    of <hi rend="italic">Autumn,</hi> the plan of “The Seasons” was completed, and
                    they were combined in a quarto volume. The success of the play was much more
                    moderate than was anticipated by the author’s numerous and powerful friends. The
                    feeble verse,</p>
                <p>O, Sophonisba, Sophonisba. O!</p>
                <p>and the parody to which it gave rise,</p>
                <p>O, Jemmy Thomson, Jemmy Thomson, O!</p>
                <p>are still remembered; a fate which has attended few of his other tragic lines.
                    His genius does not seem to have been dramatic: he is often flat, and when he
                    rises, he seldom rises above rant; even his declamation, into which his dialogue
                    too often degenerates, is not splendid, and his pathos is not affecting. In
                    this, and in all his other plays, there is a perpetual repetition of the word
                    glory, which argues great poverty of sentiment; and Hurd did him little
                    injustice when he applied to his palpable and laborious art in tragedy the words
                    of Horace, <hi rend="italic">promissus grandia turget.</hi> Nor does he display
                    any skill in depicting character, being <hi rend="italic">a</hi> more diligent
                    observer of external nature, than of the qualities of men. His heroine hates the
                    Romans, and, with little variation of expression, she says so every time she
                    appears upon the scene. Syphax is only another Bajazet, and his rival Masinissa
                    a common tragic lover, with whose raptures and lamentations no one has much
                    sympathy.</p>
                <p>About this time, Thomson is said to have been under great obligations to the
                    eccentric generosity of Quin, the celebrated actor, who, as the story goes,
                    relieved him from a spιmging-house in Holborn. After the publication of his
                    Seasons, one of his creditors had him arrested, judging that a likely time to
                    procure payment. the amount of the debt was not forthcoming, and Thomson had
                    every prospect of a lengthened sojourn in his involuntary retirement, when he
                    was visited by Quin, with whom he had no personal acquaintance. The comedian
                    gracefully apologized for his intrusion, to which Thomson was easily reconciled.
                    The additional liberty of ordering supper was also taken in good part. After
                    they bad supped luxuriously and drunk freely, Quin informed his new associate
                    that he was indebted to him in the sum of one hundred pounds for pleasure
                    received in the perusal of the Seasons. He then deposited<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=270" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0270-0250"/>
                    the money on the table, and took his departure, leaving the imprisoned bard full
                    of gratitude and amazement.</p>
                <p>Thomson’s poetical labours were now agreeably interrupted by an invitation to
                    attend the eldest son of Lord Talbot upon his travels. For this advantageous
                    opportunity of extending his experience, he was indebted to the friendship of Dr
                    Rundle. Upon his return to England, he was made secretary of briefs; the profits
                    of which appointment were fully adequate to all his wants and desires. When in
                    Italy, he conceived the idea of writing the poem of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Liberty,</hi> which was afterwards completed in five parts, successively
                    published in quarto; the first, second, and third in 1735, the fourth and fifth
                    in 1736. This poem he dedicated to the prince of Wales. One who has read the
                    achievements of the masters of the world, and seen their posterity sunk in
                    slavery and vice, is apt to imagine that he can say something that is new on the
                    blessings of freedom and the horrors of oppression. But his sensations, which
                    have been felt by all, have been described by many; and in the fervour of
                    composition, mistaking the children of memory for the offspring of fancy, a
                    great writer may produce, upon such an impracticable theme, nothing but a tissue
                    of common-places, when he dreams that he has been making an invaluable addition
                    to the treasures of knowledge. No man, whether sane or otherwise, prefers
                    darkness and chains to light and the free range of creation; and when Thomson
                    proved, by a multiplicity of examples drawn from the history of every age and
                    nation, that the former were to be shunned and the latter pursued, the reader
                    was neither amused nor instructed. By a species of infatuation not uncommon
                    among authors, Thomson considered this poem the best of all his productions. It
                    was coldly received by the public when it first appeared; and after the poet’s
                    death, when Sir George Lyttelton was collecting his works for the press, he
                    thought the best way of consulting the reputation of his deceased friend was to
                    abridge it; a strange and unwarrantable proceeding, which no motives can
                    justify. In the mutilated condition to which it was reduced by Lyttelton, it now
                    appears.</p>
                <p>The mortification of finding the public opinion of his poem opposed to his own,
                    was followed by the death of Lord Talbot, an event which deprived Thomson of his
                    place. The new chancellor, Lord Hardwicke, kept it vacant for some time, in
                    order to afford him an opportunity of applying, in the usual form, to be
                    reinstated; but no such application was made, and his lordship bestowed it upon
                    another person. The silence of Thomson probably proceeded from an incurable
                    habit of neglecting his own affairs; for his experience was sufficient to inform
                    him, that the dignity of a needy man who expects to be loaded with unsolicited
                    benefits, will soon be his sole possession. His great friends, however, did not
                    desert him; and soon after he had ceased to be a placeman, he was introduced to
                    the prince of Wales, who, among other modes of courting popularity, professed
                    himself a friend to men of letters. Being questioned by the prince on the state
                    of his affairs, Thomson informed his royal highness that “they were in a more
                    poetical posture than formerly.” This gay reply produced what might have been
                    denied to a tedious catalogue of grievances, a pension of one hundred pounds a
                    year. This allowance, well-timed as it was, being insufficient to support him in
                    his former mode of living, he again had recourse to his pen. In 1738 his tragedy
                    of Agamemnon was acted at Drury Lane. The performance was graced by the presence
                    of Pope, who, on his entering the theatre, received from the audience nearly all
                    the applause of the evening; for although supported by the acting of Quin in the
                    hero, the play, to use the words of Johnson, “had the fate which commonly
                    attends mythological stories, and was only endured, but not favoured.” Being
                    still compelled to write for the stage, Thomson next produced Edward and
                    Eleanora, to the first edition of which is prefixed the following advertisement:
                    “The representation of this tragedy on the stage was prohibited in the year one
                    thousand seven hundred and thirty-nine.” Brooke’s Gustavus Vasa was the first,
                    and Thomson’s the second, play prohibited by the operation of the new act for
                    licensing dramatic performances. In both cases this act seems to have been
                    exercised with very superfluous rigour. The following lines, however, which
                    occur near the beginning of Thomson’s tragedy, may perhaps have arrested the eye
                    of authority, and sealed its fate.</p>
                <p>In times like these, Disturb’d and low'ring with unsettled freedom. One step to
                    lawless power, one old attempt Renew’d, the least infringement of our charters.
                    Would burl the giddy nation into tempest.</p>
                <p>In conjunction with Mallet, he afterwards wrote the masque of Alfred, which was
                    played before the prince of Wales. To the favour of that illustrious personage,
                    who was on bad terms with the court, it is probable that he owed, in some
                    degree, the prohibition of his former drama. The tragedy of Tancred and
                    Sigismunda, taken from the novel in Gil Blas, was performed at Drury Lane in
                    1745. It was the most successful of his dramatic efforts, and kept possession of
                    the stage until a recent period. This tragedy was followed by the Castle of
                    Indolence, the last of his works that was published in his life-time, and, in
                    the opinion of many, the most brilliant effort of his genius. The frequent
                    recurrence of the rhyme in the Spenserian measure occasionally produces a
                    redundance both of sentiment and expression; but this objection scarcely applies
                    to any one stanza of the first canto of this poem. Every line breathes the
                    spirit of seductive languor, to which every new image lends additional force,
                    until the mind is steeped in luxurious lethargy. In the second canto the obvious
                    reasoning of Sir Industry is a feeble antidote to the eloquent sophistry of the
                    wizard Indolence in the first The necessity for further literary exertion was
                    removed by his appointment to the office of surveyor-general of the Leeward
                    Islands, which was procured for him by the influence of Lyttelton. His clear
                    emoluments amounted to about three hundred pounds a year, and the duties of his
                    office he was suffered to perform by deputy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Thomson had now every prospect of enjoying many years of learned ease; but he had
                    scarcely ceased to be the sport of fortune, when he was suddenly removed from
                    the scene. A cold caught upon the river between London and Kew, was succeeded by
                    a fever, of which he had partly recovered, when imprudent exposure to the
                    evening dews induced a recurrence of his malady, and terminated his life on the
                    27th of August 1748. His remains were interred in the church of Richmond in
                    Surrey; and in 1762 a monument was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey.
                    The expense of this memorial was defrayed by an edition of his works, published
                    during that year, in two volumes quarto. The king subscribed one hundred pounds.
                    A life of the author was prefixed by his intimate friend Dr Murdoch. But the
                    noblest tribute to the memory of Thomson is the beautiful ode of Collins,
                    beginning,</p>

                <p>The tragedy of Coriolanus, which he bad prepared for the stage, was after his
                    death performed at Covent Garden. The profits of the representation discharged
                    his debts, and left a considerable overplus, which was remitted to his sisters.
                    The principal character was supported by Quin, who also delivered a prologue
                    written by Lyttelton. When he had to utter the following lines, the great
                    comedian, who had long lived on terms of the most affectionate intimacy with
                    Thomson, was entirely overcome by his emotions:</p>
                <p>He lov’d his friends—forgive this gushing tear.— Alas! I feel I am no actor
                    here.</p>
                <p>Thomson was a man of a gross habit of body, and of a dull aspect. In a mixed or
                    numerous company he was ill at ease, and appeared to disadvantage; but when
                    surrounded by a few familiar faces, his embarrassment disappeared, and he became
                    frank, cheerful, and amusing. As a son and brother, his conduct was exemplary. A
                    letter to his sister, inserted in Johnson’s narrative, breathes the purest
                    spirit of fraternal affection. He was warmly attached to his friends, whom he
                    inspired with the same degree of cordial tenderness. He was not easily roused to
                    personal exertion, either in his own behalf or that of others; but his money was
                    freely shared with those whom he loved or pitied. In his prosperous days, he was
                    never known to shake oft’ a humble friend; and even Savage, the most
                    inconvenient of all associates, whose pride, although he lived by borrowing, was
                    as sensitive as an unhealed wound, praised Thomson’s steady friendship to the
                    skies. Upon the same authority, as related by Johnson, we learn that his habits
                    of life formed rather a ludicrous contrast to the delicacy of sentiment which
                    pervades his writings. The veracity of Savage was not his most shining quality,
                    but if Thomson had the failings imputed to him, he had also the grace to be
                    ashamed of them; an example which might have been followed with advantage by
                    succeeding writers, who have endeavoured to earn money and applause by making
                    the world a confidant of their vices.</p>
                <p>From Thomson, as an author, has never been withheld the highest praise, that of
                    originality. “He thinks,” says Johnson, “in a peculiar train, and he thinks
                    always as a man of genius; he looks round on nature and life with the eye which
                    nature bestows only on a poet; the eye that distinguishes, in every thing
                    presented to its view, whatever there is on which imagination can delight to be
                    detained, and with a mind that at once comprehends the vast, and attends to the
                    minute. The reader of the Seasons wonders that he never saw before what Thomson
                    shows him, and that he never yet has felt what Thomson impresses.” Where
                    intellectual eminence was not conspicuous, Johnson distributed commendation with
                    a very sparing hand, whether the character reviewed was dignified by rank, which
                    he valued much, or by virtue, which he valued more. Upon a lover of liberty, a
                    man of easy morals, and a writer of blank verse, in his estimation a delinquent
                    almost as odious as either, he would have bestowed no praise that he could
                    conscientiously have withheld. This liberal encomium on Thomson, therefore,
                    ought to satisfy the warmest admirers of that poet, and to silence those who
                    would detract from his reputation.</p>
                <p>The Seasons have been translated into several languages. A translation into Latin
                    verse was published by Brownell. There are three different versions into French
                    prose; and a version into French verse was published by J. Poullin in the year
                    1802. Of Spring and Winter a Danish version was executed by Peter Foersom, and
                    was printed in the posthumous collection of his poems.<note anchored="true"
