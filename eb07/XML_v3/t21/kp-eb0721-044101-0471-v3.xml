                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">TYRTAEUS</label>, a renowned poet, was an Athenian by birth,
                    and flourished about 682 years before the commencement of the Christian, era. He
                    followed the occupation of a schoolmaster, was lame in one foot, and was
                    considered as scarcely sound in mind. By the foolish, genius is sometimes
                    mistaken for fatuity. The causes which led to his being placed in a more
                    conspicuous situation were very peculiar. During their second war with the
                    Messenians, the Lacedaemonians having consulted the oracle of Delphi, were
                    directed to request the services of an Athenian general. The Athenians were
                    unwilling to disregard the injunctions of the oracle, but they were also
                    unwilling to assist a rival state in extending its dangerous power in the
                    Peloponnesus; and with the view of at once complying <pb break="no"

                    />with the form, and evading the spirit of the response, they sent the lame and
                    eccentric poet to Sparta. By the force of his genius, he speedily effaced the
                    first impressions occasioned by the meanness of his personal appearance; but his
                    victories were achieved by the lyre and not by the sword. He composed various
                    poems in praise of valour and patriotism, and breathed a new spirit into the
                    rude soldiers of Sparta. When they had been thrice repulsed, and their leaders
                    were on the point of ordering a retreat, Tyrtaeus, by loudly reciting his noble
                    verses, roused the drooping courage of the army to such a height, that every
                    warrior prepared to conquer or die. In the anticipation that they might all
                    perish on that bloody field, they each fastened on the right arm a ticket,
                    containing his own name and that of his lather, lest, in the general mass of
                    carnage, it might be impossible to recognise their mangled bodies. The
                    Messenians fought with great valour and determination, but the Lacedaemonians at
                    length obtained the victory. When civil discords afterwards arose at Sparta,
                    they were dispelled by the potent song of Tyrtaeus. As a reward of his eminent
                    services, he was admitted to the rights and privileges of a citizen. According
                    to the statement of Lycurgus, they passed a law, enjoining as a preparation for
                    battle, that the soldiers were to assemble at the king’s tent, in order to
                    listen to the recitation of this poet’s verses, so well calculated to inspire
                    them with a contempt of danger and death.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Of the literary history of Greece, very few portions are so singular as that
                    which we have now detailed; nor must it be forgotten that the people among whom
                    poetry effected such wonders, were never distinguished by the cultivation of
                    literature.</p>
                <p>Of the fragments of Tyrtaeus, the earliest edition is supposed to be that which
                    M. Aurogallus published along with the Hymns of Callimachus, Basil. 1532, 4to.
                    They were afterwards inserted in various collections, those of Tumebus,
                    Winterton, Brunck, Gaisford, and others. A separate edition was published by Dr
                    Moor, Glasg. 1759, 4to. Two editions, much more elaborate, were published by
                    Klotz, Bremae, 1764, 8vo, Altemb. 1707, 8vo. This second impression contains
                    various additions and improvements. But the most valuable edition that has yet
                    appeared is included in a volume bearing the title of “Jo. Valentini Franckii,
                    Philos. D. Callinus; sive, Quaestionis de Origine Carminis Elegiaci Tractatio
                    critica. Accedunt Tyrtaei Reliquiae, cum prooemio et critica annotatione.”
                    Altonae et Lipsiae, 1816, 8vo. The fragments of Tyrtaeus, almost entirely in
                    elegiac verse, are eleven in number, but only two of them extend to any
                    considerable length. One of them consists of a single verse. The fragment
                    beginning M <hi rend="italic">έχgις τευ xατἀxεισθε</hi>; which is frequently
                    printed among those of Tyrtaeus, is by the best critics assigned to
                    Callinus.</p>
