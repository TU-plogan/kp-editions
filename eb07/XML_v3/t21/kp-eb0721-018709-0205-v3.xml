                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">TESSERA</label>, in Roman antiquity, denoted in its primary
                    sense a cube or die; so called from the Greek word <hi rend="italic"
                    >τέσσαgα,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">τέσσεgα</hi>, <hi rend="italic">four;</hi>
                    respect being had to its number of sides, distinct from the two horizontal
                    planes above and below. And it was thus distinguished from the talus, which
                    being round at each end, contained only four planes or faces on which it could
                    stand; and therefore when thrown it had no more than two side faces in view.
                    Hence <hi rend="italic">ludere talis er ludere tesseris</hi> are spoken of by
                    Roman writers as two different games. The word <hi rend="italic">tessera</hi>
                    was applied to many other things, not so much from a similitude in the figure,
                    as from the relation they bore to some other things of which they were the sign
                    or token; as the points on the upper plane of the die denoted the good or ill
                    success of the cast.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tessera hospitalis</hi> was either public or private. As to
                    the former, we find among the inscriptions published by Gruter instances of two
                    municipal towns which put themselves under the patronage of the Roman governor;
                    and the reciprocal engagement between them, engraved on two copperplates, of an
                    oblong form, with a pediment at the top, is called in both <hi rend="italic"
                    >tessera hospitalis.</hi> The design of it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=206" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0206-0188"
                    />was to cultivate or maintain a lasting friendship between private persons and
                    their families, and gave a mutual claim to the contracting parties and their
                    descendants, of a reception and kind treatment at each other’s houses, as
                    occasion offered; for which end those tesserae were so contrived as best to
                    preserve the memory of that transaction to posterity. And one method of doing
                    this was by dividing one of them lengthwise into two equal parts, upon each of
                    which one of the parties wrote his name, and interchanged it with the other.
                    From this custom came the prevailing expression “tesseram hospitalem
                    confringere,” applied to persons who had violated their engagements.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tesserae frumentariae</hi> were small tallies given by the
                    emperors to the populace at Rome, entitling them to the reception of a quantity
                    of corn from the public at stated seasons. The person who had the inspection of
                    these was called <hi rend="italic">tesserarius.</hi> They were made of wood and
                    of stone. There was another kind of tessera, which entitled persons to a sight
                    of the public games and other diversions, usually made in an oblong form.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tessera militaris</hi> was a signal given by the general or
                    chief commander of an army, as a direction to the soldiers for executing any
                    duty or service required of them. This, upon urgent occasions, was only vocal;
                    but in ordinary cases it was written on a tablet, commonly made of wood. Besides
                    these civil and military tesserae, there are others which relate to religious
                    affairs, and may be called <hi rend="italic">sacred.</hi></p>
