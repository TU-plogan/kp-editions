                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Τηε</hi> term “timber” is applied to wood of sufficient size
                    to be adapted for building purposes, whether it be standing in the forest or
                    after it is felled. While the timber forms a portion of the growing tree, it is
                    distinguished as “standing timber when felled, it is called “rough timber.”
                    After the rough log is converted, that is, sawn into the forms for which it
                    appears best adapted, the various conversions, as the produce is called, are
                    designated according either to their shape or their dimensions, as sided timber,
                    balk, thickstuff, plank, or board. These several terms will be adverted to in a
                    more advanced portion of this article, where they will either be defined or
                    incidentally explained.</p>
                <p>Timber is of such incalculable value as the material for the construction of our
                    fleets, and it ministers also so largely and in such numerous forms to our
                    every-day wants, that it is not surprising the best means for its successful
                    cultivation should have occupied much of the attention of enlightened
                    horticulturists; while it is certainly a subject of much wonder, and has been
                    occasionally one causing no little anxiety, that the maintenance of an adequate
                    supply should be almost wholly left to accident, and that it consequently should
                    be greatly neglected.</p>
                <p>The species of timber which are chiefly used for building are oak and fir. Our
                    supply of fir is for the greater part drawn from abroad, as the climate of Great
                    Britain does not appear to be favourable to the growth of the best varieties of
                    this species of timber; but with oak the case is different. There is no doubt
                    that England was originally, almost from one extremity to the other, covered
                    with forests, in which the oak predominated; and perhaps the best oak in the
                    world is indigenous to England. We learn from the Doomsday-Book, that even in
                    the reign of William the Conqueror, timber was so plentiful that the woods were
                    not valued according to the quantity standing in them, nor according to the
                    quantity which might be annually felled. In fact, the woods, as timber, were
                    comparatively valueless, and their worth was estimated by the number of swine
                    which could be supported by the acorns. At present the produce of oak from our
                    forests is not in any adequate proportion to the demand for it; and we are
                    obliged to resort to foreign markets for this useful timber, or for substitutes.
                    This is to be regretted, because undoubtedly it is very desirable that we should
                    be independent of other nations for our supplies of so important a component of
                    our naval supremacy; and it is the more desirable, because in general the
                    substitutes which we are able to procure are not equal in quality to the produce
                    of our own soil. The oak of Great Britain is, for ship-building especially,
                    superior to most timber which we can thus obtain. The reason that the
                    maintenance of the supply of oak timber does not meet with the attention which
                    is required by the demand for it, evidently is, that although the demand is
                    present and urgent, the advantages to be derived by any attempt to provide a
                    supply are too prospective to tempt the cupidity of individual speculators. The
                    home supply is therefore almost wholly left to be provided by those who have a
                    hereditary interest in the produce of the soil, the great landholders. There
                    are, it is true, large tracts of land which, as royal forests, are available for
                    the services of the state; but it is only within a recent period that sufficient
                    attention has been paid to planting them, while the enormous demand for oak
                    timber during the late long naval war had completely exhausted the stock which
                    was previously growing upon them. It may not be deemed irrelevant to state the
                    extent of this forest-land; at the same time premising, that there is much of it
                    which is but ill adapted for the growth of good timber. the following account of
                    these forests is taken from the Seventh Report of the Commissioners of Lands
                    Revenue. It states the extent of the land in which the timber belongs to the
                    crown in each of the forests to be :—</p>
                <p>Acres. R. P.</p>
                <p>In New Forest 66,942 3 26</p>

                <p>115,594 0 34</p>
                <p>“Of which total quantity about 70,000 acres are fit for the growth of oak
                    timber.” The Report also gives a statement, which we shall quote, as forming a
                    criterion, founded on authority, to judge of the produce of forest-land: “If 700
                    acres, or <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi>, of
                    this land were enclosed and planted every year, until the whole 70,000 acres
                    shall be completed, they will, if kept under proper management, furnish a
                    perpetual supply of at least 35,000 loads of oak timber annually, from the time
                    that the first planted trees arrive at 100 years growth.” Table V. will give a
                    good idea of the enormous consumption of timber which is entailed upon us by the
                    extent of our navy. It may also be observed, that since the alterations in the
                    system of registry at Lloyd’s, merchant-ships consume nearly as much timber in
                    their construction as ships of war of similar burthens.</p>
                <p>The effect of the gradual destruction of the forests is a question of a
                    speculative nature; a question too speculative, and involving consequences too
                    far distant from our own time, to admit of discussion in this article: still it
                    may be thus casually adverted to, because it is not a stretch of the imagination
                    to suppose the time must arrive when the forests which furnish the present
                    supplies will be exhausted by the unceasing and increasing demand upon them, and
                    by the rapid spread of population. But a very few years have passed since it was
                    comparatively easy to procure fir trees from the north of Europe, of sufficient
                    size to make topmasts for the largest classes of men of war. Now there are no
                    trees from thence to be purchased which will make such topmasts. Until about
                    thirty-five or forty years ago Riga inch-masts were to be obtained as large as
                    twenty-five inches in diameter. At that time, from the increased difficulty in
                    procuring them, Canada yellow-pine sticks were substituted, which could then be
                    got with ease as large as thirty inches in diameter; but now it very rarely
                    happens that a stick of larger diameter than from twenty-five to twenty-seven
                    inches is imported, and even this timber of these sizes is gradually becoming
                    more scarce. Until lately timber of sufficient scantling to make stern-posts for
                    the largest ships was to be procured; now such logs are not in the market.</p>
                <p>The first English writer on timber was the celebrated Evelyn, who published his
                    “Sylva, or Discourse of Forest Trees,” in 1664. This book still continues one of
                    the standard works on the subject in our language. In 1774 a new edition of it,
                    with most extensive notes, and also engravings of the trees mentioned in the
                    text, was published by the celebrated Dr Alexander Hunter of York. The last
                    edition with these notes was published in 1825. In <pb break="no"

                    />France the two celebrated philosophers Buffon and Du Hamel have both devoted a
                    great portion of their useful lives to the investigation of the physiology of
                    timber, and their writings on the subject have long been the text-books of
                    arborists. In modern times the phenomena of the growth of plants have occupied
                    the attention of many men, some of whom have eminently distinguished themselves
                    in this particular branch of natural history, and to whose works we shall have
                    occasion to refer in the course of this article. The master-mind, however, in
                    these researches, and the one whose indefatigable labours have left but few of
                    the mysteries of vegetable physiology undeveloped, is Mr Knight, who was for
                    several years president of the Horticultural Society, and whose valuable papers
                    on the growth of plants in the Philosophical Transactions leave little scope for
                    further investigation on several of the most important questions.</p>
                <p>Botanists divide plants into two classes; exogenous, which are those that
                    increase in their growth by an annual accession of matter externally; and
                    endogenous, which are those that increase in their growth by an annual accession
                    of matter internally: therefore in exogenous plants the external parts are the
                    younger; and in the endogenous it is, on the contrary, the internal parts which
                    are of the latest growth. It is almost entirely of the exogenous plants that we
                    shall have occasion to treat in this article, the whole of the timber trees
                    classing under that head.</p>
                <p>The horizontal section of the stem of a plant of this description shows the
                    perfect or heart wood occupying the central and larger portion of the area of
                    the section. This wood must evidently, from what has been already stated, be of
                    the oldest growth in the centre of the tree, and the several concentric layers
                    must be younger in proportion to their distances from this centre. Around this
                    perfect wood there is seen a concentric belt of yet younger growth; so young ns
                    not yet to have attained to the maturity of the perfect wood. This belt is
                    called the alburnum or sap-wood; around it is another concentric belt, called
                    the liber; and this again is enclosed in the bark, or cortical substance, the
                    liber forming an internal coating to the bark. The centre of the heart-wood is
                    occupied by the pith; and there is a communication between the pith and the
                    bark, that is maintained by what are called the medullary rays, which, as their
                    name expresses, radiate from the pith, in the centre of the perfect wood, to the
                    external coating of the tree, the bark. The outer covering of the bark is
                    sometimes called the epidermis.</p>
                <p>We shall now proceed to describe, in a general manner, the process of the growth
                    of the plant, and the gradual formation of these several portions. The
                    germination of the seed is a mystery of nature yet undeveloped; but when the
                    seed has germinated, and the existence of the plant has commenced, the labours
                    of physiologists have enabled us to trace the various processes by which its
                    increase is effected. Mr Knight has related, in the papers which we have already
                    mentioned as having been published in the Philosophical Transactions, a series
                    of most conclusive experiments made by him, in order to ascertain the course of
                    the sap, the manner of its deposition, and the method of its influence on the
                    growth of the tree. He removed a ring of bark about half an inch in breadth,
                    from a number of trees, and compared the growth of these trees with that of
                    others not so treated. This was done early in the spring. The effects were, that
                    although the branches shot, and the parts above the incisions in the incised
                    trees did not appear to suffer, there was no increase in the parts below the
                    incisions; and that while the upper lips made considerable advances towards
                    establishing a reunion, the lower lips of the wounds remained without
                    alteration. In the course of the summer the wood from which the rings of bark
                    had been stripped, became dry and lifeless to some considerable depth beneath
                    its surface, and several buds made their appearance below the incisions. In
                    those trees in which a shoot produced by one of these buds was suffered to
                    remain, the parts of the stem below the shoot very soon began to increase in
                    size, while the part between the shoot and the annular incision still remained
                    so nearly stationary as to be, in the autumn, almost a year’s growth less in
                    diameter than the part of the stem above the incision. Mr Knight varied these
                    experiments in many different ways, but in every case he found the result to be
                    the same; that is, those parts of the stem and branches which were above the
                    incisions, and had a communication with the leaves through the bark, increased
                    rapidly; while those below the incision scarcely grew at all, but remained with
                    little perceptible change, until a new communication was obtained through the
                    bark with the leaves of a shoot from some bud below the incision; the increase
                    of the timber thus evidently depending upon the growth of the leaves.</p>
                <p>These experiments were so far conclusive as to establish that the current of sap
                    which ran upwards from the roots, was not impeded in its passage by the annular
                    incisions and the removal of the belt of bark; but that it was probably the
                    downward current which was interrupted, and also that it was this downward
                    current by which the annual increase of the tree was effected. By a series of
                    experiments with coloured infusions, Mr Knight traced the upward current through
                    the pores of the wood beyond the annular incisions in the bark, and found that
                    it had neither coloured the bark nor the sap between it and the wood. He traced
                    the coloured infusion along the leaf-stalk into the leaf, through one series of
                    vessels; and he observed another series of vessels which were conveying a
                    colourless fluid in an opposite direction, that is, out of the leaf. He traced
                    this second series of tubes downwards, and found that they entered the inner
                    bark, and, without having any communication with the tubes of the wood,
                    descended through the inner bark from the very extremities of the leaves,
                    apparently to the points of the roots. Mr Knight considers that there are two
                    series of these descending tubes, one of which forms the new annual layer of
                    alburnum, and the other the new annual layer of internal bark. It thus appears
                    that the sap is conveyed upwards through the pores of some part of the wood,
                    into the leaves, and that when there, probably by its exposure to light and air,
                    and by the evaporation which takes place, it undergoes some peculiar process of
                    elaboration which tits it for contributing to the sustenance and growth of the
                    tree. It also appears that the cause of the growth is the deposition which takes
                    place in the downward passage of this perfected sap. The sap, after this curious
                    preparation in the leaves, is called cambium.</p>
                <p>The same persevering physiologist then pursued his investigations a step farther.
                    He took trees, and not only removed a ring of bark, but also a ring of the
                    younger wood, to such a depth as to cut through and remove the whole of the
                    alburnum. These trees did not exhibit the slightest symptom of vegetation in the
                    ensuing spring; which fact evidently proved that the ascent of the sap had been
                    prevented, and also that it had been prevented by the removal of the alburnum;
                    for the previously-mentioned experiment had shewn that the removal of the bark
                    was not attended with such an effect.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This experiment is continually making on a far more extended

                    becomes perfect wood, in consequence of the deposition of matter which then
                    takes place, and fills up its pores; so that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rationale</hi> of the process appears to be, that the sap of one year deposits
                    nourishment, in its upward passage, which strengthens the sap-wood or alburnum
                    of previous years; that then, after being elaborated in the leaves, it becomes
                    cambium, and in its descent adds bulk both to the alburnum and the bark. It must
                    however be observed, that there is not in timber any appearance of a gradual
                    change from alburnum to perfect wood. On the contrary, in all cases the division
                    is most decided; one concentric layer is perfect wood, the next in succession is
                    alburnum. Mr Knight gives it as his opinion, that “towards the conclusion of
                    summer, the true sap, that is, the cambium, simply accumulates in the alburnum,
                    and thus adds to the specific gravity of winter-felled timber, and increases the
                    quantity of extractive matter.” He says he has “reason to believe that the true
                    sap descends through the alburnum as well as through the bark: that is, that the
                    superabundance of true sap is there deposited, and enriches the upward current
                    of aqueous sap, or the sap of the ensuing spring.” In confirmation of this, he
                    tested the ascending current of spring sap, extracted from the trunks of trees
                    at various heights, and found that the specific gravity increased with the
                    height, and that the taste also very sensibly altered. He argues from the
                    foregoing facts, that by girdling trees in the spring, and suffering them to
                    grow until the ensuing winter, the wood above the girdling would be increased in
                    specific gravity. In one experiment, in which the belt of bark had been
                    abstracted for several years, he found that the specific gravity of the wood
                    above was 0∙590, while below it was only 0·491, and also that the alburnum had
                    acquired a greater degree of hardness, and consequently of durability. This is
                    important, for Du Hamel established by experiment very conclusively, that the
                    strength of timber of the same species varied very nearly as its weight. There
                    are many other theories as to the growth of plants, founded also on experiment,
                    but we cannot, within the limits of this article, enter into the <hi
                    rend="italic">rationale</hi> of the whole of them. We have therefore taken this
                    of Mr Knight, because, although there may be some points in it which may be
                    objected to, we conceive that, as a whole, it probably approaches more nearly to
                    the truth than does any other, and indeed leaves but little doubt upon the mind
                    as to its general correctness.</p>
                <p>There are not less than 140 species of oak known, and although there are many
                    sorts cultivated and growing in England, botanists and arborists agree that
                    there are principally two varieties; these are, the Durmast oak, and another,
                    which is commonly called the old English oak, although both are supposed to be
                    indigenous. In the Durmast oak, the <hi rend="italic">Quercus sessil∣flora,</hi>
                    the acorns grow in clusters close to the twig, and the leaves are set on short
                    leafstalks: while in the old English oak, the <hi rend="italic">Quercus
                    Robur,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Quercus pedunculata,</hi> the acorns grow
                    generally singly, at most two together, on stalks of from one to two inches in
                    length, and the leaves are close to the twig, without the intervention of any
                    length of leaf-stalk. These are the principal distinguishing marks between the
                    two varieties. Many writers attempt to draw distinctions from the colour and
                    shape of the leaves, and the colour and appearance of the bark; but it is
                    doubtful whether these may be depended upon, as, from a careful examination of
                    the evidence, it is more than probable that the colour and appearance vary much
                    with the soil and locality. There is no doubt, however, as to the comparative
                    inferiority of the timber of the Durmast oak. Almost all the English writers on
                    timber have asserted it, and both Buffon and Du Hamel corroborate their
                    assertions, and give a most decided preference to the oak bearing large acorns
                    on separate stalks, over the oak bearing acorns in clusters; which characteris
                    tics are just the distinguishing differences that have been particularized as
                    existing between the English and the Durmast oaks.</p>
                <p>In favourable soils the old English oak has seldom more than twelve to fifteen
                    concentric layers of alburnum; but in the Durmast oak there are frequently from
                    twenty to twenty-five or even thirty. This proves at once, by analogy, the
                    inferiority of the Durmast oak; for it is an established fact, that the best
                    hard-wood timber is that in which the proportion of heart-wood to sap is the
                    largest; besides which, the numerous layers of alburnum form the basis of a
                    proportion which shows the greater age the Durmast timber must attain before it
                    becomes perfect wood. And therefore it is evident, that in order to attain large
                    scantling, comparatively older timber must be felled, and consequently a greater
                    risk be incurred of its being overgrown. The following table of the number of
                    concentric layers of sap-wood observed in various species of timber trees is
                    extracted from a valuable work on Naval Timber by Patrick Matthew; a work which
                    abounds in much sound practical information, though mixed up with many things
                    irrelevant to its subject.</p>

                    valuable, and are made available for local building purposes, and for the
                    manufacture of the conveyances and implements for agriculture. Of these, the
                    redwood willow may claim the first rank in utility. It is a timber much used in
                    France in cottages and farm buildings, and it has the advantage of being very
                    easily worked. The numerous varieties of the willow tribe are also useful in the
                    manufacture of baskets. The woods of the laburnum, the cherry, and the apple and
                    pear trees, are greatly used by cabinet-makers for articles of furniture.</p>
                <p>Although in most parts of England there is soil favourable to the growth of
                    timber, it may well be supposed that all soils are not equally favourable to all
                    timber, nor will they produce timber of equally good quality. Thus in England
                    the Sussex oak has always been celebrated as being superior to all other; and in
                    France the oak of Provence enjoys a similar reputation. Still, an oak tree grown
                    in a soil but ill adapted for it, as, for instance, a marshy soil, will retain
                    its superiority of species over the inferior timbers, as the willow and the
                    poplar, to which such a soil is less unfavourable, although in quality it will
                    fall very short of the standard of perfection for oak timber. In fact, oak grown
                    on such soils will in some measure partake of the qualities of the timber to
                    which they are better adapted, and be of more open texture, of softer fibre, and
                    of less durability than average oak timber. Oaks of slow growth, those, for
                    instance, from the mountains of Scotland, and from Cumberland and Yorkshire, are
                    proverbially hard and durable. The oak from marshy soils is often of a dull-red
                    colour, or has “foxey” stains in it, as this incipient decay is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=312" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0312-0292"
                    />called. These stains are generally around the heart of the tree. Timber grown
                    in loose soils is often what is termed “quaggy that is, the centre of the tree
                    is full of shakes and clefts. Sometimes a shake will extend around a great
                    portion of the trunk, between two of the annual concentric layers, so as to
                    divide them from each other. This is called a cup-shake, and the timber is said
                    to be “cuppy.” It is not attributable to the soil, but is supposed to originate
                    in the effect of frosts on the aqueous sap in its ascent. When the alburnum of a
                    tree has been wounded, or a branch improperly lopped or damaged, the subsequent
                    growth of the tree will cover it, and it is then called a rind-gall, which,
                    should the injured part have had time to become decayed, or partially so, or
                    even sodden with the rains, will frequently cause an extensive rottenness in the
                    plant. This is remarkably the case with elm timber. Doatiness, probably
                    dottiness, which is a spotted or speckled appearance, like small stains in the
                    wood, is most commonly a disease of beech timber; it is, however, occasionally
                    seen in all, and frequently in the American oak. These diseases are in general
                    incidental to the soil.</p>
                <p>In treating of soils in connection with the qualities of the timber which grows
                    upon them, it may be necessary to remember that the object is not to compare
                    various sorts of timber, but to compare the differences in the same species in
                    connection with the soils which produced them. It may also be observed, that as
                    oak is by far the most valuable timber of English growth, the general inquiries
                    we may enter into in the course of this article principally apply to it, unless
                    other species of timber are particularized.</p>
                <p>We have already casually adverted to marshy soils, and to the state of the timber
                    grown on them. The grain of such timber is open, its colour of a deep yellow,
                    sometimes with a tinge of red, especially towards the heart; the texture is
                    soft, and the fibre coarse. The quantity of alburnum, and also of bark, is large
                    in comparison with the quantity of perfect wood, and the outer surface of the
                    bark is very coarse and rough. The wood splits easily, and when split it has not
                    the same bright and varnished appearance possessed by the best timber. The chips
                    from the axe do not cling well together, but fall into separate fragments; and a
                    shaving or a small splinter may be easily crumbled between the finger and thumb.
                    When such timber is weighed, although it is far more saturated with moisture, it
                    is of less specific gravity; and when weighed after seasoning, the weight lost
                    will be comparatively greater. Such timber, it is evident, will be more subject
                    to decay, and to become worm-eaten, the softness of its texture inviting the
                    attacks of these insects.</p>
                <p>These peculiar characteristics attach more or less to timber grown in all soils
                    which are of a moist nature, whether they are marshy, or wet from long-continued
                    periodical inundations. They also apply to timber grown in deep sandy soil, in
                    which almost the only nutriment for the roots is the water which percolates
                    downward, and the bottom damps which rise upward through it. In all these soils
                    the timber is of rapid growth, and the trees attain early to a large size. A
                    similar result attends the timber grown in sandy soils on a clay bottom, for the
                    water which falls not being able to penetrate the clay, cannot escape, and the
                    roots of the trees are therefore virtually in the same circumstances as if they
                    were growing in marshy land. As a general axiom, timber trees have an antipathy
                    to stagnant waters; and therefore these observations on marshy soils, and on
                    sandy soils with clayey bottoms, refer themselves to this fact. The soil
                    generally the best adapted for the growth of timber appears to be a rich loam.
                    This may have a considerable admixture of sand, without any apparent detriment
                    to the timber. In such soils roots can penetrate and spread without difficulty,
                    while the loam is capable of retaining sufficient moisture to dissolve and hold
                    in solution the various substances that are found combined with it, so as to fit
                    them to be absorbed as food by the roots of the plants. If the soil be too
                    sandy, it neither retains the moisture sufficiently long in it, nor does it
                    contain adequate nutriment. If, instead of a loam, some of the very stiff clays
                    be mixed with the sand, they do not counteract this quality; for although such
                    clay is capable of combining with a great quantity of water, it will not easily
                    absorb and mix with it; and the tender roots have great difficulty in
                    penetrating the masses of clay. For these reasons, soils composed wholly of
                    stiff clay are not favourable to the growth of good timber, but the lighter
                    clayey earth produces very fine oaks. As has been before stated, sand or gravel,
                    with a large mixture of rich loamy earth, is precisely that sort of dry generous
                    soil which affords ample nourishment to the roots of trees, and allows of their
                    spreading themselves freely in search of it. Of all timber, however, oak
                    accommodates itself most easily to soil; growing in almost every thing but
                    sterile sand, if there be sufficient depth of stratum. Wherever oak will grow,
                    even in those soils the least genial to its growth, it is a valuable timber.
                    This fact cannot be too often pressed upon the attention of landholders. It is
                    admirably adapted for planting in hedge-rows between arable fields, because it
                    is found to be less destructive to the undergrowth than almost any other timber;
                    and as its roots seek their nourishment deep in the soil, they not only do not
                    impoverish the ground for the growing crop, but are themselves protected from
                    any injury which they might otherwise sustain from the tillage. Oaks so planted
                    require, however, to be protected during several years, as their early growth is
                    slow. The timber grown in such exposed situations is seldom large; the trees are
                    stunted and crooked; but this rather increases their value for ship-building
                    purposes, as they convert as compass or knee timber. The timber of hedge-row oak
                    is very close grained; that of park-grown oak is more open, and the trees being
                    better protected, spread more freely and grow to a very large size, with strong
                    lateral branches; while forest oak will frequently grow to a great height
                    without pushing out any lateral shoots. Forest oak is invariably inferior in
                    quality to that which grows singly; and in forests the trees that grow on the
                    skirts are always the best timber. The oak flourishes in variable climates,
                    which is probably the cause of the superiority of the English oak.</p>
                <p>In whatever soil planted, each vegetable will retain its own peculiar
                    characteristics. These apparently result from some property inherent in the
                    plant itself, which leads it to extract only that nourishment from the soil
                    which is appropriate to it. This has been illustrated by the example of a pea
                    and a grain of wheat both planted in the same soil, and both treated in exactly
                    the same manner: the corn will have absorbed silex from the earth, which will
                    visibly form a component of its stalk, while the pea will not have taken up any.
                    This indicates that at least a degree of selection with respect to their food is
                    inherent in vegetables, without which indeed it would be difficult to account
                    either for plants of various sorts all flourishing equally well in the same
                    soil, or for others which cannot be reared in certain soils. This selection of
                    food is however limited; for it is a well-ascertained fact that vegetable life
                    is destroyed by the same poisonous substances that are fatal to animal life, and
                    that plants do not possess the power of refusing to absorb such substances when
                    mixed with the food in which their roots are plunged. Although the root of corn
                    would absorb silex and the pea refuse it, they would both perish from the
                    unavoidable absorption with their food, of substances inimical to animal and
                    vegetable life. This is, however, merely saying that the vegetable is not
                    possessed of greater powers of discriminating the beneficial from the hurtful,
                    than is the animal under similar circumstances.</p>
                <p>A curious fact connected with the supply of food for trees is also established,
                    proving that there is not only a proportion between the spread of the roots and
                    that of the branches of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=313" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0313-0293"/>a
                    tree, but that the branches on any one side of the trunk of the tree are
                    dependent for their support on the roots which protrude from the trunk on that
                    same side. Both Buffon and Du Hamel found experimentally, that when the limbs
                    and branches of any part of a tree showed symptoms of decay, the corresponding
                    roots were invariably in a diseased state. They also found that on that side of
                    a tree from which the roots had pushed most vigorously, the annual concentric
                    layers of wood were thicker, and that consequently the form of a section of the
                    tree would be eccentric towards that side.</p>
                <p>The facility with which the roots of plants seek out for themselves the best
                    localities, is surprising. If two trees of different species be growing on the
                    edge of a marshy space, that tree which requires most moisture will push its
                    roots towards the marsh, while that which requires a dry soil will push its
                    roots into the dry firm ground. Du Hamel relates an instance in which he dug two
                    trenches crossing each other at right angles; he then returned the soil into
                    these trenches, and planted a tree at the point of their intersection. Some
                    years after, upon examining the roots, it was found that they had invariably
                    pushed into the four lines of trenches, leaving the intermediate undisturbed
                    earth wholly untouched by them.</p>
                <p>An equally important consideration with the quality of the soil, is its quantity,
                    that is, its depth from the surface. In fact, in speaking of soils in connexion
                    with the growth of timber trees, it must of course be understood that it is not
                    merely the surface-soil which is meant, but that soil in which the roots of the
                    trees would push and spread,—the soil for several feet in depth. It often
                    happens that the surface-soil may be well adapted for tillage and for
                    vegetation, and yet the sub-soil, that which is essential to the growth of
                    timber trees, may be totally incapable of supplying them with nourishment. Trees
                    which grow singly, as in hedge-rows or in parks, do not require equal depth of
                    soil with those which grow in forests, because they have the power of spreading
                    their roots in search of food. But for forest trees, either oak, chestnut, or
                    beech, a depth of at least four feet of appropriate soil is absolutely necessary
                    to produce fine timber trees. Elm and ash do not require so great a depth.</p>
                <p>Buffon has given a scale for the ages at which it is desirable to fell timber. It
                    is dependent upon the depth of soil in which it grows. He says that a depth of
                    from two to three feet will not support a tree in a thriving condition for a
                    longer period than fifty years. From three to four feet of soil will enable the
                    tree to continue improving until about seventy years old; and in a soil from
                    four to five feet deep it will flourish for a century. These periods are for
                    strong and favourable soils. In lighter soils at least ten years must be taken
                    from each period, and the timber will then also be inferior in quality. As a
                    general rule, the more generous and favourable to the growth of the timber the
                    soil may be, the longer it is advantageous to wait before felling it. Trees
                    should never be allowed to become stag-headed, that is, to have their upper
                    branches bare of leaves. It is in the top branches that the first symptoms of
                    the decline of the tree are to be perceived. The leaves have a faded, weakly
                    appearance, gradually diminish in number, and finally the branches become barren
                    of foliage, and decay. The least appearance of want of vigour in the vegetation
                    of the top of a tree should be the signal for its being felled; and even then it
                    is also a sure token that the timber is past its prime.</p>
                <p>The nature of the soil in a tract of country may be observed, either by opening
                    it, or by examining the products. Thus, at all times of the year, if plants
                    which grow only on marshy land are found on any tract, we may evidently assume
                    that tract to be marshy land, whatever its temporary appearance may be. The
                    nature of the sub-soils may often be ascertained by the ditches. The goodness of
                    earth is easily tested by making an excavation in it. If the whole of the
                    excavated earth can be returned into the cavity, the soil is poor, but if, on
                    the contrary, there is an excess, its quantity is a sure criterion by which to
                    judge of the richness.</p>
                <p>In the preceding observations as to soil, moisture has been decried as
                    unfavourable to the growth of good timber; but it must be observed, that a
                    deficiency of moisture has also its evils, although they are not of the same
                    kind as those which arise from a superabundance of it. Water is absolutely
                    necessary to the growth of timber; for even if the soil be rich, and light, and
                    well adapted for the reception of the roots, and for affording them nourishment,
                    there must be sufficient moisture in it to form a vehicle for a supply of that
                    nourishment, otherwise the trees will be of very slow growth, not from the lack
                    of proper nourishment, but from the want of a sufficient supply. The timber does
                    not appear to suffer from this in its quality, but in its size. On the contrary,
                    indeed, wood of such growth is extremely heavy, hard, and dense, as, for
                    instance, the Scotish mountain oak. Where there is a greater supply of moisture,
                    the growth of the timber will be more rapid; and, in consequence, although its
                    fibre will be tough, its grain even, and its colour the same as the other, the
                    concentric layers will be thicker, and therefore there will be fewer of them in
                    the same space; but, to compensate for this, we have in a less number of years
                    an equal sized tree, which has the advantage when felled of being in its prime,
                    while the tree of slower growth may have already, from great age, the defects
                    attendant on what is called overgrown timber. There is also another point to be
                    considered; the quicker the growth of the tree, the more it will shrink when
                    converted as timber. Trees of rapid growth, therefore, are not fitted for any
                    thing but large conversions. Timber of slow growth, and of considerable age, is
                    by far the best adapted for panelling and for furniture.</p>
                <p>These remarks afford an idea of the difference in the appearance of timber grown
                    on good soil from that produced on bad soil. As to this difference, it may
                    however be desirable to enter more into detail. An oak tree, grown on the soil
                    adapted to the development of its best properties, not only has its concentric
                    layers thin and close together, but they are also of very uniform thickness, and
                    the texture of the grain is fine. When the wood is split it has a glossy
                    varnished appearance, and is of a very pale yellow or straw colour. There is
                    sometimes as much as one fourth difference in weight between samples of oak
                    timber; and the heaviest loses a much less proportion of its weight in drying,
                    and will also, if immersed in water, absorb Jess, than the lightest. The
                    alburnum of the best timber is small in quantity, and the bark thin and of an
                    even smooth texture. In breaking such wood, it produces a sharp decided noise.
                    Having comparatively little moisture in its composition, and being less
                    hygrometric in its nature than wood of more open texture, it is little subject
                    to decay; and its grain being hard, it is not easily pierced by insects.</p>
                <p>The great size to which oak trees will attain when favourably situated as to soil
                    and locality, is truly astonishing. We will mention two instances as examples of
                    this fact. One is the celebrated chapel-oak of Allonville in the Pays de Caux in
                    France, which is still standing. The other is that of an oak which was felled in
                    Monmouthshire in 1791. The oak of Allonville measures at its base thirty-five
                    feet in circumference, and at six feet above the level of the ground it is
                    twenty-six feet in girth. It is hollow, and the interior is fitted up as a
                    chapel. This transformation was effected in 1696. The computed age of the tree
                    is between eight and nine centuries. The other instance, the Monmouthshire oak,
                    produced, when it was converted, the following enormous quantity of
                    materials:—</p>

                    There were 31¾ cords of cord-wood, 84 hogshead, 67 barrel, and 106 kilderkin
                    staves, 256 coopers’ ends: 28 hogshead, 38 barrel, and 49 kilderkin heads were
                    also converted from the slab wood.</p>
                <p>The largest oak on record grew in Dorsetshire. It was called Damory’s Oak, and
                    was used as an ale-house. It was sixty-eight feet in circumference, and the room
                    formed in it was sixteen feet in length. This tree was blown down in 1703.</p>
                <p>As a general average of the size of oak timber, 56 cubic feet for each end or log
                    of rough timber, and 30 cubic feet for each end of sided timber, may be assumed
                    as tolerably correct. In order to convert rough timber into sided timber, about
                    two thirds the diameter of the rough log, in the middle of its length, is
                    assumed as the most advantageous siding; and, on an average, it is estimated
                    that not above one third of each log or end of rough timber is used in the
                    principal conversion from it, and this principal conversion is estimated to be
                    about three fourths of the total conversions.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the great value of the bark of oak, it is the practice to fell
                    the timber in the spring of the year, because then the bark is easily detached
                    from the tree, while the bark of winter-felled timber is lost. There can be
                    little doubt, however, that the durability of the wood is much deteriorated by
                    this practice. It was a received opinion among the ancients that timber should
                    be felled in the fall of the year; and not only do modem experiments confirm
                    this opinion, but modern discoveries as to the flow and return of the sap, and
                    its nature at various seasons, tend to show the reason for its correctness. The
                    practice which almost all the eminent arborists have recommended, and supported
                    by their experiments, is to bark trees standing in the spring, and then allow
                    them to remain in this state at least one twelvemonth. This was not an uncommon
                    practice in some of the midland counties of England, and was first strongly
                    recommended in the reign of James the Second by Dr Plott, an arborist of great
                    celebrity at that time. Buffon presented a memoir in 1738 to the Royal Academy
                    of Sciences in Paris, “on increasing the Solidity, Strength, and Durability of
                    Timber for which purposes it was recommended to strip the tree of its bark
                    during the season of the rising of the sap, and then to leave it to dry
                    completely before being felled. Du Hamel gives most minute accounts of
                    experiments made by himself, all tending to the same conclusion; and Dr Hunter,
                    in his notes on Evelyn’s Sylva, says, “that by stripping off the bark, and
                    allowing the tree to stand and die before it is cut, the sappy part becomes as
                    hard and firm as the heart.” Here is a collection of opinions, of such weight,
                    that the general fact which they assert must be considered to be established
                    beyond contradiction. Buffon also says that he caused pines, firs, and other
                    species of evergreens, to be barked standing; and as he found them live longer
                    after the operation than oaks which had been also stripped, he considered their
                    wood acquired proportionately greater hardness, strength, and durability. He
                    recommended the practice for fir trees destined to be converted into ships'
                    masts.</p>
                <p>Elm, of which there are two principal varieties, like oak, will not bear a damp
                    soil with stagnant waters, but it thrives well in moist declivities, provided
                    the land be not too rich. The trees grown on too damp a soil either die
                    prematurely, or their timber is of a soft spongy nature, and prone to decay.
                    There are two British varieties of this timber, the <hi rend="italic">Ulmus
                    Montana,</hi> or Wych elm, and the <hi rend="italic">Ulmus campestris,</hi> or,
                    as they are sometimes called, the Scotish and the English elms. Of these the
                    Wych elm is decidedly the most valuable as timber, and, when used in situations
                    where it is kept constantly moist, is extremely durable; but no elm timber will
                    bear the trials of change of temperature and moisture to which oak in all its
                    varieties is comparatively insensible. The close and interwoven grain of elm,
                    the absence of decided longitudinal fibre, and its power to resist rending from
                    exposure to the heat of the sun, and the alternations of weather, cause its
                    timber to be very useful for small articles, such as the blocks used in the
                    rigging of a ship. It is valuable in many parts of the millwright’s machinery,
                    where the wood is subjected to great friction. It is also valuable and much used
                    both for the timbers and for the planking of ships below the surface of the
                    water; and the planks of clinker-built boats are very generally of elm. There is
                    one peculiarity about elm timber, namely, that the alburnum or sap-wood is
                    possessed of nearly equal power to resist decay with that which is matured; that
                    is, when both are used in situations where they are not exposed to alternations
                    in moisture. A variety of timber has of late years been introduced into the
                    market under the name of Canada elm, or American rock elm. It is a smooth, even
                    textured, pale coloured, and strongly fibrous wood, almost devoid of knots, and
                    admirably adapted for boat-building, and all works which require a flexible and
                    close-textured wood. The Canada elm appears to have many of the peculiarities of
                    toughness and flexibility which distinguish the ash.</p>
                <p>Chestnut, <hi rend="italic">Fagus castanea,</hi> and Beech, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fagus,</hi> appear to suffer the least of all the timber trees from being
                    planted in moist sandy soils; but as the chestnuts push their roots far
                    downwards, they require a proportionate depth of soil. The roots of beech, on
                    the contrary, spread widely, but without going to any considerable depth. Beech
                    is a timber which easily adapts itself to and flourishes in almost any soil.
                    Even among rocks its roots will, like those of firs and larches, insinuate
                    themselves into the smallest fissures, and find means to extract sufficient
                    nourishment to produce a useful timber. Beech-timber, when used shortly after
                    being felled, and for works where its dampness will be continued, is a
                    long-enduring wood. It is largely applied in the mercantile navy, for the lower
                    planks of the bottom of ships. The best variety has its wood of a yellow tinge.
                    Chestnut is even a more durable timber than oak, and was much used formerly; but
                    the cultivation of it has been so neglected that few trees remain in this
                    country. Ash, <hi rend="italic">Fraxinus Excelsior,</hi> which is another
                    valuable timber tree, accommodates itself to all soils. It will grow in marshy
                    grounds and in arid lands, in depth of soil or in shallow soils. It will push
                    its roots into hard gravelly bottoms, and even into the sandstone rocks; but the
                    ash-timber from very poor soils is brittle, and loses the elasticity which is
                    the valuable peculiarity of this wood. Ash is a very useful timber for carts and
                    implements of husbandry, for machinery, for tools of almost all trades; and it
                    supplies oars to our shipping. Of late it has also been much used in the
                    construction of the beds for locomotive steam-engines, tenders, and
                    carriages.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the immense consumption of timber for the maintenance of our
                    fleets, there is much imported. We import oak of excellent quality as planking,
                    from the forests on the shores of the Baltic, especially from those of Poland.
                    From Italy and from both shores of the Adriatic, sided timber and plank are
                    imported in large quantities. the Italian timber is extremely subject to rends,
                    but is both strong and durable; and the Adriatic oak has been <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=315" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0315-0295"
                    />celebrated for centuries. The Americas do not produce fine oak timber; but
                    considerable quantities are imported from Canada, in consequence of the lowness
                    of the price at which it can be sold in England. There are two sorts of oak
                    growing in America, the white and the red, but both are very inferior to
                    European timber. There is, however, an American oak, called the live oak,
                    produced principally in the Floridas, which has the character of being among the
                    most durable timbers in existence. It is said to be comparatively incorruptible,
                    but it is not a timber much known in Britain. The great resource of our
                    dock-yards for timber of large scantling is an African timber, called Tortosa,
                    more commonly only “African.” It is a heavy, hard, close-grained, and even
                    textured wood, well adapted for beams, and for internal works, but does not
                    resist alternations of moisture, and deteriorates rapidly whenever it is in
                    contact with iron. The wood round the bolt-heads is carbonized in an incredibly
                    short space of time—incredible when the strength, texture, and hardness of the
                    wood are considered; but it appears to be a timber wholly without any protective
                    oleaginous or terebinthinous juices. There are several species of timber that
                    are much used in Britain in the construction of merchant-ships, but which are
                    unknown in the royal dock-yards. We shall in a subsequent portion of this
                    article notice these, for the purpose of showing their relative values. We
                    consider that the most satisfactory course we can pursue to effect this object,
                    without occupying more space than can be appropriated to this article, will be
                    to give the tabular arrangement of woods, as enforced by Lloyd’s surveyors,
                    under the direction of the committee of that establishment.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto confined our remarks to the hard-wood timber trees, and have
                    said but little of the numerous firs which are so valuable to us. Their timber
                    is admirably adapted, by its growth, lightness, and strength to supply our
                    navies with masts and spars; while, from its comparatively small cost, and the
                    ease with which it is worked, it is also used very largely for all purposes of
                    building. Indeed it is questionable whether fir is not more generally useful to
                    us than any other species of timber. Du Hamel, in his treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >Du Transport et de la conservation des Bois,</hi> has drawn a distinction
                    between firs and pines, although it is usual to designate the timber of both as
                    fir timber. Pines, he says, have the leaves thready and slender, growing in
                    clusters from the same leaf-stalk, while firs have straight leaves, each growing
                    separate, but many growing on the same leaf-stalk, like the teeth of a comb.
                    These are the general characteristics between the two sorts of trees which
                    produce fir timber. The pines grow with their trunks much less tapering towards
                    their tops than the firs; they are therefore, from shape, more adapted for masts
                    than firs. Their wood is also more resinous, and the resin is of a more
                    glutinous nature, and therefore less easily evaporated; it also, in consequence
                    of this quality, enables the timber to resist better the absorption of water or
                    moisture when exposed to it. The pine is more durable than the fir, and its
                    fracture is, even when partially decayed, much more fibrous, and takes place
                    with more previous warning. The timber of the pine, when healthy, is
                    close-grained, even textured, and of a bright-yellow colour. The fir is,
                    although frequently little inferior in appearance in other respects, always of a
                    much paler shade of colour.</p>
                <p>The most valuable of all the varieties of fir timber is that which is called Riga
                    fir. It is the red-wood pine of the north of Europe, the <hi rend="italic">Pinus
                    Sylvestris,</hi> which, although spread over a very large portion of the globe,
                    appears to flourish in its greatest perfection in the forests of Lithuania and
                    Poland, where the cold is severe and the soil generous. Riga fir is not only
                    extremely flexible and elastic, but is by far the most durable of all the pine
                    timbers; and as long as it could be procured of sufficient size, it was
                    therefore generally used in the royal navy not only for topmasts, but also to
                    build the lower or standing masts. At present, from the increased difficulty of
                    procuring large sticks, the use of it is confined to topsail-yards and the
                    smaller description of spars. The American continent also produces this red-pine
                    timber of good quality, although much inferior to that of the north of Europe.
                    It is imported from Canada and from Virginia. The Canadian red pine is of small
                    size, seldom exceeding fourteen hands. The Virginian pine is large, sticks of
                    twenty-four and twenty-five inches in diameter not being uncommon. It is a
                    resinous and flexible wood; but the sticks are more subject than the Canadian
                    red pine to the defect of having large knots in them, which, from not being
                    firmly united to the surrounding timber, that is, not being what is technically
                    called “well collared,” injure its value. The red pine thrives extremely well in
                    Scotland, where it is called Scotish fir. There are many extensive forests of it
                    in that part of Great Britain, but the timber will not bear comparison with that
                    which is imported. Notwithstanding this, Du Hamel makes “Scotish pine" the
                    generic name of the best variety of the pine timber, that which we designate as
                    “Riga.” The French dockyards are supplied with mast-timber from the red pine of
                    the Pyrenees and of the island of Corsica; but neither of these varieties of
                    this timber is considered at all on an equality with that which is grown in the
                    more northern parts of Europe. Indeed a low temperature of climate appears to be
                    essential to the production of superior fir timber. The firs on the northern
                    sides of hills and mountains, in all temperate climates, thrive better than
                    those growing on the southern exposure, and even the timber on the northern side
                    of an exposed fir tree is far superior to that on its southern side.</p>
                <p>Yellow pine, the <hi rend="italic">Pinus Strobus,</hi> which is imported from
                    Canada, is the principal timber now available for large masts and yards, and is
                    therefore very generally used both in the royal and the mercantile navies. It
                    has neither the flexibility nor the elasticity of the red pine, nor is it so
                    durable, but it is much lighter. Its great recommendations are its large size
                    and its comparatively small cost. Sticks of this timber run from sixteen to
                    twenty-seven or twenty-eight inches in diameter; and for bowsprits they are
                    sometimes received in the royal yards as large as twenty-nine and thirty inches
                    in diameter; but sticks of these large diameters are becoming very scarce. To Mr
                    Cradock of Portsmouth dockyard, a member of the late School of Naval
                    Architecture, we are indebted for the following information as to the more
                    extensive application of this species of fir for spars of all sizes in the
                    American navy than in our own. In June of the year 1837, he surveyed the mast
                    and spars of the American frigate Independence, then lying at Spithead. “They
                    were generally as large, and in some instances the spars were larger, than those
                    of the Britannia, a British first rate; and the whole of them, without any
                    exception, were made of yellow-pine timber. Her topgallant-masts were about
                    twenty feet longer than those of the Britannia, and yet were only of the same
                    diameter, while those of the Britannia are made of Riga hand-masts. The topmasts
                    were of the same length and diameter as those of the Britannia, which are made
                    of Virginia red pine; the topsail-yards were three feet longer, and were yet
                    only one inch more in diameter than those of the Britannia, which of course are
                    made of Riga; and so on with the other spars. This proves, that the yellow-pine
                    timber may be safely used if necessary for all masting purposes, with a very
                    little increase in the diameter of the spars made from it, and with thicker
                    battens on the yards.”</p>
                <p>The yellow-pine timber grows also in Great Britain, where it was first introduced
                    by an earl of Weymouth, and thence is called the Weymouth pine; but it does not
                    appear to thrive in this climate.</p>
                <p>Scotish and Norwegian spruce spars, <hi rend="italic">Pinus Abies,</hi> are very
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=316"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0316-0296"/>generally used in the mercantile navy for yards
                    and topmasts, and also in the royal navy for the smaller description of spars
                    and boats’ masts. They are tough, close grained, and elastic, but are very full
                    of large knots; and care is therefore required in selecting them. The timber
                    also is soft and far from durable, it having very little appearance of resin.
                    The Norwegian spruce grows frequently to a large size.</p>
                <p>Cedar, <hi rend="italic">Pinus Cedrus,</hi> would be among the most valuable of
                    all timber trees, were it sufficiently common to be available for building
                    purposes. It is almost indestructible from time, and no insects will ever attack
                    it. It thrives well in this climate, but hitherto has only been planted either
                    as an object of curiosity or of ornament. It requires a more generous soil than
                    any other of the tribe of pines, and is considered to be a timber of very slow
                    growth. Pitch-pine is also a very valuable timber for building purposes, but it
                    is too heavy for spars.</p>
                <p>Fir sticks, the Riga hand-masts especially, are very liable to have serious
                    defects in them, which it is often impossible to discover until the stick is
                    worked. They are technically called upsets. The grain appears to be partly
                    separated, so that a shaving from the stick at that place would bend to a sharp
                    angle at the upset, as if partly broken. There always appears to be a greater or
                    less accumulation of the turpentine about the injury, as if it had originally
                    exuded at the wound, and become congealed around it. These defects are most
                    frequently found in the smaller sticks, those especially that are more resinous
                    and knotty than others; and they sometimes are so numerous as to extend, at very
                    short distances apart, for a great portion of the length of the stick. Mr
                    Cradock, who has long superintended the mast-making at Portsmouth dock-yard,
                    considers them to be the effect of violent winds on the more exposed trees of a
                    forest. He founds this opinion on the facts that they are most common in the
                    most flexible timber; that they are not perceived in sticks of large diameter;
                    and that in the firs of little flexibility, as the yellow pine, they are seldom
                    or never found; although the sticks of this fir, from being cut in every variety
                    of direction, to form the components of made-masts, are more searched than any
                    other. The cowdee, a New Zealand timber, lately introduced both in the royal and
                    mercantile navies, is, he says, much subject to this defect; and he has observed
                    it once in a poon topmast. The defect seldom or never appears in the outer
                    layers of the timber, but only after some of these have been removed by the axe,
                    and the older timber laid bare of the sap-wood.</p>
                <p>The sap-wood in all fir timber is useless, and very generally there is a large
                    proportion of it in comparison to the quantity of heart-wood. It is rather a
                    curious fact, that there appears to be a difference between the pines and the
                    generality of the hard-wood timber in this, that a small proportion of sap-wood
                    in fir is indicative of the inferiority of the timber. Thus the red pine of
                    Scotland has fewer layers of sap-wood than either the red pine of Canada or of
                    the Baltic. As a general remark, it may be stated, that the greater the quantity
                    of sap-wood there is about a tree of any description of fir timber, the better
                    will be the quality of the spine, which is the technical name given to the
                    mature wood.</p>
                <p>The cowdee, which is now largely imported into this country, is a close and
                    even-grained timber, almost entirely free from knots. It grows to so large a
                    size as to be available for the topmasts and other principal spars of the
                    largest classes of vessels; but from its want of elasticity, and its liability
                    to warp and rend, it is not so suitable for small conversions. It varies greatly
                    in its quality, even so much as often to be of different colours, grain, and
                    texture, in the same stick. It is of about the same average weight as Virginia
                    red pine</p>
                <p>Larch timber, <hi rend="italic">Pinus Larix,</hi> formerly unknown in Great
                    Britain, has, within the last century, been very extensively planted. The first
                    plantations of it were made on the vast estates of the duke of Atholl, in the
                    Highlands of Scotland. The following account, which is extracted from Knowles on
                    Preserving the Navy, was, as the author of that work states, furnished to him by
                    the late duke, and it contains, consequently, the results of the longest
                    experience as to the growth of larch timber in Britain which can be obtained.
                    The account is interesting, because plantations of larch are becoming very
                    numerous, as they are found to be very profitable. The returns from a larch
                    plantation during the time the trees are arriving at their full growth, are
                    estimated to be at least double what they would have been from an equal
                    plantation of any other timber. “Seedlings of larch were probably first brought
                    into Scotland in the year 1738, by Mr Menzies; but it has been asserted by some,
                    that they were introduced into that part of this country in 1734, by Lord Kames.
                    Some were left at Dunkeld, and some at Blair Athole, by the former gentleman;
                    and being exotic plants, were placed by the gardeners in green-houses. Not
                    thriving in those situations, they were planted in the pleasure-grounds, where
                    they grew luxuriantly. When the present duke succeeded to the titles and estates
                    (in 1774), there was a considerable number of trees in a thriving state; and on
                    a general survey of his estates in 1783, there were found to be 900 Scotish
                    acres of plantation, 600 of which were of larch; since which time his grace has
                    planted extensively every year, and in the spring of 1820, 10,820 Scotish, or
                    about 12,984 English acres, were covered with trees. The different species were,

                <p>“The larch thrives in very exposed situations. The lower range of the Grampian
                    Hills, which extends to Dunkeld, are at an altitude there of from 1000 to 1700
                    feet above the level of the sea. The larch trees are planted as high as 1200
                    feet up these hills, and grow exceedingly well; a situation where the hardy
                    Scotish firs cannot rear their heads. The spruce fir, however, thrives equally
                    well as the larch on high and exposed hills. The growth of the larch trees is
                    very rapid, and Scotish fir of the same age will measure only half the quantity;
                    and so much is the wood esteemed in Scotland, that while the former is worth 2s.
                    6d. per cubic foot, the latter brings only 1s. 3d. The following account of a
                    larch tree, planted in the year 1738, and measured February 1819, will give some
                    notion of its growth.</p>

                    well. The timber in question has been used for many years in Scotland for almost

                    />and ferry-boats; and in all these situations has been found to be very
                    durable. The author has seen part of a ferry-boat twenty-three years old, which
                    remained very sound, and the iron nails driven into it as perfect as when they
                    first came from the forge. This perhaps was occasioned by their being constantly
                    covered with an insoluble varnish (the Venice turpentine of the shops), with
                    which the larch abounds. The duke of Atholl has recently built a vessel of 170
                    tons w holly of larch, the necessary knees and crooks being formed from the
                    roots of the trees; the lower masts and boats are also of that wood, the
                    topmasts and yards of spruce firs grown upon his estates. One of the qualities
                    of larch for building merchant-ships, is its great lightness, a cubic foot
                    weighing, when seasoned (which it does rapidly), only thirty-four pounds.
                    Although it is not so strong as many sorts of wood, it has great resilience.
                    Cabinet-work of great beauty has been made from larch; it polishes well, and
                    when seasoned is not found to warp or shrink. In addition to its other
                    properties, it is slow of combustion, and is said to let shot through without
                    splintering. A most important fact in agriculture has arisen from planting larch
                    trees on rocky ground; the vegetable compost formed thereon by the falling of
                    the leaves has been the cause of producing herbage for feeding cattle, and made
                    that land which on the average did not formerly bring more than 8d. or 9d. per
                    acre, now to be worth from 12s. to 14s. per acre annually.”</p>
                <p>Larch timber, although so generally planted, and so generally thriving, requires
                    considcrable attention in the selection of proper soil for it. It is very
                    subject to a heartrot, which seizes on the roots, and rapidly proceeds up the
                    centre of the stem of the plant, which swells considerably for several feet
                    above the surface of the ground. Larch cannot bear a cold, damp soil, or any
                    stagnation of water, or even the moisture of the rich vegetable moulds. Nor will
                    it thrive in the light sandy soils; for although it dislikes marshy stagnant
                    waters, its roots require to be preserved from the droughts of summer. Sandy and
                    gravelly soils, if situated so as to receive from declivities the moisture
                    percolating through them, will produce excellent larch timber; as will also the
                    sides of rocky hills and mountains, in which no moisture can stagnate, and into
                    the fissures and clefts of which the roots easily penetrate, and find ample
                    nourishment. Larch trees attain to a very great height. In some of the public
                    buildings of Venice, there are said to be single-pieced beams of larch which are
                    120 feet in length. It must be very durable, for it is almost the only wood
                    which was used in the palaces and public buildings of that city. Larch is
                    imported from Canada under two names, hackmatack and tamarack; at least the
                    timbers bearing those names have every appearance of being identical with the
                    Scotish larch.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Measurement of Timber.</hi></p>
                <p>Timber is bought and sold by solid measure, according to the number of cubic feet
                    in the tree or log. The measurement of timber is therefore the operation by
                    which these cubic contents are determined; that is, the multiplying together the
                    three dimensions, or the mean length, the breadth, and the depth of each log. If
                    the log should vary much in size in different parts, then the length, breadth,
                    and depth of each of these parts must be multiplied together, and the contents
                    of the log will be the sum of the products. When the log tapers, a mean breadth
                    or depth is taken; the object in every case being to attain the most correct
                    approximation to the contents of the log. In measuring rough logs, it is however
                    usual to gird the log at the measuring place with a string, and then, folding
                    the string into four equal parts, to assume this fourth part of the girth to be
                    one side of the square area at the measuring place; which area, when multiplied
                    by the length, will give the solid contents of the log. The arithmetical
                    operation, simple as it is, is universally superseded by the more simple and far
                    more correct plan of referring to published tables of contents, calculated for
                    every foot in length of a log, and every quarter of an inch in the side of the
                    square. Those most generally used for this purpose are in Hoppus’s Practical
                    Measurer.</p>
                <p>In measuring standing timber, the length is taken as high as the tree will
                    measure twenty-four inches in circumference, less than which measurement is not
                    considered as timber. At half this height, the measurement for the mean girth of
                    the timber in the stem of the tree is taken; one fourth of this girth is assumed
                    to be the side of the equivalent square area. The buyer has in general the
                    option of choosing any spot between the but-end and the half-height of the stem
                    as the girding place. All branches, as far as they measure twenty-four inches in
                    girth, are measured in with the tree as timber. An allowance, which varies
                    according to circumstances, is generally deducted for the bark. In oak it is
                    from about one tenth to one twelfth of the circumference at the girding place;
                    in other sorts of timber it is less. In all, however, this allowance depends
                    much upon special agreement.</p>
                <p>It is usual to speak of timber by the load, which means fifty cubic feet of
                    squared timber, or forty cubic feet of rough timber. A load of plank is
                    dependent upon its thickness. Thus it will require 200 square feet of three-inch
                    plank to make the load of fifty cubic feet; therefore the load of plank is the
                    number of square feet of its respective thickness, which is necessary to make
                    the load of fifty cubic feet. Deals are measured, according to their thickness
                    and lengths, by the hundred, reckoning 120 to the hundred.</p>
                <p>The practice of receiving and measuring timber for the use of the royal navy is
                    more specific and strict in its detail than that which has been described; and
                    as the customs of the public service in this branch of commerce must greatly
                    influence the timber market, we shall proceed to give an outline of them.</p>
                <p>Rough oak timber must be so hewn or squared, that at each measuring place the
                    width of the surface or square shall not be less than one fourth the diameter of
                    the piece at the place where the measurement is to be taken. The lengths for
                    measurement are regulated by the several stops or joggles. Each piece of timber
                    is measured for contents, by calliper measurements, as far as the spine<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Spine is the technical term
                    used to designate the perfect wood.</p></note> will hold twelve inches in
                    diameter; and no tops are received excepting the spire and one other limb,
                    remaining on the piece, and admitting of being converted with it. These limbs
                    are only measured as far as they will hold twelve inches in diameter, unless the
                    timber will convert as compass timber, in which case it is measured as far as it
                    will hold nine inches in diameter.</p>
                <p>Rough elm timber is measured in the same manner as the oak, excepting that the
                    piece is measured as far as it will hold nine inches in diameter.</p>
                <p>Sided timber, which may be defined as the rough log with two and opposite slabs
                    sawn from it, is measured according to the following conditions. The term
                    “siding” is synonymous with thickness, and the term “moulding” with breadth. It
                    must measure at least twelve inches in parallel thickness. The moulding at the
                    but-end must not exceed the siding by more than one half. The moulding at the
                    middle of the length must not exceed the siding by more than one fourth, nor by
                    less than one eighth; and the moulding at the top-end must not exceed the siding

                    The piece must be fairly tapered from the but-end to the middle of the length,
                    and must not have more than four inches in the two wanes taken together on
                    either side; that is to say, if there be but one wane,<note anchored="true"

                    the hypothenuse of an angular portion of timber which is wanting to complete the

                    log between the wanes.</p></note> that wane shall not exceed four inches. The
                    piece must be so sided, that between the wanes, at half its iength, there shall
                    not be less than the siding with one eighth in addition, and the pane at the
                    top-end must not be less than two thirds the pane at the middle of the length.
                    The piece is measured for contents as far as it holds between the wanes three
                    fourths of its siding. It must be so hewn the moulding way, that the surface of
                    the square shall not be less than one fourth the diameter of the piece at that
                    place, and this dimension must be set off previously to the diameter for
                    measurement being taken. No but-length is allowed, but the timber is measured
                    for contents at the middle of the length. If any piece of timber has length
                    beyond the prescribed proportion of pane, and which is really convertible with
                    the piece, it is received at a reduction of price. Timber having five inches or
                    more of naturally grown rounding in any twelve feet or less of its length, is
                    denominated compass timber.</p>
                <p>Timber of certain sidings must have at least certain proportionate lengths. These
                    are as follow:</p>
                <p>Siding. Length.</p>
                <p>20 inches to 19½ must be at least 24 feet.</p>

                    together.</p>
                <p>Thick-stuff is a name used to designate all planks beyond a certain arbitrarily
                    assumed thickness, which is now four and a half inches and upwards, to ten
                    inches inclusive. All below four and a half inches in thickness is called plank.
                    It must be cut straight and of a parallel thickness, and the breadth for
                    measurement, which is taken at half the length of the piece, must not exceed
                    nineteen inches nor be less than twelve inches clear of sap. This breadth, at
                    the middle of the length, is measured by taking in half the wanes, thus,
                    provided the breadth clear of the sap is within two inches of the breadth at
                    which the piece is received. No thick-stuff can be received of less length than
                    twenty-three feet, at which length it must measure nine inches clear of the sap;
                    and all extra length, as far as it measures nine inches between the sap, is
                    measured into the contents.</p>
                <p>The rules for measuring thick-stuff and plank vary slightly, in order to accord
                    with the growth of the sort of timber from which they are converted. For
                    example, in the case of Lorraine oak thick-stuff, the minimum length is
                    twenty-four feet; the measurement for breadth, which must not exceed eighteen
                    inches, nor be less than fourteen inches, is taken at eight feet from the
                    but-end of the piece. The piece must be square edged from end to end, and must
                    measure nine inches at the top-end clear of sap on the most sappy side. English
                    elm thick-stuff of five inches and four and a half inches in thickness, must not
                    be less than fourteen inches broad in the middle of the length, nor less than
                    twelve inches broad at the top-end clear of shakes and dead sap. The planks must
                    average twenty-six feet in length, and no plank may be of less length than
                    twenty-three feet. North American rock elm thick-stuff of five inches and four
                    and a half inches in thickness, is received at twelve inches broad, clear of
                    shakes and sap, of the average length of twenty-eight feet, but none shorter
                    than twenty-four feet in length.</p>
                <p>English oak plank of four inches thick must be at least twenty-two feet, and of
                    three inches thick at least twenty feet in length. The breadth between the sap
                    at those lengths must be seven inches, and the plank is measured as far as it
                    holds six inches clear of sap. The breadth for measurement, which is taken at
                    half the length of the piece, and clear of sap, must not be less than nine
                    inches for the four-inch plank, and eight inches for the three-inch plank. This
                    is taking in half the wanes, provided the breadth clear of sap be within two
                    inches of the breadth at which the piece is received.</p>
                <p>Dantzig oak plank of four and a half and four inches thick is to mete at
                    thirty-two feet long, with a minimum length of twenty-four feet. It is to be
                    from twelve to fifteen inches broad, and cut square edged its whole length.
                    Plank of three and a half and three inches thick is to mete at twenty-eight feet
                    long, with a minimum length of twenty-four feet, and to be from twelve to
                    fourteen inches broad. Lorraine plank must be square edged from end to end. No
                    plank of four inches in thickness is to be less than twenty-four feet in length,
                    or more than sixteen inches or less than thirteen inches in breadth, at seven
                    feet from the but-end. The length is to be measured for superficial contents as
                    far as the plank runs eight inches in breadth, clear of sap on the most sappy
                    side. For three-inch plank, the minimum length is twenty feet. The breadth at
                    six feet from the but must not exceed sixteen inches, nor be less than twelve
                    inches; and the length is to be measured for superficial contents, as far as the
                    plank runs seven inches in breadth, clear of sap on the most sappy side. The sap
                    on the two edges taken together on either side of this plank, after the edge is
                    squared, must not exceed one inch; that is to say, if there be no sap on one
                    edge, that on the other edge must not exceed one inch.</p>
                <p>Fir timber received for general purposes is measured for its size at the middle
                    of its length, and the size for measurement must be the mean of the sizes taken
                    at the but and top, and the spine must be seen on the four sides from end to end
                    of the piece. The red-pine timber, whether from the north of Europe or from
                    Virginia, is not received of less length than eighteen feet, nor less in
                    diameter than eleven inches. The Canada red-pine timber, which must be felled
                    above Montreal, must not be of less length than twenty feet. The North American
                    yellow pine must be at least twenty feet in length, and sixteen inches square.
                    That which is received for the cheeks of made-masts is required to run as high
                    in dimensions as sixty-three feet in length, and cighteen inches square at the
                    measuring place.</p>
                <p>Fir that is received especially for mast-making is required to be of certain
                    proportionate dimensions. It is divided into two sorts, inch-masts and
                    hand-masts. The inch-masts are designated according to the number of inches they
                    measure in diameter at a measuring place called the partners, after they have
                    been chopped on each square, so as to show spine; and their length must be nine
                    feet more than three times the number of feet which they have inches in
                    diameter. The distance of the partners from the but-end is in a given ratio to
                    the whole <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=319"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0319-0299"/>length of the stick. Between the partners and the
                    top-end certain measuring places are determined, at each of which places, called
                    “quarters,” the diameter of the stick must be in a given proportion to the
                    diameter at the partners; and all these conditions must be fulfilled before the
                    stick can be received at the number of inches first assumed as the diameter at
                    the partners. If the sticks are intended for yards, the measuring place is at
                    the slings, in the middle of the length, and the stick is measured from that
                    point towards each end, the quarters being set off each way. If the sticks are
                    intended for bowsprits, the given diameter is at the bed, and the quarters are
                    set off towards each end.</p>
                <p>All these proportions for masts, yards, and bowsprits, are determined from tables
                    which have been drawn out for the purpose, and framed to suit the peculiarities
                    of the growth of the various sorts of timber to be applied to these different
                    uses.</p>
                <p>Hand-masts are measured in their round state, according to the number of hands
                    they are in circumference at the but, the hand being four inches. Their length
                    must be cighteen feet more than three times the number of feet that they are
                    hands in circumference, and the top-end must measure in circumference two thirds
                    of the measurement of the but. Sticks which measure less than six hands are
                    received under the general name of spars, and are designated as cant, barling,
                    boom, middling, and small spars, according as they measure above five, four,
                    three, two, or one hand respectively.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On the Woods of India.</hi></p>
                <p>The following account of woods, the growth of our possessions in the East Indies,
                    is compiled from a series of reports with which the writer of this article was
                    favoured, through the enlightened liberality of the Court of Directors of the
                    Honourable East India Company, and also from a paper in the Asiatic Annual
                    Register, written by Daniel Lambert, Esq., which accompanied those reports. The
                    reports were made to the honourable court by their surveyor of shipping in
                    Bengal, John Millingar Seppings, Esq., a son of the late able surveyor of the
                    royal navy, Sir Robert Seppings. The account embodies all those points in the
                    reports which contain information consistent with the purpose of this article;
                    and, as nearly as has been possible in such a compilation, in order to insure
                    correctness of information, the language of the reports has been adhered to. The
                    report of the experiments made by Captain H. C. Baker has been given entire, as
                    it would not admit of condensation; but in order to economize space, only the
                    mean results of the experiments have been printed; and the number of experiments
                    of which the given results are a mean, has been inserted in the table.</p>
                <p>We have also been enabled, through the great kindness of a friend, to enrich this
                    article by a most valuable tabular series of original observations on the effect
                    which seasoning produces on almost every species of timber that has been treated
                    of in the course of the foregoing remarks: to which are appended some most
                    interesting and judicious observations and deductions by the author of the
                    table, Mr Bennett, of her majesty’s dock-yard at Portsmouth, a member of the
                    late School of Naval Architecture.</p>
                <p>The woods used in India for ship-building are, teak, saul, sissoo, jarrol, poon,
                    and toon. Teak is the most durable among these timbers, but it varies very much
                    in quality. There are two kinds of the Malabar teak, the northern and southern;
                    the first is far superior in point of durability, but is the most difficult to
                    procure. The Malabar teak is classed at Bombay as follows. No. 1, Northern,
                    curved timber, which is brought a distance from Bombay of from 130 to 140 miles;
                    No. 2, Southern, Calicut teak;</p>
                <p>No. 3, Northern Pattey, or straight timber, used for small vessels and boats; No.
                    4, Bassein, or curved timber.</p>
                <p>The great length of time which several vessels built of Malabar teak have lasted
                    (from thirty to fifty years, in some particular instances nearly a century) has
                    established the prime Malabar northern teak as the most valuable timber in the
                    world for ship-building. It is, however, like every kind of wood, liable to
                    early decay, if not properly or gradually seasoned, by exposure to a moderate
                    current of air after being felled. Malabar teak is so seldom imported into
                    Calcutta, from the expense of bringing it round Ceylon, and on account of the
                    distance, that it may be said never to be used there for ship-building.</p>
                <p>Pegu and Moulmein teak is extensively used by the ship-builders of the Hooghly,
                    and is the only description of teak timber imported in any quantity to the
                    Calcutta markets. It is brought in a half-wrought state, the logs or planks
                    being squared. Pegu and Moulmein teak is a coarse, porous, open-grained wood,
                    when compared with Malabar teak. It is not a timber which can be depended upon,
                    particularly that which is of a pale-brown colour, which frequently goes very
                    rapidly to decay. It is also of such a mixed quality, and the importation to
                    Calcutta is so limited, that it is frequently difficult to select sufficient
                    prime dark timber out of all the cargoes to build a ship of 200 tons burthen.
                    Its weight, when moderately seasoned, may on an average be stated to be
                    forty-two pounds per cubic foot, while the weight of Malabar teak on an average
                    is from forty-five to fifty-two pounds per cubic foot. The forests of Tonga and
                    Irrawaddy supply the whole of the Pegu teak. That of the Tonga forests is of the
                    best quality, the country being high, and not flooded during the rainy season;
                    whereas the forests of the Irrawaddy are always in a swampy state, and are part
                    of the year covered with water sufficient to allow of the trees being floated
                    from where they are felled. The Birmans are in the habit of tapping the teak
                    trees, particularly those which are straight grown, to extract a varnish or oil,
                    which is highly prized by them, and used chiefly for protecting their pagodas or
                    temples from the weather, for which purpose it is very effectual. These edifices
                    are built entirely of untapt teak, as the Birmans consider the timber to be much
                    injured, both in its strength and its durability, by being deprived of this oil.
                    The principal parts of these temples are sunk in the ground, and although so
                    fixed, the timber remains perfectly sound, notwithstanding many of them have
                    stood nearly a century.</p>
                <p>The importation of teak from Moulmein and the Tenasscrim coast has only taken
                    place since the Birman war. Prior to that period, Calcutta was supplied almost
                    exclusively from Rangoon, but only with straight teak. The Moul-meia market
                    first supplied crooked teak timbers, which sold at such prices as to induce the
                    Rangoon merchants also to send crooked timber from thence. The quantity,
                    however, is so very limited, that the greatest difficulty is at present
                    experienced upon the Hooghly in completing vessels from 100 to 400 tons entirely
                    of teak.</p>
                <p>Inferior as the Pegu and Moulmein teak is in quality when compared with the
                    Bombay teak, it is preferable either to the saul or the sissoo, which has been
                    brought to Calcutta within the last fifteen years, and which will be presently
                    noticed. The accounts of the forests of Pegu and Tenasscrim are, that they are
                    inexhaustible, and, if encouraged and properly worked, would supply timber of
                    the largest size, and in sufficient quantity to meet the whole demand of the
                    royal yards of Britain. In the batches of teak brought from the Tenasscrim
                    coast, a species of darkcoloured teak, approaching to black, may be noticed,
                    which appears to be a superior description of timber. It is very tough, with the
                    grain close and irregular. It is said to be brought down from the forests mixed
                    with the common <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=320"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0320-0300"/>or brown teak. The following useful information as
                    to the expense of both workmanship and material was obtained, in October 1832,
                    from Captain Forzar, who was engaged in the Moulmein timber trade.</p>
                <p>“The head Birmah carpenter, Mistry, offered to supply and trim teak timbers all
                    round for a ship of 400 tons, at four rupees each; or to execute the whole of
                    the work, as it regards the supply of carpenters, for 10,000 Sicca rupees,
                    including joiners’ work for the hull, and the masts, yards, &amp;c.”</p>
                <p>“The price of teak crooks at Moulmein was, lst sort large, to side about 12 to 15
                    in. 7 rup. each. 2d ditto middling, ditto 11 to 8 in. 3 to 5 rup. each.”</p>
                <p>“The 'Cashmere Merchant’ cargo (imported into Calcutta) cost at Moulmein in
                    1832,</p>
                <p>From 15 feet { 1st sort large... 9 rupees each, to 18 feet { 2d do. middling 6
                    ditto, in length. { 3d do. small 4 ditto.</p>
                <p>“Boat timbers, to side from three to six inches, and from four to seven feet
                    long, cost from twenty to twenty-five rupees per hundred.”</p>
                <p>The other kind of teak used in India for ship-building is the Java teak, of which
                    considerable quantities were imported into Calcutta during the time the English
                    governed that island. Of late years scarcely any has been imported. The Java
                    teak is of a very superior quality, and, judging from the state of the vessels
                    built of it, it is nearly if not quite equal to Malabar teak.</p>
                <p>All descriptions of teak, if sound, free from defects and from sap-wood, are
                    proof against the white ants; whereas all other descriptions of timber
                    enumerated in this memorandum are liable to the attacks of these insects.</p>
                <p>Saul is a hard heavy wood. It is imported from Behar, Oude, and the inexhaustible
                    forests that skirt the hills which form the northern boundaries of Bengal and
                    Behar. It is used extensively in all Calcutta ships, for the timbers, beams,
                    &amp;c. It is of two kinds, the Goruckpore and Morung; the first is a most
                    inferior timber, and goes rapidly to decay. An intelligent gentleman long
                    engaged in the timber trade of this country writes as follows. The forests
                    situated to the east of the Coosey river, and to the west of the Teestan,
                    produce the only good saul in India, which, like the elephant, deteriorates in
                    quality the farther it is produced to the westward. The best timber is found at
                    the foot of the hills, on a rocky ground. Sauls of large dimensions are now
                    becoming exceedingly scarce, as the whole of the forests within a reasonable
                    distance of the navigable streams are completely exhausted; and every good
                    timber must now be conveyed by land-carriage a journey of two days. A great part
                    of the natives, and all the Europeans (with the exception of one gentleman),
                    have given up timber cutting altogether. The great superiority of Morung saul
                    over that produced to the west of these forests appears to have been but a
                    recent discovery in Calcutta, though always well known to the native
                    boat-builders. That found to the west of the Coosey river, for instance,
                    Goruckpore and Bogah, being of a soft spongy nature, but little better than
                    Mango wood, is now driven out of the market. The prejudice existing against the
                    smaller timbers (dakar), on the ground of immaturity, would be done away with
                    were it known that every fine tree produces a large and a small timber, the
                    bottom the chakar, the top the dakar.</p>
                <p>Good saul is inferior to the very fine description of sissoo which was used in
                    Calcutta-built ships about thirty years ago. The best description of saul, if
                    well seasoned, may be classed, in point of durability, with the best sort of
                    African timber, now so extensively used by the ship-builders of England. The
                    greatest care is necessary in the selection of saul for immediate use, on
                    account of its requiring a long time to season. It is very heavy, and will not
                    answer for any part of a ship exposed to the sun, as it shrinks very much. Saul
                    continues to be used for the frame, beams, shelf-pieces, breast-hooks, and
                    inside planking, of ships built at Calcutta.</p>
                <p>Sissoo may be classed of two kinds, the dark and the light coloured. The first
                    grows in the forests of the same districts where the best saul is to be found;
                    but it has become so very scarce for some years past, that it is now seldom or
                    never brought to Calcutta, although scarcely thirty years have elapsed since the
                    forests of the north-west districts of Behar, where the finest sissoo timber is
                    produced, were pronounced to be almost inexhaustible. The other kind (the light)
                    has been the only crooked timber of late years brought down the country for
                    ship-building: it is decidedly an inferior sort of wood, very subject to the dry
                    rot, and to the attack of white ants.</p>
                <p>Jarrol is of two sorts, the red and the white. The red jarrol grows to a size fit
                    for the largest ships, and may be obtained in any quantity near Chittagong; at
                    which place several fine ships have been built, some of which are now running,
                    although from fifteen to twenty-five years old. They were built of red jarrol
                    timbers, with Pegu teak plank. Jarrol is very extensively used in Rangoon-built
                    ships, but of a mixed and inferior sort. Comparing the superior sort of jarrol
                    with the best kind of sissoo or saul, it must be considered an inferior wood in
                    point of durability. White jarrol is very inferior, and never should be used in
                    ship-building.</p>
                <p>Poon is also of two kinds, the dark and the light. It is a wood that answers very
                    well for masts, for which it is used; but it is perfectly unfit to be introduced
                    into the hull, either as timbers or planks. The Malacca red poon is that of
                    which masts and yards are made.</p>
                <p>Toon should never be used for ship-building. It has however been introduced into
                    several Cochin-built ships, and after five years has been found perfectly
                    rotten. It is a porous open-grained wood; and the only use it can be applied to
                    is for making furniture, for which it is extensively used in Calcutta.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the best test of the durability of a Calcutta-built ship which can be
                    cited, will be the Hastings of seventy-four guns, built there in 1818. The hull
                    is composed of saul, sissoo, Pegu and Java teak, all of the best kind. So great
                    was the expense incurred in the building of this ship, that when completed, the
                    account, after giving credit for her freight, exhibited the cost of the hull for
                    sea 11,63,754 Sicca rupees, or, ten rupees to the pound, L.1 16,375 sterling. It
                    is usual in Calcutta-built ships to convert the frame, with the knees,
                    breast-hooks, &amp;c. from sissoo timber; the beams and inside planking being of
                    saul, and the bottoms, wales, topsides, decks, keels, stem, and stern-posts, of
                    the Pegu teak.</p>

                <p>The specimens, many of them, were obtained from the Commissariat Timber Depot;
                    some very fine ones from the Cossipore Gun-Carriage Agency, and others were the
                    produce of the Calcutta market. Those of three and two feet in length were,
                    generally speaking, cut from the sound fragments of the larger specimens.</p>
                <p>The central deflections of the seven and six feet specimens were usually noted
                    immediately after the application of each fifty pounds of fresh load, at which
                    time the set taken by each appeared more regular than after some interval had
                    elapsed. The first deflections were commonly recorded with 150 pounds weight, in
                    some cases with only fifty pounds. Sometimes the specimen was turned upon the
                    trestles and subjected to two or more trials; and in a few instances the load
                    was left suspended for many hours, deflections being noted at different
                    intervals of time.</p>
                <p>The depth of the neutral axis was occasionally observed, but this has been found
                    to vary so little (being generally five eighths of the depth) as to render its
                    insertion in the table of little practical utility.</p>
                <p>The direct cohesive strength of the wood having also been subjected to
                    experiment, the calculation of it from Mr Barlow’s formula has not been thought
                    necessary; but the curious in such investigations are here presented with
                    abundant materials for pursuing the inquiry.</p>
                <p>lt is much to be regretted, that from the circumstances under which most of the
                    specimens were obtained, so little accurate information respecting the timber
                    could be procured. The age, size, time of felling, and circumstances under which
                    the trees had been respectively placed subsequently to their being cut down,
                    would all have materially enhanced the value of this statement of results to the
                    man of research; but, unluckily, no such information was accessible. Indeed in
                    few cases was it even precisely known from what part of the timber the specimen
                    itself was cut out, or what number was off the same trunk. The year of
                    importation, where known, has been however inserted.</p>
                <p>The following were the woods experimented on. Saul<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The saul and sissoo are obtained from the
                    forests north of the Ganges line, between the 25th and 3lst degrees of north
                    latitude, and 74th and 88th degrees of east longitude, but chiefly from the
                    tract lying north of Purneah and Goruckpore.</p></note><hi rend="italic">(
                    Sharea Robusta Rox).</hi> This timber is too well known to render a lengthened
                    description of it requisite; but its value for building purposes does not yet
                    seem to have been fully appreciated. The great mechanical resistance it affords
                    in cases of strain, however applied, renders it unquestionably the most valuable
                    of Indian timber yet generally known for engineering purposes. The regularity of
                    its deflections is indeed such as to render calculations of the requisite
                    scantling for any particular stress, at all times simple and sure.</p>
                <p>The general appearance of its fracture beautifully illustrates Mr Barlow’s theory
                    of the axis of motion or rotation being centrically situated; the upper or
                    compressed fibres being smooth as though cut with a sharp knife, those in a
                    state of tension so fine and intimately blended as to resemble those of hemp
                    rope when violently torn asunder.</p>
                <p>The saul of the Calcutta market is seldom above thirty feet in length, but the
                    trees grow to a much greater height. From the injudicious practice of squaring
                    it after felling, its mean girth is only about six to seven feet, but must be
                    naturally much greater.</p>
                <p>Saul has lately been very successfully substituted for teak in many of the
                    component parts of the gun-carriages, cheeks, beams, and transoms; poles and
                    framing of gun and ammunition boxes; occasionally spokes, naves, and fellies.
                    Its toughness in cases of percussion must obviously render it a much safer
                    material than teak to be near in action. It has also been used for door and
                    window panels. It however shrinks more, from its greater density.</p>
                <p>To both the above woods, the teak (<hi rend="italic">Tectona grandis),</hi> in
                    point of strength and elasticity, is decidedly inferior. Its brittleness renders
                    it indeed rather hazardous to stand near the specimens when they are subjected
                    to heavy strain, as the pieces, sometimes several of them, fly with considerable
                    impetus in different directions.</p>
                <p>A reference to the tables will show, that of a great number of specimens tried,
                    three only, 80, 81, 88, of which only the mean result is given in this abridged
                    table, see ( 1 ), at all approximate in results to those of Mr Barlow. the mean
                    of my experiments is about 2∙078, of Mr Barlow’s 2∙462, a number which exceeds
                    that of the saul tried by me. Mr Barlow’s specimens must therefore have been
                    vastly superior to any in common use throughout India, for the comparative
                    superiority of saul in point of strength is, I believe, indisputable.</p>
                <p>The teak grows to a great height, seventy to eighty feet and more, but cannot be
                    easily obtained good of that size, the heart being frequently very much decayed.
                    It is a durable wood when exposed, and is not subject to the depredations of
                    white ants until it has been very long in use. The uses to which teak is applied
                    are too generally known to render much remark necessary; planking, boxes,
                    panelling, doors, windows, venetians, furniture, beams of houses, are amongst
                    the most common.</p>
                <p>Sissooh <hi rend="italic">(Dalbergia Sissooh Box')</hi> in structure somewhat
                    resembles the fine species of teak, but it is tougher and more elastic. The
                    sissooh grows to the height of about thirty feet, but it is generally rather
                    crooked, and therefore not so well adapted for beams. Sissooh is said to get
                    harder with age.</p>
                <p>It is by the natives employed for house-furniture, beams, cheeks; spokes, naves,
                    and fellies of wheels; keels and frames of boats, blocks, printing presses; and
                    generally in all work where crooked timber is required.</p>
                <p>Jarrol (red) is a fine even wood in structure, and grows to great size in the
                    Chittagong district; but that brought to the Calcutta market is too small to be
                    of much use except for picture-frames and other similar purposes.</p>
                <p>The Chittagong forests are said to be dearly cleared of the best or thorny
                    species of jarrol; the others are of little value. It is considered a
                    treacherous wood in ship-building.</p>

                <p>In order to make this valuable series of mean results as useful as possible, we
                    have formed a similar Table from the mean results of the experiments made by
                    Professor Barlow, and published by him in his work on the Strength of Timber.
                    The two Tables taken together form a most interesting and perfect series of
                    results.</p>

                <p>In Table III., which is the classification of timber adopted by the Committee of
                    Lloyd’s Register Book of British Shipping, there are two sorts mentioned as
                    timber of the first quality, which are yet little known in this country in
                    private building yards, and not at all in our public establishments. These are
                    greenheart and morra. They are both the produce of British Guiana, a colony that
                    will in all probability ere long be a chief source from which this country will
                    draw her supplies of naval timber. The territories of the colony have never yet
                    been clearly defined. Its extent has been variously stated, by some as not much
                    exceeding 12,000 square miles, by others as extending over an area of 76,000
                    square miles. It is situated almost immediately under the equator, and has
                    consequently the vigorous and luxuriant vegetation inherent to such regions. The
                    forests of the interior are said to be of immense extent, and abounding in
                    valuable timber trees. Among these are, the morra, which nearly resembles in
                    appearance the best African oak; the simiri, or locust, a wood well known in
                    England; and the siperi, or greenheart, so called from a peculiar green tinge
                    which the timber has when cut with a tool. There arc many other valuable timber
                    trees, both for building and for ornamental work; but these perhaps are the most
                    important to notice here.</p>
                <p>The morra may be obtained easily to square twenty inches, and the logs run from
                    thirty to fifty feet in length. It is said not to be susceptible of dry rot; but
                    there can hardly yet be sufficient experience of it when combined in the masses
                    of timber to be found in large ships to establish this important point as
                    indisputable. If it be as similar in its qualities as it is in its appearance to
                    African oak, it certainly can claim no exemption from the attack of dry rot. The
                    trees grow to a great height; and although the trunks are generally straight,
                    the branches afford good compass timber.</p>
                <p>But the most important timber produce of British Guiana is the greenheart. It is
                    a hard close-grained wood, having, like teak, an oily feel to the touch. Its
                    specific gravity is about equal to that of African oak, but it is decidedly
                    superior to it in strength, toughness, and durability. These, however, are not
                    its chief advantages: its great value consists in its being completely exempt
                    from the attacks of worms. It is on this account used in Demerara for
                    sluice-gates, piles, and all marine engineering works which would be exposed to
                    their ravages. Experiments of a most conclusive nature as to its really
                    resisting these insects have been made in this country. The port of Liverpool is
                    much infested with worms, and the wood-work of the docks there is constantly
                    destroyed by them. Clows of greenheart timber have now been down upwards of
                    seven years at the west entrance of the Brunswick half-tide basin, and are as
                    yet untouched; while experience has proved that clows of other timber in the
                    same situation would have been destroyed in less than half that time.</p>
                <p>This is a most important quality, and renders this timber invaluable for marine
                    engineering works. It is imported in logs of from twelve to sixteen inches
                    square, and from twenty to forty feet in length. It is exceedingly hard, and
                    difficult to work as planking, although latterly some colonial vessels have been
                    planked with it. There is another Gui-anian timber, the siruaballi, of a softer
                    texture, and much used for planking, as it is also said to be able to resist the
                    ravages of the worm.</p>

                </table>
                <p>“In the above table, the first weight of each specimen was taken within or
                    shortly after one year of the felling of the tree. This is to be generally
                    understood, unless otherwise expressed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Remarks.</hi></p>
                <p>“Few authors agree as it respects the weight of various species of timber in a
                    seasoned and in an unseasoned state. This diversity of opinion often arises from
                    an indefinite use of the terms ‘ seasoned,’ and ‘ unseasoned and we need not be
                    surprised at these seeming contradictions, when we remember that many other
                    words which denote the state or condition of bodies, are equally indeterminate.
                    Thus, when we speak of heat and cold, light and darkness, moisture and dryness,
                    we may naturally inquire what diminution of heat occasions cold, what decrease
                    of light causes darkness, or what absence of moisture constitutes dryness.
                    Hence, generally speaking, the word ‘ seasoned’ implies a relative rather than
                    an absolute state of the wood. To prevent as far as possible any ambiguity on
                    the subject, the dates and circumstances under which the wood was placed are
                    carefully recorded, by which means the reader may form his own conclusions
                    respecting the gradations of weight at intervals of time varying from one to
                    twenty years. It should be understood, that large masses of timber, even if
                    placed in dry situations for many years, in buildings or ships, would have their
                    specific gravity diminished if cut into small portions. This will be manifest,
                    if the reader refers to those specimens in the table which were taken out of a
                    ship of war, the Marlborough.</p>
                <p>“It occasionally happens that the specific gravity of timber is increased instead
                    of being decreased by seasoning. This occurs when the shrinkage diminishes in a
                    greater ratio than the weight. See No. 75 and 78.</p>
                <p>“Shrinkage rarely takes place in the direction of the length of timber; when it
                    does so occur, it seems to arise from a want of uniformity in the direction of
                    the grain; for instance, when the wood is ‘curly’ and knotty. Independently of
                    the length, the greatest shrinkage is in a direction at right angles with the ‘
                    silver grain the least in the direction of the plane of the ‘ silver grain.’
                    Hence, when the heart of the tree is in the middle of the wood, so that the
                    silver grain radiates from the heart to the exterior, there is no greater
                    tendency to shrinkage in the one than in the other direction.</p>
                <p>“In those cases in which the specimens are known to be tops and buts of trees,
                    they are so distinguished; otherwise they must be supposed to be
                    indiscriminately taken from the top, but, or middle of the trees. It is a
                    generally-received opinion, that the but of English and other oak is heavier
                    than the top; still men of great eminence differ on this subject. The view of Du
                    Hamel may probably partly account for these conflicting ideas. He asserts, that
                    in healthy vigorous trees, the but is heavier than the top; but that in trees
                    past their maturity and on the decline, the top is heavier than the but.
                    Whatever deference may be due to this opinion, an analysis of the facts
                    contained in our table will show, that another cause materially affects the
                    condition of the question, which is the hygrometrical state of the specimens
                    subjected to experiment; for it is an interesting fact, which will be presently
                    verified, that the but of a tree may be of greater, of equal, or of less
                    specific gravity than the top, according as each is more or less advanced to a
                    state of seasoning.</p>
                <p>“Among others, the following results are derived from the foregoing table.</p>
                <p>“1st, The average weight of a cubic foot of unseasoned English oak, derived from
                    twenty-seven specimens, viz. No. 9 to 35 inclusive, is 1000 oz., or 62 lbs. 8
                    oz.</p>
                <p>“2d, From the same specimens the average weight of a cubic foot of English oak
                    allowed to season during the space of from thirteen to twenty years is 45 lbs. 9

                    />the average weight of those which were kept in a warm room, in which there was

                    were kept in a shed weighed only 44 lbs. 13 oz. to the cubic foot. This result
                    seems to warrant the conclusion, that within certain limits artificial heat does
                    not season wood so expeditiously as natural heat and ventilation. It should be
                    however remarked, that the average original weight of the specimens kept in a
                    warm room exceeded that of those kept in the shed; the former weighing 63 lbs.
                    4½ oz. to the foot, while the latter weighed 62 lbs. 3 oz. to the foot. The
                    difference, however, is too small to vitiate the conclusion just drawn.</p>
                <p>“4th, From the specimens of English oak in which the tops and buts are
                    distinguished, it appears that in seasoned oak the top is heavier than the but;
                    the average weight of a cubic foot of each being respectively 48 lbs. 7¾ oz.,
                    and 44 lbs. 4 oz. On the contrary, in unseasoned oak the but is heavier than the
                    top, the average weight of a cubic foot of each being respectively 64 lbs. 14
                    oz, and 62 lbs. 13 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    oz. It hence follows, that there must be a medium state of seasoning, in which
                    the top and but are equally heavy.</p>
                <p>“5th, From specimens No. 37 to 42, it appears that the average weight of a cubic
                    foot of French oak is, seasoned 48 lbs. 0¼ oz., and unseasoned 68 lbs. 2 oz.
                    These specimens not having been seasoned four years, are not to be considered as
                    having arrived at their ultimate state. Nos. 47 and 48 were not cut out until
                    August 1840, although the trees were felled in 1836. These, however, together
                    with 49 and 50, serve to show the degree of seasoning of the solid log, as
                    compared with the seasoning of No. 37 to 42, being the same kind of timber cut
                    into small portions.</p>
                <p>“Taking the five specimens, 37 to 41, it will be seen that, both in a seasoned
                    and in an unseasoned state, the tops are, at least at present, heavier than the
                    buts. Thus,—</p>

                    besides those already mentioned, arc, Sir John Hill, M. D., on the Construction
                    of Timber as explained by the Microscope; first published in 1770: the work of
                    Forsyth on Fruit and Forest Trees, which is also of importance, as he was the
                    first to treat on vegetable surgery: the Planter’s Guide, by Sir Henry Steuart
                    of Allanton: and especially the Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum, by J. C.
                    Loudon, in eight volumes; one of the most scientific and important books
                    published on the subject. There are many other works which may be advantageously

                <p>The concluding short table will give some idea of the immense consumption of
                    timber incidental to our being a maritime power; and the estimate that each ton
                    of our merchant shipping has consumed at the very least a load and a quarter of
                    timber, will perhaps tend to diminish the surprise which may have been excited
                    in the early part of the article, by the assertion that the demand for timber
                    was fast outrunning the supply, and exhausting the forests.</p>

                <p>In this Table the contents of the “sided oak” and of the elm timber are expressed
                    in sided contents, which are derived from the converted contents by assuming the
                    converted contents to be to the sided contents as 2 to 5. The sided contents of
                    the fir timber are derived from the converted contents by assuming them to be to
                    each other as 4 to 3. The quantities of deals are expressed in “feet running” of
                    the rough deals expended on the ships. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b z.)</hi></p>
