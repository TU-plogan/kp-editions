                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">TOBAGO</label>, the most southerly of the Carribbee Islands,
                    lies in 60° 30' west longitude, and 11° 16' north latitude. It is about
                    twenty-two miles long, and from four to nine miles broad. This island was
                    discovered by Columbus in 1496, and received its name from the herb which was
                    smoked by the inhabitants. Sir Robert Dudley visited it in 1580; and in 1608
                    James I. claimed its sovereignty, though no effectual attempts were then made to
                    colonize it. In 1628 Charles I. made a grant of the isle to the earl of
                    Pembroke; but it continued almost deserted till 1632, when <pb break="no"

                    />some merchants of Zealand sent over 200 emigrants, and founded a colony, to
                    which they gave the name of New Walcheren; but before they were able thoroughly
                    to establish themselves, they were attacked by the Spaniards of Trinidad, aided
                    by the Indians, and the colony was utterly destroyed. Tobago remained deserted
                    till 1654, when two opulent merchants of Flushing, named Lampsin, again
                    colonized it, and raised it to be one of the most thriving commercial emporiums
                    in the West Indies. About the same time the duke of Courland, to whom James I.
                    had given a grant of the island, carried about a hundred families from Courland,
                    and settled them on one of the most beautiful parts of the island, which was
                    named after the founder. The island experienced various vicissitudes till it was
                    taken by the British in 1793, in whose possession it has continued ever
                    since.</p>
                <p>Tobago consists of a mass of rocks, the highest part of which is towards the
                    north-eastern extremity, where it rises to about 900 feet; it gradually descends
                    towards the south-west, with small and delightful valleys interspersed. It is
                    well cultivated where the rocks are not too steep. It has several good harbours,
                    chiefly on the northern coast. The climate is considered unhealthy, the average
                    mortality of the white troops having been ascertained to be at the rate of
                    fifteen per cent. annually. The principal town is Scarborough, which is situated
                    at the sea-shore, on the south coast.</p>
                <p>By the census of 1835, the population consisted of,—</p>
                <p>Males. Females. Total. Whites 250 30 280</p>
                <p>Free coloured and blacks ... 3,000</p>

                <p>13,085</p>
                <p>The experts of Tobago amounted in 1836 to L.196,974, of which L.166,333 were for
                    sugar and molasses, and L.29,960 for rum; thus showing that the sugar-cane
                    produces almost the sole exportable commodities of the island. The imports
                    during the same period amounted to L.73,947, consisting chiefly of wood and
                    lumber, fish, corn, and British manufactures.</p>
                <p>In 1836 there were four free schools in the island, with 347 scholars; and four
                    private schools, one of which is connected with the Moravians, and two with the
                    Methodists. The local legislature consists of the lieutenant-governor, a
                    legislative council of nine, and a house of assembly of sixteen members.</p>
