                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">TASSO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Torquato</hi></label>, one of the
                    most celebrated of modem poets, was the son of Bernardo Tasso, himself eminent
                    ill the same path of literature. Bernardo, a native of Bergamo, noble but poor,
                    published in 1560 his chivalrous poem of the Amadigi, which forms the link
                    between the wild and half-burlesque school in which Ariosto was the chief, and
                    the serious epic given to Italy by his own son.</p>
                <p>Torquato was born in 1544, at the beautifully situated town of Sorrento, on the
                    southern shore of the Bay of Naples; but, his father having been involved in the
                    misfortunes and exile of a distinguished patron, the son’s education was
                    conducted in the north. At Padua, when he had scarcely completed his eighteenth
                    year, he published his romantic poem called Rinaldo, which, aided by other
                    compositions, soon spread his fame over the peninsula, and introduced him into
                    the service of the house of Este, princes of Ferrara. His next work of
                    importance was the Aminta, a pastoral drama, in which, although having no claim
                    to rank as the inventor of that faulty species of poetry, he exhibited it in a
                    height of excellence neither attained before nor since. But, in the midst of
                    studies, minor compositions, and travels which carried him as far as Paris, his
                    mind was mainly occupied in elaborating his great work, the “Gieru-salemme
                    Liberata,” which he had planned and partly executed before leaving the
                    university. Though the youthful sketch is still extant, the work was afterwards
                    rewritten, and did not reach its close till 1575. The poet, now more than thirty
                    years old, had already displayed those infirmities of character which made him,
                    during the remainder of his life, the helpless victim of envious enemies, or of
                    mean and heartless patrons. The tale which Goethe and Byron have made the theme
                    of poetical invention, represents Tasso as the lover of Leonora d’Este, or,
                    according to some biographers, of Lucretia her sister; but the story is neither
                    sufficiently vouched, nor in itself either probable or consistent; and the real
                    cause of the persecution to which he was subjected remains, after all
                    investigations, as obscure as ever. We know, however, enough to show that his
                    mind was but ill qualified to stand the shock and tumult of the world. That
                    exquicite sensibility which reigns in his poetry was never dormant in any action
                    of his life: deficient in moral courage, and acutely sensitive in taste, he
                    hesitated for years to give his great poem to the public; his imagination,
                    overwrought and undisciplined, filled him with exaggerated suspicions of all who
                    were around him, and superstitious terrors completed his misery. He surrendered
                    himself to the Inquisition, confessing, as heretical doubts, what the
                    inquisitors had sense enough to consider as illusions of hypochondria; and,
                    after an unlucky quarrel had brought on him a temporary imprisonment at Ferrara,
                    he fled secretly from that city in 1577, and, crossing the central Appenines by
                    unfrequented paths, sought refuge with his sister at Sorrento. For a year and a
                    half after this period he wandered through Italy, alternately abandoning himself
                    to fanciful despondence, and arousing his mind to the composition of some of his
                    minor works. In 1579, returning to Ferrara for the second time since his flight,
                    he was treated with neglect by the duke and his sisters, and insulted by the
                    retainers of the court: he broke out, it is said, into violent reproaches
                    against his alienated patrons; and, seized by order of the Duke Alfonso, he was
                    immured in the hospital of Sant’ Anna, a public madhouse. In this prison he
                    remained more than seven years, receiving at one time permission to see his
                    friends, and even to pay visits in the city, but treated during the greater part
                    of the period with all the severities which in those days fell to the lot of
                    ordinary maniacs. In the earlier years of his imprisonment, his mind seems to
                    have gathered, from solitude and reflection, a strength of resolution which it
                    had not before possessed, while his literary genius was undecayed and constantly
                    active; but at length the horrors of his situation increased his constitutional
                    tendency to mental disease, and there is little ground for doubting that, in the
                    later period of his confinement, he laboured under a partial alienation of
                    reason.</p>
                <p>At length, however, the solicitation of powerful friends procured his release,
                    which took place in 1586; and, although his after years present us with several
                    stories of new misfortune and neglect, he found some patrons both kind <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0106-0088"/> and judicious. His Jerusalem Delivered had been
                    published repeatedly during his imprisonment, in spite of his earnest
                    remonstrances; and now, weaned alike from chivalrous enthusiasm and from the
                    wish to flatter princes, he rewrote the whole poem, and published it anew at
                    Rome in 1562, under the title of the “Gierusalemme Conquistata.” In this altered
                    shape the work was a religious allegory, and the Ferrarese princes were never
                    named in it; but the original editions of the poem have kept their place in
                    general favour, and the alteration is universally and not unjustly neglected.
                    Except the tragedy of Torrismondo, all his other extensive compositions after
                    his release were of a devotional cast. In the spring of 1595, while preparations
                    were making for conferring on him the honours of that triumphal coronation in
                    the Roman capitol, which had been invented in favour of Petrarca, he felt that
                    his end was approaching, and retired to the convent of Saint Onofrio on the brow
                    of the Janicu-lan Mount. He there expired placidly, having just completed his
                    fifty-first year; and his body still lies beneath the pavement of the little
                    church.</p>
                <p>Tasso’s works are very numerous, both in prose and verse; and recent examinations
                    of libraries, both in Italy and France, especially that of Alfieri, now
                    preserved at Montpellier, have added to the list many pieces, though without
                    throwing any decisive light on the mysterious portions of his history. One of
                    the most curious of the discoveries is a “Discorso intorno alla Sedizione nata
                    nel regno di Francia,” which was published in an Italian periodical in 1817. It
                    was written during his residence of twelve months at Paris, and is a bigoted
                    argument for the use of extreme severities against the Huguenots. This
                    performance, with other treatises and letters, was reprinted by the Abate
                    Mazzuchelli in 1822. Rosini’s edition of the poet’s works contains a volume
                    exclusively devoted to letters and poems not previously published; and several
                    separate collections have appeared, the most important being the “Trattato della
                    Dignità ed altri Scritti,” by Gazzera (Turin, 1838), and the “Manoscritti
                    inediti” of Count Alberti (Lucca, 1837-8).</p>
                <p>Tasso’s prose dialoguesand moral treatises, and his minor works in general, have
                    scarcely received, even from his own countrymen, that attention which they
                    fairly deserve; and Monti had some reason for declaring, that the poet’s shade
                    has been appeased but in part for the insults offered to him in his lifetime by
                    Salviati and the other academicians of the Crusea. Many of his lyrics are
                    exceedingly beautiful, and none of them more so than those gems which stand as
                    choruses in the Torrismondo, atoning by their pathetic sweetness for a bad plot
                    and a want of all dramatic vigour in the tragedy itself. But the Jerusalem
                    Delivered will always continue to be its author’s title to immortality; and,
                    whatever its faults may be, there are assuredly no two epics of modern times
                    that deserve to be placed above it. Regarded in comparison with other chivalrous
                    poems of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in Italy, it distinguishes itself
                    by two prominent features; its perfect regularity and simplicity of plan, and
                    its lofty and single seriousness of temper. No preceding poem in the language
                    had both these qualities; and Ariosto’s, the masterpiece of the series, and in
                    some respects the masterpiece of modern Italian literature, was possessed of
                    neither. The completeness of finishing in the Gierusalemme is another
                    excellence, in which it stands perhaps higher than any poetical work that has
                    been composed since the days of Virgil: and the antithetical quibbles and plays
                    upon words which descended from the Troubadours to Petrarca, from Petrarca to
                    Tasso, and from Tasso (though not through him directly) to our own poets of the
                    Elizabethan age, are faults more than balanced by the chivalrous sentiment, the
                    picturesqueness of natural descriptions, the fanciful beauty of the supernatural
                    machinery, and the tenderness which so often melts into irresistible pathos. We
                    must not look, in that picture of the Crusades which Tasso has painted, for the
                    stem and vigorous truth which such a mind as Shakspeare’s would have
                    incorporated in essential harmony with the poetical elements: we must not look
                    even for that inferior kind of fidelity to historical features which gives so
                    strong a charm to some poems of our own time; but we must view in it, with
                    thankful admiration, a panorama of poetically romantic incident, and poetically
                    chivalrous character, as delightful as any thing which genius has ever
                    presented.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Serassi. Vita
