                <p><label type="entry">TYROL or <hi rend="smallcaps">Thiol</hi></label>, a province
                    of Austria, one of those most early acquired by the imperial family. It takes
                    its name from an ancient castle on a mountain, near the river Meran, which came
                    under the house of Austria through a female, Margaretta Maultasche, in the year
                    1363. It extends in north latitude from 45° 39' 30" to 47° 41' 15", and in east
                    longitude from 0° 28’ 5'' to 12° 32' 23”, and contains 11,180 square miles. The
                    province is divided into seven circles, comprehending twenty-two cities,
                    thirty-six markettowns, and 8150 villages. The inhabitants were, in 1817,
                    717,524; but by the census of 1832, they appear to have increased to 805,750.
                    They all adhere to the Roman Catholic Church, there being no Protestants or
                    Greeks, and only eight or ten Jewish families. The whole of the province is a
                    continuation of the Alps, and the face of the country resembles Switzerland,
                    with some lofty mountains capped with snow, having between them similar profound
                    precipices, thundering cascades, and extensive glaciers. This portion of the
                    Alps, known to the ancients as the Rhetian, contains some of the loftiest
                    mountains of the range. The Orteler exceeds 14,000 feet in height, the
                    Tschernowand is 11,600, and a great number above 8000 feet. This mountainous
                    district abounds in most beautiful lakes, which are the sources of several
                    rivers, the Etsch, the Brenta, the Drave, and the Gail, which run to the
                    Adriatic; and of the Isar, the Lech, the IIler, and the Inn, which finally empty
                    themselves into the Danube. The air is pure and cold, but the too frequent
                    sirocco in the summer has often a most injurious effect on the health of the
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>From the nature of the country, the far greater part is inaccessible to
                    agriculture. The woods are estimated to be about three times the extent of the
                    pasture and arable land together; and of about 1,800,000 acres, not more than
                    170,000 are capable of being ploughed; whilst the pasture land, in which are
                    included those parts of the Alps which afford in the summer only food for
                    cattle, are estimated at 600,000 acres. In the valleys, and lower sides of the
                    hills, about 20,000 acres are appropriated to vineyards and gardens. The
                    district is every year deficient in corn, and receives supplies from its
                    neighbourhood, although the cultivation of potatoes, of maize, and of buckwheat,
                    is extensive, and supplies substitutes for wheat, rye, and barley. The chief
                    agricultural products which exceed the demands of the population are butter,
                    hemp, tobacco, flax, and on the southern border, towards Italy, some silk.</p>
                <p>the country is rich in minerals, but that branch of industry is languishingly
                    pursued, The mines yield gold about 200 ounces, silver 16,000 ounces, and some
                    iron, lead, calamine, and much rock-salt. Some iron and sheet wares are
                    exported, as well as wine, tar, pitch, horses, cheese, and butter, chiefly to
                    Italy. From the poverty of the country, the emigration is very great; and in
                    every part of Europe the natives of it are to be seen, who, after successful
                    wanderings, return to enjoy the proceeds of their industry and parsimony in
                    their native land. The Tyrol has some privileges beyond the other portions of
                    the Austrian states. The deputies form an assembly of four orders, the clergy,
                    the nobles, the burghers, and the peasantry, being the only part where the
                    latter class have representatives. The power of the states is however very
                    inconsiderable, being limited to the distribution of the taxes imposed on the
                    province among the several subdivisions of it, and to the privilege of
                    petitioning and remonstrating.</p>
