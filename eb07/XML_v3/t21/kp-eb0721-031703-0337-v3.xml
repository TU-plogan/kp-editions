                    painting of all the Lombard school, and the best colourist of all the moderns,
                    was born at Cadore, in the province of Friuli, in the state of Venice, in 1477,
                    or in 1480 according to Vasari and Sandrart. His parents sent him at ten years
                    of age to one of his uncles at Venice, who, finding that he had an inclination
                    to painting, put him to the school of Giovanni Bellino. But as soon as Titian
                    had seen the works of Giorgione, whose manner appeared to him abundantly more
                    elegant and less constrained than that of Bellino, he determined to quit the
                    style to which he had so long been accustomed, and to pursue the other, that
                    recommended itself to him by having more force, more relief, more nature, and
                    more truth. Some authors affirm that he placed himself as a disciple with
                    Giorgione, yet others only say that he cultivated an intimacy with him; but it
                    is undoubtedly certain that he studied with that great master, that he learned
                    his method of blending and uniting the colours, and practised his manner so
                    effectually that several of the paintings of Titian were taken for the
                    performances of Giorgione; and his success then inspired that artist with an
                    invincible jealousy of Titian, which broke off their connection for ever
                    after.</p><p>the reputation of Titian rose continually; every new work contributed to extend
                    his fame through all Europe, and he was considered as the principal ornament of
                    the age in which he flourished. And yet Sandrart observes, that amidst all his
                    applause and constant employment at Venice, his income and fortune were
                    inconsiderable; and that he was more remarkable for the extensiveness of his
                    talents, than for the affluence of his circumstances. But when his merit was
                    made known to the emperor Charles V., that monarch knew how to set a just value
                    on his superior abilities; he enriched him by repeated bounties, allowed him a
                    considerable pension, conferred on him the honour of knighthood, and, what was
                    still more, honoured him with his friendship. Titian painted the portrait of
                    that benefactor <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=338" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0338-0318"/>several times; and it is recorded by Sandrart,
                    that one day while the emperor was sitting for his picture, a pencil happening
                    to drop from the painter, he stooped, took it up, and returned it; obligingly
                    answering to the modest apology of the artist (who blushed at the condescension
                    of so great a monarch), that the merit of a Titian was worthy of the attendance
                    of an emperor.</p><p>It cannot be truly affirmed that Titian equalled in design the great masters of
                    the Roman school; but he always took care to dispose his figures in such
                    attitudes as showed the most beautiful parts of the body. His taste in designing
                    men was not generally so correct or elegant as it appeared in his boys and
                    female figures; but his colouring had all the look of real flesh; his figures
                    breathe. He was not so bold as Giorgione, but in tenderness and delicacy he
                    proved himself much superior to him and all other artists. The expression of the
                    passions was not his excellence, though even in that respect many of his figures
                    merited the justest commendation; but he always gave his figures an air of case
                    and dignity. His landscapes are universally allowed to be unequalled, whether we
                    consider the forms of his trees, the grand ideas of nature which appear in his
                    scenery, or his distances, which agreeably delude and delight the eye of every
                    observer; and they are executed with a light, tender, and mellow pencil. He
                    learned from nature the harmony of colours, and his tints seem astonishing, not
                    only for their force, but their sweetness; and in that respect his colouring is
                    accounted the standard of excellence to all professors of the art. He was of so
                    happy a constitution, that he was never ill till the year 1576, when he died of
                    the plague, at the age of ninety-six or ninety-nine. His disciples were Paulo
                    Veronese, Giacomo Tintoret, Giacomo de Porte Bassano, and his sons.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
