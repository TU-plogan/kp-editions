                <p><label type="entry">TUSCANY</label>, ' a grand duchy in Italy, said to have
                    derived the name from a King Tuscus, who in remote ages ruled Etruria. It
                    extends in north latitude from 42° 5' 20” to 44° 31' 10'', and in east longitude
                    from 9° 32' 25’ to 11° 4' 35". It is bounded on the north-west by Lucca and
                    Modena; on the north-east, east, and south-east, by the states of the church;
                    and on the south-west and west by the Mediterranean Sea. Besides what is
                    contained within these boundaries, its territory includes, on the north, the
                    vicariate of Pietra Santa, surrounded by the dominions of Modena, Parma, Genoa,
                    and Lucca. It also possesses the islands of Elba, Pianosa, Palmajola, Gorgona,
                    Giglio, Montechristo, Melora, Formiche, and Gianuti. It comprehends 8494 square
                    miles, or about 5,500,000 acres. It is divided into five departments:</p>
                <p>Departments. Cities. Towns. Villages. Inhabitants. Florence 12 55 958 596,258</p>
                <p>Pisa 5 19 537 295,649</p>
                <p>Sienna 6 22 212 128,095</p>
                <p>Aretino 10 32 596 201,292</p>
                <p>Groseto 3 6 187 53,736</p>
                <p>36 134 2517 1,275,030</p>
                <p>By a later enumeration, in 1833, the whole number of inhabitants was found to be
                    1,320,500. They all adhere to the Roman Catholic church, with the exception of
                    9300 Jews, mostly in Leghorn, who are fully tolerated, and a few German,
                    English, and other Protestants, in the commercial places. The ecclesiastical
                    establishment is numerous and expensive, there being three archbishops, 16
                    bishops, and 10,000 secular clergy, with 96 monasteries and 67 nunneries, w hose
                    members are 6750. The whole revenue of the church, including the regular and the
                    secular, is estimated to amount to a very large sum.</p>
                <p>The cities of Tuscany, of more than 10,000 inhabitants, are the following:</p>
                <p>Cities. Population. Cities. Population.</p>
                <p>Florence 78,900 Pisa 20,000</p>
                <p>Leghorn 50,550 Patro 10,000</p>
                <p>Sienna. 24,500</p>
                <p>The Apennine Mountains cover about one third of the duchy, entering it at the
                    north-west part, and extending into the papal dominions, throwing out various
                    branches. The loftiest points of the range are the Boscolengo, 4178 feet in
                    height; the top of Vernina, 3914 feet; the top of Sasso-Eismore, 3798 feet; and
                    Monte Raticoa del Pietramala, 2719 feet The Vale of Arno, which comprehends one
                    sixth of the duchy, is a basin formed by the mountains; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=462" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0462-0432"
                    />and of this vale Florence is nearly in the centre. While the upper part is
                    narrow, its breadth extends as it approaches the sea, where it forms a wide and
                    level plain, highly unfavourable to the health of the inhabitants. This
                    district, however, called the Maremma, is very fruitful in grass, and feeds
                    abundance of cattle. The river Arno, the chief stream, which receives most of
                    the others, is navigable for boats to Florence; but its chief utility is of a
                    very different kind, and it is diverted into hundreds of channels, for the
                    purpose of watering the fields and gardens. The climate is as different as the
                    face of the country. The Vale of Arno, which includes most of the department of
                    Florence, though only one fourth of the extent, contains half the inhabitants of
                    the duchy, and is generally healthy, and the weather mild. On the mountains the
                    snow lies many weeks, and the cold is severe. In the marshy districts, which
                    comprehend nearly one half of the extent, the fevers are constant, and it is
                    only in winter that the herdsmen are induced to resort to them.</p>
                <p>In the Vale of Arno the land is admirably cultivated. It is commonly divided into
                    small tenements, from four to ten acres each; eight or ten of which combine to
                    keep a team of oxen among them, and each has commonly a small horse and some
                    cows, besides a few calves. They are on the Metayer system, paying rent by a
                    portion (commonly one half) of the produce. The corn chiefly consists of wheat,
                    but barley and oats are extensively grown on the Apennines; in some parts a
                    large quantity of maize, and in others of rice; and besides these, pease and
                    beans of various kinds. Chestnuts are used as a substitute for bread by the
                    greater part of the rural inhabitants. From 800,000 to 1,000,000 bushels of this
                    food are computed to be annually obtained and consumed. In years of average
                    productiveness, the corn raised is about equal to the consumption; but in
                    deficient seasons, wheat is required, which Leghorn can commonly supply by
                    importations from the Black Sea and the Sea of Azoph. The unhealthy marshes feed
                    about 400,000 sheep, 30,000 horses, and a multitude of cows and goats. Fruits
                    are abundant, and citrons, pomegranates, figs, and almonds are articles of
                    export. An ample supply of culinary vegetables is always raised. Large
                    quantities of both red and white wine are made; and though not much esteemed by
                    foreigners, some of the best of the former is exported, mostly in flasks. Olive
                    oil is an extensive object of industry. Much of it is converted into soap or
                    consumed at home; but that of the best quality is exported to distant countries,
                    it is said to the amount of more than 700,000 gallons. The whole of the silk
                    produced does not exceed 200,000 pounds weight, and it is all consumed at home
                    in manufactures. Some flax is raised; but that used for making the finest linen
                    is imported from foreign countries. The breed of sheep has been of late years
                    increased by crosses with Merinos, and now the wool is of moderate fineness. The
                    greater part is used at home, but some portion is exported.</p>
                <p>The fisheries are carried on extensively on the shores of the continent, as well
                    as from the islands. The tunny fishery has establishments in and near Leghorn
                    and in Elba; while that for anchovies is conducted chiefly from the islands,
                    particularly from Gorgona, the celebrity of whose curing is known in all parts
                    of the world.</p>
                <p>There is a variety of manufactures, but they are chiefly carried on at Florence
                    or Leghorn. One which employs many hands, that of straw-plait for hats, is
                    indeed dispersed in all the villages. Cloth of linen and woollen, silks of
                    different kinds, hosiery, hats, and carpets, and some ironmongery, are made for
                    home use. The chief manufacture for foreign trade is paper, which employs 80
                    mills. There are skilful makers of soap, perfumery, essences, porcelain, coral
                    articles, lamps, glass, alum, vitriol, Florentine wax, marble and alabaster
                    figures, and carriages. These, with the products of agriculture, form the trade
                    of Leghorn, and enable the duchy to procure from foreign countries the several
                    articles which they need.</p>
                <p>The revenues of the duchy arise partly from a land-tax, partly from taxes on
                    exports, from stamps, from a lottery, from farming tobacco, from the mines and
                    salt-works, and the public domains. They amount to 16,000,000 francs. The
                    expenditure, which is 100,000 francs less, defrays the communal and departmental
                    expense of the poor, of hospitals, bridges, and roads, as well as of the
                    military, civil, and judicial departments. The national debt is in a gradual
                    course of extinction, having, since the peace, been reduced from L.5,000,000 to
                    L.1,500,000 sterling. The army consists of 5500 men, besides a militia, which
                    can be called out when it is wanted. The naval force is three corvettes and two
                    gun-boats.</p>
                <p>The government is an hereditary unmixed monarchy, in a junior branch of the
                    imperial house of Austria; and after the death of Maria Louisa, the widow of
                    Bonaparte, the duchy of Lucca will be united with Tuscany.</p>
                <p>After the fall of the western Roman empire, in 476, the Ostrogoths obtained
                    dominion over Tuscany. They were succeeded by the Greeks for a short time, and
                    afterwards by the Lombards. It then assumed its present name, having before been
                    generally called Etruria; and was constituted a feudal dukedom under the supreme
                    government of the kings of Lombardy. When Charlemagne established his empire,
                    Tuscany was ruled as one of its provinces. Under Louis the Pious, it was divided
                    into several districts, under the authority of nobles appointed by him. Some of
                    these called themselves margraves and some dukes, but all of them managed to
                    render the dignity hereditary in their several families. In 1160 the emperor
                    Frederick the First obtained the whole of Tuscany by purchase from the Guelphs,
                    who were then dukes of Bavaria. The cities on this occasion strove to obtain
                    independence. Florence, the capital, which assumed the lead, combined with
                    several other cities against the authority of the empire; but Pisa, with a few
                    other cities, adhered to that authority, and in 1197 formed a league to maintain
                    it. These opposite leagues gave rise to civil wars between the two parties
                    called the Guelphs and Gibbelines, by which Tuscany was wasted during nearly 300
                    years. Sienna had become an independent and flourishing state from the middle of
                    the thirteenth century, but the theatre of contests between the nobles and the
                    citizens. Similar contests arose in Florence, where the family of the Medici,
                    who had gained vast wealth by trade chiefly with the eastern countries, obtained
                    the supreme authority in 1434, and maintained it during three· centuries.
                    Florence subdued Pisa in 1509, and Sienna in 1557. This was the period when
                    Florence established itself as the nurse of literature and of the fine arts, and
                    collected within its territory the greatest men of the age. Tuscany continued
                    under the power of the family of the Medici till 1737, with the name of a
                    dukedom. Giovanni Gasto de’ Medici then dying without heirs, was, in consequence
                    of a settlement by Cosmo de’ Medici in 1569, succeeded by Francis duke of
                    Lorraine, who afterwards became emperor of Germany. Tuscany was then governed by
                    the house of Austria, till, in the revolutionary war of France, it was seized by
                    that power, and received from Bonaparte the rank of a kingdom, with its ancient
                    name Etruria. This settlement was but temporary, to favour a delusive agreement
                    with the king of Spain, whose daughter was promised the sovereignty; and at
                    length, when Bonaparte fell, it was restored to the family of Austria, who
                    continue to rule it. Tuscany has been celebrated for the illustrious men which
                    it has produced, particularly, besides the Medici, Dante, Petrarca, Galileo,
                    Macchiavelli, Leonardo da Vinci, and Michel Angelo.</p>
