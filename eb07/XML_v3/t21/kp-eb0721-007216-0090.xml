                    celebrated prince and conqueror, was born in 1335, in the village of Kesch,
                    belonging to the ancient Sogdiana. His origin is obscurely known, some writers
                    describing him as of royal blood, others as the son of a shepherd. It is however
                    evident that he chiefly owed his elevation to his talents and bravery. At the
                    age of twenty-five he attained the highest dignities, with surprising courage,
                    and an ambition astonishing to all the world. Endeavouring to perfect the great
                    talents which he had received from nature, he spent nine years in different
                    countries, where his strong sense and elevated genius appeared in councils and
                    assemblies, while his intrepidity and valour, whether in personal combats or
                    pitched battles, drew upon him the admiration of all mankind. He made himself
                    master of the three empires of Jagatay Khan, Tushi Khan, and Hulaku Khan; so
                    that his power, riches, and <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=91" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0091-0073"/>magnificence, were immense. Of his grandeur vast monuments remain in the
                    cities, towns, castles, and walls, which he built; in the rivers and canals
                    which he dug, as well as the bridges, gardens, palaces, hospitals, mosques, and
                    monasteries, which he erected in divers parts of Asia, in so great a number,
                    that a king might be accounted very powerful and magnificent who should have
                    employed thirty-six years only in building the great edifices which Timur caused
                    to be founded. He undertook the conquest of India, and haying obtained
                    possession of Delhi, he became master of the immense treasures of the Mogul
                    empire. He afterwards invaded Syria, and took Damascus; and Bagdad having
                    attempted to throw off his yoke, he put many thousands of the inhabitants to the
                    sword, and delivered the city to the rapacity of his soldiers. In Bajazet,
                    emperor of the Turks, he found a formidable antagonist. In 1402 they engaged on
                    the plains of Ancyra; and in a battle which lasted for three days, the emperor
                    was defeated and taken prisoner. According to the common account, the victor
                    confined him in an iron cage. Tamerlane died on the 1st of April 1405, in the
                    seventieth year of his age. When he found death approaching, he sent for his
                    principal officers, declared his grandson his heir, and made them swear to
                    execute his will. Having recommended brotherly love and concord to the princes
                    his children, he ordered one of the doctors to read the Koran at his bed head,
                    and often repeat the unity of God. At night he several times made profession of
                    his belief, “that there is no other God than God,” and then expired.</p><p>Timur, according to the historian Arabshâh, was in his person very corpulent and
                    tall. He had a large head, with an ample forehead. His countenance was
                    agreeable, and his complexion fair. He wore a long beard, was very strong and
                    well limbed; had broad shoulders, thick fingers, and long legs. His constitution
                    was amazingly vigorous; but he was maimed in one hand, and lame of the right
                    side. His eyes appeared full of fire; his voice was loud and piercing; he feared
                    nothing; and when far advanced in years, his understanding was sound and
                    perfect, his body vigorous and robust, his mind constant and unshaken like a
                    rock. He was surprisingly happy in his conjectures; vigilant, active, and
                    unshaken in his resolutions. He took great delight in reading history, and was
                    well versed in the state of countries, provinces, and cities. He was
                    penetrating, subtle, close, and dissembling; just by inclination, liberal from
                    disposition; but ambition had in a great measure extinguished his humanity; war
                    had familiarized him to blood; and his religious zeal had inspired him with the
                    most cruel, implacable, and pernicious fanaticism.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
