                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">TOBOLSK</label>, the name of one of the two great governments
                    into which Asiatic Russia is divided, being the western division of that immense
                    territory. Irkoutsk is the eastern division. Tobolsk is bounded on the west by
                    the Oural chain of mountains, which separates it from European Russia; on the
                    north by the Northern Ocean, the coast, broken by many deep bays, extending from
                    the mouth of the Obi to that of the Olenek. It is separated from Chinese and
                    Independent Tartary by an extensive frontier, partly of mountains and partly of
                    desert plains; and from the contiguous territory of the Irkoutsk by no very
                    definite boundary. Within the Bounds of this government are included three
                    extensive districts, which are watered by the great rivers, the Obi, the
                    Irtysch, and the Yenisei, which include the most cultivated parts of Siberia.
                    But the country, on the whole, is far from productive. From the northern shore
                    of the Frozen Ocean, as far as latitude 58° north, it presents one uniform
                    aspect of the most dismal sterility, with only a few pines and stunted shrubs,
                    or bare moss; and a great portion of the southern parts consists of steppes or
                    plains, covered with saline lakes or marshes. Some of these however, as the
                    steppe of Barabinski towards the east, are covered with the most luxuriant
                    pasturage, and would be susceptible of high cultivation, if the inhabitants had
                    skill and industry. The agricultural districts are those on the west, on the
                    Tobol and its tributaries, which in the lower part of their course yield most
                    luxuriant crops; also in the east, the middle parts of the Yenisei and Obi. The
                    rivers in those parts of Siberia abound in fish, which, notwithstanding the
                    indolence of the inhabitants, has become a considerable article of traffic. The
                    mountains on its western and southern frontier abound in mineral wealth. The
                    wastes and forests are filled with innumerable wild animals, many of which are
                    rendered valuable by their furs. But the country still labours under natural
                    disadvantages, which render its communications difficult, and the transmission
                    of its surplus produce to the proper market expensive. Its northern shores are
                    inaccessible to traffic; and its vast rivers, taking their course to that ocean,
                    lead only to the seats of poverty and barbarism. By the census of 1801, its
                    inhabitants amounted to 622,422. These are composed of Mongols, Ostiaks,
                    Tschuwashes, Bucharians, Tungouses, Yakoutes, Samoiedes, besides 20,000 Cossacs,
                    and several other tribes of wandering Tartars.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">TobolsK,</hi> the capital of the above government, and of
                    all Asiatic Russia, is a large city, and is situated at the confluence of the
                    river Irtysch with the Tobol. It was originally, in 1587, a wooden fort, which
                    was burned to the ground in 1643, and in its stead was erected the present city,
                    which is composed of two parts, the high and the low town; the former built on
                    an elevated ridge running parallel to the Irtysch at a little distance, while
                    the latter fills the level space between it and the river. The high town
                    contains the residence of the governor, the tribunals, public offices, and the
                    magazine of foreign merchandise. These, along with two churches and a convent,
                    are built of stone; the remainder are of wood. The elevated situation of the
                    town, the whiteness of the buildings, and the gilded cupolas, give it a fine
                    appearance from a distance. There was formerly the Kremlin, built of stone, and
                    flanked with towers, now gone to ruin; while to the south of it is the great
                    market-square, enclosed by atone buildings, forming two stories of merchants’
                    shops. This part of the town, from its elevation, is secured from the risk of
                    inundations; but seldom a year passes without the low town being overflowed.
                    This may be considered a sort of suburb, and is built entirely of wood; and it
                    is connected with another large suburb, formerly inhabited by Tartars, who have
                    been removed to another and a separate quarter. The crowded manner in which they
                    built their houses renders them extremely liable to fire. These Tartars consist
                    of the original inhabitants, mixed with some Bucharians. The other residents are
                    descended from exiles sent thither by the Russian government. The largest colony
                    ever transported thither consisted of Swedish prisoners taken at the battle of
                    Pultawa, who, being much better informed and more polished than the European
                    Russians, greatly improved the Siberian society of Tobolsk, by opening
                    seminaries of education, in which were taught ancient and modern languages,
                    geography, mathematics, and drawing. Provisions are extremely cheap in this
                    city; and the neighbouring woods and rivers afford the finest hunting and
                    fishing in the world. Society and manners are also greatly improved, so as,
                    according to Dr Clarke, to equal these in any other Russian city. Tobolsk is the
                    commercial emporium of Siberia, in which centres all the trade that is carried
                    on in this quarter. The most important brandi of it is that which traverses an
                    immense <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=341"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0341-0321"/>extent of land and river carriage between European
                    Russia and China. The merchants from Europe arrive in spring, and return with
                    the produce of the east at the end of summer to Moscow and St Petersburg; and
                    those from Tartary and Bucharia arrive in the beginning of winter, which they
                    spend at Tobolsk, and return in spring. All the furs collected as tribute from
                    the tribes who wander over the immense desert of Siberia are brought to Tobolsk,
                    in which are large magazines for depositing these various goods. Population
