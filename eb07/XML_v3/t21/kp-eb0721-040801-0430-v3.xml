                <p><label type="entry">TUNQUIN, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Tonquin</hi></label>, a
                    large kingdom of India beyond the Ganges, bordering on the Chinese provinces of
                    Quangsee and Yunan, and separating that empire from Cochin-China and Cambodia.
                    It is situated between the seventeenth and twenty-third degrees of north
                    latitude. It is bounded on the east by the Gulf of Tunquin, and on the west by
                    Laos, Lactho, and part of the province of Yunan in China. This country is of an
                    extremely diversified surface. The districts to the north and west, towards
                    China, are wild and mountainous, with no very distinct boundary; and the breezes
                    from these heights, and towards the sea, always preserve a tolerable degree of
                    coolness. Mountains, extending from east to west, separate Tunquin into two
                    divisions, of which the northern is considerably larger than the southern. A
                    prolongation of these ridges separates Lactho from Laos, and others separate
                    Tunquin from Cochin-China. These mountains are of great elevation, and many of
                    them terminate in sharp peaks. The central part of the country consists of a
                    vast alluvial plain traversed by numerous rivers, chiefly tributaries to the
                    great river called Saigong, which flows through the whole breadth of Tunquin,
                    and on which all the principal towns are situated. The seasons or monsoons are
                    here, as in other tropical countries, divided into wet and dry. The rains begin
                    in May and end in August, and are accompanied with thunder loud and terrific.
                    There are few countries better supplied with water than Tunquin and the lower
                    parts of Cochin-China. The country of Tunquin is watered by above fifty rivers
                    that flow towards the sea, several of which, by their union, form the large
                    stream which passes Backing. This river, which was navigable about 150 years
                    ago, when Dutch vessels ascended the stream to within fifteen leagues of
                    Backing, has now thrown up many islands, and its mouth is so obstructed by a bar
                    of sand, that the Chinese junks which trade to this country can no longer ascend
                    the stream. The country is inundated and rendered fertile by the tropical rains,
                    and thus yields ample crops of rice and other productions. Potatoes, yams, and
                    other roots, furnish also a copious supply of subsistence. The usual tropical
                    fruits abound, such as mangoes, lemons, cocoa-nuts, ananas; and the most
                    delicious oranges, as also the peach, the plum, the pomegranate, and the citron,
                    are produced. The tea-plant is almost as common as in China, but not being
                    attended with the same care, is not so valuable. The areca, the bctel, the
                    indigo, the sugar-cane, also grow in these fertile plains. Vines have been
                    planted, but the grapes do not come to maturity. Mulberry trees are plentiful,
                    and supply food for silk-worms. The country also contains much large timber fit
                    for building; beautiful cabinet woods, such as eigle wood, cocoa-nut, and other
                    palms, bamboos, and rattans. There are mines of various metals; and iron ore is
                    procured in a state of great purity. It is also asserted that there are
                    tin-mines in the mountainous tract towards China, the working of which is
                    prohibited. Particles of gold are found in many of the Tunquin rivers, and salt
                    and saltpetre are in great plenty and of good quality.</p>
                <p>Among the wild animals to which the woods afford ample cover, are found the
                    elephant, which is the property of the monarch; and the buffalo, which is
                    employed for agricultural purposes. Neither the sheep, nor the ass, nor the
                    hare, nor the camel, is known; but the hog and the goat are abundant. The horses
                    are a contemptible breed. The rhinoceros is occasionally discovered, and tigers
                    of the largest size are found. There arc bears of a diminutive species, and deer
                    and monkeys of all sorts. The country is much infested with rats, and with
                    reptiles and insects, some venomous, others innocuous. Fish are remarkably
                    plentiful, and furnish the inhabitants with a greater supply of food than they
                    derive from the terrestrial animals. In addition to the common sorts of fish,
                    there are turtles, tortoises, crabs, shell-fish, and moluseas, the substance of
                    which is gelatinous, and greatly relished by the Chincse, however distasteful to
                    European palates. Ducks and poultry are numerous, and very cheap.</p>
                <p>The trade of Tunquin can hardly be described as very considerable, and it is
                    chiefly carried on by merchants from China and Siam. The chief manufactures to
                    be obtained at Tunquin are silks and lackered ware. The silks are both raw and
                    wrought; they are very beautiful and cheap, while the lackered ware is scarcely
                    inferior to that of Japan. Gold may also be obtained in considerable quantity.
                    Other articles of export are earthenware, drugs, Chinese paper, dyeing woods,
                    musk, rhubarb, tortoise-shell, ginger, cassia, ebony, ivory, sugar, arid
                    molasses. In the seventeenth century the Portuguese, Dutch, English, and French,
                    had factories in Tunquin; but they have been long since abandoned. At present
                    the Chinese experience greater favour than any other nation, and are allowed to
                    ascend the rivers; a privilege also granted to the Portuguese at Macao; but
                    neither are allowed to establish factories on shore. In Tunquin there are
                    reckoned to be twelve principal cities; namely, Backing, or Keeho, said to
                    contain 40,000 inhabitants; Hanring, 15,000 to 20,000; Tranhac, 10,000 to
                    15,000; Causang, 7000 to 8000; Vihoang, a town on the river that passes through
                    Tunquin, up to which the Chinese junks can ascend; Hunnam, a town on the same
                    river, containing about 5000 inhabitants. There are, besides, six other towns
                    containing from 6000 to 7000 souls.</p>
                <p>Tunquin is divided into ten districts, of which the central district, named
                    Xunam, is by far the most populous, consisting of a vast plain, watered by
                    numerous navigable streams, and in the density of its population resembling a
                    Chinese province. We have no data for any accurate estimate of the population of
                    the country. It has been computed by a missionary at eighteen millions; but this
                    is probably far beyond the truth. One tenth of the inhabitants are supposed,
                    like the Chinese, to live constantly on the water. The Tunquinese, deriving
                    their origin from the Chinese, are distinguished by a general resemblance to
                    them in their language and manners. Their language is a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=431" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0431-0409"
                    />modified dialect of the Chinese, but so greatly changed and corrupted, that
                    the spoken language is now wholly unintelligible to a native of China, though
                    the written character is understood, being the same in both countries. Printing
                    is known in Tunquin, but the people generally are rude and uninformed; such
                    limited knowledge as they possess being confined to the mandarins. Their
                    printing is of the rudest kind, their types being of wood, and not moveable; but
                    being rather a mode of stereotype, and every additional book requiring new
                    plates and characters, few are printed, and these have in general a reference to
                    religion and law. The historical works are inaccurate; those on moral subjects
                    are mostly translations from Chinese works, or commentaries on them; and the
                    sciences have remained stationary for nearly a thousand years. The people
                    resemble the Chinese in their shape and features; but the additional practice
                    which they have adopted of blacking their teeth, gives them a hideous
                    appearance. The blackness of the teeth is, however, considered as singularly
                    ornamental, and takes -place generally at the age of sixteen or seventeen. Like
                    the Chinese, they allow their nails to grow to an immoderate length. They differ
                    however from the Chinese in their laborious habits, being extremely indolent,
                    and not easily roused to any vigorous exertion; and their task being
                    accomplished, they soon relapse into their former state of sloth and repose.
                    They are remarkably coarse in their mode of eating, using for food what among
                    other nations is rejected with disgust. Not only are particular parts of the
                    rhinoceros and the elephant eaten, but grasshoppers, monkeys, horses, and dogs,
                    with mountain rats, lizards, and some kinds of worms and snakes. They refuse the
                    milk of animals in any shape, holding it in extreme aversion. They have the same
                    repugnance to fresh eggs. They eat all manner of odious reptiles and noxious
                    animals, and prefer drinking water in a tepid state. Their laws and institutions
                    bear all the marks of a rude and barbarous people. Punishments are decreed
                    against all sorts of crimes with particular minuteness, but with little
                    discrimination, being not at all proportioned to the nature of the offence;
                    those against manners being more rigorously punished than crimes dangerous to
                    society. There is no proper security for natural rights; nor is life and
                    property protected against the despotic rule of the emperor. It is dangerous,
                    for example, to excel in any profession of art, as the talents of the artificer
                    are immediately put in requisition to work gratis for the emperor, or the
                    governor of a province, or even any common mandarin. They are restrained in many
                    cases by a species of sumptuary laws. The bulk of the people are not allowed to
                    build their houses of stone, or more than one story high; and the larger
                    edifices, such as temples and palaces, are generally constructed of wood, or of
                    wood and brick mixed. The roads are generally very bad, there being only one of
                    a superior description from Backing, the capital of Tunquin, to the capital of
                    Cochin-China, a distance of nearly 500 miles.</p>
                <p>Their religion is a modification of the Buddhist system, nearly resembling that
                    which prevails in China, but blended with many local and peculiar superstitions.
                    The higher classes are described as adherents of Confucius, who submit to the
                    worship of images and other ceremonies through deference to public opinion. Some
                    of the more barbarous tribes worship the tiger and the dog. To the first, human
                    flesh is offered, and other disgusting oblations to the latter. Traces of the
                    same worship are to be found among the mountaineers on the borders of lndia, as
                    well as among the Indo-Chinese nations.</p>
                <p>The Christian religion was first introduced by the Portuguese about the beginning
                    of the seventeenth century, and subsequently by the French, while they had
                    commercial establishments in the country. At an early period the Jesuits sent
                    missionaries into the country, and had made considerable progress when they were
                    expelled. During the eighteenth century, the exercise of the Christian religion
                    was generally prohibited, and at particular periods persecuted with the greatest
                    cruelty. In Inter times, the missionaries have suffered more from the mandarins
                    and inferior officers than from the emperor.</p>
                <p>Tunquin, along with Cochin-China, Cambodia, and Siam-pa, are recorded to have
                    anciently formed part of the Chinese empire; but on the Mogul invasion of China
                    from Tartary in the thirteenth century, the Chinese governors of Tartary took
                    that opportunity to throw off the badge of dependence. In this manner several
                    distinct kingdoms were created, the rulers of which continued to acknowledge for
                    many years a nominal subjection to the authority of China. The Tunquinese rulers
                    gradually assumed a greater degree of independence, and, about 1553, are said to
                    have extended their dominion over Cochin-China. The subsequent history of this
                    country is confused and obscure, consisting of a series of assassinations and
                    revolts, und a perpetual fluctuation of boundaries. A revolution commenced about
                    the year 1774; and it terminated after a sanguinary warfare of twenty-eight
                    years, leaving the empire as it at present exists. Tunquin was finally conquered
                    in 1800 by the emperor of Cochin-China, and has ever since continued under the
                    delegated authority of that sovereign. (<hi rend="smallcaps">f</hi><hi
