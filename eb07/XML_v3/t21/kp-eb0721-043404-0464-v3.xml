                    and pious martyr, was born during the latter part of the fifteenth century. He
                    is said, but apparently without foundation, to have been the grandson of Hugh,
                    Lord Tyndale; who having been engaged in the civil wars between the houses of
                    York and Lancaster, lost his honours, together with his estate in
                    Northumberland, and, under the borrow ed name of Hutchins, sought a place of
                    refuge in Gloucestershire, where he retrieved his fortune by marrying the
                    daughter and sole heiress of Hunt of Hunt’s Court. William Tyndale having been
                    early and well initiated in learning, was sent to Oxford, where he was entered
                    of Magdalen Hall. He not only acquired a knowledge of the Latin, but even of the
                    Greek language, which at that period was but little understood in England. He
                    read the Greek Testament to the students of Magdalen College as well as Magdalen
                    Ilall. After having taken his degree in arts, he is said to have passed some
                    time in the university of Cambridge. On the 11th of March 1502, deacon’s orders
                    were conferred upon him by a suffragan of Warham bishop of London, in the church
                    belonging to the priory of St Bartholomew in Smithfield. He was ordained priest
                    to the nunnery of Lambley, in the diocese of Carlisle; and in 1508 he became a
                    friar in the monastery of the Minorites at Greenwich. Even at this period of his
                    life, he appears to have been impressed with the great importance of presenting
                    to the people the sacred Scriptures in their mother tongue; and he had commenced
                    his version of the New Testament so early as the year 1502. He was afterwards
                    engaged as a tutor and chaplain in the family of Sir Jolm Welch, a knight of
                    Gloucestershire, who kept a hospitable table, and was frequently visited by the
                    neighbouring prelates and other clergy. The careful and anxious study of the New
                    Testament had prepared Tyndale for receiving the doctrines of the reformation.
                    As he found it unsale to prosecute his pious labours in his own country, he
                    sailed for Hamburg in 1523, and from that port proceeded to Wittemberg, at that
                    time the residence of Luther. There he completed his version of the New
                    Testament. John Fryth and William Roy, who both suffered martyrdom, lent their
                    aid as his amanuenses. “One edition,” says Mr Offor, “probably of three
                    thousand, was prepared for general circulation: this was quickly followed by a
                    more elegant edition in quarto, with glosses, commenced at Cologne in 1526, und
                    finished at Worms or Wittemberg. The type, cuts, and ornaments of both these
                    books are those used by the German printers on the Rhine.” This version has
                    recently been reprinted under the superintendence of Mr Offor, who has prefixed
                    a memoir of his life and writings. Lond. 1836, 8vo. He likewise undertook a
                    translation of the Old Testament, and having completed his version of the first
                    books in 1529, he began to publish them in separate tracts, ornamented with
                    wood-cuts, and accompanied with notes, which gave no small offence to the
                    bigoted clergy. Having completed the last book of the Pentateuch, be sailed for
                    Hamburg with the view of printing it; but being wrecked on the coast of Holland,
                    be lost his money, bis books, and manuscript. He however continued his journey,
                    and being joined by Coverdale, they again translated the book of Deuteronomy,
                    and, with the assistance of a pious lady named Van Emmerson, printed it in the
                    year 1530. He afterwards translated the book of Jonah. The circulation of the
                    Scriptures in the vulgar tongue excited the utmast alarm in England, where many
                    copies of his version of the New Testament were committed to the flames. The
                    king, the cardinal, and the chancellor, made some ineffectual attempts to induce
                    him to return home. He afterwards fixed his residence at Antwerp; and there one
                    of their emissaries, a miscreant named Henry Phillips, circumvented the worthy
                    and unsuspecting man; and having procured a warrant at Brussels, betrayed his
                    confidence with signal baseness, and delivered him into the hands of the
                    officers. He was committed to prison at Vilvoord, a village between Brussels and
                    Malines. By virtue of a decree made at Augsburg, against what was termed heresy,
                    he was condemned to suffer death; and after having been in custody about a year
                    and a half, he was, in September 1536, conducted to a rising ground near his
                    prison, was first strangled, and his body was then consumed by fire. Tyndale,
                    who was a man of learning as well as talents, appears to have translated the
                    Scriptures from the original tongues; and his pious labours gave a great impulse
                    to the progress of reformation. Of the English language, as written at that
                    period, his own works afford an excellent specimen. In his controversy with Sir
                    Thomas More, he had many advantages over his antagonist. His Works, together
                    with those of Fryth and Barnes, were collected into a large volume. Lond. 1572,
                    fol. Dr Geddes has remarked, that although his translation is far from perfect,
                    “yet few first translations will be found preferable to it. It is astonishing
                    how little obsolete the language of it is, even at this day; and in point of
                    perspicuity and noble simplicity, propriety of idiom, and purity of style, no
                    English version has yet surpassed it.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
