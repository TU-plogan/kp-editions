                <p><label type="entry">TARTARY</label>, a tract of territory in central Asia, of
                    which the limits have never been exactly defined. It is generally understood to
                    embrace that wide space which intervenes between the dominions of Russia and
                    China on the west and east, and which on the south is bounded by the kingdom of
                    Persia and the lofty central mountains of Asia. This vast space was formerly
                    occupied by pastoral tribes, who, united under one great chief, assailed and
                    finally overthrew the Roman empire; and who afterwards, under their great leader
                    Ghenghis Khan, carried their devastations both into Europe and Asia. Central
                    Asia is one vast meadow, extended on a dead level to an almost boundless extent,
                    covered with flocks and herds, and necessarily the habitation of a pastoral
                    people. Such has accordingly been the character of the Tartars from time
                    immemorial; their sole employment being to tend their flocks and herds, and
                    occasionally to hunt the wild animals of the forest; living in tents in the open
                    fields, without towns or villages; delighting in horsemanship, and in all manly
                    and warlike exercises; and having a breed of the finest horses in the world.
                    “The fancy of the poet,” says the Roman historian, “has clothed the pastoral
                    life in the fairest attributes of innocence and peace; but it is the province of
                    history to exhibit a different picture, and to exhibit these shepherds as they
                    truly are, fierce, bloody, savage, and vindictive.” The Tartars were accordingly
                    known in ancient history under the appellation of Scythians, and were admired
                    for their warlike virtues and for the simplicity of their manners, for their
                    hospitality, and their ignorance of money and luxury, by the Greek legislators
                    of Athens and Sparta, whose policy it was to form a community on the same
                    warlike model, where nothing was to be seen but</p>
                <p>Man and steel, the soldier and his sword.</p>
                <p>They were at all times the most formidable enemies of civilized life, and the
                    various inroads into their dominions by the greatest conquerors only ended in
                    disaster and defeat. As light troops, they were most formidable in the ancient
                    wars; and the Persian monarchs, with their well-trained bands, and even
                    Alexander of Macedon, were forced to retreat before their formidable though
                    desultory attacks.</p>
                <p>While Rome retained the vigour and simplicity of her republican institutions, and
                    the iron discipline of her armies, the rude assaults of these barbarians were
                    invariably repelled; but when the warlike habits of the Romans began to be
                    corrupted by the progress of luxury, their attacks were renewed with increased
                    fierceness, and with greater chances of success. Numbers of the first invaders
                    perished in the inroads into the Roman provinces. But these being still
                    reinforced with increasing multitudes, while the vigour of the defence was
                    relaxed, they at length effected permanent conquests; and, under the appellation
                    of Huns, finally extended their ravages over all Italy. The intelligence of
                    their success, and of the riches and beauty of the conquered countries,
                    attracted multitudes from the remote extremities of Asia, and under their
                    repeated assaults the empire of the west was subverted. This event was hastened
                    by the dreadful invasion of Attila, who was characterized as “the sword of God
                    and the destroyer of nations.” On the east the Tartar tribes, under the
                    appellation of Toorks or Turks, from Chinese or Independent Tartary, poured
                    their innumerable hordes on the Persian empire, where they established a dynasty
                    celebrated under the name of the Seljnkian. About the end of the tenth century,
                    they crossed the Euphrates in four divisions under different leaders, and
                    invaded Asia Minor and Syria, of which they conquered and retained possession of
                    the finest provinces. They endured various vicissitudes, and were at one time
                    reduced very low. But being directed by able leaders, they recovered the
                    ascendant; and, their numbers being swelled by the warlike and migratory
                    population which, in the course of long wars, was scattered over those
                    countries, they finally succeeded in overturning the eastern empire, and
                    Constantinople became, and still continues, the seat of their empire. In the
                    twelfth century the Tartar tribes were still more formidable. Their whole power
                    being consolidated under Zingis or Ghenghis Khan, they successively conquered
                    China, Persia, and all central Asia from the Black Sea to eastern Asia. His
                    successors pursued the career of conquest, and added Russia and Poland, with
                    part of Germany. A general panic was now diffused over the whole civilized world
                    by the intelligence of these conquests, and of the ravages committed by these
                    barbarians in the fairest portions of the earth. The great empire of Ghenghis
                    Khan was broken into divisions; but the different chiefs who now reigned were
                    still eager for conquest; and Timur the Tartar, or Tamerlane, having established
                    his dominions over a large and fertile portion of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=101" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0101-0083"
                    />Asia, conquered Persia, where the degenerate chiefs of the race of Ghenghis
                    still bore sway, broke the power of the Turks in Asia Minor, ravaged and
                    conquered India, and in that country established a dynasty which continued till
                    the close of the last century, when every minor authority in that part of Asia
                    was swallowed up by the extending sway of Britain, on whose bounty the great
                    Mogul, the descendant of Ghenghis, is now a humble pensioner. China fell an easy
                    prey to these conquering hordes, and has long been the seat of a Tartar dynasty,
                    having been conquered about the sixteenth century by the Mantchoos, a tribe
                    which issued from the north, near the coasts of the Eastern Ocean. But the
                    rising power of Russia has reduced most of those wandering tribes under her
                    dominion; and the reign of Independent Tartary is now contracted within a narrow
                    span. The progress of civilization, and the improvement of the art of war by the
                    invention of fire-arms, have entirely broken the power of these savage hordes.
                    The Russian cannon now forms a sure barrier against the incursions of the Tartar
                    horse; and under her growing civilization and military power, the fiercest
                    tribes have been taught to tremble and obey. All northern Asia, to the limits of
                    China, and eastward to the Pacific Ocean, has been reduced under the power of
                    Russia; and the narrow space that is now occupied by Independent Tartary is
                    ruled by numerous petty sovereigns, who are often engaged in mutual wars, and
                    can never be again formidable to the civilized states of Europe. On the
                    contrary, the rude tribes of Asia will hardly be able to maintain their ground
                    against the encroaching flood of European civilization or of European arms. The
                    powers of Europe seem now to have imbibed the spirit of conquest which formerly
                    propelled the Asiatic hordes into the seats of European civilization; and the
                    late unsuccessful expedition of the Russians from the west to Khyvah, about 240
                    miles east of the Caspian Sea, and the bold and admirably conducted inroad of
                    the British from the east as far as Candahar and Caubul, are among the fruits of
                    this ambitious policy.</p>
                <p>This extensive country may be divided into Independent Tartary and Chinese
                    Tartary.</p>
                <p>I. Independent Tartary includes that extensive region which stretches from the
                    Caspian Sea, as far cast as the great Himalaya range of mountains, which runs
                    through the centre of Asia, and from which a branch diverges from the main
                    ridge, under the designation of Beloor Taugh, northward, and separates
                    Independent Tartary from the country of Kashgar and from Chinese Tartary. On the
                    south, this country is indistinctly bounded by Persia, and on the north by the
                    provinces of Oufa, Orenburg, and Tobolsk, belonging to Asiatic Russia.
                    Independent Tartary is divided into various states; namely, L Khyvah, which is a
                    stripe on the banks of the Oxus, of which the length does not exceed between 200
                    and 300 miles, and the breadth in no place more than fifty. 2. The kingdom of
                    Bockhara or Bukharia, which is by far the most important both in power and
                    extent. The habitable part of this kingdom is small in proportion to the desert
                    with which it is chiefly surrounded, and which may be considered in a great
                    measure as its boundary. It is divided from Khyvah on the west and north-west;
                    to the north-east stretch vast tracts of desert, thinly sprinkled with the tents
                    of the Toorkoman and other tribes, and only interrupted by the stream of the
                    Jaxartes; on the east it is bounded by Kokaun; and the Oxus, with the mountains
                    from which it flows, may be said to form its southern boundary. The limits of
                    this kingdom are, however, in a state of fluctuation, varying, as is generally
                    the case in the disorderly regions of Asia, with the success of its arms; so
                    that they can hardly be laid down with any precision. 3. The independent state
                    of Kokaun, which is fully 250 miles in length by 150 in breadth, is bounded on
                    the east from Bockhara by a steep and inaccessible chain of mountains, the two
                    countries being divided by the White River; on the south it has the mountainous
                    tract which divides it from Buduckshan and Chitral; on the south-west it is
                    bounded by Kurratageen; on the east and north-east by mountains tributary to
                    China, and inhabited by Kirgeesh and Kuzaks; on the north-west by the district
                    of Tash-kund, with mountains and deserts. South and east of Bockhara lies the
                    large and interesting province of Balk; and about 600 miles east of Kokaun lie
                    the Mahommedan states of Kashgar and Yarkund.</p>
                <p>One of the great peculiarities of Asiatic manners:, well calculated to attract
                    attention, is the division of the population into the two classes of fixed and
                    wandering communities. In the richer countries to the south and east of Asia the
                    inhabitants are mostly stationary, dwelling in fixed habitations, and occupied
                    with trade and agriculture; but the northern and western parts, including
                    Arabia, Persia, a portion of Afghanistan, Balk, and all the country that lies in
                    the same parallel of latitude, as far east as the most civilized parts of China,
                    and on th west including a portion of Poland and Russia, have been occupied by
                    wandering tribes, migrating with the winter and summer in quest of pasture, and
                    having no fixed habitations in towns and villages. This class has been gradually
                    diminishing with the progress of civilization. But in the country we are now
                    describing, the pastoral life is still seen in its original rudeness and
                    simplicity; and in many districte those shepherds discover all the cruelty and
                    ferocity of the Tartar tribes. The original invaders were the Mongoles from the
                    eastern regions bordering on China; but they have been supplanted in their turn
                    by other invaders, and the country is chiefly occupied by the Toorkomans, and
                    the Oosbecks or Usbecks, and other rude tribes. The Toorkomans are divided into
                    other tribes, the three principal of which are, the Tuckch, the Gocklan, and the
                    Yamoot. They occupy the country to the north of the Elburz range of mountains,
                    and of Persia, and are found as far north as Khyvah, all along the shores of the
                    Caspian Sea. They are extremely barbarous and cruel in their manners. They live
                    partly by plunder, and pour down from their deserts upon the cultivated
                    countries around, plundering villages and caravans with every circumstance of
                    atrocious outrage, murdering on the spot the old, the feeble, and the helpless.
                    Those who are fit for labour they carry into slavery. They have depopulated many
                    extensive districts, which but for them would continue fertile and inhabited.
                    The Toorkomans, and most of the tribes in the same quarter, are Mahommedans of
                    the sect of Soonies; the Persians again are Sheahs, and the deadly hatred which
                    prevails between these sects may exasperate the fury of their invaders, and add
                    to their cruelties. On the east, there are other tribes who commit the same
                    ravages. The captives that are carried off are disposed of to slave-merchants,
                    and are by them sold in the great slave-markets of Khyvah and Bockhara. All
                    these tribes are described by Fraser<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Fraser’s Narrative of a Journey into Khorassan, chap.
                    xii.</p></note> as cruel, blood-thirsty, and rapacious, even in their private
                    lives and domestic relations. They set no value whatever on human life; and a
                    word, a look, or some trivial mistake, he observes, is apt to occasion
                    bloodshed. A Toorkoman will put to death his wife, his child, or his servant,
                    for the merest trifle; and if crimes of this sort do not more frequently occur,
                    it is more from considerations of interest than from any regard to the ties of
                    blood or affection. “Even the wars between the tribes,”</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=102"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0721-0102-0084"/>
                <p>observes this judicious writer, “have assumed the same cruel and rapacious
                    character which marks their foreign warfare; avarice has quite overpowered
                    religious zeal; and the unholy practice of selling captives of their own faith
                    is now frequent.”</p>
                <p>The tribe of Tuckch is the most numerous of the Toorkoman tribes, containing
                    40,000 families. They are a treacherous and faithless race, and never suffer an
                    opportunity to escape of plundering even their friends. The Gocklans were
                    formerly powerful, but their power has been broken by adverse events, and they
                    now acknowledge the Persian supremacy. The Yamoot tribe is divided into two
                    parts: the one, amounting to 15,000 families, acknowledges the Persian monarch;
                    the other, amounting to 16,000 families, is subject to Khyvah. All these tribes
                    resemble each other in their customs and manners. They live in tents or portable
                    houses, and frequently change their stations, as pasture becomes scarce, seldom
                    remaining more than five or six days in one place. They encamp in parties of
                    from 30 to 200 families; each party is ruled by its elder, whose advice is taken
                    in all matters affecting the interests of the community, and who adjusts petty
                    disputes; but they have no governors, chiefs, or nobles among them, nor would
                    they endure any one arrogating such superiority. The same spirit of equality
                    prevails in common life, no distinctions of rank being at any time observed, nor
                    any great deference to the claims of age or relationship. Like all rude tribes,
                    the Toorkomans pique themselves on hospitality; but so vitiated have their
                    morals become by the love of plunder, that even this tie is often violated.</p>
                <p>The wealth which they acquire by perfidy and rapacity, they generally invest in
                    such property as camels, horses, valuable swords, arms and armour, women’s
                    ornaments, clothes, jewels of gold or silver, and rich furniture. The women are
                    not concealed, as in Mahommedan countries; nor do they wear veils. Their dress
                    consists of a long loose vest or skirt, with sleeves, which covers the whole
                    person down to the feet, and is open at the breast in front, but buttons or ties
                    close up to the neck. It is made of silk or cotton stuff, red, blue, green,
                    striped red or yellow, checked, or variously coloured. Underneath are drawers of
                    silk or cotton. Their head-dress is a lofty cap with a broad crown, made of
                    light chips of wood or split reeds covered with cloth. With respect to the
                    dresses of the men, those of the poorer class consist of a stout woollen shirt,
                    and a pair of woollen drawers, or a long brown woollen wrapper; but the better
                    classes have generally adopted the common Persian habit. There is much
                    individual variety among those tribes. The Tuckehs have a good deal of the
                    Tartar physiognomy. Many of them are tall, stout, and well made, with scanty
                    beards, small eyes drawn up at the corners, high cheek-bones, and small flat
                    noses; all the true features, in short, of a Tartar face; while others have
                    handsome features, more resembling a European than an Asiatic countenance. The
                    Gocklans also bear traces of a Tartar origin, but less than the Tuckehs, while
                    there are remarkable differences among them, marking the intermixture of
                    different races. The Ya-moot men have less of the Tartar physiognomy than any of
                    the other tribes. Many of them resemble the Persians, and also the Russians, in
                    a certain harsh irregularity of feature which they possess. They are all
                    ferocious and warlike in their habits. Their arms are a spear and sword, in the
                    use of which they are sufficiently dexterous. The sword is generally formed in
                    the curved Persian fashion, and very sharp. They also wear a dagger. Fire-arms
                    are as yet not in general use among them. The Gocklans and Yamoots use bows and
                    arrows, in the use of which they are not nearly so dexterous as their ancestors.
                    These tribes arc all excellent horsemen, and they possess a race of horses which
                    are celebrated all over Asia. They greatly value size and bone, which are
                    indigenous to the country; but figure and blood, borrowed from the Arab breed,
                    much more. Their horses are capable of enduring extraordinary fatigues. When
                    properly trained for a plundering expedition, they will carry their riders
                    without flagging for eight days together, at the rate of from eighty to a
                    hundred miles per day. Those of the best breeds cannot be purchased under L. 150
                    or L.200. For the protection of their flocks they have a breed of very large and
                    fierce dogs, which assist their shepherds in managing their flocks. But though
                    they attend to their flocks, they still delight in plunder, to which they look
                    for riches and extraordinary indulgences; and when they resolve on any
                    expedition, they unite under some leader whose conduct and courage inspire them
                    with confidence; and, sallying from their haunts, they move with astonishing
                    celerity into some of the frontier provinces of Persia. They lie near the gates
                    of the town or village which they have marked out for their prey; and watching
                    in silence until dawn, when the unsuspecting inhabitants begin to issue from the
                    gates to pursue their daily labour, they start from their lurking place, seize
                    all they can catch, murder those who resist, rapidly plunder the houses, and,
                    binding their booty on the cattle, hasten to retreat before the country is
                    alarmed. They massacre the old and infirm; and those who are taken captive to be
                    sold for slaves, they fasten by ropes to their horses, with their arms tied
                    behind their backs; and they drive them on with blows of heavy whips to increase
                    their speed. They have a few manufactures, such as carpets, which they weave of
                    a very beautiful fabric, and which are highly valued, and bring high prices.
                    They also weave cloth of camels’ hair, and coarse woollens chiefly for their own
                    use; and they dispose of butter and cheese, the produce of their flocks.</p>
                <p>A large portion of Independent Tartary, farther to the east of the Caspian, in
                    the neighbourhood of Bockhara, Balk, and Samarcand, countries which lie near the
                    river Oxus, is inhabited almost entirely by the Oosbecks, a people of the widely
                    extended race of the Turk or Toork, but whose original seat is not precisely
                    ascertained. They appear to have come from the north, and to have been tempted
                    from their original and inhospitable abodes by the finer countries on the plains
                    of the Oxus and the Jaxartes. Like the other Turks, they are celebrated all over
                    the east for their fine appearance, which is remarkably contrasted with the
                    Mongoles, Kalmucks, and other Tartar tribes. They are distinguished by broad
                    foreheads, high cheek-bones, thin beards, and small eyes; by a clear and ruddy
                    complexion, and generally by black hair. The women are fair and beautiful. Their
                    dress resembles that of the Toorkomans of the desert. They wear a lofty cap upon
                    the head, with a handkerchief over it. The shirt and trousers, with the gown,
                    are not unlike those of the men. The dress of the latter at Khyvah consists of a
                    shirt and drawers of white cotton cloth, with two or three gowns over them of
                    striped silk stuff, blue, red, and gray, all open at the breast, so that when
                    the girdle is loose the person is very indecorously expelled. A broad-topped
                    sheep-skin is worn upon the head. The khan is hardly to be distinguished by his
                    dress from his subjects; but on grand days he wears a small jewel in his turban,
                    with a gold-embroidered Oosbeck gown over his white shirt and drawers; and the
                    other ensign of royalty which he assumes, is a tuft of gold and jewels upon his
                    horse’s head.</p>
                <p>The Oosbecks at Khyvah are described as a very uncivilized race, gross in their
                    domestic habits, and coarse and disgusting in their food and manner of eating;
                    the khan, his ministers, and almost all his nobles, being fat and un-wcildy,
                    owing to their habits of indolence. There is little distinction between the
                    different ranks of society; the master and servant, the chief and the groom,
                    standing or sitting promiscuously together. In Bockhara, where the Oosbecks
                    constitute the chief portion of the population, along with the Taujicks and
                    Toorkomans, they are represented <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=103" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0103-0085"/>by
                    Fraser as honest, just, sincere, good tempered, generally well disposed, and by
                    no means either cruel or treacherous; rarely quarrelling, and their quarrels
                    rarely stained with blood; nor are they addicted to private and murderous
                    revenge, like most of their neighbours. They are fond of horse-flesh, which they
                    prefer to beef; and by their fondness for the intoxicating drink called mare’s
                    milk, they are often seduced into excess and drunkenness. They are likewise fond
                    of tea. They are the chief inhabitants of Kokaun, and other districts to the
                    east, and are there represented as a fat, fair, and high-complexioned people,
                    extremely quiet, good humoured, and hospitable; very fond of riding, hunting,
                    hawking, and getting drunk on <hi rend="italic">kimmiz,</hi> or mare’s milk. The
                    other wandering tribes who are scattered over this country are also described as
                    peaceable and honest. The Oosbecks who inhabit the desert tracts of the country,
                    live in parties of from two hundred to above one thousand families. These
                    parties have no particular chief, but each is regulated in all its concerns by a
                    bey or beg, who is chosen by common consent, on account of his wealth,
                    character, or abilities. In the larger divisions, the king has a voice in the
                    election of the bey or chief, but in the smaller divisions this is little
                    attended to. These chiefs decide in all disputes which are not of great
                    importance. In serious cases several of them consult together; and if they
                    cannot agree they remit the matter to the cauzee, who is always appointed by the
                    king, and is held in considerable awe. In all the different states, the king or
                    chief is perfectly absolute, the fountain of all authority and power. The only
                    restraint on his will is derived from the influence of religion; the oleemut and
                    heads of religion alone possessing any authority or respect, to which it is
                    necessary for the king to defer. The influence of this body, however, has been
                    of late so much weakened, that some of them have been put to death by the
                    reigning monarch. The priests rank above all classes, civil as well as military.
                    The nobles belonging to the army occupy the second rank. The revenue is
                    collected by the bey in kind; namely, sheep, camels, oxen, and other animals, in
                    the proportion of one in forty. He fixes a price on them, and the tribute is
                    paid in money to a collector sent with another legal officer and ten soldiers to
                    receive it. In order to preserve his control, the king discourages different
                    tribes from living together in the same union; but it is common in the desert to
                    see a variety of tribes mingled together. The tents of the Oosbecks consist of a
                    frame-work of thin laths covered with thick black felt, and these are called
                    kirgahs or black houses. The floors of the rich are spread with carpets and
                    numuds; those of the poor with a blanket or mat of camel’s hair; and a hole in
                    the roof, of open lattice-work, is the only chimney, over which they draw a
                    piece of black felt when it rains. The dress of the Oozbecks in Bockhara
                    consists of the same loose and flowing garments as in most parts of Asia. They
                    were a shirt and drawers, of cotton in summer and of woollen in winter, and over
                    these a silk or woollen wrapping gown, tied round the waist with a girdle; and
                    in winter a sheep’s skin, or a coat of thick felt, in which they wrap
                    themselves. The head-dress is in summer a painted cap of silk, which they call a
                    calpak, and in winter a small cap of broad cloth lined with fur; a checked or
                    white turban is often worn round this, and forms the true national dress.
                    Bandages of cloth rolled round the legs form a rude substitute for stockings; or
                    boots are worn, of brown leather, reaching up to the knee. The dress of the
                    women is very similar to that of the men. They wear boots and silk gloves, and
                    throw over the person a silk sheet, which conceals them from head to foot, a
                    small orifice being left for the eyes. They are fond of ornaments, wearing
                    necklaces of gold beads, with nose-rings and ear-rings. In the country the women
                    wear no veils, but <hi rend="italic">go</hi> about openly as in Europe. The
                    Taujicks are a peaceable class, who are understood to be opposed to the Toorks
                    or Toorkomans, and the Oosbecks, and other wandering hordes, who, under various
                    designations and subdivisions into tribes, form a scanty population, inhabiting
                    chiefly the banks of the Oxus, and the habitable spots scattered through the
                    desert; but they are to be found in greater or smaller numbers, according to the
                    quantity of cultivated land, all over the more fertile and well-watered country
                    to the south and south-east of Bockhara.</p>
                <p>The towns of Tartary are, Khyvah, Ourgunge, Haza-rasp, Zercaun, Pitnuck;
                    Bockhara, Balk, both large towns; Samarcand, now ruined and in a state of decay,
                    though still containing many fine buildings; Kokaun, Khojund, Yarkund, and
                    others of less consequence. Of the commerce of this distant region, some account
                    has been given under the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Bukharia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Balk.</hi> The Russians have long carried on commerce with
                    Khyvah and the western parts of Tartary. The possession of the port of Astracan,
                    and more lately those of Bako, Salian, Derbund, and Lanke-ran, has given them an
                    entire command of the navigation and commerce of the Caspian Sea; and it is long
                    since they began to build forts on its eastern shore. The principal of these is
                    Okh Trappeh, not far from Astrabad, and some miles to the north of Attruck, in
                    the territory of the Toorkoman tribes. They also occupy a port or point in or
                    connected with the Bay of Balkan, called by the Russians Krasnovodsk, and an
                    island in the Bay of Mangushluck, still farther to the north. It is from some of
                    these points that they have sent a military force against Khyvah, which,
                    according to the latest accounts, had nearly perished from cold and fatigue. The
                    greatest obstacle to the march of an army in these deserts is the want of water.
                    The distance from Krasnovodsk to Khyvah is about 500 miles, in which, for
                    several days’ journey, no water is to be found. Fraser, in his account of the
                    Persian empire, states his opinion that a Russian force might be set down on the
                    eastern shore of the Caspian Sea, either at Balkan or at Mangushluck, “that,
                    with common management, might not only capture, but retain possession of,
                    Khyvah, and project and prepare for ulterior enterprises.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Appendix B, part ii.</p></note> Russia
                    has, as anticipated by Fraser, undertaken this expedition, which has in the mean
                    time failed, as already stated, but whether from want of common management, or
                    of a sufficient force, or from the difficulties of the enterprise, has not been
                    clearly ascertained.</p>
                <p>Russia supplies this extensive country, Khyvah, as well as Bockhara, with the
                    greater portion of the European articles which its inhabitants require. With
                    both these places an intercourse is maintained by means of caravans, which
                    proceed from Astracan by Orenburg. The route is long and dangerous, being about
                    forty days’ journey, and in many places exposed to the attacks of the Kirgeesh
                    and Kuzaks, w ho inhabit the steppes north and north-west of Khyvah. The chief
                    traffic is by sea to Mangushluck, where the Russian traders bring their goods,
                    and are met by those from Khyvah. One great branch of trade consists in slaves
                    captured from the surrounding countries in plundering expeditions, and Khyvah
                    and Bockhara are the chief marts. The Toorkomans, the Yamoots, and even the
                    tribes around Khyvah itself, make inroads into Persia, and carry off the cattle
                    and the inhabitants, who are sold for slaves; and on the other side, the
                    Kirgeesh and Kuzaks make prisoners of the Russians on their own frontiers, or
                    when journeying in caravans, and carry them for sale to the great slave-markets
                    in the east. Bockhara carries on a regular trade with Russia, Persia, and the
                    east; for a more particular account of which, see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bukharia.</hi></p>
                <p>Several of those cities which have been mentioned, towards the east of this
                    extensive region, arc said to be rich <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=104" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0104-0086"
                    />and populous. But unless in those richer tracts which are interspersed through
                    central Asia, and in the cities on the banks of rivers, the inhabitants
                    generally retain their pastoral and migratory habits; and more especially as we
                    proceed farther northwards among the Kirgeesh, who connect Independent Tartary
                    with Russia, and have been already described. Everywhere fertile tracts are to
                    be found; but the desert, the abode of the wandering tribes, greatly
                    preponderates.</p>
                <p>Besides those tribes who still inhabit the country of Tartary, this pastoral
                    population is spread over the southern provinces of Russia, which is inhabited
                    by the Kalmucks and Baschkirs. The Kalmucks have been already described. They
                    entirely resemble the other wandering tribes in their habits. They were formerly
                    numbered among the most powerful tribes in Tartary, and they even boasted of the
                    great conqueror Zingis as belonging to their nation. After various wanderings
                    and misfortunes, the whole body settled, in 1723, on the banks of the Volga,
                    from Tzaritzin to Astracan. They numbered 14,000 tents or families, and owned
                    the supremacy of the czar. They could not, however, relinquish at once their
                    predatory habits, in consequence of which they experienced the iron grasp of
                    Russia, and numbers of them sought an asylum near the frontier of China, whither
                    they emigrated about the year 1771. Those now inhabiting Russia still amount to
                    about 40,000 or 50,000.</p>
                <p>The Baschkire inhabit the southern parts of the provinces of Orfa and Orenburg,
                    with part of Tobolsk, between the rivers Belaia, Kama, Volga, and Oural. They
                    were established in these countries from a very early period, and were
                    instigated to repeated revolts, particularly in 1676, 1708, and 1735; and in
                    1771 they joined the standard of Pugatscheff. Their power was entirely broken in
                    the course of their various conflicts with Russia; and after they were subdued,
                    they experienced so much lenity from the Russian government that they are now
                    numerous and prosperous. They retain all their Tartar habits, being entirely
                    devoted to the rearing of cattle, and, so far, to the growing of such a supply
                    of oats and barley as may serve them for winter food when milk fails them. They
                    consist of 27,000 families, and are obliged to furnish their contingent to the
                    Russian armies, being placed on the footing of Cossacs, mounted and equipped at
                    their own expense.</p>
                <p>II. Chinese Tartary. On the decay of the Tartar sway over central Asia, and the
                    breaking up of their empire, a vast portion of territory fell under the dominion
                    of China. It comprehends that extensive country which is situated between
                    Hindustan and Asiatic Russia, bounded on the north by the great range of the
                    Altai Mountains, and between the Eastern Ocean and the great range of the Beloor
                    Taugh, which bounds Independent Tartary on the east. This space extends in its
                    widest dimensions over seventy degrees of longitude and twenty of latitude. It
                    is doubtful whether it includes or is bounded by Thibet on the south. It is in
                    many parts mountainous and desert. The great desert of Shamo or Cobi stretches,
                    nearly through its whole extent, over a space of nearly 2000 miles in breadth,
                    and interposes between China and the Russian empire. This immense plain is in
                    many places barren and destitute of water, but in other places is watered by
                    rivulets and springs, or lakes, and affords pasturage to the hordes that wander
                    over its desert parts, and is covered with herds of cattle. Our knowledge of
                    this tract, especially of its western limits, is but imperfect, and is chiefly
                    derived from the accounts of the early missionaries by whom it was visited. The
                    most westerly district on the other side of the great mountain range of Beloor
                    Taugh includes, according to the most recent accounts, the Mahommedan states of
                    Kashgar and Yarkund, about 600 miles nearly east of Kokaun. The appearance of
                    this country is in general more pleasing than that to the west, being better
                    watered and more finely diversified, more verdant and better wooded, and
                    differing both from the gravelly and rocky soil of Persia. Khorassan, Balk, and
                    from the salt or sandy deserts of Khaurezm or Bockhara to the west. Kashgar is
                    the more westerly of the two, and is situated in long. 76° 15 45'' E. and in
                    lat. 39° 25' N. It is a city of great celebrity, and of great commercial resort
                    from the surrounding countries. It embraces a circuit of three miles, contains
                    10,000 houses, and is crowded with strangers. It was destroyed by Meerza
                    Abubekr, the grandson of Timur, who having afterwards made it his residence,
                    restored it to prosperity, and adorned it with many splendid edifices. Along
                    with several of the neighbouring states, it has been under the dominion of China
                    for the last seventy or eighty years. Yarkund, which by the road is 180 miles
                    from Kashgar, and is placed in long. 78° 27' 45'' E. lat. 38° 19' N., enjoys a
                    high degree of celebrity in that part of Asia, and is a rendezvous of merchants
                    from India, Caubul, and Independent Tartary. The bazaar contains many handsome
                    shops, which are chiefly occupied by the Chinese. The country which surrounds
                    these cities is described as rich and fruitful, well watered and delightful,
                    abounding in towns and villages, in rich cultivation, and especially in
                    well-flavoured and delicious fruits.</p>
                <p>The conquest of the country by the Chinese, as related by Fraser, took place
                    about seventy or eighty years ago. About the year 1670 or 1680 the countries of
                    Yarkund, Kashgar, and other neighbouring districts, were under the Moghuls or
                    Mongoles, the descendants of Timur, from whom they were conquered by the
                    Kalmucks, whose king resided at Eelah, and appointed governors over the other
                    cities. A great plague having broken out among the Kalmucks, the Mongole lords,
                    seeing the weakness of their rulers, rose in rebellion against them, and
                    succeeded in regaining their lost power. But at this period they put to death an
                    ambassador from China, who was despatched to their country by the emperor, on
                    which he sent an army to avenge the insult, and after a severe conflict the
                    country was subdued, and has ever since remained under the yoke, though they
                    have still preserved their paternal seat, and live ostensibly under the
                    government of their own princes. According to the accounts of travellers, the
                    strictest order and an efficient police are maintained throughout the wide
                    precincts of the Chinese authority; moderate duties are levied, trade is
                    protected, and a single traveller may journey as securely as a large
                    caravan.</p>
                <p>That portion of Tartary which is to the west and north-west of China, is for the
                    most part desert, or a naked and wide-extended plain, with occasional spots
                    which are fertile and well watered, and afford pasture to the flocks of the
                    wandering tribes of Mongoles, Kalkas, and Eluths. The origin of these tribes is
                    but imperfectly known. The Mongoles are generally considered as having been the
                    great disturbers of the world, whose reckless devastation seemed destined to
                    destroy and obliterate arts and knowledge, and every vestige of civilized life.
                    Being gradually broken into separate states, they were partly crushed by the
                    rising power of Russia, and partly fell under the dominion of China. They are
                    really, however, under the rule of the Chinese, though a small portion of them
                    are within the dominions of Russia. These withdrew themselves from the Chinese
                    dominion, and voluntarily put themselves under that of Russia; and this example
                    would have been followed by other races, had not Russia engaged by a treaty not
                    to give admittance to any more of these tribes. The Russian Mongoles inhabit the
                    regions about the Selenga, in the government of Irkutsk, from the 122d to the
                    125th degree of longitude, and between the 50th and 53d degree of north
                    latitude. The allegiance of those who are under the dominion of China is secured
                    by a pension to their chiefs. They sometimes also engage in wars with each
                    other, though these con <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=105" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0105-0087"
                    />tests, when they rise to a certain height, are quelled by the Chinese. All
                    these rude tribes are devoted to the religion of the Lamas.</p>
                <p>The Mantchoo Tartars inhabit the most eastern extremity of Tartary, bordering on
                    the Pacific, which, in consequence of having given a conquering dynasty to
                    China, now forms a province of that empire. They resemble the Mongoles in
                    person, but have a fairer complexion. They have adopted only to a limited extent
                    the religion of Fo or Boodh, so universally established over the east of Asia;
                    they have an ancient superstition of their own, to which they are greatly
                    attached. They have also a peculiar language, which differs materially from that
                    of the Chinese, Coreans, and Mongoles. It is rude in structure, but is said to
                    be copious. Their country is in general mountainous and woody; the mountains are
                    lofty, and the forests are of great depth. The cold is in proportion to the
                    altitude; and though the latitude be only that of the south of France, the
                    climate is cold, and the rivers begin to freeze in September. (<hi
