                    empire, on the eastern side towards the Turkish dominions. In the German
                    language it is called Siebenbürgen, from the seven towers or fortresses by which
                    it was formerly protected against attacks from the Ottoman power. Its Latin
                    name, Transylvania, was derived from its local position beyond the Carpathian
                    Mountains, as part of the ancient Dacia. In the enumeration of the Austrian
                    dominions it is usually denominated a principality. From the 5th century
                    downwards, it was but thinly peopled, and was rided by various chiefs of tribes.
                    In the year 1004, it was subdued by Stephen the First, king of Hungary, who
                    formed it into an Hungarian province, and divided and governed it by waiwodes or
                    stadtholders. In 1536, the waiwode John Zapolya, after a war with one of his
                    rivals for the dignity, obtained for himself, by a treaty with the emperor
                    Ferdinand the First, the rank and authority of an independent sovereign prince.
                    At this period the Turkish government interfered much in the affairs of the
                    principality, which encouraged the princes of the house of Zapolya, and
                    afterwards the house of Batori, that succeeded. Among the princes of the latter
                    family, Bethlem Gabor and George Rakotzy were mostly distinguished by their
                    animosity to the house of Austria, and the resolute resistance which they made
                    to its authority. At length, in 1689, the emperor Leopold the First completely
                    conquered Siebenbürgen, and concluded, ten years after, a peace at Carlowitz
                    with the Turks, by which the sovereignty of the emperor, in his character of
                    king of Hungary, was guaranteed; but the princely family were secured in their
                    possession of subordinate authority. That house became extinct by the death of
                    Prince Michael Aspasi in 1713, when the sole power fell into the hands of
                    Austria. Maria Theresa raised the district to the more elevated rank of a grand
                    principality in 1765.</p><p>This principality extends in latitude from 45° 33' 55'' to 47° 37' 3", and in
                    longitude from 22° 40' 44” to 25° 57' 40'', and comprehends about 24,420 square
                    English miles. It is bounded on the north by Hungary, on the north-east by
                    Bukowina, on the east by Moldavia, on the south by Wallachia, and on the west by
                    Hungary.</p><p>It is an elevated district, in which are to be found the sources of the great
                    rivers that run to the Black Sea. The Carpathian range of mountains, in the form
                    of a half-moon, almost encompasses the whole province, sending out spurs from it
                    on both sides, which fill almost the whole surface. The valleys between these
                    spurs vary in extent, but for the most part are highly productive when
                    moderately cultivated. The highest points of the Carpathians within the
                    principality are, the Butshetsch, 8160 feet, the Reticzat, 7800 feet, and the
                    Szurul, 7126 feet, above the level of the Black Sea. The tops of these mountains
                    are commonly clothed with snow till July. Their sides are well covered with
                    woods to the height of about 5000 feet, when the power of vegetation begins to
                    decline, and soon disappears, leaving the summits quite bare and naked. Among
                    these elevations are some most extraordinary natural clefts and grottos, which
                    invite and reward the attention and examination of the traveller</p><p>The inhabitants of this province are of no less than thirteen distinct tribes,
                    according to their origin. The three most distinguished of these classes are
                    called united <hi rend="italic">(uniti).</hi> They are the Hungarians, the
                    Szecklers, and the Saxons; which last were brought from the parts of Germany
                    then called Saxony, near to Liege, Luxembourg, and Treves, in 1143, by king
                    Seysa the Second. The land is divided among these three nations thus. The
                    Hungarians are in the western division, which extends over one half of the land,
                    and contains rather more than half the population, and is divided into eleven
                    gespanschafts or waiwodeships. The land of the Szeckler is the least; it is
                    thinly peopled, and is subdivided into five bailiwicks. The land of the Saxons
                    is both on the north and the south side of the province, and is the best
                    cultivated as well as the most densely inhabited, and comprises eleven
                    bailiwicks. The remainder of the nation are denominated by their description <hi rend="italic">Tolerati,</hi> consisting of Wallachians, Greeks, Armenians,
                    Moravians, Poles, Russians, Bulgarians, Servians, Jews, and Gipsies. These last
                    are called Pharohniens, as coming from Egypt, or supposed to have come from
                    thence. Maria Theresa tried to accustom these people to the practices of
                    civilized society; but her efforts, as well as those of her successors, have had
                    but little effect, as they continue averse to agricultural labour, and indeed to
                    any fixed course of life. The Wallachians are the most numerous of these
                    tolerated tribes. The richer part of them have acquired landed estates, but the
                    lower classes are very ignorant, idle, and filthy. The Armenians and the Greeks
                    devote themselves chiefly to traffick. Among all these tribes the Saxons are the
                    most active and orderly. Their villages and dwellings are well built, and
                    everywhere show prosperity and purity of morals. Their written language is the
                    High German, but they speak, or at least have the pronunciation, of the <hi rend="italic">Platt Deurch.</hi> In the districts inhabited by this race, corn,
                    wine, and culinary vegetables are produced, as well as garden flowers. In the
                    cities of Kronstadt and Hermanstadt, they are the chief conductors of the
                    manufacturing establishments. The religion of the principality is various; and
                    there is a degree of obscurity in the statistical account, which renders any
                    estimate of their relative numbers so very uncertain that only an approximation
                    can be obtained. There are four established <hi rend="italic">(privilegirte)</hi> religious sects. The Roman Catholics, who amount to about
                    150,000, have a bishop and other dignitaries, and forty convents. With them are
                    joined what are called the United Greeks, who to a settled point are Catholics;
                    and with them may be classed most of the Armenians. These have also a bishop,
                    several dignitaries, and convents, and the number of them is estimated at
                    210,000, thus making the whole of the Catholics 390,000. The Reformed or
                    Calvinist Church consists of about 300,000 persons, under a superintendent and
                    two archdeacons, with 587 pastors. The Lutheran Church is calculated to number
                    250,000 souls; having a superintendent, fourteen deacons, and 286 pastors. The
                    Unitarians or Socinians are mostly refugees from Poland, who were received into
                    this province when persecuted in their native country, where they were joined by
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=366" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0366-0346"/>some of the Szecklers, and a few others. Their
                    numbers are said not to exceed 40,000 persons; but they have a bishop, 110
                    churches and fifty-four chapels. Each of these sects has its established
                    institutions for education. Thus the Catholics have a college at Clausenburg,
                    and lyceums or grammar schools at Karlsburg, Maros, Basarhely, Udvarhely, and
                    Hermanstadt; the Protestants have colleges at Nagy-Enyed, Maros, Clausenburg,
                    Vasarhely, and Broos; the Lutherans have colleges in Hermanstadt, in Mediaset,
                    Schasburg, and Bisztritz; and the Unitarians have a college at Clausburg, and
                    gymnasiums at Thorenburg and at Hermanstadt. Besides these established religious
                    sects, there is one whose adherents are more numerous than all the others
                    together, which is tolerated, but not privileged. These are the Greeks who
                    believe the doctrines of the pure church of their name, under the patriarch of
                    Constantinople. They consist of Wallachians, Bulgarians, Greeks, and the
                    Gypsies. They have an archbishop, twenty-nine archdeacons, and 991 churches, but
                    no institutions for education. They consist of the lowest class of labourers
                    both in agriculture and in mining.</p><p>The greatest export of agricultural produce is that of tobacco, of which much is
                    grown of a quality highly admired. The breeding of horses is an extensive
                    pursuit, in which the Gypsies are said to be very skilful. The breed most common
                    is of slight make, but very agile, strong, and capable of enduring labour. Most
                    of the gentry support establishments to improve the breed of horses. The sheep
                    have coarse wool, and no improvement has been recently introduced by
                    fine-woolled rams. The cows are numerous, and afford good butter and cheese, and
                    furnish oxen for the ploughs. As much flax and hemp are raised as is required by
                    the inhabitants to supply the cloths and furniture made of those substances,
                    which are spun in all the houses, and converted into cloth by itinerant weavers.
                    The mines are a great source of wealth, and furnish the chief occupation to the
                    poorer classes. the salt-mines are a part of that vast vein of rock-salt which
                    commences in Wallachia, and extends to Wieliczka in Poland. From six shafts are
                    annually extracted 1,000,900 quintals of this substance, of which nearly three
                    fourths are sent to the provinces of Hungary, and to the Bannat. The other mines
                    are those of gold and silver, yielding, of the former nearly 20,000, and of the
                    latter 40,000 ounces yearly. The copper mines yield about 3000 quintals, those
                    of lead 2500 quintals, and those of iron 70,000 quintals. Besides these, sixty
                    quintals of quicksilver are prepared. Much of the gold is obtained by washing
                    the sand of the rivers, a labour in which the Gypsies excel. The proprietors and
                    directors of the mines are for the most part Germans. It is an aristocratic
                    country, like Hungary, and, as there, the nobility are exempt from many of the
                    taxes; and the higher clergy of the established sects are considered as noble,
                    but not the monks or pastors. The nobles form the legislative assembly, but can
                    enter into no affairs but such as arc suggested by the prince. With his
                    approval, the laws may be amended or repealed, or new laws made. The prince has
                    the sole power of making peace or war, of coining money, of conferring clerical
                    dignities, and of granting dispensations for marriages, and is the heir of the
                    landed property of all families that become extinct. Appeals may be made from
                    the courts of law in Siebenbürgen, as in Hungary, to the high court of chancery,
                    which sits at Vienna. the emperor, as prince, derives an income of L.130,000
                    from taxes and tithes on minerals and salt, and, besides, has the hereditary
                    land revenues, and from the whole draws annually the sum of nearly L.500,000.
                    According to the last calculation, at the end of the year 1836, the whole
                    population amounted to about 2,250,000 persons. The principal cities, with their
                    population, were, Kronstadt, or, in Hungarian, Kruhnen 30,000</p><p>Klausenburg or Kolosvar 20.000</p><p>Hermanstadt 16,000</p><p>Thorenberg or Thordaz 7,000</p><p>Strasburg or Nagy-Enyed 6,000</p><p>Carlsburg 6,000</p><p>Schasburg 6,000</p><p>Mediasch 5,000</p><p>Mullenbach 5,000</p><p>On the borders of this principality, as on the other frontiers of the Austrian
                    dominions that are in contact with the Turks, there are what are called military
                    colonies. These consist of soldiers who are furnished with houses and small
                    farms, which they cultivate for their maintenance, having no pay, but the land
                    rent-free. They are armed and clothed by the government, and being regimented,
                    are always prepared to repel any insult from their neighbours, and to suppress
                    any kind of disturbance. The colonists on the Siebenbürgen boundary compose five
                    regiments, four of which are infantry, and one hussars. The staff of each
                    regiment has its head-quarters fixed at one of the small towns on the frontier.
                    The whole number of these colonists, including wives, children, and dependants,
                    with colonists discharged from the service from age or other causes, is
                    estimated at 135,000 persons. They form an active and economical
                    militia-force.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
