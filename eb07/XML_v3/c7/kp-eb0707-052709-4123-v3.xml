                <change n="3.0" status="public" when="2024-12-06" who="#pml">v3.0. Includes
                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">CUDWORTH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ralph</hi></label>, a very
                    learned philosopher and divine of the seventeenth century, was born at Aller, in
                    Somersetshire, in 1617, and studied at Cambridge, where he distinguished himself
                    as a tutor, and had as a pupil the celebrated Mr, afterwards Sir William,
                    Temple, in 1641 he was presented to the rectory of North Cadbury, in
                    Somersetshire; and the year following published a discourse concerning the true
                    nature of the Lord’s Supper, which Bochart, Spencer, Selden, and other eminent
                    wri- ’ ters have quoted with great commendation. In January 1657, he was one of
                    the persons nominated by a committee of the parliament to be consulted about the
                    English translation of the Bible. In 1678 he published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >True Intellectual System of the Universe,</hi> a work which at the time met
                    with great opposition. He likewise published a treatise entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Deus</hi><hi rend="italic">Justificatus,</hi> or the divine
                    goodness vindicated against the assertions of absolute and unconditionate
                    reprobation. He embraced the mechanical or corpuscular philosophy; but with
                    regard to the Deity, spirits, genii, and ideas, he principally followed the
                    Platonists. He died at Cambridge in 1688. It has been justly observed, that it
                    is not easy to meet with a greater storehouse of ancient learning than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Intellectual System</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and various
                    writers have been indebted to it for an appearance of erudition which they might
                    not otherwise have been able to assume. That Dr Cudworth was fanciful in some of
                    his opinions, and that he was too devoted a follower of Plato and his
                    successors, will scarcely be denied even by those who are most sensible of his
                    general merit. But the reflections which have <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194754136" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4136-0528"/>been cast upon this great
                    writer by bigoted writers are altogether contemptible. It is often the lot of
                    distinguished merit to be thus unworthily treated. Lord Shaftesbury, speaking on
                    this subject, has borne honourable testimony to the merits of Dr Cudworth. “You
                    know,” says his lordship, “the common fate of those who dare to appear fair
                    authors. What was that pious and learned man’s case who wrote the <hi
                    rend="italic">Intellectual System of the Universe?</hi> I confess it was
                    pleasant enough to consider that, though the whole world were not less satisfied
                    with his capacity and learning than with his sincerity in the cause of Deity,
                    yet he was accused of giving the upper hand to the atheists, for having only
                    stated their reasons, and those of their adversaries, fairly together.” “Though
                    his life,” says Sir James Mackintosh, “was devoted to the assertion of divine
                    Providence, and though his philosophy was imbued with the religious spirit of
                    Platonism, yet he had placed Christianity too purely in the love of God and man
                    to be considered as having much regard for those controversies about rites and
                    opinions with which zealots disturb the world. They represented him as having
                    fallen into the same heresy as Milton and Clarke; and some of them even charged
                    him with atheism, for no other reason than that he was not afraid to state the
                    atheistic difficulties in their fullest force. As blind anger heaps inconsistent
                    accusations on each other, they called him an Arian, a Socinian, or a deist. The
                    courtiers of Charles II., who were delighted with every part of Hobbes but his
                    integrity, did their utmost to decry his antagonist.” (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dissertation Second,</hi> p. 225, where the reader will find at once the ablest
                    and most eloquent view of the peculiar doctrines and characteristic attributes
                    of this profound thinker and truly original writer, which is perhaps to be found
                    in the English language). But the slanders of fierce polemics and profligate
                    courtiers are now only remembered to be detested or despised; and posterity has
                    done justice alike to the traducers and the traduced. It is observed by Dr Birch
                    that Dr Cudworth’s <hi rend="italic">Intellectual System of the Universe</hi>
                    has raised him a reputation to which nothing can add but the publication of his
                    other writings still extant in manuscript in the British Museum. That these
                    writings are valuable cannot possibly be doubted. It is known, indeed, that they
                    display great compass of sentiment and a vast extent of learning; nevertheless,
                    from their bulk, the abstruseness of the subjects of which they treat, and the
                    revolutions of literary taste and opinion, it is pretty certain that the
                    publication of them would not be successful in the present age. We may add, that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Intellectual System</hi> was translated into Latin by
                    Mosheim, and published at Jena in 1733, one volume folio, with a life of
                    Cudworth and notes. Dr Cudworth’s daughter Damaris, who married Sir Francis
                    Masham of Oates, in Essex, was a lady of genius and learning. She had a great
                    friendship for Mr Locke, who resided several years at her house at Oates; and
                    she had the honour to nurse the infirmities and to watch the last breath of that
                    great philosopher, who had been opposed to her father in speculative philosophy,
                    but who heartily agreed with him in the love of truth, liberty, and virtue.</p>
                <p>Dr Cudworth, as already stated, left several manuscripts, which seem to be a
                    continuation of his <hi rend="italic">Intellectual System,</hi> of which he gave
                    the world only the first part. One of these was published by Chandler, bishop of
                    Durham, in 1731, 8vo, under the title of a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Eternal
                    and Immutable Morality</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a work levelled against the
                    writings of Hobbes and others, who had revived the exploded opinions of
                    Protagaras, by which the essential and eternal difference of moral good and
                    evil, justice and injustice, was destroyed, and these attributes were considered
                    as arbitrary productions of divine and human will. Dr Cudworth also left several
                    other manuscripts, entitled,</p>
                <p>1. A Discourse of Moral Good and Evil; 2. Another Book of Morality, in which
                    Hobbes’s philosophy is explained; 3. A Discourse of Liberty and Necessity, in
                    which the grounds of the atheistical philosophy are confuted, and morality
                    vindicated anfl explained; 4. Another book <hi rend="italic">De Libero</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Arbitrio</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">5.</hi>
                    Upon Daniel’s Prophecy of the Seventy Wecks, in which all the interpretations of
                    the Jews are considered and refuted, with several of some learned Christians; 6.
                    Of the Verity of the Christian Religion against the Jews; 7. A Discourse of the
                    Creation of the World and the Immortality of the Soul; 8. Hebrew Learning; and
                    9. An Explanation of Hobbes’s notion of God, and of the extension of Spirits.
                    These manuscripts, after passing through various hands, and being exposed to
                    many dangers, are now safely lodged in that noble repository the British
                    Museum.</p>
