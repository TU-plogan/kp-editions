                    eminent English antiquary, descended from an ancient family, was born in 1570.
                    In his eighteenth year he began to collect ancient records, charters, and other
                    manuscripts. Camden, Selden, and Speed have acknowledged their obligations to
                    him in their respective works. He was highly distinguished by Queen Elizabeth,
                    and also by James I. who created him a baronet. He wrote many things himself;
                    but the principal obligation which the country owes him is for his valuable
                    library, consisting of curious manuscripts, which he was forty years in
                    collecting, and of which a catalogue was published by Thomas Smith, entitled <hi rend="italic">Catalogus Librorum</hi><hi rend="italic">rnanuscriptorum
                    Bibliothecae Cottoniance, etc.</hi> 1696, fol. At his death in 1631 he left the
                    property of this collection to his family, though he designed it for public use.
                    Large accessions were made to this library by private benefactions before the
                    death of the founder, and afterwards by purchases of his heirs, and donations of
                    others, who added to it a great number of books, chiefly relating to the history
                    and antiquities of our own country. At the request of Sir</p><p>John Cotton, an act of parliament was passed for preserving it after his decease,
                    under the above denomination, for public use. It is now fixed in the British
                    Museum. , <hi rend="smallcaps">Cotton,</hi><hi rend="italic">Charles,</hi> a
                    burlesque poet, was descended of a good family, and lived in the reign of
                    Charles II. and James II. His most noted piece is <hi rend="italic">Scarronides,</hi> or a travesty of the first and fourth books of the Aeneid.
                    But though, from the title, one might imagine it an imitation of Scarron’s
                    famous travesty of the same author, yet, upon examination, it will be found to
                    excel not only that, but every other attempt of the same kind which has hitherto
                    been made. He also translated several of Lucian’s dialogues, in the same manner,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Scoffer Scoff’d,</hi> and wrote another
                    poem of a more serious kind, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Wonders of the
                    Peak.</hi> The exact period of Mr Cotton’s birth or his death is nowhere
                    recorded; but it is probable that the latter happened about the time of the
                    revolution. Neither is it better known what were his circumstances with respect
                    to fortune. They appear, however, to have been easy, if one may judge from the

                    turn of his writings, which is such as seems scarcely possible for any one to
                    indulge in whose mind was not perfectly at ease. There is one anecdote told of
                    him which seems to show that his vein of humour could not restrain itself on any
                    consideration. It appears that in consequence of a single couplet in his <hi rend="italic">Virgil Travesty,</hi> in which he has made mention of a peculiar
                    kind of ruff worn by a grandmother of his who lived in the Peak, he lost an
                    estate of L.400 per annum. The old lady, whose humour and testy disposition he
                    could by no means have been a stranger to, was never able to forgive the liberty
                    he had taken with her; and having her fortune wholly at her own disposal,
                    although she had previously made him her sole heir, she altered her will, and
                    gave avřay the estate to an absolute stranger.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cotton,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nathaniel,</hi> an English

                    1788. Like several other medical men of this country, he cultivated poetry as
                    well as physic; and although he published observations on a particular kind of
                    scarlet fever, yet he is better known as the author of poetical pieces, inserted
                    in the collection published by Dodsley, and particularly by a work.in verse,
