                    similarity of pursuit had made Craig acquainted with that truly great man; and
                    on his return to Scotland he enjoyed the intimate friendship of the accomplished

                    in substance revived by Hume, had been formerly refuted by Ditton, a
                    contemporary mathematician of this country, andby Houte-ville and others on the
                    Continent. If, however, it may be allowed to form an opinion of Craig’s

                    eldest son of William Craig of Craigfintray, afterwards called Craigston, in the
                    county of Aberdeen. The period of his birth is uncertain; but as he was sent to
                    the university of St Andrews in 1552, we may suppose him to have been born about
                    the year 1538. He was entered at St Leonard’s College; a seminary which was
                    afterwards placed under the direction of Buchanan, and which therefore occupies
                    some space in the academical annals of the age. He took the degree of A. B. in
                    the year 1555; but as his name does not occur in the list of masters, he is
                    supposed to have left the university before he had completed the ordinary course
                    of study. For those who were destined for the legal profession, it was then the
                    usual practice to finish their education in some of the French universities,
                    which about that period attained to the highest eminence as schools of the civil
                    and canon law. A similar practice prevailed almost universally till the earlier
                    part of the last century; and a writer in the reign of Charles the First thought
                    it not a little “strange toe see ane man admitted to teach the lawes, who was
                    never out of the countrie stu-dicing and learning the lawes.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Spalding’s Hist, of the

                    to a great extent founded on the principles of the civil law; and without a
                    competent knowledge of the civil law, no man can attain to a complete and
                    masterly knowledge of the law of Scotland. At an early period, when the students
                    of law were very few in number, the professors were without a sufficient
                    excitement to exertion; and the Scotish youth were compelled to seek for able
                    preceptors in other countries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Ea enim actate sapere, nisi Romano jure, homines non

                    beyond all competition: their celebrity however was at length eclipsed by the
                    more modern universities of Holland; and our countrymen then resorted to Leyden
                    and Utrecht, instead of Bourges and Toulouse. Craig, as we are informed,
                    completed his academical studies in France, and he has himself made more than
                    one allusion to his connexion with the university of Paris. But at Paris the
                    civil law was not then publicly taught; and it is scarcely to be doubted that he
                    repaired to some other university, in order to acquire a branch of knowledge
                    which was then regarded as indispensable to a lawyer. His skill in the civil and
                    the canon law was united with great proficiency in classical learning, for which
                    we may conjecture that he was in no small degree indented to the disèûĩljpe of
                    Paris, where philological studies were then cultiůat’çd with very eminent
                    success.</p><p>Craig, having reached a vigorous manhood, was admitted an advocate in the month
                    of February 1563. In the year 1564 he was appointed the deputy of the justice
                    general, Archibald earl of Argyle. It belonged to his office to try the highest
                    offences; and his name very frequently occurs in the criminal records of that
                    period, which have lately been rendered more accessible by the labours of Mr
                    Pitcairn. This distinguished lawyer appears to have steered a prudent course, in
                    the midst of that turbulence and those disorders which prevailed in Scotland
                    during a great part of his life: he appears to have devoted himself with great
                    assiduity to the studies and duties of his profession, and, shunning the
                    dangerous path of political ambition, to have sought a more pleasing solace of
                    the mind in his ’ recreations with the Muses. Hė published Several Latin poems,

                    very inauspicious subject, is not inserted in the collection. Here we find
                    another poem, entitled “Jacobi serenissimi Scotorum Principis, Ducis Rotheèaiae,

                    Heriot of Trabroun in the county of Haddington. His wife was probably the
                    cousin'of Buchanan, whose mother, Agnes Heriot, belonged to the same family. At
                    the age of thirty-four, his eldest son, Sir Lewis Craig, was raised to the bench
                    in February 1604 by the title of Lord Wrightslands.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brunton &amp; Haig’s Historical Account of

                    was then customary for the judges to wear their hats on the bench; blit whenever
                    Craig had occasion to plead before his son, the latter sat uncovered, and
                    listened to him with filial reverence. We may reasonably Suppose that the Same
                    interest which bad raised the son, might as ’ easily have raised the father to
                    the bench; but the modesty of his disposition perhaps led him to prefer a less
                    elevated station;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Ipse
                    vero,” says Dempster, “ut alter Maecenas, cum summa posset capessere,
                    mediocribus fuit contentus, et advocationis munus quam sustinuit feliciter, quam
                    meruit submisse.” (Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Scotorum, p. 197∙ Bononiae,
                    1827, 4to.)</p></note> nor is it improbable that the salary of a judge would not
                    have exceeded the emoluments of his extensive practice, added to those of his
                    different appointments. He is not mentioned as the deputy of the justice general
                    after the close of the year 1573: in the course of the following year he appears
                    as sheriff of Edinburgh; and he is supposed to have resigned the one office on
                    being nominated to the other. At a much later period, namely in 1606, he is
                    described as advocate of the church. And this seems to complete the catalogue of
                    his regular preferments, but we likewise find his name inserted in occasional
                    commissions of importance.</p><p>The greatest of his literary labours was his treatise on the feudal law. Such an
                    undertaking was at that period attended with many difficulties. The municipal
                    law had not received any considerable degree of cultivation: systematic
                    treatises it possessed few or none; written authorities of every kind were
                    scanty and inaccessible; and the collecting of materials must therefore have
                    been not a little tedious and laborious. The feudal law, in its general
                    principles, was taught in the foreign universities as a necessary' branch of
                    jurisprudence, and the foreign lawyers, particularly those of Italy and France,
                    had published a great variety of works on the subject; but it was Craig’s
                    special object to illustrate the principles of that law as they had been applied
                    and modified in his native country, and in this department he was without a
                    model and without a precursor. It is not therefore surprising, though it may
                    justly be regretted, that he was unable to amass such <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753018" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3018-0442"/>a stock of
                    materials as prepared him for throwing a clear and steady light on the progress
                    of feudal rights and tenures from the earliest times. The character of his work
                    is likewise affected by his patriotic zeal to facilitate the union of the two
                    kingdoms, by assimilating their national laws and customs. “Sir Thomas Craig,”
                    says another able jurist, “who is always instructive when he describes the
                    feudal customs of his own times, is seldom so when he goes back into
                    history.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stuart’s

                    perhaps appear sufficiently just and discriminating. The value and importance of
                    Craig’s <hi rend="italic">Jus</hi><hi rend="italic">Feudale</hi> is admitted by
                    every competent judge, nor has it been superseded by any subsequent treatise:

                    has since made its appearance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Principia Juris Feudalis, auctore Alexandro Brussio, JCto.

                    as well as of extensive learning; and it may perhaps be affirmed, without much
                    hazard of refutation, that no other Scotish lawyer can so safely be brought into
                    comparison with Lord Stair.</p><p>Craig did not. himself commit his elaborate work to the press; and indeed the
                    printing of any treatise on the law of Scotland seems then to have been
                    considered as almost entirely out of the question. Nearly half a century after
                    the author’s death, it was published by Robert Burnet, who had married his
                    grand-daughter. “Jus Feudale, tribus Jibris comprehensum; quibus non solum
                    Consuetudines Feudales, et Praediorum Jura, quae in Scotia, Anglia, et plerisque

                    Civilis singula reducuntur.” Edinb. 1655, fol. Some copies bear the imprint of
                    London. The editor has prefixed a preface, in which he speaks with learning and
                    judgment of the author and his work. After a long interval appeared another
                    edition, “cum praefatione Lüderi Menckellii, JCti.” Lipsiae, 1716, 4to. This was
                    speedily followed by the latςst and best edition; “editio tertia, prioribus
                    multo emendation, opera et studio Jacobi Baillie, Advocati.” Edinb. 1732, fol.
                    Prefixed is an excellent portrait of the author, together with a short account
                    of his life; and the typography of the edition is greatly superior to that of
                    the other two. Of this work there are two manuscript copies in the Advocates
                    Library, and likewise two copies of “A Compend or Breviarie of the most
                    substantiell Poynts relating to the Law: extracted forth of the bookes of that
                    learned jurisconsult D. T. C. treating upon the Feudall Law.”</p><p>Another ample and elaborate work, undertaken about the same period, is his
                    treatise entitled “De Jure Successionis Regni Angliae libri duo, adversus
                    Sophismata cu-jusdam personati Dolomanni, quibus non solum Jura Successionis in
                    Regnis, sed etiam ipsorum Regum sacro-sanc-tam Authoritatem nititur evertere.”
                    Under-the assumed name of Dolman, Robert Parsons had in the year 1594 published
                    “A Conference about the next Succession to the Crown of England ;” in which he
                    chiefly aimed at superseding the claims of a protestant successor to Queen
                    Elizabeth. Although he did not proceed on the same philosophical principles, he
                    arrived at a similar conclusion with Buchanan; namely, that all political power
                    is derived from the people, and that the consent of the governed is an essential
                    ingredient in all legitimate governments. The right of resisting kings was
                    boldly taught by other Jesuits, and particularly by Mariana, well known as the
                    historian of Spain ∙,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Joannis Marianae Hispani, e Soc. lesu, de liege et llegis Institutione libri

                    .Mariana, as the reader may easily conjecture, is only directed agâinst
                    heretical kings.</p></note> but all their better speculations are mingled with
                    Jesuitical notions of priestly power. Craig, adhering to the prevalent doctrines
                    respecting the divine right of kings and the passive obedience of subjects, has
                    at great length discussed the subject of regal succession and authority. Such a
                    production cannot now be regarded as of much importance; but of so able a man,
                    intimately acquainted with history, and with jurisprudence in all its branches,
                    the labour could not be entirely fruitless. Parsons was likewise refuted by
                    Peter Wentworth, Sir John Hayward, and other English writers.</p><p>King James succeeded very quietly to the throne of England, and the original of
                    Craig’s treatise <hi rend="italic">De Jure</hi><hi rend="italic">Successionis</hi> it was not thought necessary to publish. Various manuscripts
                    of it have however been preserved: one belongs to the Advocates Library, another
                    to the University Library, and a third to the writer of this brief notice. The
                    second of these Gatherer describes as the original manuscript. The author’s
                    doctrines were afterwards found very palatable by the Jacobites; and the design
                    of printing the work was formed by Dr Monro, who was principal of the university
                    of Edinburgh at the period of the Revolution. He lost his preferments in the
                    church and the university, and being otherwise involved in the troubles of his
                    party, he did not live to carry this design into execution. From the transcript
                    which he had procured, a translation was however made by his friend James
                    Gatherer, who, before the Revolution, had been parson of Kilmauns in Ayrshire,
                    and who having at length become a bishop among the non-jurors, died in the month
                    of February 1733.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Dr

                    the counterfeit name of Doleman; by which he endeavours to overthrow not only
                    the Rights of Succession in Kingdoms, but also the sacred Authority of Kings
                    themselves: written originally in Latin about 100 years since, by the eminently
                    learned and judicious Sir Thomas Craig of Riccartoun, the celebrated author of

                    and which is written with the author’s usual learning and ability. “In point of
                    matter and style,” says Mr Tytler, “in the importance of the subject to which it
                    relates, the variety of historical illustrations, the sagacity of the political
                    remarks, and the insight into the mutual interests of the two countries which it
                    exhibits, it perhaps deserves to rank the highest of all his works.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tytler’s Account of the Life

                    treatise has never been printed; but a manuscript, extending to 264 pages in
                    folio, is preserved in the Advocates Library. On the same subject two Latin
                    disquisitions were published by Robert Pont, D.D. who was at once
                    anofficiatingeJergyman, and a judge in the supreme court; and by David Hume of
                    Godscroft, who is well known for his other writings in prose and verse. Craig
                    performed another patriotic task <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753031" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3031-0443"/>by preparing a
                    work which bears the following title: “De Hominio Disputatio adversus eos qui

                    great library; but long after the death of the author, a translation of it was
                    published under the title of “Scotland’s Sovereignty asserted: being a dispute’
                    concerning Homage, against those who maintain that Scotland is a Feu or
                    Fee-Liege of England, and that therefore the King of Scots owes Homage to the
                    King of England, &amp;c. translated from the Latin manuscript; and a preface
                    added, with a short account of the learned author, and a confutation of that
                    homage said to be performed by Malcolm III. King of Scotland, to Edward the
                    Confessor, lately found in the ar-chieves of England, and published in a single
                    sheet by Mr Rymer, the King’s Historiographer: by Geo. Ridpath.” Lond. 1695,
                    8vo. Craig had vindicated the independence of the Scotish monarchy against the
                    imputations of the English historians, particularly Holinshed, or his coadjutor
                    Harrison; and the more recent attempt of Rymer is allowed to have been
                    sufficiently repelled by Ridpath, who has shewn that the supposed form of
                    ancient homage bears several unequivocal marks of forgery. His publication was
                    however followed by Atwood’s “Superiority and direct Dominion of the Crown of
                    England over the Crown and Kingdom of Scotland, asserted against Sir Thomas
                    Craig.” Lond. 1704, 8vo. This book was refuted by Anderson in 1705; and the
                    superiority of the crown of England was re-asserted by Atwood in the course of
                    the same year.</p><p>Archbishop Nicoson mentions an historical production of the same learned author.

                    Atwood to call him a favourite author. Such, 1 do acknowledge, he is with me;
                    and ’ tis not impossible but I may, in the warmth of my affection, have
                    express’d a more kind opinion of his performances, than my nicer adversary
                    thinks he deserves.” <hi rend="italic">(Leges Marchiarum,</hi> or Border Laws,
                    pref. Lond. 1705, 8vo.)</p></note> And here we complete the enumeration of his
                    writings in prose.</p><p>Towards the elbse of his life, he again indulged his poetical vein. He wrote some
                    commendatory verses, which are prefixed to Thomas Jack’s “Onomastico Poeticum.”
                    Edinb. 1592, 4to. And seven years later, he wrote a short elegy on the death of
                    Rollock, which, with many similar contributions, is subjoined to George
                    Robertson’s “Vitae et Mortis D. Roberti Rolloci Scoti Narratio.” Edinb. 1599,
                    8vo. During one and the same year, he published three different poems. “Ad
                    sereniss. et potentiss. Principem Iacobum Sextum, e sua Scotia decedentem,
                    Parae-netico.” Excudebat Robertus Waldegrave, 1603, 4to. “Ad serenissimum
                    Britanniarum Principem Henricum, e Scotia discedentem, Propemptico.” Edinburgi
                    excudebat Robertus Charteris, 1603, 4to. “Serenissimi et invictissimi Principis,
                    Iacobi Britanniarum et Galliarum Regis, Srspavopog/a.” Excudebat Robertus
                    Charteris, 1603, 4 to.</p><p>In the year 1604, Craig was nominated among the Scotish commissioners empowered
                    to treat respecting the projected union of the two kingdoms. One of his
                    associates was Sir John Skene, who had likewise contributed to illustrate the
                    jurisprudence of his native country. The Scotish and the English commissioners
                    met at Westmin ster, but it is well known that their deliberations were not
                    attended with any important consequences. Many prejudices were to subside, and
                    many fierce contentions'to be assuaged, before this great and salutary measure
                    could be accomplished. This visit afforded him an' òpportunity of cultivating an
                    acquaintance with Camden, and other learned men; and the king bestowed upon him
                    one of those honours which at that time, as well as at the present time, had
                    begun to be held in little estimation on account of their indiscriminate
                    distribution. James determined to elevate him to the rank of knighthood; but
                    instead of aspiring to this distinction, he secretly withdrew himself, in order
                    to avoid the intended ceremony'·. The king however commanded that he should be
                    styled and reputed a knight; and accordingly his name is generally accompanied
                    with a title which he himself had no wish to assume.</p><p>Sir Thomas Craig died on the 26th of February 1608. His death was bewailed in
                    Latin verse by his learned countryman Dempster, who, like himself, was a poet as
                    well as a lawyer. He left behind him an estimable character and a fair estate.
                    He is celebrated for his liberal style of hospitality, and, what is of higher
                    moment, for his zealous adherence to the protestant faith. He had four sons and
                    three daughters. Sir Lewis Craig, whom we have already mentioned as his eldest
                    son, died in the year 1622. The second, James Craig of Castle-Craig and
                    Craigston in the kingdom of Ireland, was killed during the insurrection of 1641;
                    and dying without issue, he bequeathed his estates to his next brother, John
                    Craig, an eminent physician. Gassendi informs us that in the year 1592 Craig, a
                    Scotish physician, published a tract against Tycho Brahe, under the title of
                    “Capnuraniae Restinctio, seu, Cometarum in Aethera Sublimationis Refutatio;” and
                    that an answer to it was written by Christianus Longomontanus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Gassendi Vita Tyćhonis

                    astronomer himself published a “Responsio Apologetica ad quondam Scotum,
                    Aristote-licum Philosophum, et Medicum Galenicum.” This is supposed to have been
                    the third son, Dr Craig, who was successively physician in ordinary to King
                    James, and first physician to King Charles. The youngest son was Robert Craig,
                    whose son acquired by marriage the estate of Ramorgnie in Fifeshire. Margaret,
                    the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas, became the wife of Sir Alexander Gibson of
                    Durie; and from this marriage is descended the present possessor of the estate
                    of Riccarton, Sir James Gibson Craig, Bart. Elizabeth, his second daughter,
                    married James Johnston of Warriston; and their son Sir Archibald Johnston acted
                    a conspicuous part in the proceedings of his own unhappy times: their daughter
                    Rachel was married to Robert Burnet of Crimond, a judge in the court of session,
                    and the father of Gilbert Burnet, the celebrated bishop of Salisbury. Craig’s
                    third daughter, Janet, was married to John Belches of Tofts, and their son Sir
                    Alexander Belches was likewise raised to the bench. <hi rend="italic">.
