                    metaphysics and education, was born at Grenoble in 1715. He was brother <pb

                    Mably; and, like him, arrived at high celebrity, though in a different line of
                    pursuit. He seems to have been actuated by the purest motives of utility to his
                    species, in directing his exertions to the elucidation of those subjects in
                    metaphysical science, the imperfect state of which had involved the studies, as
                    well as the public pursuits, of the thinking world, in perplexity, and had
                    retarded the attainment of that degree of sound knowledge and of happiness for
                    which the faculties of man entitled him to hope. The field of metaphysical
                    research had been for some time laid open by the destruction of the imperious
                    authority of Aristotle and the schools; a variety of contending doctrines, which
                    had made their appearance, created in active minds a spirit of independence; and
                    no admiration of the genius of another prevented the suggestions of the
                    philosophic critic from mingling themselves with the illustrations of the
                    enlightened pupil. Locke had led the way to a mode of investigation now rising
                    into favour, and promising to impart a luminous simplicity to the science of
                    mind; and philosophers emulated one another in their efforts to correct or to
                    extend the doctrines of this author, or to found upon them others distinguished
                    by new improvements. Condillac was one of the first who introduced this style of
                    metaphysical inquiry into French literature. His earliest work was his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine
                    des Connaissances Humaines,</hi> which appeared in 174G. This work contains
                    those favourite opinions which are exhibited with more correct taste in his
                    subsequent productions. It is not, however, superseded by the latter, as it
                    contains a variety of interesting illustrations peculiar to itself; and although
                    here we find his errors particularly prominent, that circumstance seems rather
                    to proceed from the absence of art and of plausibility, than from the subsequent
                    adoption of views more radically correct. From the outline which he first formed
                    of philosophic methods, he seems never to have departed. The object of the first
                    part of this essay is to confirm and extend the doctrine of Locke, that all
                    ideas originate in the senses, and consist of sensations variously modified.
                    Readers who conceive that Locke’s doctrine, when followed to its consequences,
                    tends to lower the estimation in which the human mind ought to be held, will
                    probably attach the same blame to Condillac. His curious saving clause will not
                    vindicate his opinions among the philosophers of this country, however
                    convenient it might be found among the adherents of the Roman Catholic church,
                    that the dependence of the soul on the senses is one of the effects of the fall
                    of man, and a proof of his present state of degradation. Readers who are not
                    ambitious of possessing a fixed theory in a department of metaphysics so
                    abstruse, will be pleased with those traits of acuteness in the observation of
                    mental phenomena which abound in this essay, and which are often expressed with
                    great felicity, even while the slight distortions communicated to some of his
                    representations of facts by the tendencies of his theories obtrude themselves on
                    our notice. The doctrine now mentioned is followed up by two other leading
                    positions, “that the association of ideas is the foundation of the most
                    important mental operations,” and “that language is absolutely necessary to the
                    development of the human faculties.” Ideas, he asserts, cannot be associated
                    with one another, except by being associated with words or other signs which
                    become the materials of a language. On this doctrine he establishes a definition
                    of memory, which is altogether unique, that it consists in the recalling of
                    words or circumstances relating to a perception; the recalling of the perception
                    itself belongs to imagination, while it is reminiscence that makes us recognise
                    it as one which we have formerly entertained. He denies all memory to animals,
                    because they have no language. Thus a futile fallacy led him to form a verbal
                    distinction, founded on no difference in the nature of things. A person
                    destitute of language, and wishing to have it in his power, on future occasions,
                    to recal a particular idea, might certainly find means adapted to his purpose,
                    by associating it with different objects. These objects would serve the same
                    purpose as the signs of which our languages consist. Some such associations are
                    essential to memory. The slightest attention will show us that words or signs
                    serve no other purpose than is done by all kinds of ideas, in assisting the mind
                    to make use of one another. λVhat this author calls a sign, is merely another
                    idea intentionally associated with that which we principally wish to recollect.
                    We may give the latter numerous associations, that it may have many chances of
                    being recalled. We associate it either with the most important or with the
                    readiest of our perceptions, that it may be recalled more perfectly, or with
                    greater certainty. The only circumstances that render some perceptions better
                    adapted to this end than others, are their importance, their familiarity, and
                    their analogy with those which have been previously used. We generally choose
                    our instruments of private recollection from the materials of language, because
                    these materials are already employed for communication. They are rendered
                    convenient by their variety, and by the classifications and analogies which were
                    followed in the first formation of them, as necessary for rendering them the
                    media of communication, and which, by connecting them powerfully together, give
                    them a high adaptation for extensive arrangements. Language, in that state of
                    improvement in which it exists in a cultivated age, extends intellectual
                    operations; but it neither adds any radically distinct faculty, nor gives origin
                    to any new genus of mental exercise. Condillac says, that “a man without
                    language could not recal his ideas, except when placed in the same circumstances
                    in which they had been formerly presented.” The obvious answer to this is, that
                    language, in so far as it serves this purpose, consists in the multiplication of
                    the assisting circumstances in which a man is placed when a perception is
                    formed. Many ingenious illustrations are subjoined, which are deserving of
                    attention; but when well considered they will lead to conclusions diíFering from
                    those which the author endeavours to establish. In viewing the mind in its
                    active state, he justly observes, that objects attract its attention only as
                    they are connected with our temperament, our passions, our condition, and our
                    wants; and this principle is afterwards beautifully applied to the illustration
                    of the earliest acquisitions of knowledge, and of the difference of character
                    between them and many that succeed at a later period. But no person would affirm
                    that our wants are the signs of our perceptions, though various perceptions are
                    powerfully recalled by their means.</p>
                <p>The opinions of the author certainly led him to ascribe too much to language. It
                    is to the want of signs that he traces the whole disadvantages of the deaf,
                    whereas we know that they are entirely owing to the deficiencies of their mental
                    intercourse with others, that is, to their privation, not of the private, but of
                    the social use of language. We find that the great improvements now made in the
                    art of communicating with the deaf have made these disadvantages to disappear.
                    The young man of Chartres, who was born deaf, but acquired the faculty of
                    hearing when of adult age, and was therefore able to describe the state of his
                    understanding during his former deafness, declared, that when he made the sign
                    of the cross, and joined in the other ceremonies of the Roman Catholic religion,
                    he had never attached to them any meaning, or supposed that any thing was
                    represented by them. Thus, for want of language, he is represented as destitute
                    of ideas. In this instance, however, we only perceive <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194749937" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9937-0205"/>the facility with which men
                    imitate one another’s acts and professions, without exercising independent
                    thought. The difference between this deaf man and most other persons was, that
                    he took the propriety of the ceremonies for granted, being entirely led by
                    example, while those who had heard their meaning explained acquiesced with
                    reverence and complacency in certain verbal positions connected with them,
                    without ever inquiring into their meaning or their merits. Another illustration
                    is taken from a man, who, though lie enjoyed the faculty of hearing, had lived
                    apart from all association with his species in the forest of Lithuania. But it
                    is easy to show that the great mental deficiencies of that individual arose from
                    the want of society, and not simply from the want of a language to supply his
                    private meditations with signs.</p>
                <p>It is in the art of calculation that the utility of signs is most conspicuous in
                    forwarding the progress of intellectual operation, and it is there that we find
                    a language presented to the eye, which is adapted in a most perfect degree to
                    the purposes of the mind. Hence the use of signs for expressing our ideas of
                    number is a favourite topic with Condillac and the other adherents of the
                    doctrines of the Nominalists. The number ninety-nine could not be distinguished
                    from a hundred, except by language. Ninety-nine objects placed together would
                    not convey a different perception from a number varying from it by one less or
                    one more. It is an error, however, to imagine, that the words one hundred, or
                    the ciphers (100) by which the number is represented, give us a perfect idea of
                    any number. They only represent one relation of it to a certain mode of
                    accumulation, the decimal series. Independently of all language, general
                    features may be perceived to characterize objects too complicated to be
                    comprehended by any human mind.</p>
                <p>Condillac, seduced by his favourite theories, condemns one of the most profound
                    and useful of the practical observations of Locke, that the best way of arriving
                    at correct knowledge is to consider ideas by themselves, independently of their
                    signs. This exercise our author pronounces to be utterly impracticable; and all
                    that he attempts to recommend in its stead is the precaution of employing only
                    such words as are well understood. How can words be understood, unless the ideas
                    which they represent are considered as detached from all association with them,
                    and thus exempted from the embarrassing influence of fallacious analogies?</p>
                <p>Regarding language as a necessary instrument of mental operations, he makes some
                    observations on the parts of speech, and the manner in which they are connected
                    in sentences. He describes with ingenuity the steps by which words pass from
                    expressing sensible qualities to become the names of mental faculties. Here we
                    perceive a glimmering of some truths which have been since luminously displayed
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Essays</hi> of. Mr Dugald Stewart. He
                    introduces at the same time some speculations on the origin of abstract terms,
                    which are not entitled to equal approbation. He takes occasion, however, to make
                    one remark which is both beautiful and just, that men have too often imagined
                    that words perfectly explain the essence and nature of tilings, whereas they
                    express in reality nothing more than some imperfect analogies. This position,
                    followed to its consequences, would suggest a correction of a great part of the
                    author’s errors.</p>
                <p>In describing the pronoun, he gives way to a species of metaphysical mysticism,
                    by which he is grievously misled. He conceives that this class of words must be
                    of late formation, because some difficulty must have occurred in substituting
                    another word for the proper name of an object. He did not here consider that
                    nothing of the essence of an object, nothing but qualities, circumstances, or
                    accidents, is expressed by the proper name, more than by the pronoun. The same
                    man may be “John,” “father,” “brother,” “master,” “subject,” “I,” “thou,” or
                    “he,” according to the occasions on which the mention of him is introduced. All
                    the designations applied to him are equally proper and easily made.</p>
                <p>Yet this work is well worthy of an attentive perusal. We find in it a brilliancy
                    of expression which renders it more amusing than metaphysical dissertations
                    often are; although it must be confessed that there is in some instances a false
                    simplicity, arising from an attempt to represent metaphysical science as easier
                    than it really is. In his subsequent works he acknowledges that he had fallen
                    into some errors from the precipitate views which he took of the mental powers;
                    but he specifies no particulars; and a reader who does not acquiesce in all his
                    improved views will not easily see the exact corrections which the author made
                    on those contained in his <hi rend="italic">Essai.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1749 he published his <hi rend="italic">Traité des Systèmes,</hi> the object
                    of which was to show the futility of the doctrines derived from those
                    hypothetical systems which were the offspring of an erroneous mode of procedure
                    in the pursuit of knowledge; such as those which set out with general or
                    abstract maxims, and pretend to establish on them a body of profound science.
                    Another kind consists of arbitrary suppositions, laid down as principles for the
                    explanation of things which cannot be otherwise accounted for. These are a
                    convenient resource for ignorance; they are formed with so much pleasure and so
                    little trouble, that a man in bed may, by their aid, create and govern the
                    universe. He illustrates the conspicuous influence which this mode of
                    systematizing had on opinions in metaphysics. He takes a view of the system of
                    innate ideas as maintained by Descartes; that of Malebranche, who reduced all
                    knowledge and all mental activity to operations which had the divine essence for
                    their objects; that of Leibnitz, who explained the laws both of matter and of
                    mind by general functions pertaining to simple and indivisible beings, which he
                    called <hi rend="italic">monades;</hi> and that of Spinoza, who reduced all
                    nature and all existence to one simple substance, of which the various
                    phenomena, material and mental, are only modifications. The last of these
                    systems had created some commotion in the philosophical and religious world, as
                    adverse to a belief in moral distinctions. Condillac treats the argument with a
                    dignified delicacy, as having received a wrong direction in the writings of that
                    author, in consequence of the erroneous methods of investigation which he
                    employed. His words are, “Does Baylc believe that he has refuted Spinoza, by
                    exposing the consequences which he himself draws from the system of that
                    philosopher? If these are not really its consequences, he does not attack
                    Spinoza. If they are, Spinoza will reply that they are not at all absurd, and
                    only appear so to persons who are unable to ascend to the principles of things.
                    Destroy, he will say, my principles, if you would overthrow my system; or if you
                    let my principles alone, assent to the propositions which are their necessary
                    consequences.” “My object,” says Condillac, “has been to show that Spinoza had
                    no idea of the positions which he advanced; that his definitions are vague, his
                    axioms inaccurate, and his propositions entirely the work of imagination, and
                    include nothing that can lead to the knowledge of things. Having done this, I
                    proceed no farther. To attack the phantoms which arise from his principles,
                    would be as preposterous as the feats of the knights-errant, who combated the
                    spectres of the sorcerers. The wisest plan is to destroy the enchantment.”
                    Having shown the radical fallacy of the principles adopted by the preceding
                    writers, he points out the cases in which hypotheses assist human knowledge. The
                    first is, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749950" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9950-0206"/>when
                    we can exhaust all the hypotheses that can be formed on any subject, and possess
                    a rule for distinguishing that which is admissible. Of this we have examples in
                    the pure mathematics. A second kind of hypothesis includes those which are
                    employed in astronomy, provided they are limited to the object of accounting for
                    the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. A third occasion on which they ought not
                    to be rejected is, when they facilitate observation, by giving greater
                    palpability to truths attested by experience, he mentions the importance of
                    general systems formed by a process of induction. He points out the necessity of
                    general systems in politics, founded on the character and condition of the
                    different classes of men who constitute the body politic; and concludes with a
                    view of the advantage derived from system in the arts. He gives some useful
                    practical observations on the application of mathematical and metaphysical
                    analysis. This treatise abounds in excellent remarks on human character, as
                    displayed both in intellectual pursuits and in the business of life. His
                    comparison of Locke and Malcbranche is a masterpiece of description.</p>
                <p>Next in order, his <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Sensations</hi> made its appearance in 1754∣; a work which displays a truly
                    philosophical spirit, uniting boldness with circumspection. The mode in which he
                    investigates the origin of ideas of sense, and the progress of intellectual
                    operation, bad the merit of some originality, and afforded an undoubted
                    advantage to the prosecution of the most interesting inquiries. He considers the
                    sense in a separate state, by forming the supposition of a being created without
                    sensations. He supposes this being in the first instance to be endowed with the
                    sense of smell, and describes the mental character which would thus be formed.
                    He gives a similar account of the other senses, and examines successively the
                    effects of their combinations, till he arrives at the description of a complete
                    human being.</p>
                <p>His uniform aim is to show <hi rend="italic">that all ideas and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">alimentai</hi><hi rend="italic">phenomena consist of sensations
                    transformed.</hi> Those who reject that doctrine will still acknowledge the
                    beauty and ingenuity of his train of description. The conclusion itself is
                    refuted by the slightest reflection on the very scope of the author. He
                    evidently supposes the man who becomes thus complete by receiving his different
                    external senses in succession, to have been previously in possession of dormant
                    intellectual faculties; for his descriptions, while they apply to man, will not
                    apply to many other animated beings whose senses are equally perfect, because
                    the use which they are able to make of the impressions received is either
                    incomparably more limited or different in kind. If the results of intellectual
                    operation are nothing else than sensations transformed, the transformation is
                    certainly more important than the original materials, and the transforming power
                    cannot be lightly esteemed by any one who values extended knowledge. The
                    favourite theme of the author, however, detracts but little from the pleasure
                    which this ingenious work imparts. Some would pronounce the discussions which it
                    contains to be not strictly analytical. Analysis should begin with man as he
                    exists in a complicated state, with all his senses as well as his faculties
                    entire, and proceed to separate his constituent powers by successive
                    subdivisions, till, in its progress downwards, it arrives at the description of
                    each sense and each species of intellectual operation in a separate and simple
                    state. The description of a man endowed in that kind of succession which
                    Condillac describes, is a purely hypothetical process, more allied to arbitrary
                    synthesis than to analysis. By analysis, however, the author means, in a general
                    way, the task of surveying in succession the parts of which compound objects
                    consist, and examining separately the relations by which they are connected,
                    without any reference to the order of procedure. Decomposition and recomposition
                    he, in a subsequent work, represents as alike belonging to analysis; and though
                    from etymology the Greek word <hi rend="italic">synthesis</hi> is the same with
                    that of the Latin word <hi rend="italic">composition,</hi> he limits the former
                    term to that mode of composition which he condemns, that which begins with
                    general or abstract doctrines, and which regards these as the ground of systems
                    pretending to explain the existing world. Although his order of description of
                    the senses is so far hypothetical as to have nothing corresponding to it in the
                    natural history of man, he regarded it as sufficiently capable of being
                    substantiated by close comparison with every man’s experience, and thus
                    distinguished from the offspring of an arbitrary synthesis.</p>
                <p>These works having procured for the author a distinguished character in the
                    philosophical world, he was appointed preceptor to the infant Duke of Parma,
                    grandson of Louis XV.; and, in applying himself to the discharge of the duties
                    of that office, he brought into exercise the same talents which had shone so
                    conspicuously in his writings. He composed a course of studies <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cours d’Etudes']</hi> in thirteen volumes, including <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grammaire,</hi><hi rend="italic">ÎArt dEcrire, ïArt</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Raisonner,</hi><hi rend="italic">l’Art</hi><hi rend="italic">de Penser,</hi>
                    occupying the first four volumes, succeeded by nine volumes <hi rend="italic">On
                    Ancient and Modern History.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">Grammaire</hi> exhibits,
                    in his own able manner, doctrines in universal grammar nearly allied to those
                    which generally prevailed, and which we find in the <hi rend="italic">Grammaire
                    Générale et</hi><hi rend="italic">Raisoìinée</hi> of the Port Royal. The
                    author’s favourite principle, that every language is an analytical method, runs
                    through the body of his work, and probably leads him to pay too great respect to
                    the technical differences of the parts of speech, as indicating thoughts of
                    different classes. <hi rend="italic">L’Art d'</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecrire</hi>
                    is a most agreeable and enlightened system of general criticism, and adds to
                    this the merit of exhibiting an interesting view of French literature, in the
                    examples of good and of faulty writing by which the precepts contained in it are
                    illustrated. The whole rules relative to style are referred to one principle,
                    that a writer ought to conform his diction and his imagery to the most
                    fundamental associations of ideas. His rules thus deduced do not exhibit any
                    such difference from those of other authors as to form in his readers a style
                    marked by any singularities. On the contrary, we find him exempting literature
                    from the shackles of some rules, the close observance of which secures an
                    apparent accuracy at the expense of a natural ease, and showing his
                    susceptibility to the influence of a pure taste by bestowing approbation on
                    passages which a critic of a more formal cast would have thought himself called
                    upon to censure. His <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Raisonner</hi> is a work of singular excellence and utility. It is a luminous
                    exemplification of the rules of reasoning, in the steps of that mental progress
                    by which physical philosophers have unfolded the laws of motion, the principles
                    of mechanics, and the theory of the heavenly bodies. He discriminates with just
                    and beautiful effect the different kinds of evidence on which the various
                    doctrines of those branches of natural philosophy rest. This treatise is well
                    worthy of being known in our language, as it exhibits an uncommonly pleasing
                    road to an elegant department of physical knowledge, and furnishes a model for
                    the prosecution of other studies. His^4r∕ <hi rend="italic">de Penser,</hi>
                    notwithstanding all the ability which it displays, will probably be found the
                    least interesting part of the <hi rend="italic">Cours dEtudes,</hi> as it
                    chiefly consists in an explanation and recommendation of the author’s peculiar
                    notions on the nature of mind. His <hi rend="italic">Ancient and Modern
                    History</hi> forms a body of morality and legislation. His details are not
                    inspirited with the ardent eloquence of a popular historian who excites a deep
                    interest in individual<pb break="no" facs="nls:194749963"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-9963-0207"/> characters or insulated events. He does not
                    exhibit paintings to the imagination, but contents himself with furnishing
                    leading principles to the understanding. His style, though pure, is without
                    ornament and without fire, and hence his history has been much less read than
                    his other works.</p>
                <p>In 1768 he was admitted into the Academy of Sciences, on the death of the Abbé
                    d’Olivet; but he never afterwards appeared at any of the meetings of that
                    body.</p>
                <p>His attention being habitually directed to those subjects in which intellectual
                    exertion was most wanted, for the advancement of objects of general utility, he
                    published, in 1776, the results of his studies on Political Economy, in a work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Commerce</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et le Gouvernement, considérés relativement l’un à l’autre.</hi>
                    This work became an object of attack to the Economists; and the author, no
                    doubt, like most others who have written on that subject, committed some
                    mistakes. Yet he essentially improved the discussions connected with it, and he
                    exhibits a model of luminous arrangement in his mode of delivering his
                    opinions.</p>
                <p>The extended fame of Condillac procured for him a most honourable testimony of
                    esteem from the Polish nation. The council of public instruction of that nation
                    requested him, through the medium of Count Ignatius Potocki, to draw up an
                    elementary treatise on logic, for the use of their palatinal schools. This gave
                    birth to liis <hi rend="italic">Logique,</hi> which was published in 1780, a few
                    months before his death. The object of this work is to give a condensed account
                    of the principles of <hi rend="italic">analysis,</hi> taken in the acceptation
                    already mentioned. This process, he observes, is taught by nature, and is always
                    conducted with accuracy when man is in quest of the means of supplying the
                    urgent necessities of his being. It is when curiosity forms to him a separate
                    order of objects for his gratification, that he becomes precipitate in grasping
                    at conclusions, and embraces them with readiness, though not the produce of that
                    rigorous correctness of method which necessity imposes on his earlier pursuits.
                    In giving an account of the origin of ideas and the mental faculties, he
                    exemplifies his views of analysis, and, at the same time, prepares the way for
                    further applications of the mental powers of his pupils. He adheres to his
                    doctrine of the supreme and exclusive influence of language in conducting all
                    intellectual pursuits. Generalization and classification arc, with him, nothing
                    more than the contrivance of generic names. The art of reasoning is made to
                    consist in the formation of an appropriate language for the different sciences.
                    He considers the justness of our reasonings as depending on the degree of
                    perfection of the languages which we possess. The superior certainty of
                    mathematical compared with other knowledge is ascribed by him to the superior
                    accuracy of mathematical language. Hence his favourite illustrations of the
                    progress of the mind are taken from arithmetic and algebra.. This principle is
                    certainly carried by' him to great excess in the framing of his general
                    positions; yet we find him on other occasions recommending to his readers to
                    cultivate the unbiassed study of nature, and to choose their words rather from
                    the correctness of their application to objects, as they have fallen under
                    actual observation, than from having their meaning fixed by the unsatisfactory
                    formality of verbal definitions. He lays down some highly useful rules for the
                    prosecution of knowledge. His errors arise chiefly from a strained effort to
                    give to his subject a degree of simplicity not adapted to its nature. Hence some
                    of his maxims are more quaint than just; but, compared with the complicated
                    systems of logic previously in use, that of our author formed an improvement
                    which merited the grateful reception that was given to it; and, even at the
                    present day, if we pardon the paradoxical generalities by which it is
                    disfigured, we may profitably trace, in company with the author, the steps by
                    which many intellectual attainments are made, and the means by which the process
                    admits of being facilitated.</p>
                <p>The last work of Condillac, his posthumous treatise, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Langue</hi><hi rend="italic">des Calculs,</hi> formed an important
                    acquisition to science, which has not in this country been duly appreciated. In
                    some subordinate points it is not unexceptionable; for example, he here, as in
                    some of his former works, particularly his <hi rend="italic">Art</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Raisonner,</hi> perpetually repeats the assertion as of the
                    greatest importance, that just reasoning consists in tracing identical
                    propositions, and in passing from identity to identity. Aware of the objection
                    to which this assertion was exposed, that identical propositions can amount to
                    nothing more than futile and stagnant truisms, he imagines that this objection
                    is answered by stating that, in the different steps of a process of calculation,
                    there is <hi rend="italic">an identity of ideas,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">a
                    difference in words,</hi> which is certainly a gross paralogism. In one or two
                    passages he states with greater truth, though apparently by accident, that a
                    process of calculation consists in considering the same objects in different
                    points of view; a proposition which ought to have had that conspicuous place in
                    his treatise which he gives to his doctrine of perfect identity. If this single
                    alteration is made in the mind of the reader, the <hi rend="italic">Langue des
                    Calculs</hi> will be perused with the highest profit. An English translation of
                    it would form an important accession to the means of an enlightened education in
                    this country', as leading, by pleasant steps, to the highest scientific
                    attainments.</p>
                <p>Condillac is to be considered as in the soundest sense of the word an amiable
                    man. If he had an apparent reserve, and in some respects a want of fervour,
                    these apparent defects were more than compensated by the steadiness of his
                    conduct. In early life he was intimate with J. J. Rousseau, Diderot, and Duclos.
                    But he indulged no hazardous speculations on the general interests of mankind,
                    and cherished no modes of thinking which tended to divide or distract the age.
                    He was sincerely public-spirited; and his conciliating sentiments will, perhaps,
                    among those who most accurately weigh them, be respected as morally sublime. As
                    a well-wisher to the fortunes of his species, he acted on a principle which he
                    considers as having uniformly operated in the production of former improvements.
                    He dwells on the value of the attainments already made, as an exercise fitted to
                    create a spontaneous disposition to extend them, divested of the spirit of
                    party, and exempt from rashness. Hence his works were not only' much read by
                    individuals, but were employed in many of the continental seminaries of
                    education, and, without exciting discontent or apprehension, except among the
                    inflexible scholastics of Spain, proved successful in illuminating the age in
                    which they appeared. He died in August 1780, on his estate near Bangenci, where
                    he had cultivated a life of retirement, though not more allied to solitude than
                    as it was exempt from the scenes of public bustle and prevalent ambition.</p>
