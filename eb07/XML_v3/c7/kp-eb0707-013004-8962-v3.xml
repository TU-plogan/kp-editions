                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Columbus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Christopher,</hi> the
                    celebrated navigator and discoverer of the western world, was born in the city
                    of Genoa, about the year 1446. Although several illustrious families have
                    contended for his alliance to them, his father Domenicoand his ancestors appear
                    to have followed the trade of woolcombers or carders, and were of humble though
                    reputable origin. Columbus received his education at the university of Padua,
                    and, having evinced an early passion for the sea, entered into nautical life at
                    the age of fourteen. The first voyage in which we have any authentic accounts of
                    his being engaged, was a warlike expedition fitted out at Genoa in 1459, when,
                    associated with hardy and daring adventurers, he acquired so much distinction as
                    to be intrusted with a separate command. After this, it is supposed, he was
                    employed in various commercial, pious, and predatory expeditions against the
                    Mahömme-dans and Venetians, in company with a famous corsair of his own name and
                    family, and acquired reputation and experience in his profession. His son
                    Fernando relates, that in an engagement off the coast of Portugal with four
                    Venetian galleys, returning richly laden from Flanders, the vessel on board
                    which he served, and one of the Venetian ships to which it was grappled, took
                    fire. Columbus threw himself into the sea, seized an oar which was floating near
                    him, and by this means, and his dexterity in swimming, reached the shore,
                    although two leagues distant. Proceeding thereafter to Lisbon, he was induced.to
                    take up his residence in that capital.</p>
                <p>Columbus became acquainted in Lisbon with the most eminent men in science and
                    maritime art, whom the encouragement of Prince Henry of Portugal had attracted
                    around him. At this period (anno 1470) he was in the vigour of manhood, of an
                    engaging appearance, grave, courteous, and affable in his deportment, moderate
                    and simple in his diet and apparel, eloquent in discourse, possessing high
                    magnanimity, and a temper which, though irritable, was under the control of a
                    gentle and enthusiastic piety. Here he married Doña Felipa, daughter of
                    Bartolomeo Moñìs de Palestrello, an Italian cavalier lately deceased, and a
                    distinguished navigator, who had discovered and colonized the island of Porto
                    Santo. Having obtained possession of the journals and charts of this sea
                    captain, and also bearing accounts of his voyages from his widow, Columbus was
                    seized with an irresistible desire of visiting unknown regions. In order to
                    indulge it, he made a voyage to Madeira, and continued during several years to
                    trade with that island, the Canaries, Azores, the settlements in Guinea, and the
                    other places which the Portuguese had discovered on the continent of Africa. By
                    the experience acquired in such a number of voyages, Columbus became one of the
                    most skilful navigators in Europe.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of the fifteenth century the intelligence of Europe, and
                    particularly of Portugal, was directed in seeking everywhere for the “scattered
                    lights of geographical knowledge.” The lofty and enterprising mind of Prince
                    Henry, matured by diligent researches and laborious investigation, conceived the
                    idea of the circumnavigation of Africa; and under his auspices the Cape of Good
                    Hope was doubled, and the commerce of the East thrown open to maritime
                    adventure. At this period, whilst invention and skill were well nigh exhausted
                    in the projection and accomplishment of this eventful discovery, the existence
                    of the western world was never dreamt of; the Atlantic Ocean was regarded with
                    awe and wonder, “ 'seeming,” says Washington Irving, “to bound the world as with
                    a chaos, into which conjecture could not penetrate, and enterprise feared to
                    adventure.” The danger and tediousness of the voyage by Africa first set
                    Columbus to ruminate whether a shorter and more direct passage to the East
                    Indies could not be found out; and after long consideration, he became
                    thoroughly convinced that, by sailing across the Atlantic in a westwardly
                    direction, new countries, probably forming a part of the vast continent of
                    India, would infallibly be discovered. He was led to this conviction by the
                    theories of the ancients and the discoveries of the moderns, aided by his own
                    experience and the advancement of science. Adopting as a fundamental principle,
                    that the earth was a terraqueous globe, traversable round from east to west, he
                    acquired a notion of its true figure. His eminent biographer, Washington Irving,
                    relates, that “he divided the circumference from east to west at the equator,
                    according to Ptolemy, into twenty-four hours, of fifteen degrees each, making
                    three hundred and sixty degrees. Of these he imagined, comparing the globe of
                    Ptolemy with the earlier map of Marinus of Tyre, that fifteen hours had been
                    known to the ancients, extending from the Canary or Fortunate Islands, to the
                    city of Thinae, in Asia, the western and eastern extremities of the known world.
                    The Portuguese had advanced the western frontier one hour more by the discovery
                    of the Azores and Cape de Verde Islands; still <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194748975" xml:id="kp-eb0707-8975-0131"/>about eight hours, or one
                    third of the circumference of the earth, remained to be explored. This space he
                    imagined to be occupied in a great measure by the eastern regions of Asia, which
                    might extend so far as to approach the western shores of Europe and Africa. A
                    navigator, therefore, by pursuing a direct course from east to west, must arrive
                    at the extremity of Asia, or discover any intervening land. The great obstacle
                    to be apprehended was from the tract of ocean that might intervene; but this
                    could not be very wide, if the opinion of Alfraganus the Arabian were admitted,
                    who, by diminishing the size of the degrees, gave to the earth a smaller
                    circumference than was assigned to it by other cosmographers; a theory to which
                    Columbus seems generally to have given much faith. He was fortified also by the
                    opinion of Aristotle, Seneca, Pliny, and Strabo, who considered the ocean as but
                    of moderate breadth, so that one might pass from Cadiz westward to the Indies in
                    a few days.”</p>
                <p>Columbus received a decided confirmation of his theory in 1474, not only from
                    Paolo Toscanelli, one of the ablest cosmographers of the day, and from the
                    narrative of Marco Polo, a Venetian traveller, whose map proved of great
                    assistance to our navigator in his first voyage of discovery; but also from the
                    observations of several more modern navigators. Martin Vicenti, a Portuguese
                    pilot, proceeding farther westward than usual, found a piece of artificially
                    carved timber floating on the sea, and, as it was wafted by a westerly wind,
                    conjectured that it might have come from some unknown land in that direction.
                    Pedro Correo, the brother-in-law of Columbus, found a similar piece of wood on
                    Porto Santo; and had also seen canes of an enormous size floating upon the
                    waves, which resembled those described by Ptolemy as growing in India. After a
                    course of westwardly winds, trees torn up by the roots were often driven upon
                    the coast of the Azores; and at one time the dead bodies of two men, with
                    singular features, different from those of any known race of people, were cast
                    upon the island of Flores.</p>
                <p>On these grounds Columbus formed the vast and daring enterprise which was
                    destined to hand down his name to posterity with unfading honour; and, firmly
                    established in a belief of the successful result of his projects, “he never,”
                    says Irving, “spoke in doubt or hesitation; but with as much certainty as if his
                    eyes had beheld the promised land. A deep religious sentiment also mingled with
                    his thoughts, and gave them at times a tinge of superstition, but of a sublime
                    and lofty kind. He looked upon himself as standing in the hand of heaven, chosen
                    from among men for the accomplishment of its high purpose; he read, as he
                    supposed, his contemplated discovery foretold in holy writ, and shadowed forth
                    darkly in the prophecies. The ends of the earth were to be brought together, and
                    all nations, and tongues, and languages, united under the banners of the
                    Redeemer.”</p>
                <p>The disturbed state of Portugal under Alphonso retarded the progress of
                    discovery. The compass, though in general use, had not gained that reliance
                    which induced mariners fearlessly to brave the dangers of the deep; and the
                    project of a voyage through boundless wastes appeared extravagant and
                    impracticable. Nothing daunted, however, by these disheartening symptoms,
                    Columbus pursued his favourite schemes with ardour, and longed to put them into
                    execution. So perilous an adventure was not, however, to be attempted without
                    the patronage of some sovereign power.; and John II. of Portugal having at this
                    juncture ascended the throne, and being favourably inclined to the cause of
                    discovery, Columbus made his proposals, which were graciously received by the
                    monarch, and referred to a learned junto, consisting of Roderigo and Joseph, two
                    physicians, and Diego <hi rend="subscript"> -</hi> Ortiz, bishop of Ceuta, all
                    men of learning and science. Unfortunately, however, these were the persons who
                    had been the chief directors of the Portuguese navigations, and had advised to
                    search for a passage to India by an opposite course to that which Columbus
                    recommended as shorter and more certain. They could not therefore approve of his
                    proposal without submitting to the double mortification of condemning their own
                    theory and of acknowledging his superiority. The result of their conferences
                    therefore was, that they recommended the king to fit out a caravel privately,
                    and attempt the proposed discovery by the designated route, which they
                    ascertained from charts and details craftily obtained from Columbus. John, in an
                    evil hour, had the weakness to adopt this perfidious counsel. The caravel
                    departed, but the pilots had neither the genius nor fortitude of Columbus; their
                    courage failed, and putting back to the Cape de Verde Islands, they returned
                    from thence to Lisbon, execrating the project as extravagant and irrational.</p>
                <p>This ungenerous and unworthy attempt roused the indignation of Columbus, who
                    immediately quitted Portugal, taking with him his infant son Diego, and made
                    application to the government of Genoa'; but this republic, weakened by the
                    reverses of war, rejected a proposal that would have restored their ancient
                    splendour, and might for a long period have “perpetuated the golden w;and of
                    commerce in the failing grasp of Italy.” Columbus next carried his proposition
                    to Venice, where he was equally unsuccessful. He also sent his brother
                    Bartholomew to lay his plans before Henry VII. of England, having in the mean
                    time sailed himself for Spain, where he arrived after having exhausted all his
                    means.</p>
                <p>Columbus, in this state of abject poverty, met with great hospitality from Friar
                    Juan Perez de Marchena; and, encouraged by this worthy ecclesiastic and his
                    friends, and assisted by the generosity of Martin Alonzo Pinzon, he set out for
                    the Castilian court at Cordova in the spring of 1486. The moment was
                    unpropitious for such a proposition, the Spanish sovereign being at the time
                    engaged in military preparations against the Moorish kings. At length, through
                    the intercession of Cardinal Gonzalez, he obtained an interview, and submitted
                    his project to Ferdinand. True science had as yet made so little progress in
                    Spain, that most of those to whom the consideration of his plan was referred
                    were utterly ignorant of the first principles on which our adventurer founded
                    his hopes. Some, from mistaken notions concerning the dimensions of the globe,
                    contended that the voyage could not be performed in less than three years:
                    others concluded that Columbus would find the ocean of infinite extent,
                    according to the opinion of some ancient philosophers; or that if he should
                    steer beyond a certain point, the convex figure of the globe would present a
                    kind of mountain, up which the vessel could never sail with the most favourable
                    wind. Even without entering into particular discussion, some rejected the scheme
                    in general, making use of that maxim of the ignorant, “that it is presumptuous
                    in any person to suppose that he alone possesses knowledge superior to all the
                    rest of mankind united.” Worn out with a series of disappointments and delays,
                    and supporting himself by making maps and charts, Columbus, despairing of the
                    Spanish patronage, began to look to other courts, in hopes of meeting more
                    encouragement. He had already made preparations for this purpose, and taken
                    measures for the disposal of his children during his absence, when Juan Perez
                    solicited him to defer his journey, making application at the same time to
                    Isabella, the result of which was a gracious invitation of Columbus back to
                    court, accompanied with the present of a small sum to equip him for the journey.
                    The monarchs were now pledged to attend to his proposals, and negotiations were
                    set on foot to carry them into execution<pb break="no" facs="nls:194748988"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-8988-0132"/>. Columbus appeared before the persons appointed
                    to confer with him, with the same confident hopes of success as formerly, and
                    insisted on the same high recompense. He proposed that a small fleet should be
                    fitted out under his command to attempt the discovery, and stipulating that he
                    should be invested with the titles and privileges of admiral and viceroy of all
                    the seas and lands he should discover, with one tenth of all gains, either by
                    trade or commerce. He further offered to furnish an eighth of the cost, on
                    condition of enjoying an eighth of the profits. His terms were, however, deemed
                    inadmissible; the negotiation broke off, and Columbus, in indignation, mounting
                    his mule, was already on the road to Cordova, with the intention of immediately
                    proceeding to France, when he was overtaken by a messenger from the queen, who
                    had been prevailed upon by the arguments of Quintanilla and St Angel, two of
                    Columbus’ patrons, again to favour his undertakings. The negotiations were now
                    completed, and the capitulations were signed by Ferdinand and Isabella at Santa
                    Fé on the 17th of April 1492. The articles of agreement were to the following
                    effect:—That Columbus should be constituted high admiral in all the seas,
                    islands, and continents he should discover, with similar honours and
                    prerogatives to those enjoyed by the high admiral of Castile in his district. He
                    was also nominated viceroy and governor-general over all the said lands and
                    continents; and a tenth of all free profits arising from the merchandise and
                    productions of the countries within his admiralty was granted to him for ever.
                    Columbus, or his lieutenant, was to be sole judge of all causes and disputes
                    arising out of traffic between those countries and Spain. He was further
                    permitted to contribute an eighth part of the expense of expeditions to the
                    countries he expected to discover, and was entitled in return to an eighth part
                    of the profits. A principal object of Columbus in this undertaking was the
                    propagation of the Christian faith, to which he was a zealous devotee. Expecting
                    to arrive at the extremity of Asia, he hoped to spread the light of the gospel
                    among the barbarian nations of the East; and so confident were his
                    anticipations, that letters were actually given him by the sovereigns for the
                    Grand Khan of Tartary. Although the royal documents were signed both by
                    Ferdinand and Isabella, her separate crown of Castile defrayed all the expense;
                    and the queen in consequence reserved for her subjects of that kingdom an
                    exclusive right to all the benefits which might accrue from the success of the
                    expedition.</p>
                <p>The arrangement being finally completed, Columbus set sail on the 3d of August
                    1192, in three small vessels, only one of which (commanded by himself) was
                    completely decked. The two others were commanded by Martin Alonzo Pinzon and
                    Vicente Yáñez Pinzon. The expedition had sailed nearly 200 leagues to the
                    westward, when Columbus perceived that the needle of the coinpass, when night
                    set in, had varied; a circumstance which filled the pilots with consternation.
                    For this phenomenon he was obliged to invent a reason, which, though it did not
                    satisfy himself, yet served to dispel their fears. As the squadron advanced,
                    various indicationsof land, such as birds flying from the west, the water
                    becoming less salt, and occasionally covered with weeds, animated and supported
                    the courage of the crew; but at length murmursand fears began to prevail amongst
                    them. They had sailed for eleven days, wafted by a most propitious breeze, over
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> tranquil sea, without lowering or shifting a sail. The
                    rude seamen began to be alarmed that no other winds blew but easterly, and that
                    it would therefore be impossible for them ever to return home. A few light
                    breezes from the west allayed for a time their apprehensions, and several small
                    singing birds came in the morning and flew away at night. But the sailors lost
                    all patience, and became so mutinous and refractory that it required the utmost
                    address of Columbus to maintain his authority. The appearances of land, though
                    frequent, were in many instances deceiving; and at last the seamen broke forth
                    into loud clamours, and insisted upon abandoning the voyage. Fortunately,
                    however, on the following day, the manifestations of land were such as no longer
                    to admit of doubt. In the evening Columbus perceived a light glimmering at a
                    distance, and the next morning land was clearly seen about two leagues distant.
                    The sailors now burst forth into the most extravagant transports. They threw
                    themselves at the feet of Columbus, implored his pardon, and pronounced him to
                    be a person inspired by heaven with more than human sagacity and fortitude, to
                    accomplish a design so far beyond the ideas and conceptions of all former ages.
                    At daybreak, says his biographer Spotorno, on the 12th of October, the hero
                    landed, “<hi rend="italic">e di grand' orma</hi><hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nuovo mondo imprinted</hi> (and with his great footstep impressed
                    the new world). Columbus and his followers threw themselves on their knees; and
                    rising, the admiral drew his sword, planted the cross, hoisted the royal
                    standard, and in the presence of the astonished natives, who imagined that the
                    Spaniards had dropped from heaven, took possession of these new countries in the
                    names of the Castilian sovereigns, giving the island the name of San Salvador.
                    Having visited several of the West India islands, and settled a colony in
                    Hispaniola, he again set sail for Spain. ∙ On the voyage he fell in with the
                    Pinta, which had separated from him for a long time through the wickedness of
                    the captain, who had gone in search of gold. After encountering several violent
                    tempests, Columbus arrived in the Tagus, near Lisbon, on the 4th of March 1493.
                    He was treated with the most honourable attentions by the court of Portugal, and
                    finally reached the port of Palos on the 15th of March.</p>
                <p>The triumphant return of Columbus excited the most unbounded transport. Wherever
                    he went the air rang with acclamations, and he received such honours as are paid
                    to sovereigns. The court was then at Barcelona, and Columbus took care
                    immediately to acquaint the king and queen of his arrival. They were no less
                    delighted than astonished with this unexpected event. The admiral was conducted
                    into the city with all imaginable pomp. The sovereigns received him seated in
                    state under a rich canopy of brocade of gold, surrounded by their principal
                    nobility. When he approached they stood up, and, raising him as he kneeled to
                    kiss their hands, ordered him to be seated in their presence, and give a
                    circumstantial account of his voyage. When he had finished his oration, which he
                    delivered with much modesty and simplicity, the king and queen, kneeling down,
                    offered up solemn thanks to God for the discovery. Every possible mark of honour
                    that could be suggested by gratitude or admiration was conferred on Columbus;
                    the former capitulation was confirmed, his family was ennobled, and a fleet
                    ordered to be equipped, to enable the navigator to go in quest of those more
                    opulent countries which he still confidently expected to find.</p>
                <p>The successful attainment of the splendid discovery of Columbus, great and
                    manifold as were its advantages to mankind, was the prelude to the dark and
                    troubled epoch of his life. By his second voyage to the western world he no
                    doubt in part realized his expectations, extended his discoveries, and came back
                    to Spain with substantial proofs of success; but the ostensible purpose of his
                    return was to obtain reparation of injurious imputations which had been heaped
                    upon him, and generally to have his privileges confirmed and enlarged so as to
                    enable him to exercise his authority over the colonists, who had become
                    re-ſractory<pb break="no" facs="nls:194749001" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9001-0133"/>
                    and unmanageable. But his third voyage only accelerated his disastrous fate. The
                    newly discovered possessions were distracted with the horrors of rebellion. The
                    verdant and blooming isles, the expected abodes of peace and happiness, were
                    converted into theatres of sanguinary conflicts and misery; and Columbus found
                    himself an object of fear and execration. It was during this voyage that he
                    landed on the coast of Paria, in South America. Meanwhile, his enemies in the
                    old world were not idle. An investigation into his conduct was instituted under
                    the control of Francisco Bovadilla, who was empowered, should he find the charge
                    of mal-administration proved, to supersede Columbus, and assume the government
                    of Hispaniola. The result was, that he and his brothers Diego and Bartolomeo,
                    after having been treated with the greatest indignities, w cre sent to Spain in
                    chains. From these disgraceful bonds he was immediately on his arrival released
                    by the Spanish monarchs; but his complaints were tardily acknowledged; he again
                    sunk into obscurity, and was reduced’to such straitened circumstances that,
                    according to his own account, “he had no place to repair to except an inn, and
                    very frequently had not wherewithal to pay his reckoning.”</p>
                <p>At length he was again employed in a fourth voyage, with restricted powers. But
                    the result was unpropitious; and he returned to Spain, dejected in mind and worn
                    out with bodily infirmities. Death at last relieved him from his earthly
                    afflictions. He expired on the 2Oth of May 1506, commending, with his latest
                    breath, his spirit to God. A marble tomb was reared over his dust, bearing the
                    inscription,</p>
                <p>A Castilla y a Leon,</p>
                <p>Nuevo mondo dio Colon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To
                    Castile and to Leon, a new world gave Colon.</p></note></p>
                <p>Columbus was a man of great and original genius, energetic in his conduct, and
                    possessed of lofty, daring, but noble ambition. “The magnanimity of his nature,”
                    says Irving, “shone forth through all the troubles of his stormy career. Though
                    continually outraged in his dignity, braved in his authority, foiled in his
                    plans, and endangered in his person, by the seditions of turbulent and worthless
                    men, and that, too, at times when suffering under anguish of body and anxiety of
                    mind, enough to exasperate the most patient, yet he restrained his valiant and
                    indignant spirit, and brought himself to forbear, and reason, and even to
                    supplicate.” His piety, though tinctured with superstition, was genuine and
                    fervent. If on certain occasions his religion displayed itself in harshness and
                    severity, the spirit of the age he lived in must be adverted to in palliation of
                    his conduct. His temperament was deeply imbued with poetic enthusiasm. “It
                    spread,” remarks Irving, “a golden and glorious world around him, and tinged
                    every thing with its own gorgeous colours. It betrayed him into visionary
                    speculations, which subjected him to the sneers and cavils of men of cooler and
                    safer but more grovelling minds. It filled his mind with solemn and visionary
                    meditations on mystic passages of the Scriptures, and on the shadowy portents of
                    the prophecies.” “His soul,” observes a Spanish writer, “was superior to the age
                    in which he lived. For him was reserved the great enterprise of traversing a sea
                    which had given rise to so many fables, and of deciphering the mystery of his
                    age.” “With all the visionary fervour of his imagination,” adds Washington
                    Irving, “its fondest dreams fell short of the reality. He died in ignorance of
                    the real grandeur of his discovery. Until his last breath he entertained the
                    idea that he had merely opened a new way to the old resorts of opulent commerce,
                    and had discovered some of the wild regions of the East. He supposed Hispaniola
                    to be&lt; the ancient Ophir which had been visited by the ships of king Solomon,
                    and that Cuba and Terra Firma were but remote parts of Asia. What visions of
                    glory would have broken upon his mind could he have known that he had indeed
                    discovered a new continent, equal to the old world in magnitude, and separated
                    by two vast oceans from all the earth hitherto known by civilized man 1 and how
                    would his magnanimous spirit have been consoled, amidst the afflictions of age
                    and the cares of penury, the neglect of a fickle public and the injustice of an
                    ungrateful king, could he have anticipated the splendid empires which would
                    arise in the beautiful world he had discovered, and the nations, and tongues,
                    and languages which were to fill its lands with his renown, and to revere and
                    bless his name to the latest posterity!” It will be remarked that Mr Irving, in
                    accordance with the generally entertained belief of all his biographers, alludes
                    to Columbus as being the first discoverer of the American continent. It has,
                    however, been lately ascertained that the earliest navigator who touched the
                    American continent was Sebastian Cabot, who discovered Newfoundland and Labrador
                    in June 1497, nearly a year previous to the visit of Columbus on the coast of
                    Paria; and it seems more than probable that Columbus was aware of Cabot’s
                    discovery. " See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cabot.</hi></p>
                <p>Few subjects have afforded more abundant matter for learned discussion than the
                    records that from time to time have appeared relating to Columbus. His
                    birth-place alone has given rise to much ingenious and unprofitable speculation.
                    That point, as well as the dates of his birth, and several voyages, are now
                    pretty correctly ascertained. The curious in such investigations are referred to
                    the Spanish and Italian authors, particularly to <hi rend="italic">Dissertazione

                <p>In addition to these points of minor and less general interest, several
                    controversies have arisen bearing upon the claims of Columbus to the discovery
                    of the western world; but such disputes, at least in so far as they affect the
                    discovery of the <hi rend="italic">Columbian archipelago,</hi> are proved to be
                    idle and futile; as no doubt now remains of Columbus having been the first
                    navigator of the old world who reached the island of San Salvador, and the first
                    who determined the existence of the western world. One of the most current
                    slanders on our navigator’s fair fame, as related by Inca Garcilaso, was, that
                    Alonzo Sanchez, sailing to the Canaries in 1484, reached the island of St
                    Domingo, and communicated his voyage and route to Columbus. Some other Spanish
                    writers notice the event without giving the name of the author of the discovery.
                    Oviedo considers these relations as mere vulgar fables. We are, however, told by
                    Columbus himself that he took advantage of such accounts as were transmitted to
                    him by Spanish and Portuguese mariners, some of whom had sailed westward so far
                    as to perceive what they considered to be indications of land. Gallo and
                    Giustiniani, authors contemporaneous with Columbus, assert that Bartholomew
                    Columbus first conceived the idea of western discovery, and communicated it to
                    his brother; but Columbus has been triumphantly vindicated from these ungenerous
                    aspersions by the unanimous testimony of the Spanish writers, among whom Las
                    Casas, who knew both brothers, and preserved many papers belonging to Columbus,
                    merits especial credence.</p>

                <p>But if any doubts remained, they are completely removed by the written
                    declaration of Ferdinand and Isabella, who, in a communication dated the 4th of
                    August 1494, write thus to the admiral: “One of the principal reasons for which
                    your discovery (the first) has caused so much joy to us is, that it is to be
                    ascribed to your genius (por ser in-ventada), and that it has been commenced and
                    terminated by your own individual endeavours, by your courage, your
                    perseverance, and industry.”</p>
