                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">COUNT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Comes</hi></label>, a nobleman
                    who possesses a domain erected into a county. English and Scottish counts we
                    distinguish by the title of Earls; foreign ones still retain their proper
                    designation. The dignity of count is intermediate between that of duke and
                    baron. According to the modern use, most plenipotentiaries and ambassadors
                    assume the title of counts though they have no county. Anciently, all generals,
                    counsellors, judges, and secretaries of cities under Charlemagne were called
                    counts; the distinguishing character of a duke and count being this, that the
                    latter had but one town under him, whereas the former had several.</p>
                <p>A count has a right to bear on his arms a coronet, adorned with three precious
                    stones, and surmounted with three large pearls, those in the middle and
                    extremities of the coronet advancing above the rest.</p>
                <p>Counts were originally lords of the court, or of the emperor’s retinue, and bad
                    their name of <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> either <hi rend="italic">α</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">comitando</hi> or <hi rend="italic">a commeando</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and hence those who were always in the palace, or at the
                    emperor’s side, were called <hi rend="italic">counts palatine,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">comites a latere.</hi></p>
                <p>In the times of the commonwealth, <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> among the Romans
                    was a general name for all those who accompanied the proconsuls and propraetors
                    into the provinces, there to serve the commonwealth; as the tribunes, prefects,
                    scribes, and others.</p>
                <p>Under the emperors, <hi rend="italic">comites</hi> were the officers of the
                    palace. The origin of what we now call counts seems to date from the time of
                    Augustus, who took several senators as his <hi rend="italic">comites,</hi> that
                    is, to accompany him in his voyages and travels, and to assist him in the
                    hearing of causes, which were thus judged with the same authority as in full
                    senate. But Gallienus seems to have abolished this council, by forbidding the
                    senators to appear in the armies; and none of his successors re-established
                    it.</p>
                <p>These counsellors of the emperor were really counts, <hi rend="italic"
                    >comites,</hi> or companions of the prince; and they sometimes took the title
                    accordingly, but always with the addition of the name of the emperor whom they
                    accompanied; so that it was rather a mark of their office than a title of
                    dignity. Constantine was the first who converted it into a dignity, and under
                    him the name was first given absolutely. But the title being once established,
                    it was in a little time indifferently conferred, not only on those who followed
                    the court, and accompanied the emperor, but also on most kinds of officers, a
                    long list of whom is given by Du Cange.</p>
                <p>Eusebius tells us that Constantine divided the counts into three classes: the
                    first bore the title of <hi rend="italic">illustres;</hi> the second that of <hi
                    rend="italic">clarissimi,</hi> and afterwards <hi rend="italic"
                    >spectabiles;</hi> whilst the third were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >perfectissimi.</hi> Of the first two classes the senate was composed; those of
                    the third had no place in the senate, but enjoyed several other of the
                    privileges of senators.</p>
                <p>There were counts who served on land, and others at’sea; some in a civil, some in
                    a religious, and some in a legal capacity; as <hi rend="italic">comes</hi><hi

                    >Rornoe, comes patrimonii,</hi> and so on'.</p>
                <p>The Franks, Germans, and other nations, on passing into Gaul and Germany, did not
                    abolish the form of the Roman government; and as the governors of cities and
                    provinces were called counts, <hi rend="italic">comites,</hi> and dukes, <hi
                    rend="italic">duces,</hi> they continued to be so designated. They commanded
                    during war, and in time of peace they administered justice. Thus, under
                    Charlemagne, counts were the ordinary judges and governors of the cities.</p>
                <p>These counts of cities rankedbelow the dukes and counts who presided over
                    provinces. The counts of provinces were in nothing inferior to dukes, who
                    themselves were only governors of provinces. Under the last of the second race
                    of French kings, their dignity was rendered hereditary, and they even usurped
                    the sovereignty. When Hugh Capet came to the crown, his authority was not
                    sufficient to oppose their encroachments; and hence it is that they date the
                    privilege of wearing coronets in their arms. They assumed it then, as enjoying
                    the rights of sovereigns in their particular districts or counties; but by
                    degrees most of the counties became reunited to the crown.</p>
                <p>The quality of count has now become very different from what it was anciently,
                    being no more than a title, which a king grants upon erecting a territory into a
                    county, with a reserve of jurisdiction and sovereignty to himself. At first
                    there was no clause in the patent of erection intimating the reversion of the
                    county to the crown in default of heirs male; but Charles IX. to prevent their
                    being too numerous, ordained that duchies and counties, in default of heirs
                    male, should revert to the crown.</p>
                <p>The point of precedence between counts and marquises was formerly much
                    controverted; and the reason was, that there were counts who were peers of
                    France, but no marquises. The point, however, was given up, and marquises took
                    precedence; although anciently, when counts were governors of provinces, they
                    were on a level even with dukes.</p>
                <p>William the Conqueror, as is observed by Camden, gave the dignity of counts in
                    fee to his nobles, annexing it to this or that county or province, and allotting
                    for their maintenance a certain proportion of money arising from the prince’s
                    profits in the pleadings and forfeitures of the provinces.</p>
                <p>The Germans call a count <hi rend="italic">graaf</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >graff,</hi> which properly signifiesjw¢¾’e, and is derived from <hi
                    rend="italic">gravio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">graffio,</hi> formed 1 from
                    ygapω, <hi rend="italic">I write.</hi> They have several kinds of counts or
                    graffs, as land-graves, march-graves, burg-graves, and palsgraves or counts
                    palatine. These last are of two kinds; the one of the number of princes, with
                    the investiture of a palatinate, while the others have only the title of count
                    palatine, without the investiture of any palatinate. Some assert that, by
                    publicly professing the imperial laws for twenty years, a person acquires the
                    title of count palatine; and there are instances of professors in law who have
                    assumed the title accordingly; but this right has been much disputed.</p>
