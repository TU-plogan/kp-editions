                <p>I. HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE CORN LAWS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">All</hi> governments, in every age of the world, have
                    interfered too much with the affairs of their subjects. A notion has very
                    generally prevailed, that certain branches of commerce were sometimes
                    advantageous to society, though ruinous to those who should attempt to carry
                    them on; and that other branches, though profitable to individuals, were
                    frequently inconsistent with the general advantage. On a first view, this
                    opinion, though essentially erroneous, seems sufficiently plausible. Many of the
                    pursuits of individuals apparently conduce very little, and may sometimes even
                    seem hostile, to the interests of the whole; and hence we are naturally enough
                    led to infer, that the public advantage would be best consulted by their
                    prohibition. Nothing evinces more strikingly the prevalence of this notion of
                    the propriety of restricting and directing the operations of industry and the
                    investment of capital, than the regulations respecting the trade in corn. This,
                    no doubt, is only what might have been expected. To secure an adequate supply of
                    food, and to obviate famine and scarcity, must always be an object of the first
                    importance with legislators; and while the efficacy of the regulating system is
                    unquestioned, it is here it will be chiefly called into action.</p>
                <p>When legislators abandon the principle of free competition, and imagine they can
                    give a more advantageous direction to national industry, their habits and
                    station in society have a powerful influence in determining the regulations they
                    adopt. Agriculturists raise corn for <hi rend="italic">sale,</hi> as well as for
                    their own consumption; and as they naturally endeavour to obtain the highest
                    price for their produce, where their voice predominates in the legislature of a
                    country, it is reasonable to presume, that the regulations respecting the trade
                    in corn will be framed with a design rather to enhance than to lower its price.
                    Whether they have that effect is an entirely different, and often a very
                    delicate inquiry; but unless there be pretty explicit evidence to the contrary,
                    it is not easy to imagine, that agriculturists, or those supported by
                    agriculture, should give their consent to any law intended to lower the value of
                    the products they have to dispose of. On the other hand, where the legislature
                    of a country is principally composed of merchants, manufacturers, capitalists,
                    and others depending on the profits of stock, as was formerly the case in
                    Holland, or where it is chiefly influenced by them, it is nearly certain it will
                    not intentionally adopt any measure which may have for its object to raise the
                    price of corn. When it is low, such persons obtain a comparatively large
                    quantity in exchange for their peculiar products or services. How then is it to
                    be expected that they should voluntarily consent to any measure which they
                    supposed would contribute to raise the price of so important an article?</p>
                <p>Throughout the principal continental states, the regulations affecting the corn
                    trade have been mostly framed with a view to keep down the price of corn. This
                    fact, however, is perfectly consistent with what has now been stated. After the
                    feudal system lost its energy, and the power of the great barons had been
                    weakened by the rise of cities and the consolidation of the royal authority,
                    monarchs were able to take such measures as appeared most likely to benefit the
                    lower classes of their subjects, which it was then their object to exalt. Of
                    these, none seems more natural, or better calculated to effect its object, than
                    the imposing of restrictions on the exportation of raw produce. If a nation
                    raise more corn than is required for its consumption, the first consequence of a
                    prohibition of export is undoubtedly to lower its value. It is certain, indeed,
                    that this effect will very soon cease; but, in early ages, men seldom attend to
                    prospective considerations, and it is not a very easy matter, even now, to
                    convince the bulk of mankind that the granting liberty to send abroad the
                    necessaries of life lowers their price at home. To demonstrate, or even
                    apprehend this principle, requires a considerable acquaintance with political
                    economy, a Science altogether unknown when the first laws respecting the corn
                    trade were framed in the European commonwealth. With a view still further to
                    reduce the price of corn, its free importation was very generally allowed; and,
                    in periods of scarcity, bounties or premiums, over and above the market price,
                    were sometimes given by the state to the importer.</p>
                <p>In this country’, an opposite course has been pursued. The Lords and Commons, the
                    first depending entirely, and the latter principally, on agriculture, having
                    attained great power and influence, we cannot be surprised at their having more
                    frequently exerted it to increase than to lower the pricogt; of corn.</p>
                <p>Restrictions on the exportation of corn, without being in any degree advantageous
                    to the consumers, are eminently hurtful to agriculturists. While they exist, no
                    market can be found for that excess of produce which an agricultural country
                    generally has to dispose of in favourable seasons. Farmers are not, therefore,
                    stimulated to exertion, because, in a country thus situated, a luxuriant crop,
                    by its causing a great fall of price, is nearly as prejudicial to them as a
                    scarcity; which, indeed, by its lessening the quantity sown next year, it seldom
                    fails to occasion. In most countries, however, these very simple considerations
                    have been overlooked, and the exportation of corn, unless in years of extreme
                    plenty, has been forbidden under severe penalties. In the reigns immediately
                    succeeding the conquest, this was done in England; but, in 1436, in the reign of
                    Henry VI. an act was passed permitting exportation without license, whenever the
                    price of wheat did not exceed 6s. 8d. (equal in amount of pure silver to 12s.
                    10∣d. present money) per quarter, and barley 3s. 4d. In this act it is stated,
                    that the previous regulations had obliged farmers to sell their corn at low
                    prices, to the great prejudice of the whole kingdom. But, in addition to the
                    reason assigned for this important measure, we may observe, that, for a
                    considerable time posterior to the conquest, rents were paid in kind, and the
                    high or low price of corn was not, therefore, a matter of so much importance to
                    landlords, as it became after money rents were generally introduced. In Henry I.
                    ’ s time, the rents of the crown lands were paid in corn and other farm produce,
                    and were only converted into pecuniary payments, in consequence of the great
                    complaints made by the tenants of the inconveniences they suffered in bringing
                    necessaries for the king’s household from distant partsof the kingdom. (Eden’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the State of the Poor,</hi> vol. i. p. 55.) The
                    same causes would doubtless affect, though in a less degree, the tenants of the
                    great barons; and, when once money rents were introduced, it was for the
                    advantage of the proprietors that all obstacles to a rise in the price of corn
                    should be removed. A more favourable opportunity could not have been found for
                    effecting their abolition. Henry, weak and irresolute, with a disputed title to
                    the throne, and a powerful competitor, could not, had he been so disposed, have
                    made any effectual opposition to a change <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751614"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1614-0334"/> of the system on which the corn trade had been
                    conducted.</p>
                <p>At the time when this act was passed, the prices of corn were exposed to
                    fluctuations of which we can now form a very inadequate conception; and hence it
                    is not easy to determine whether the exportation price of 6s. 8d. was above or
                    below the medium price. While the trade of corn merchants and corn factors was
                    unknown, or laboured under degrading restrictions, very little providence was
                    exercised in the distribution of the crops, and the superfluous produce of one
                    year scarcely ever compensated for a deficiency in the crop of the next.
                    “Purchasers,” says Sir F. Μ. Eden, “who only looked to their immediate wants,
                    having corn cheap, were naturally wasteful and improvident in the consumption;
                    the price, therefore, almost invariably rose as the year advanced, and was
                    frequently at an enormous height just before harvest; and, before a fresh supply
                    could be obtained, the stock of the preceding year was often entirely
                    exhausted.” <hi rend="italic">(^Inquiry into the State of the Poor,</hi> vol. i.
                    p. 18.) . Of this Sir Frederick has collected many instances; and he
                    conjectures, seemingly with great probability, that the enthusiastic joy with
                    which the rustic feast of harvest-home was anciently celebiated, arose chiefly
                    from the almost constant fall that then took place in the price of corn.</p>
                <p>That the act of 1437 was advantageous to the agriculturists cannot be doubted;
                    and having experienced the benefit of legislative interference in one-instance,
                    they were not slow in again having recourse to it. Not satisfied with the.
                    liberty of exporting, they procured in the following reign (1463) the enactment
                    of a law prohibiting <hi rend="italic">impôt</hi><hi rend="italic">tation</hi>
                    from abroad until the home price exceeded the price at which exportation ceased.
                    Had the uncertain and fluctuating policy of the times permitted the proper
                    execution of these laws, the restrictive system would have been thus early
                    perfected; and, with the exception of the bounty, all the refinements of modern
                    policy would have been in full operation. In practice, however, they were nearly
                    inoperative, and a lengthened period elapsed before the agriculturists succeeded
                    in obtaining a real monopoly of the home market. (Dirom’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Inquiry,.</hi> p. 34.)</p>
                <p>Until the reign of Elizabeth, these acts nominally regulated the prices at which
                    the exportation and importation of corn might take place. In that period,
                    however, the coin had been greatly degraded; and the value of silver, owing to
                    the discovery of the American mines, was rapidly falling throughout Europe in
                    the latter part of the fifteenth and in the sixteenth century. The consequent
                    rise of prices,] as it could not, in a nearly stationary state of society, when
                    capital was but slowly accumulating, be speedily followed by a corresponding
                    rise of wages, was necessarily productive of much distress. But neither the
                    government nor the people seems to have hecn at all aware of the real cause of
                    the rise of prices, and of the extraordinary increase of pauperism in this
                    interval.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In 1436 the
                    pound sterling contained as much pure silver as is now contained in L.l. 18s.
                    9d. In 1464 the value of the pound sterling was reduced to L.l. 1 Is. present
                    money, at which sum it remained stationary until 1527, when it was reduced to
                    L.l. 7s. 6fd. present money. In 1543 the previous value of the coin was again
                    reduced about one seventh part, or to L.l. 3s. 3įd. present money. In the ten
                    years subsequent to this era, the process of degradation advanced with
                    unparalleled rapidity; the weight of the coin being not only diminished, but the
                    standard purity of the metal itself debased; so that in 1551 the pound sterling
                    only contained as much silver as is now contained in 4s. 7∣d. In 1552, the last
                    year of the reign of Edward VI. the standard was restored to its former purity;
                    but the weight of the coin, and consequently the quantity of pure silver which
                    it contained, was at the same time reduced about <hi rend="italic">one
                    seventh</hi> part below its weight in 1543, and hence the value of a pound
                    sterling in 1552 corresponded to L.l. 6∣d. present money. Since that period the
                    standard has undergone almost no variation, either as to weight or
                    purity.</p><p>It therefore appears, that between 1527 and 1552, the value of the
                    pound sterling was reduced from L.l. 7≡. 6^d; to L.l. 6∣d., or about <hi
                    rend="italic">one fourth</hi> part; and this degradation of the vaine of the
                    coin, accompanied as it was by an extraordinary fall in the value of the
                    precious metals themselves, leaves us at no loss to account for the distress by
                    which the people of England were then assailed, and for the universal complaints
                    of a rise of prices. The dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII. in 1536
                    and 1538 has commonly been considered as the immediate cause of the institution
                    of a legal provision for the support of the poor in England; but it seems
                    abundantly certain that this was really a consequence of the misery of the lower
                    classes, caused by the degradation of the standard, and the fall in the value of
                    gold and silver. “The principal real grievance at this time,” says Mr John Smith
                    <hi rend="italic">{Memoirs of Wool,</hi> 8vo edit. vol. i. p. 88), when
                    adverting to some riots and complaints caused by the high prices in 1550, “of
                    the poorer manufacturers, they do not appear to have been sensible of, and
                    historians have since overlooked it, was the <hi rend="italic">state of the
                    coin.</hi> The debasement of the coin, which was now of several years standing,
                    had undoubtedly given a nominal advance to all things vendible; and, though
                    perhaps to wages too, yet probably nothing near in proportion to the difference
                    of the coin. And, as the money in which they were paid, not containing as much
                    silver as it did before, would not purchase the same quantity of the necessaries
                    of life it was wont to do; that, in course, must have bore hard upon the lower
                    sort of people especially, who had every thing to buy, and nothing to sell
                    except their labour.” This idea has been borrowed, and illustrated, in an
                    article of considerable merit, published in the 22d volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi></p></note> It was not yet known that silver
                    may fall in value, and that this fall must always be attended by a proportional
                    rise in the money price of the commodities for which it is exchanged. Instead,
                    therefore, of ascribing the enhancement of prices to the degradation of the
                    coin, and the greater plenty of gold and silver, it was universally affirmed to
                    be owing to the <hi rend="italic">decay of tillage,</hi> and to the improper
                    practices of corn merchants; and many (now obsolete) statutes for the
                    improvement of tillage, with the laws against engrossing, forestalling, &amp;c.
                    owe their origin to the absurd attempts that were then made to lower the price
                    of corn.</p>
                <p>That the complaints respecting the decay of tillage were very ill founded,
                    appears evident. The great foreign demand for English wool, the exportation of

                    some</hi> small farms, and the more general introduction of inclosures. But this
                    fact, so far from being any proof of the alleged decay of tillage, affords
                    satisfactory evidence of the accumulation of capital, and shows that some
                    improvement had been made in agriculture.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    disagreeahle to the lower classes; and being then attended by a great rise of
                    prices, raised the popular indignation to such a pitch that, in the reign of
                    Edward VI. the greater part of the inciosures were violently <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> demolished. As might have been foreseen, the statutes
                    directing the extension of tillage effected nothing; unfortunately, however,
                    those against engrossing were not quite so inefficient.</p>
                <p>By the statute fifth and sixth of Edward VI. cap. 14, it was enacted, that
                    whoever should buy any corn or grain, with intent to sell it again, should be
                    reputed an unlawful engrosser, and should, for the first fault, suffer two
                    months imprisonment, and forfeit the value of the corn; for the second, suffer
                    six months imprisonment, and forfeit double its value; and for the third, be set
                    in the pillory, suffer imprisonment during the king’s pleasure, and forfeit all
                    his goods and chattels. And by the same law no person could transport corn from
                    one part to another, without a license, ascertaining his qualifications as a man
                    of probity and fair <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751627"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1627-0335"/>dealing. Neither could corn be purchased to be
                    laid up in granaries for home sale, unless the quarter of wheat was at or under
                    6s. 8d. and oats at 2s. money of the time. By the same statute the authority of
                    three justices of the peace was necessary in order to grant a license; and even
                    this restraint not being thought sufficient, a statute of Elizabeth confined the
                    privilege of granting it to the quarter sessions.</p>
                <p>That the landed interest should have made little opposition to the laws
                    restricting the freedom of the internal corn trade, does not appear very
                    surprising. Before the principles of trade began to be understood, it was
                    natural for landlords and farmers to conclude that they would deal on fully more
                    advantageous terms by selling their produce directly to the consumers, than by
                    transacting with them through the medium of a third party. Forgetting that the
                    profits of the corn merchants were but a fair remuneration for the capital they
                    had engaged in the most important of all employments—that of distributing the
                    supply of food equally throughout the year, and according to the effective
                    demand—the farmers believed that they were acquired from the community at their
                    expense, and, of course, felt no repugnance to the virtual annihilation of the
                    trade of the dealer.</p>
                <p>But as society improved, and as the principles of commerce were better
                    understood, the bad effects of these laws became apparent. The statute of 1548
                    was considerably modified in 1624, and at last, by the 15th of Charles 11. cap.
                    7, the engrossing or buying of corn, in order to sell it again, so long as the
                    price of wheat did not exceed 48s. the quarter, was declared lawful to all
                    persons not being forestallers, that is, not selling again in the same market
                    within three months; an act, as Dr Smith has justly observed, which, with all
                    its imperfections, has contributed more, both to the plentiful supply of the
                    home market, and to the increase of tillage, than perhaps any other law in the
                    statute book.</p>
                <p>The act of Henry VI. regulating the export prices of corn was again renewed, but
                    without any variation of the rates, in the reign of Philip and Mary. As the
                    coin, however, had in the interi n been greatly degraded, no exportation could
                    now take place, until prices had really fallen much below the level of 1436.
                    This act, like that against engrossing, was no doubt framed in the view of
                    reducing the rising money price of corn, and of quieting the discontent then
                    prevalent among the labouring classes; although, by shackling and discouraging
                    cultivation, its real effects must have been extremely different.</p>
                <p>In 1562 the prices at which exportation might take place were extended to 10s.
                    per quarter for wheat, and 6s. 8d. for barley and malt. This scale, however, was
                    soon after abandoned; and in 1570 it was enaeted that corn might be exported
                    from particular districts; wheat paying a duty of Is. and other grain of 8d. per
                    quarter, whenever no prohibition to the contrary was issued by government; and
                    that the lord presidents and councils for shires, and the justices of assize, at
                    their different sessions, should consult with the respectable inhabitants of the
                    counties, and determine whether any exportation could with propriety be
                    allowed.</p>
                <p>The provisions of this act allowing corn to be exported from one part of the
                    country, at the same time that its exportation was prohibited in another, arose
                    from the extreme inequality of prices. At this era roads were scarcely formed ;·
                    and as there hardly existed any communication between distant parts of the
                    kingdom, the priées in the different cotmties differed exceedingly from each
                    other, and from the price in London. England was then in the same situation as
                    Spain in the present day. A particular province might be afflicted with
                    scarcity, without deriving any assistance from the superfluous produce of its
                    neighbours. But the complex nature of the regulations prevented their being
                    properly executed; and they were superseded by a fresh law (35th Eliz. cap. 7),
                    which permitted expoι ration on paying a duty of 2s. on wheat, and of Is. 4d. on
                    all other species of corn, whenever the price of wheat did not exceed 20s. per
                    quarter, and barley and malt 12s. This act did considerable service to
                    agriculture, by repealing several absurd statutes for the promotion of tillage,
                    and against the enlargement of farms.</p>
                <p>It deserves to be remarked, that the check given to cultivation by the
                    injudicious imposition of heavy duties on the exportation of corn, and still
                    more, the rapid depreciation of money in the reign of Elizabeth, caused an
                    astonishing rise in the price of commodities. A contemporary author, quoted by
                    Mr Hume, estimates this rise in the twenty or thirty years previous to 1581, at
                    no less than fifty per cent. Wages not having increased in proportion, pauperism
                    became very general; and this circumstance, combined with the excessively high
                    prices of 1596, 1597, and 1598, resulting from the bad harvests of those years,
                    occasioned the enactment of the famous statute of 1601, which has served as a
                    basis to the whole of the present English system for supporting and managing the
                    poor.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The contemporary

                    good capon for 3d. or 4d., a chicken for Id., a hen for 2d., &amp;c. Now a payre
                    of shooes costs 12d.; yet in my time I have bought a better for Ġd.” Latimer, in
                    his sermons, ascribes this increase of price to landlords raising their rents.
                    “Notwithstanding,” says he, “God doth send us plentifully the fruits of the
                    earth mercifully, according to our desertes, these rich men causeth such dearth,
                    that poore men, which live of their labour, cannot with the sweat of their face
                    have a living, all kinde of victuals is so dear.” ∙ A variety of passages to the
                    same import may be found in óther contemporary authors, quoted by Sir F. Μ.

                    extraordinary advance of prices, caused partly by the degradation of the coin,
                    but more by the fall in the real value of the precious metals, as it very far
                    exceeded the rate at which capital, and consequently the demand for labour, was
                    then increasing, must, ∙ even supposing wages had been left to find their own
                    level, and to be adjusted on the principles of fair competition, have been
                    attended by a very great deterioration in the circumstances of the labouring
                    classes. But positive enactments were framed to prevent the increase of wages;
                    so that, while the prices of all sorts of commodities were advancing with
                    unprecedented rapidity', the sums paid the labourers were violently kept down to
                    near their former level.</p><p>By the statute 11th Henry VII. c. 22, regulating
                    the wages of labour, a common labourer was allowed 4d. per diem, from Easter to
                    Michaelmas; and, taking the average prices of wheat, rye, and barley at that
                    period at 6s. 8d., 4s., and 3s. per quarter respectively, it will follow that a
                    labourer who had 4d. a day, could earn a quarter of wheat by twenty days’
                    labour, a quarter of rye by twelve days’ labour, and a quarter of barley by nine
                    days’ labour.</p><p>But in the latter part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the
                    labourer’s situation was very different. The prices of corn may be supposed to
                    have nearly corresponded with the rates at which exportation was allowed by
                    statute 35th Eliz. c. 7, that is, wheat probably averaged 20s. a quarter, rye
                    13s. 4d., and barley 12s. It appears, however, from the determination of the
                    justices of the East Hiding of Yorkshire, in the same year, that the wages of a
                    common labourer, without meat or drink, were limited to <hi rend="italic"
                    >five</hi> pence a day, from the 1st March to the Feast of All Saints.
                    Consequently, a common labourer could not, in the latter part of the reign of
                    Queen Elizabeth, earn a quarter of wheat by less than 48 days’ labour, a quarter
                    of rye in less than 32 days, nor a quarter of barley in less than 28⅘ days. If
                    barley was his common sustenance, he could have earned <hi rend="italic"

                    as the necessaries of life were concerned, the situation of the labourer was not
                    <hi rend="italic">one half</hi> so advantageous in 1593 as it had been in 1495.

                    extraordinary rise in the price of provisions being unattended by any

                    of poor-rates. In the long interval between 1379 and 1530, it does not appear
                    that any statute was passed directly referring to the maintenance of vagrants or
                    beggars. At the latter era, however, when the prices of all sorts of commodities
                    began suddenly to rise, pauperism became very prevalent, and engaged a
                    considerable portion of the attention of the legislature.</p><p>The following

                    608), shows in a very distinct manner the various steps by which the compulsory
                    maintenance was established in England:—“By 22d Henry VIII. c. 12, the justices
                    were to distribute themselves into several <hi rend="italic">divisions</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> within which divisions respectively they might <hi

                    voluntary alms,</hi> as that none of them might, of necessity, be compelled to
                    go openly in begging, on pain that every person making default should forfeit
                    twenty shillings a month. And the churchwardens, or other substantial
                    inhabitants, were to make collections for them with boxes on Sundays, and
                    otherwise by their discretions. And the minister was to take all opportunities
                    to stir up and exhort the people to be liberal and bountiful. By the 1st Edward
                    VI. c. 3, houses were to be provided for them by the devotion of good people,
                    and <hi rend="italic">materials</hi> toset them at work; and the minister, after
                    the gospel every Sunday, was specially to exhort the parishioners to a liberal
                    contribution. By the 5th and 6th Edward VI. c. 2, the collectors of the poor, on
                    a certain Sunday in every year, immediately after divine service, were <hi
                    rend="italic">to take down in writing</hi> what every person was willing to give
                    weekly, for the ensuing year; and if any should be obstinate, and refuse to
                    give, the minister was gently to exhort him; if he still refused, the minister
                    was to certify such refusal to the bishop of the dìo-cese, and the bishop was to
                    send for him, to induce and persuade him by charitable ways and means, and so
                    according to his discretion <hi rend="italic">to take order for the reformation
                    thereof.</hi> By the 5th Elizabeth, e. 3, if he stood out agaiust the bishop’s
                    exhortation, the bishop was to certify the same to the justices in sessions, and
                    bind him over to appear there; and the justices at the said sessions were again
                    gently to move and persuade him; and, finally, if he would not be persuaded,
                    then they were to <hi rend="italic">assess</hi> him in what they thought
                    reasonable towards the relief of the poor; and, in case of refusal, were to
                    commit him till paid. By 14th Elizabeth, c. 5, power was given to the Justices

                    this hath continued ever since; for the statute of the 43d Elizabeth, c. 2, is

                    place were, after some trifling alteration in 1604, fixed in 1623 at the high
                    rate of 32s. the quarter for wheat, and of 16s. the quarter for malt and barley.
                    In this and the preceding reigns, and for a considerable time afterwards,
                    importation continued unrestricted; and notwithstanding the improvement of
                    agriculture, the nation was partially dependent for supplies of corn on the
                    trade with the countries round the Baltic, and others.</p>
                <p>During the agitation of the civil wars, the people of England, intensely occupied
                    in endeavouring to throtv off, or at least to restrict and modify, the royal
                    authority, paid no regard to the corn trade. But this inattention does not seem
                    to have been attended with any bad effects. The high prices of that turbulent
                    period, if they were not altogether caused by a fall in the value of the coin,
                    which, previously to the recoinage under Cromwell, was very' much clipped and
                    debased, were most probably owing to the interruptions thrown in the way of
                    agricultural labour.</p>
                <p>On the restoration of Charles II. in 1660, an act was passed, permitting the
                    exportation of corn on the same terms as other commodities on which duties were
                    payable, whenever the price of wheat did not exceed 40s. per quarter, barley and
                    malt 20s., and oats 16s. But as this law laid <hi rend="italic">a</hi> duty of
                    20s. on every quarter of wheat exported, and on other grain in proportion, it
                    really amounted to a prohibition; and neither the agriculturists nor the revenue
                    derived any advantage from the extent to which exportation was permitted,
                    although both must have been somewhat benefited by the high duties it imposed on
                    importation.</p>
                <p>Mr Dirom’s opinion, that the prohibitory duties on exportation were the chief
                    causes of the high prices of this and the two following seasons, seems entirely
                    destitute of foundation. The law against exportation could not certainly raise
                    the prices of the year in which it was framed, and this high price, as far as it
                    was not caused by a deficiency in the crop, or by any fluctuation in the value
                    of the coin, was unquestionably owing, not to the duties on exportation, but to
                    the exorbitancy of those on <hi rend="italic">importation,</hi> which had really
                    secured a monopoly of the home market to the agriculturists.</p>
                <p>This view of the matter appears to have been soon after taken by parliament; for
                    in 1663 the high duties on importation were taken off, and an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad valorem</hi> duty of nine per cent, imposed in their stead. The exportation
                    price of wheat was at the same time extended to 48s. per quarter, chargeable
                    with a duty of 5s. 4d. and other grain in proportion.</p>
                <p>This act, however, by permitting the importation of foreign grain on paying a
                    moderate duty, not being reckoned sufficiently advantageous to the landholders,
                    a more decided step was subsequently taken, and in 1670 exportation prices were
                    extended to 53s. 4d. per quarter for wheat, and other grain in proportion, while
                    import duties, amounting to a complete prohibition, were imposed on foreign
                    wheat till the home price reached 53s. 4d., and between that price and 80s. a
                    duty of 8s. was exigible. But this law, though extremely favourable to the
                    agriculturists, by whom indeed it had been framed, did not perfectly correspond
                    with their wishes. The necessities of the crown caused the continuance of
                    impolitic duties on exportation, and the prohibition of importation was rendered
                    to a certain extent nugatory, by the want of any proper and settled method tor
                    ascertaining prices. Groundless complaints of the decay of agriculture, and of
                    the evils of foreign competition, were therefore continued, and gave occasion to
                    the act of 1685, designed more effectually to check importation from abroad, by
                    securing correct returns <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> home prices.</p>
                <p>We have now reached a period no less memorable in the economical than in the
                    political history of Great Britain. A <hi rend="smallcaps">bounty</hi> on the
                    exportation of corn was granted at the revolution. The Prince of Orange could
                    not oppose the wishes of the landed interest, who then constituted the immense
                    majority of parliament, on this particular subject. Whether he really approved
                    of the measure cannot now be ascertained; but whatever may have been William’s
                    private sentiments, it was necessary for him to give way to the inclinations of
                    those who had so lately raised him to a throne, and on whose assistance he was
                    chiefly to depend in prosecuting his war against France. The bounty payable
                    under the act 1st William and Mary, cap. 12, amounted to 5s. for every quarter
                    of wheat exported, while the price continued at or below 48s.; 2s. 6d. for every
                    quarter of barley or malt, while their price did not exceed 24s.; and 3s. 6d.
                    for every quarter of rye, when its price did not exceed 32s.</p>
                <p>A still more essential advantage was shortly after con- <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751653" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1653-0337"/>'ferred on agriculture, by
                    the act 11th and 12th William III. cap. 20, which repealed all previous duties
                    on the exportation of corn, and prevented the operation of the bounty from being
                    in the slightest degree counteracted.</p>
                <p>No alteration having been made in the prices and duties regulating importation,
                    as fixed in 1670, and these duties being rigorously exacted, the act repealing
                    the duties on exportation completed the restrictive system. Every part of this
                    complex machine was now in operation; and while no foreigner was allowed to
                    contend with the home growers, the liberality of the state enabled them to
                    contend with foreigners, even when the price of corn in Great Britain was
                    considerably higher than its price abroad!</p>
                <p>The policy adopted in Scotland respecting the trade in corn was nearly the same
                    as that of England. Previously to 1663 the importation of corn into this kingdom
                    was permitted without limitation or duties (Dirom, p. 61); but in that year it
                    was loaded with an <hi rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duty of about forty per
                    cent.; while its free exportation was allowed, on payment of a trifling duty,
                    until the prices exceeded those mentioned below.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wheat, L.12 Scots per boll; bear and barley,
                    L.8 do.; oats and peas, 8 merks.</p></note> This duty was afterwards
                    relinquished, and a bounty granted by the statute William, Par. 1, cap. 32. At
                    length, by the treaty of union, the corn laws of both kingdoms were
                    incorporated, and it was settled that “the allowances, encouragements, and
                    drawbacks, prohibitions, restrictions, and regulations of trade, and the customs
                    and duties on import and export, settled in England when the union commences,
                    shall, from and after the union, take place throughout the whole united
                    kingdom.” Oats not having been mentioned in the English statute granting the
                    bounty, it was declared, that whenever oats did not exceed the price of lðs.
                    sterling per quarter, there should be paid a bounty of 2s. 6d. for every quarter
                    of oatmeal exported.</p>
                <p>Whatever may have been the ultimate consequences of ’ the bounty act, there can
                    be no doubt that it was framed in the view of enhancing the value of corn. In
                    the preamble to this celebrated statute, it is stated “that the exportation of
                    corn and grain into foreign parts, <hi rend="italic">when the price thereof is
                    at a</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> low</hi><hi rend="italic">rate in this
                    kingdom,</hi> hath been a great advantage, not only to the owners of land, but
                    to the trade of this kingdom in general.” It would indeed be absurd to suppose
                    that the landed interest should have unanimously urged the adoption of a law,
                    had it been imagined to have any tendency to lower the value of agricultural
                    produce.</p>
                <p>We shall afterwards endeavour to show that the bounty had in fact no such
                    tendency; but at present we shall only offer a few observations explanatory of
                    the fall in the price of corn posterior to 1690, which has, as it appears to us,
                    without any sufficient reason, been ascribed to the bounty.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that no certain conclusions can ever be drawn as to whether the
                    real value, that is, the expense of producing a commodity, is diminished, from
                    the fact of its <hi rend="italic">money</hi> price having declined. Before
                    forming any accurate conclusions as to a rise or fall in the real price of
                    commodities, from variations in their money price, it is essential to know, not
                    only the state of the coin as to purity and weight, but also whether the value
                    of bullion be itself stationary. A fall of money price may be as effectually
                    produced by a rise in the value of gold and silver, as by a diminution of the
                    cost of production; and the real price of a commodity may be increasing at the
                    very time its money price is falling. To produce this effect it is only
                    necessary that the real price of bullion should increase faster than the real
                    price of the commodity with which it is compared.</p>
                <p>That the real value of gold and silver rose in the early part of last century,
                    has been maintained by Dr Smith, apparently on pretty good grounds. As no
                    remarkable improvements in agriculture were then made, either on the continent
                    or in England, the expense of producing corn may be reckoned to have remained
                    nearly the same, or rather to have increased, as the increase of population,
                    however slow, would cause recourse to be had to inferior soils. But during this
                    period the money price of corn fell, not only in this country, where a bounty
                    was given on exportation, but in those continental kingdoms where exportation
                    was prohibited. Conclusive evidence of this fact, as far as regards France, will
                    be found in the table of the prices of wheat, at. the Paris or Rosoy market,
                    annexed to the work of Dupre de St Maur, entitled <hi rend="italic">Essai sur
                    les</hi><hi rend="italic">Monnoies,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou</hi><hi

                    And the table of the price of wheat at Seville, from 1675 to 1764 inclusive,
                    published in the appendix to the <hi rend="italic">Bullion Report,</hi> strongly
                    confirms the reasoning of Dr Smith, and shows that prices declined considerably
                    in Spain in the first fifty years of last century.</p>
                <p>The impulse imparted to this country by the revolution, the abolition of all
                    oppressive and arbitrary exactions, and the number of intelligent and wealthy
                    foreigners who sought refuge in England from the persecution of intolerant and
                    bigoted governments, coupled with the revival of trade and the establishment of
                    the bank in 1694, caused the extension of commerce, and a considerable
                    accumulation of capital, subsequently to the treaty of Ryswick. The wars of
                    Queen Anne counteracted this progress; but during the long and pacific
                    administration of Sir Robert Walpole, the increase of capital, and the
                    improvement of every species of industry, though not so great as they afterwards
                    became, continued uninterrupted. A rise in the money price of labour in Great
                    Britain during that interval is not therefore inconsistent with the fact of an
                    advance in the value of the precious metals, but, as Dr Smith has stated, is a
                    natural consequence of the improving state of the country, and of the increasing
                    demand for labour. In France, which had been completely exhausted by the ruinous
                    enterprises of Louis XIV. and where, of course, the demand for labour remained
                    nearly stationary, wages <hi rend="italic">fell</hi> as the price of corn
                    declined. <hi rend="italic">( Wealth of Nations,</hi> i. 313.)</p>
                <p>But whatever weight may be attached to these conclusions, respecting a general
                    rise in the real value of gold and silver in the early part of last century,
                    there can be no question as to the fact of a rise having taken place in the
                    value of the coin of Great Britain, in consequence of the recoinage in the
                    latter part of King William’s reign. At that period silver constituted the
                    English standard of value, and to such an extent had the silver currency been
                    debased by clipping, filing, &amp;c. that, in 1695, the common price of silver
                    bullion was 6s. 5d. per ounce, or Is. 3d. above the mint price. A guinea then
                    passed current for about 30s., and the <hi rend="italic">nominal</hi> exchange
                    between London, Holland, and Hamburg was rather more than twenty-five per cent,
                    against the first. (<hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations,!.</hi> 304.) That this
                    degraded state of the coin raised the price of every other commodity as well as
                    bullion, might be concluded for certain, although no direct evidence of the fact
                    had been transmitted to us. Mr Lowndes, however, in his Report on the state of
                    the silver coin in 1695, mentions its degradation as “<hi rend="italic">one
                    great cause of the raising the price, not only of all merchandises, but of every
                    article necessary for the sustenance of the common people, to their great
                    grievance.”</hi> (Liverpool <hi rend="italic">on Coin,</hi> p. 70.) And Mr
                    Locke, in his answ er <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751666"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1666-0338"/>'to Lowndes’ proposal for lowering the standard,
                    confirms this statement, and asserts, that the “<hi rend="italic">price
                    of</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">all</hi><hi rend="italic">sorts of provisions and
                    commodities had risen excessively." (Idem.)</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >medium</hi> rise in the price of undepreciated gold coin, and of silver
                    bullion, compared with the clipped and degraded coin, appears, from the
                    statements of Locke and Lowndes, to have rather exceeded thirty per cent. And it
                    is of importance to remark, that, in 1700, the year in which the new coin came
                    into general circulation, the market price of corn, which had previously been
                    rising, <hi rend="italic">declined to very near the same extent.</hi> Ίhat this
                    fall may in some degree have been owing to luxuriant crops, is probable; but it
                    is quite certain that the increased value of the circulating medium would of
                    itself have speedily lowered the money price of corn, and of every other
                    commodity.</p>
                <p>Mr Charles Smith, Mr Malthus, and others who contend that a bounty on the
                    exportation of corn tends to lower its price, admit that the bounty granted in
                    1688 had no such effect anterior to 1700! This fact should have stimulated them
                    to inquire whether any thing peculiar belonged to that year. They should have
                    recollected, that a fall of money prices may be as effectually brought about by
                    a rise in the value of the currency, as by a fall in the value of commodities.
                    Had they kept this principle in view, and adverted to the circumstances under
                    which the recoinage of 1G96,1697, and 1G98 took place, perhaps they would not
                    have been so very confident in their assertions as to the effects of the bounty;
                    and, at all events, they would not have adduced the fall of prices in 1700, and
                    subsequently, as any proof of fheir correctness.</p>
                <p>We do not certainly mean to affirm that the whole rise of price, from 1692 to
                    1G98 inclusive, is to be ascribed to the depreciation of the currency. The
                    bounty, and, in a still greater degree, bad seasons, contributed to produce this
                    rise; and the fair inference is, that had there been no bounty, priées would
                    have fallen still lower after the recoinage.</p>
                <p>In considering the effects of the bounty, it ought always to be recollected that
                    priées were gradually falling previously to its being granted.</p>

                <p>The bounty was given with the avowed intention of checking this fall, and it was,
                    in our opinion, well calculated to accomplish its object. But, whatever may have
                    been its cffeets, it cannot surely be assigned as the cause of the fall of
                    prices between 1700 and 1746, seeing that that very fall began thirty years
                    before it was granted, and that prices rose in the first ten years of its
                    existence.</p>
                <p>Perhaps part of the fall of corn in England subsequently to 1640 may be justly
                    ascribed to the prohibition of the exportation of wool, which, after several
                    previous attempts, was earned into full effect by the act of 1GGO. The wool
                    formerly raised in Great Britain having much exceeded what was required for our
                    manufactures, its price declined as soon as its exportation was put an end to;
                    and, of course, some portion of the soil employed in rearing sheep would be
                    brought under tillage, and a greater quantity of good land, besides an
                    additional capital, would be turned to the raising of corn.</p>
                <p>Although the mint price of gold had been reduced by King William, it was still
                    rated too high as compared with; silver; and consequently the currency again
                    became de- <hi rend="italic">f</hi> ranged. The deficieney of new silver coin,
                    caused by the I inducement to melt it down, was not immediately expe∙ [ rienced;
                    but towards the latter part of Queen Anne’s reign, . a want of silver, and a
                    difficulty in making payments, were universally felt and complained of. As might
                    have been expected, <hi rend="italic">prices rose,</hi> and, from 1709 to 1717
                    both inclusive, were much above the average of the eight preceding or of the
                    following years. That this could not be an effect of deficient crops, is evident
                    from the fact of a considerable exportation, forced, no doubt, to a certain
                    extent, by the bounty having then taken place. The government did not indeed
                    entertain any such opinion, but having wisely adopted the suggestion of Sir
                    Isaae Newton, and reduced the mint value of the guinea, the melting and hoarding
                    of silver ceased, and priées, as in 1700, fell to their former level.</p>
                <p>Jn accounting for the low price of corn in the reigns of George I. and George
                    II., after allowingfor the increased value of the coin, the relaxation of the
                    laws against forestallers and engrossers must not be forgotten. Large capitals
                    being engaged in the corn trade, extraordinary fluctuations of price were
                    avoided. The home demand was rendered more steady and equal; while the perfect
                    security of property, and the greater political influence attached to landed
                    possessions, naturally attracted a more than ordinary portion of the
                    accumulating capital of the country towards agriculture.</p>
                <p>The bounty, by extending the foreign market, no doubt contributed materially' to
                    the extension of cultivation, although, by forcing recourse to worse soils in
                    order to obtain additional supplies of corn, it raised prices. In the period
                    from 1740 to 175J, the cheapest in last century, the bounties paid on
                    exportation amounted in all to L.1,515,000; and in 1749 alone they somewhat
                    exceeded L.324,000. The bounty, however, had by this time been too long in
                    operation to permit the growers or exporters to realise more than the common and
                    ordinary profits of stock; and, therefore, had it never been granted, the
                    quantity of corn exported, and the home price (which must have been regulated by
                    the expense necessary to produce the increased supply required by the bounty on
                    the poorest soils in cultivation), would both have been reduced. We shall
                    afterwards elucidate this principle at greater length; but it is of importance
                    to remark bow much this forced exportation must have raised the real price of
                    corn, at the very time when it ţs supposed to have reduced it.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding the factitious stimulus thus given to exportation, the
                    exports which, in 1750, amounted to 1,667,778 quarters of all sorts, rapidly
                    diminished; and the gradual increase of the home demand, in the last ten years
                    of the reign of George II. accompanied as it was by a rise of prices, reduced
                    the annual average exportation, at the accession of George III. in 1760, to
                    about 600,000 quarters. After the peace of Paris in 1763, the progress of
                    improvement was prodigiously accelerated. The extension of industry caused by
                    the acquisition of new branches of commerce, by the increase of our colonial
                    possessions, and, perhaps more thgn all the rest, by the introduction of
                    improved machinery into the cotton manufacture,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jennies were invented in 1766, by Richard
                    Hargraves, weaver in Lancashire, who, to the disgrace of his age and nation, was

                    sudden increase of the population, and, as importation was prohibited, by a
                    corresponding rise of prices.</p>
                <p>The admirers of the restrictive system have generally reasoned as if this rise of
                    price and the cessation of exportation<pb break="no" facs="nls:194751679"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1679-0339"/> had been a consequence of the alteration of the
                    corn laws in 1773. But it should be carefully observed that this alteration was
                    an avowed, and indeed a necessary consequence of the previous rise. In 1765,
                    .before any suspension of the restrictive system had taken place, the balance on
                    the side of wheat exported amounted to only 77,000 quarters, and the home price
                    in that and the two preceding years rose to an unusual height. The general and
                    growing dissatisfaction at continuing the prohibition of importation under such
                    circumstances, produced a suspension of the high duties in 1766; and by
                    temporary enactments, this suspension (accompanied occasionally with
                    restrictions on exportation) was continued to 1773, when a permanent act was
                    framed under the auspices of Mr Burke. By this act foreign wheat was allowed to
                    be imported on paying a nominal duty of 6d. whenever the home price readied 48s.
                    a quarter; and the bounty and exportation were together to cease when the price
                    reached 44s. This statute also permitted the importation of corn at any price,
                    in order to be again exported, duty free, provided it was, in the mean time,
                    lodged under the joint locks of the king and the importer.</p>
                <p>The prices, when exportation was to cease, seem to have been fixed too low in
                    this act; and, as Dr Smith has observed, there appears a good deal of
                    impropriety in prohibiting exportation altogether at the preeise priées at which
                    the bounty given to force it is withdrawn; yet with all these defects, the act
                    of 1773 was a material improvement on the former system, and should not have
                    been altered unless to render the trade perfectly free.</p>
                <p>The idea that this law must, when enaeted, have been injurious to the farmers,
                    seems altogether illusory. The permission to import foreign grain, when the home
                    priées rose to a certain rate, certainly prevented their realizing exorbitant
                    profits at the expense of the other classes, and prevented an unnatural
                    proportion of the capital of the country being turned towards agriculture. But
                    as this rate was fixed very considerably higher than the average price in the
                    reign of George 1I., it cannot be maintained that it had any tendency to lower
                    priées, which alone could discourage agriculture; and in fact no such reduction
                    took place.</p>
                <p>It is indeed true, that but for this act we should not have imported so much
                    foreign grain in the interval between 1773 and 1791. This importation, however,
                    was not occasioned by the declining state of our agriculture, for it is
                    universally admitted that every department of rural economy was more improved in
                    that period than in the whole course of the preceding century; but arose
                    entirely from a still more rapid increase of the manufacturing population, and
                    hence of the effective demand for corn.</p>
                <p>By referring to the tables of exports and imports annexed to this article, it
                    will be seen that, in 1772, the balance on the side of wheat imported amounted
                    to 18,515 quarters; and in 1773, 1774, and 1775, all years of great prosperity,
                    this balance was very much increased. The loss, however, of a great part of our
                    colonial possessions, and the stagnation of commerce occasioned by the American
                    contest, diminished the consumption; and this diminution concurring with
                    luxuriant harvests, the balance was high on the side of exportation in 1778,
                    1779, and 1780. In 1783 and 1784 the crop was unusually deficient, and
                    considerable importations took place; but in 1785, 1786, and 1787, the exports
                    again exceeded the imports; and it was not till 1788, when the country had fully
                    recovered from the effects of the war, and when manufacturing improvements were
                    carried on with extraordinary spirit, that the imports permanently overbalanced
                    the exports.</p>
                <p>The growing wealth and commercial prosperity of the country had thus, by
                    increasing the population, and enabling individuals to consume additional
                    quantities of food, caused the home supplies to fall somewhat short of the
                    demand; but it must not therefore be concluded that agriculture had not at the
                    same time been very greatly ameliorated. “The average annual produce of wheat,”
                    says Mr Comber, “at the beginning of the reign of George III. was about
                    3,800,000 quarters, of which about 300,000 had been sent out of the kingdom,
                    leaving about three and a half millions for home consumption. In 1773, the
                    produce of wheat was stated to the House of Commone to be 4,000,000 of quarters,
                    of which the whole, and above 100,000 imported, were consumed in the kingdom. In
                    1796’ the consumption was stated in the House of Commons, by Lord Hawkesbury, to
                    be 500,000 quarters per month, or six millions annually, of which about 180,000
                    were imported, showing an increased produce, in about twenty years, of 1,820,000
                    quarters. It is evident, therefore, not only that no defalcation of produce had
                    taken place in consequence of the cessation of exportation, as has been too
                    lightly assumed, from the occasional necessity of importation; but that it had
                    increased with the augmentation of our commerce and manufactures.” (Comber <hi
                    rend="italic">on National Subsistence,</hi> p. 180.)</p>
                <p>These estimates are, no doubt, very loose and unsatisfactory, but the fact of a
                    large increase of produce is unquestionable. In the Report of the House of
                    Commons on <hi rend="italic">Waste Lands,</hi> drawn up in 1797, the number of

                <p>It deserves particular notice, that from 1771 to 1791, both inclusive, the period
                    when these great agricultural <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751692"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1692-0340"/>improvements were principally carried on, there
                    was no rise of prices.</p>
                <p>The landholders, however, could not but consider the liberty of importation
                    granted by the act of 1773 as injurious to their interests, inasmuch as it
                    prevented prices from rising with the increased demand. A clamour, therefore,
                    was raised against that law; and, in addition to this interested feeling, a
                    dread of becoming habitually dependent on foreigners for supplies of corn
                    operated with many, and produced a pretty general acquiescence in the act of
                    1791, by which the price, when importation could take place at the low duty of
                    6d., was raised to 54s., under 54s. and above 50s. a middle duty of 2s. 6d., and
                    under 50s. a prohibitory duty of 24s. 3d., were exigible. The bounty continued
                    as before, and exportation without bounty was allowed to 46s. It was also
                    enacted that foreign wheat might be imported, stored under the king’s locks, and
                    again exported free of duty; but if sold for home consumption in the kingdom, it
                    became liable to a warehouse-duty of 2s. 6d. in addition to the ordinary duties
                    payable at the time of sale.</p>
                <p>Mr Comber has justly blamed this imposition of duties on the warehousing of
                    foreign corn; but the deficient crops of 1795 and 1797, followed as they were by
                    a great' rise of prices, superseded these provisions, and even caused the
                    granting of high bounties on importation.</p>
                <p>In 1797 the Bank of England was restricted from paying in specie, and the
                    consequent facility of obtaining discounts gave a fresh stimulus to agriculture;
                    the efficacy of which was most powerfully assisted by the great scarcity and
                    high prices of 1800 and 1801. These may indeed be said to have inspired all
                    classes with a sort of agricultural mania; and as the prices of 1802 and 1803
                    would not permit the profitable cultivation of the poor soils which had been
                    taken into tillage during the scarcity, a new corn law was loudly called for by
                    the farmers, and passed in 1804. This act imposed a prohibitory duty of 24s. 3d.
                    per quarter on all w heat imported when the home price was at or below 63s.;
                    between 63s. and 60s. a middle duty of 2s. 6d. was paid; and above 66s. a
                    nominal duty of 6d. The price at which the bounty was paid on exportation was
                    extended to 40s. and exportation without bounty to 54s. By the act of 1791, the
                    maritime counties of England had been divided into twelve districts, and
                    importation and exportation had been regulated by the particular prices of each;
                    but by the act of 1801, they were regulated in England by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aggregate average of</hi> the twelve maritime districts, and in Scotland by the
                    <hi rend="italic">aggregate average</hi> of the four maritime districts. The
                    averages, as at present, were taken at four periods in the year, and the ports
                    were either open or shut for not less than three months. This method of
                    ascertaining prices was, however, modified in the following season, and it was
                    then fixed that importation both in England and Scotland should be regulated by
                    the average price of the whole ,twelve maritime districts.</p>
                <p>To prohibit the importation of the necessaries of life into a country where the
                    supply is short of the demand, till prices rise to a certain height, has an
                    obvious tendency to raise them still higher. In 1805 the crop was very
                    considerably deficient, and the average price of that year was about 22s. above
                    the price at which importation was allowed by the act of 1804. The depreciation
                    of paper compared with bullion, being at that time about four per cent., the
                    high price must have been ov, ing to the new corn law preventing importation
                    till the home price was high, and then cramping mercantile operations; and to
                    the war rendering the cost of importation unusually great. In 1806, 1807, and
                    1808, the depreciation of paper, compared with bullion, continued at nearly four
                    per cent.; and the price of wheat in these years being generally from 66s. to
                    75s., a small importation only took place. From autumn 1808 to spring 1814, the
                    depreciation of our currency was rapid beyond all former example; and several
                    crops in that interval being likewise deficient, the money price of corn,
                    influenced by both causes, rose to a surprising height. The following is a
                    statement of the money or <hi rend="italic">paper</hi> price, and the <hi

                <p>The crops of 1809 and 1810 were much below an average, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bullion</hi> price of these years is a good deal higher than the importation
                    price fixed by the act of 1804. This excess is to be ascribed partly to that
                    law, and partly to the extraordinary difficulties then thrown in the way of
                    importing grain. At that time no vessel could be loaded in any continental port
                    for England, without purchasing a license; and the freight and insurance were at
                    least <hi rend="italic">Jive</hi> times as high as during peace. The same causes
                    operated in 1812; but in the autumn of 1813 the destruction of Napoleon’s
                    anti-commercial system having increased the facilities of importation, a large
                    quantity of corn was poured into the kingdom; and in 1814 its bullion price was
                    reduced below the point at which importation was allowed.</p>
                <p>Before this fall of price, a committee of the House of Commons had been appointed
                    to inquire into the state of the laws affecting the corn trade; and their report
                    (dated 11th May 1813) recommended a very great extension of the rates at which
                    exportation was formerly allowable, and when importation free of duty could take
                    place. The recommendation of this committee was not adopted by the House; but
                    the fact of its having been made when the home price was at least 112s. per
                    quarter, displays a surprising solicitude to exclude foreigners from all
                    competition with the home growers.</p>
                <p>The lessening of the dependence of the country on foreign supplies formed the
                    sole ostensible ground on which this committee proposed to alter the act of
                    1804. But after the fall of price in autumn 1813, and in the early part of 1814,
                    it became obvious, on comparing our former prices with those of the Continent,
                    that, without an alteration of the existing law, this dependence would be
                    considerably’ increased; that a good deal of the poor lands, which the recent
                    high prices had forced into cultivation, would have to be thrown into pasturage;
                    and that rents would be materially reduced. These consequences alarmed the
                    landlords and occupiers, and in the early part of the session of 1814 a series
                    of resolutions were voted by the House of Commons, declaring that it was
                    expedient to repeal the bounty; to permit the free exportation of corn, whatever
                    might be the home price, and to impose a graduated scnle of duties on foreign
                    corn when imported. Thus, wheat imported when the home price was at or under
                    64s. was to pay a duty of 24s.; when at or under 65s. a duty of 23s.; and so on
                    till the home price reached 86s. when the duty was reduced to Is., at which it
                    became stationary. Corn imported from the British colonies in North America was
                    to pay only half the above duties. As soon as these resolutions were agreed to,
                    two bills founded on them, one regulating the importation of foreign corn, and
                    another repealing the bounty, and permitting unrestricted exportation, were
                    introduced. Very little attention was paid to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751705" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1705-0341"/>the last of these bills; but
                    that which imposed fresh duties on importation encountered a very keen
                    opposition. The manufacturers, and every class not directly supported by
                    agriculture, stigmatized it as an unjustifiable attempt to keep up the price of
                    food, and to secure excessive rents and large profits to landlords and farmers,
                    at the expense of the consumers. Meetings were generally held, and resolutions
                    entered into strongly expressive of this sentiment, and dwelling on the fatal
                    consequences that a continuance of high prices would have on our manufactures,
                    in a season of peace, when we could no longer monopolize the commerce of the
                    world. This opposition, coupled with the indecision of ministers, and perhaps,
                    too, with an expectation, on the part of some of the landlords, that prices
                    would speedily rise, without any legislative interference, caused the
                    miscarriage of this bill. The other was passed into a law.</p>
                <p>Committees of both houses of parliament were appointed in 1814 to examine
                    evidence and to report on the state of the corn trade; and a great number of the
                    most eminent agriculturists were in consequence examined. The witnesses were
                    unanimous in this only, that the protecting prices fixed by the act of 1804 were
                    insufficient to enable the farmers to make good the engagements into which they
                    had subsequently entered, and to continue the cultivation of the inferior lands
                    lately brought under tillage. Some of them thought 120s. ought to be fixed as
                    the limit when wheat might be imported free of duty; others varied from 90s. to
                    100s.; others from 80s. to 90s.; and a few from 70s. to 80s. The general
                    opinion, however, seemed to be that 80s. would answer; and, as prices continued
                    to decline, a set of resolutions, founded on this assumption, were submitted to
                    the House of Commons by Mr Robinson (now Lord Goderich), and having been agreed
                    to, a bill founded on them was, after a very violent opposition, carried in both
                    houses by immense majorities, and finally passed into a law (55th George 111. c.
                    26).</p>
                <p>The agriculturists confidently expected that this act would immediately raise
                    prices, and render them steady at about 80s. But, for reasons which will be
                    afterwards stated, these expectations were entirely disappointed , and there has
                    been a more ruinous fluctuation of prices since 1815, when it was passed, than
                    in any previous period of our recent history. In 1821, when prices had sunk very
                    low, a committee of the House of Commons was appointed to inquire into the
                    causes of the depressed state of agriculture, and to report their observations
                    thereupon. This committee, after examining a number of witnesses, drew up a
                    report, which, though not free from error, is a very valuable document. It
                    contains a forcible exposition of the pernicious influence of the law of 1815,
                    of which it suggested several important modifications. These, however, were not
                    adopted; and as the low prices and consequent distress of the agriculturists
                    continued, the subject was brought under the consideration of parliament in the
                    following year. After a good deal of discussion, a new act was then passed (3d
                    Geo. IV. cap. 60), which enacted, that, after prices had risen to the limit of
                    free importation fixed by the act of 1815, that act was to cease, and the new
                    statute to come into operation. This statute lowered the prices fixed by the act
                    of 1815, at which importation could take place for home consumption, to the
                    following sums, viz.</p>

                <p>But in order to prevent any violent oscillation of prices from a large supply of
                    grain being suddenly thrown upon the market, it was enacted, that a duty of 17s.
                    a quarter should be laid on all wheat imported from foreign countries during the
                    first three months after the opening of the ports if the price was between 70s.
                    and 80s. a quarter, and of 12s. afterwards; and if the price was between 80s.
                    and 85s. the duty was to be 10s. during the first three months, and 5s.
                    afterwards; and if the price should exceed 85s∙ the duty was to be constant at
                    Is.; and proportionally for other sorts of grain.</p>
                <p>This act, by preventing importation until the home price rose to 70s. and then
                    loading the quantities imported between that limit and the limit of 80s. with
                    heavy duties, was certainly more favourable to the views of the agriculturists
                    than the act of 1815. But, unluckily for them, no species of corn except barley
                    was sufficiently high while this act existed to bring it into operation.</p>
                <p>In 1825, the first approach was made to a better system, by permitting the
                    importation of wheat from British North America, without reference to the price
                    at home, on payment of a duty of 5s. a quarter. But the act for this purpose was
                    passed with difficulty, and was limited to one year’s duration.</p>
                <p>Owing to the drought which prevailed during the summer of 1826, there was every
                    prospect that there would be a great deficiency in the crops of that year; and
                    in order to prevent the disastrous consequences that might have taken place had
                    importation been prevented until the season was too far advanced for bringing
                    supplies from the great corn markets in the north of Europe, his majesty was
                    authorized to admit 500,000 quarters of foreign wheat, on payment of such duties
                    as the order in council for its importation should declare. And when it was
                    ascertained that the crops of oats, peas, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> were
                    greatly below ,an average, ministers issued an order in council, on their own
                    responsibility, on the 1st of September, authorizing the immediate importation
                    of oats on payment of a duty of 2s. 6d. a boll, and of rye, peas, and beans, on
                    payment of a duty of 3s. 6d. a quarter. A considerable quantity of oats was
                    imported under this order, the timely appearance of which had no doubt a
                    considerable effect in mitigating the pernicious consequences arising from the
                    deficiency of that species of grain. Ministers obtained an indemnity for this
                    order in the subsequent meeting of parliament.</p>
                <p>Nothing could more strikingly evince the impolicy of the acts of 1815 and. 1822
                    than the necessity under which the legislature and government had been placed of
                    passing the temporary acts and issuing the orders alluded to. The more
                    intelligent portion of the agriculturists began at length to perceive that the
                    corn laws were not really calculated to produce the advantages they had
                    anticipated; and a conviction that increased facilities should be given to
                    importation becanie general throughout the country. The same conviction made
                    considerable progress in the House of Commons; so much so, that several members
                    who supported the measures adopted in 1815 and 1822 expressed themselves
                    satisfied that the principle of exclusion had been carried too far, and that a
                    more liberal system should be adopted. Ministers having participated in these
                    sentiments, Mr Canning moved a senes of resolutions, as the foundation of a new
                    corn law, on the 1st of March 1827. These resolutions bore that foreign corn
                    might be imported, at all times, free of duty, for warehousing; and that it
                    should always be admissible for home consumption on payment of certain duties.
                    Thus, in the instance of wheat, it was resolved that, when the home price was at
                    or above 70s. a quarter, the duty should be a fixed one of Is. a quarter; and
                    that for every shilling <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751718"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1718-0342"/>that the price fell below 70s. a duty of 2s.
                    should be imposed; so that, when the price was at 69s., the duty on importation
                    was to be 2s.; when at 68s. the duty was to be 4s. and so on. The limit at which
                    the constant duty of Is. a quarter was to take place in the case of barley was
                    originally fixed at 37s.; but it was subsequently raised to 40s.; the duty
                    increasing by Is. 6d. for every shilling which the price fell below that limit.
                    The limit at which the constant duty of Is. a quarter was to take place in the
                    case of oats was originally fixed at 28s.; but it was subsequently raised to
                    33s., the duty increasing at the rate of Is. a quarter for every shilling that
                    the price fell below that limit. The duty on colonial wheat was fixed at 6d∙ the
                    quarter when the home price was above 65s.; and when the price was under that
                    sum, the duty was constant at 5s.; the duties on other descriptions of colonial
                    grain were similar. These resolutions were agreed to by a large majority; and a
                    bill founded on them was subsequently carried through the House of Commons.
                    Owing, however, to the change of ministers which took place in the interim,
                    several peers originally favourable to the bill, and some even who assisted in
                    its preparation, saw reason to become amongst its most violent opponents: a
                    clause moved by the Duke of Wellington interdicting all importation until the
                    home price exceeded 66s. having been carried in the Lords, ministers gave up the
                    bill, justly considering that such a clause was entirely subversive of its
                    principle.</p>
                <p>A new set of resolutions with respect to the corn trade were brought forward in
                    1828 by Mr Charles Grant. They were founded upon the same principles as those
                    which had been rejected during the previous session. But the duty was not made
                    to vary equally, as in Mr Canning’s resolutions, with every equal variation of
                    price; it being 18s. 8d. when the home price was 67s. the imperial quarter, and
                    10s. 8d. only when it was 70s.; a difference of 3s. in the price making a
                    difference of no less than 8s. in the duty. The point when the fixed duty of Is.
                    was to commence was fixed at 73s. a quarter. We subjoin a table of the duties
                    imposed by the act founded on Mr Grant’s resolutions (9 Geo. IV. cap. 60), by
                    which the corn trade is at present regulated.</p>

                <p>The prices which govern the duties and regulations in this act are ascertained
                    from the sales of corn in most of the principal towns of England. The dealers
                    are bound, under a penalty for each omission, to make weekly returns of these
                    sales to the corn inspectors resident in the different towns, who report them to
                    the comptroller of corn <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751731"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1731-0343"/>returns at London. The latter deduces from them a
                    general average price, which is weekly published in the Gazette. Attempts have
                    sometimes been made to falsify the average, by making reports of íietitious
                    sales; but it is generally believed that the prices as reported have
                    corresponded very closely with the real prices at the time.</p>
                <p>Besides the objections which, it will be immediately shown, may be made to all
                    protecting duties, from their tendency to force up average priées, and to render
                    exportation in abundant years impossible, the duty imposed by the 9th Geo. IV.
                    cap. 60, is liable to some which may be looked upon as peculiar to itself. From
                    the way in which it is graduated, it introduces a new element of uncertainty
                    into every transaction connected with the corn trade, producing a disinclination
                    on the part of the merchant to import, and of the foreigner to raiŝe corn for
                    our markets. Suppose a merchant commissions a cargo of wheat when the price is
                    at 7Is. a quarter, in the event of the price declining only 3s. or to 68s., the
                    duty will rise from 6s. 8d. to 16s. 8d.; and if the merchant brings the grain to
                    market he will realise 13s. a quarter less than he expected, and 10s. less than
                    he would have done had there been no duty, or the duty been constant '</p>
                <p>It may perhaps be said, that if, on the one hand, the present scale of duties be
                    injurious to the merchant when prices are falling, and when importation is
                    consequently either unnecessary, or of less advantage, it is, on the other hand,
                    equally advantageous to him, when prices are rising, and when the public
                    interests require that importation should be encouraged; but the prices in the
                    view of the merchant when he gives an order are usually such as he supposes will
                    yield a fair profit; and if they rise, this rise would, supposing the duty to be
                    constant, yield such an extra profit as would of itself encourage him to
                    increase his importations to the utmost. If it were possible to devise a system
                    that would diminish the losses of the merchants engaged in unfavourable
                    speculations, by making a proportional deduction from the extraordinary gains of
                    those whose speculations turn out to be unusually successful, something perhaps
                    might be found to say in its favour. But the system we have been considering
                    proceeds upon quite opposite principles; its effect is not to diminish risks,
                    but to increase them; it adds to the loss resulting from an unsuccessful, and to
                    the profit resulting from a successful speculation!</p>
                <p>It would therefore seem, that if a duty be imposed, one that is constant is
                    preferable to one that fluctuates. When the duty is constant, all classes,
                    farmers as well as merchants, are aware of its amount, and can previously
                    calculate the extent of its influence. But the effect of a duty that fluctuates
                    with the fluctuations of prices can never be appreciated beforehand. Its
                    magnitude depends on contingent and accidental circumstances, and it must
                    therefore of necessity prejudice the interests of the farmer as well as of the
                    corn-dealer.</p>
                <p>The policy on which the corn trade of Ireland was eon-ducted during the last
                    century, was not materially different in its principles from that followed in
                    Great Britain. In 1707, the Irish parliament granted, by a statute framed in
                    imitation of the English act of 1689, a bounty of Is. 6d. per quarter on every
                    quarter of wheat exported when the price was at or under 14s.; of Is. on the
                    quarter of barley, bear, or big, when at or under 10s.; and of Is. on the
                    quarter of oats when at or under 9s. This act, however, did not by any means
                    place the Irish agriculturists on the same footing with those of Great Britain.
                    The bounty scarcely exceeded one fourth part of what had been granted in this
                    country; and Mr Newenkam has shown, that the prices, when it became payable,
                    were fixed much below the average rate at the time. <hi rend="italic">^Natural
                    and Political Circumstances of Ireland,</hi> p. 124.)</p>
                <p>Though we are very far from imagining that Ireland lost any thing by this
                    different treatment, it shows the spirit wbich influenced thç English government
                    in its conduct towards that country. If bounties were really beneficial, as they
                    were then supposed to be, Ireland had a right to every advantage that could be
                    derived from them. We had just succeeded in putting a stop to her rising
                    progress in the woollen manufacture; and if the government of England, and its
                    dependents in the Irish parliament, had not been actuated by a mean and
                    illiberal jealousy of the advancement of Irish agriculture, as well as of Irish
                    manufactures, the same encouragements to cultivation would doubtless have been
                    held forth in both countries.</p>
                <p>The bounty continued to be regulated by the act of 1707 till 175Ô, when its mode
                    of payment was changed, but the amount remained nearly the same. In the reign of
                    George III., however,, a different policy was adopted, and several consecutive
                    laws (5th Geo. III. c. 19, 13th and 14th Ged. III. ĉ. 11, 19th and 20th Geo.
                    III. c. 17) were enacted, by which the bounties were greatly enlarged. At last,
                    in 1784, the celebrated statute, 23d and 24th Geo. III. c. 19, was passed, by
                    which a bounty of 3s. 4d. was granted on every barrel of wheat weighing twenty
                    stone exported when the home price was at or under 27s.; of Is. 7d. on the
                    barrel of barley, bear, and big, weighing sixteen stone, when at or under 13s.
                    6d., and of Is. 5d. on the barrel of oats, weighing fourteen stone, when at or
                    under 10s. These high bounties, coupled with the prohibitory duties imposed at
                    the same time on importation, amounting to 10s. the barrel on wheat when the
                    home price was at or under 30s., on barley 10s. when at or under 14s. 6d., and
                    on oats ðs. when at or under 1 Is., gave an extraordinary stimulus to
                    cultivation, and soon caused a very great increase of tillage, and of the
                    exports of corn from Ireland.</p>
                <p>It is extremely doubtful, however, notwithstanding the encomiums which have been
                    lavished on the act of 1784 by Mr Newenham and others, whether this increase of
                    tillage has not been really prejudicial. The nature of the soil, and the
                    humidity of the climate, render Ireland much better fitted for pasture than for
                    cropping. Mr Young, certainly a very competent judge of such matters, asserts
                    that wheat and other kinds of grain raised in that country are decidedly
                    inferior in quality to those of Britain; that the crops, too, even under the
                    best management, are full of grass and weeds, and that the harvests are
                    generally wet and tedious. Now, surely the <hi rend="italic">mere extension</hi>
                    of tdlage under such circumstances, and this was the whole effect of the bounty,
                    could not be advantageous. If the agriculture of Ireland had been improved, if
                    more produce had been obtained with less labour than formerly, and if the
                    cottage system, the bane of that kingdom, had been losing ground, it might have
                    been justly contended that the immediate effects of the bounty had been
                    beneficial; but it has not had, and could not rationally be expected to have,
                    any such consequences. “Perhaps,” says Mr Wakefield, “I shall be told that
                    Ireland under the present system is improving, and that rents of late years have
                    considerably risen. Kents will rise by an extension, as well as by an
                    improvement of tillage;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>they will rise from an increase in the price of produce; and it is well known
                    that they have risen in consequence of an enlargement of circulating medium. To
                    these causes I ascribe the latter circumstance, the truth of which I fully
                    admit, though I absolutely deny the former. If any one will show me farming

                    construction, in the hands of an Irish farmer, whose only means of support is
                    the cultivation of the soil, I will allow that some improvement has taken place.
                    Is any competent judge prepared to say, that fewer acres, in proportion to the
                    whole tillage land, are cultivated with the spade, than there were twenty years
                    ago? Some, perhaps, may consider this system as beneficial, by affording
                    employment to the people; but it might be observed on the other hand, that to
                    count the grains of wheat in every barrel would furnish them employment also. In
                    every case of this kind we ought to look to the result, for employment is useful
                    only as it becomes productive.” <hi rend="italic">(Account of Ireland,
                    Statistical and Political,</hi> vol. i. p. 582.)</p>
                <p>It appears much more reasonable to ascribe any real improvement which may have
                    taken place in Ireland since 1784, to the comparative degree of freedom then
                    conferred on that country; to the abolition of various restrictions previously
                    imposed on its industry; and, above all, to the political privileges conferred
                    on the Catholics, rather than to the mere granting of a bounty on the
                    exportation of corn. A great proportion of the people were formerly a degraded
                    sect, viewed with jealousy and aversion by the ruling few, and deprived of all
                    political power; and it was natural to expect that a very marked improvement in
                    their circumstances should take place after they were in some measure restored
                    to the enjoyment of their natural rights, and had become really interested in
                    the improvement of the country. This, in our opinion, is the chief source of the
                    recent improvement of Ireland, which, instead of being accelerated, was kept
                    back by the bounty. By suddenly raising prices, that measure certainly
                    stimulated the cultivation of the soil; but the want of capital, and the
                    consequent difficulty of finding farmers capable of taking large farms, coupled
                    with the general predilection of the Irish people in favour of small ones, have
                    conspired to cause a still more minute division of property, and to give a
                    factitious stimulus to population. The mere fact of an increase having taken
                    place in the numbers of a people (and it is on this that Mr Newenham principally
                    relies when contending for the favourable effects of the bounty), will not
                    enable us to determine whether it has been really beneficial. If it were
                    possible, and we trust it is not, to give the English and Scotch peasants the
                    same habits as those of Ireland, to render them satisfied with potatoes, mud
                    cottages, fags and wretchedness, their numbers would rapidly increase; but it
                    would, at the same time, be indisputably certain that their situation would be
                    altered very much for the worse. In the same way, if we could inspire the people
                    of Ireland with the same taste for comforts, cleanliness, and good living, which
                    so honourably distinguishes the people of England, their number would perhaps be
                    diminished, but their social condition would be rendered far more enviable than
                    at present. More happiness, more enjoyment, more, in short, of every thing that
                    is either desirable or praiseworthy, will be found in a country occupied by a
                    comparatively few inhabitants, well fed, well clothed, and well educated, than
                    are to be found in a nation peopled with myriads of human beings pressing
                    against the limits of subsistence, and sunk in poverty and ignorance.</p>
                <p>The endeavour to impress on the minds of the lower classes the propriety of being
                    contented with the simplest and cheapest fare, is extremely pernicious to the
                    best <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> interests of mankind. Encomiums ought not to
                    be bestowed on those who are satisfied with mere necessaries. On the contrary,
                    such indifference ought to be held disgraceful. A taste for the comforts, the
                    enjoyments, and the luxuries of life, should be as widely diffused as possible,
                    and, if possible, interwoven with the national character and prejudices. This,
                    as it appears to us, is the best mode of attempting to meliorate the condition
                    of the lower classes. Luxurious and even wasteful habits are incomparably better
                    than that sluggish apathy, which would content itself with what can barely
                    continue mere animal existence. “In those countries,” Mr 11 icardo judiciously
                    observes, “where the labouring classes have the fewest wants, and are contented
                    with the cheapest food, the people are exposed to the greatest vicissitudes and
                    miseries. They have no place of refuge from calamity; they cannot seek safety in
                    a lower station; they are already so low that they can fall no lower. On any
                    deficiency of the chief article of their subsistence, there are few substitutes
                    of which they can avail themselves, and dearth to them is attended with almost
                    all the evils of famine.”</p>
                <p>The corn law of 1804, the first framed subsequently to the union, extended to
                    Ireland; and the price at which the bounty became payable on the exportation of
                    wheat from that country was raised to 29s. 4d. per barrel, and of rye to 20s.
                    4d.; the price at which the bounty was given on the exportation of oats remained
                    the same, and almost no alteration was made on the amount of the bounties
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>The shackles which an absurd policy had at different. times (see 33d Geo. III. c.
                    65, 42d Geo. III. c. 35, 44th Geo. III. c. 65, &amp;c.) imposed on the transport
                    of corn be-ļ tween Great Britain and Ireland, were not removed by the' act of
                    1804. These impolitic restraints were, however,, abolished very soon after. The
                    act of 1806 (46th Geo. 111. c. 97) established a perfect freedom in the corn
                    trade between the two great divisions of the empire; and contributed more
                    perhaps to the general advantage and prosperity, than any other enactment framed
                    in the reign of George III.</p>
                <p>The provisions of the existing law regulating exportation and importation are the
                    same in Ireland as in Great Britain. The averages by which the opening and
                    shutting of the ports are regulated, being framed with reference to the price of
                    British corn only, it follows, as prices are always lower in Ireland than in
                    this country, that the restriction on importation operates most efficaciously in
                    that country.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Our

                <p>II. PRINCIPLES OF THE CORN LAWS.</p>
                <p>Having completed this sketch of the history of the corn laws, we shall now
                    briefly examine the principles on which they have been founded. And as there no
                    longer exists any difference of opinion as to the propriety of giving an
                    unbounded freedom of exportation, we shall confine our inquiries to the policy
                    of encouraging this exportation by means of a bounty, and of laying restrictions
                    on importation.</p>
                <p>That this subject may be properly understood, it is necessary to premise, that
                    the average value of corn, like that of every other commodity, is regulated, in
                    every stage of society, <hi rend="italic">by the greater or less quantity of
                    labour necessary to its production under the most unfavourable</hi><hi

                    of this important and fundamental principle, see Mr Ricardo’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principles of Political Economy and Taxation.</hi></p></note> A bushel of wheat
                    might be obtained from the rich soil in the Carse of Gowrie at a half or a third
                    of the expense necessary to produce it in less favoured situations, and might
                    therefore be sold for a half or a third part of the price of the other. But if
                    the demand be such as requires the cultivation of inferior lands, the price of
                    the produce of the richer lands is elevated so as to admit of the ordinary
                    profits of stock being realized on the poorest. For were it not raised to this
                    height, the cultivation of the inferior lands would be abandoned, and the
                    necessary supplies of food would no longer be obtained.</p>
                <p>In the earlier stages of society, and wherever the population is very limited,
                    the best lands only are cultivated; and as they yield a large produce with
                    comparatively little labour, its value is proportionally low. But as society
                    advances, and as population becomes more numerous, recourse must be had to
                    inferior soils. A greater expenditure of capital and labour is then required to
                    produce the same quantity of corn; and, of course, its value, compared with
                    other commodities, in the production of which no additional quantity of labour
                    has been required, is increased.</p>
                <p>The raising of raw produce is, therefore, very different from any other species
                    of industry. In manufactures, the worst machinery is first set in motion, and
                    every day its powers are improved; and it is rendered capable of yielding a
                    greater amount of produce with the same expense. The discovery of a new machine,
                    or of a more expeditious and less expensive mode of manufacturing, very soon
                    supersedes the older and clumsier machinery previously in use; while the
                    consequent competition never fails to reduce the price of commodities to the sum
                    which the least expensive method of production requires for their
                    manufacture.</p>
                <p>In agriculture, on the contrary, the best machines, that is, the best soils, are
                    first brought into use; and recourse is afterwards had to inferior soils,
                    requiring a greater expenditure of capital and labour to produce the same
                    supplies. Improvements in the construction of farming implements, and in
                    agricultural management, reduce the price of raw produce; and, operating like
                    improvements in manufacturing machinery, so far assimilate the two species of
                    industry. Any fall, however, which may take place in the price of raw produce,
                    as it enables every class of society to procure a greater quantity of it than
                    before, in exchange for their manufactured commodities or their labour, raises
                    the profits of stock, and leads, of course, to an increased accumulation of
                    capital. But “this accumulation necessarily leads to a greater demand for
                    labour, to higher wages, to an increased population, and consequently to a
                    further demand for raw produce, and to an increased cultivation.” (Ricardo, <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles,</hi> &amp;c. p. 79.) Agricultural improvements cheek,
                    for a time, the necessity of having recourse to inferior soils; but the check is
                    only temporary. The stimulus which they at the same time give to population,
                    soon equalizes the demand with the supply, and, byā re-action of a different
                    kind, raises prices, and forces the cultivation of poor lands.</p>
                <p>The value of raw produce, therefore (though improvements in agriculture, and
                    other circumstances, occasionally reduce it), has a natural tendency to rise as
                    society advances. As it becomes more difficult to raise food, it necessarily
                    exchanges for a greater quantity of other produce. Not merely its nominal, but
                    its real price is increased; and no person can have the same command over it as
                    before, without making a proportionally greater sacrifice of labour, or of some
                    other equivalent.</p>
                <p>This circumstance, and not the accumulation of capital, by raising wages, reduces
                    the profits of stock, and cheeks, or at least retards, the progress of all old
                    settled and populous countries. The real value of a commodity not being
                    regulated by the price at which the labour required for its production is paid,
                    but by the quantity of that labour, every increase in the wages of workmen
                    obviously lessens the share of the commodity they manufacture which belongs to
                    the capitalist, or, which is the same thing, it lessens the profits of
                    stock.</p>
                <p>Supposing the value of money to be invariable, and the quantity of labour
                    necessary to produce L.1000 worth of gloves to remain the same, the gloves would
                    continue to sell for that sum, whether tb.e wages of the labour necessary to
                    their production amounted to L.600, to L.800, or to L.900. The rise of wages, it
                    must be remembered, is supposed to be quite general; and hence, if theL.1000
                    worth of gloves freely exchanged, before wages rose, for a certain quantity of
                    boots, stockings, coats, &amp;c. they would do the same afterwards, unless the
                    labour expended on these other commodities had increased or diminished; for it
                    is evident that a rise of wages which equally affects different commodities
                    leaves their relative values unaltered.</p>
                <p>If the rise of wages were not universal, and if the glove manufacturer alone had
                    to pay 10 per cent, additional on the wages of his workmen, while the
                    manufacturer of boots, stockings, coats, Ac. paid only the former rate of wages,
                    he would either obtain a greater quantity of these commodities in exchange for
                    gloves, or be forced to abandon his trade altogether. But such a state of things
                    could not continue. There would immediately be an influx of labourers into the
                    glove manufactory; and their increase in one department of industry, and
                    consequent diminution in the rest, would very speedily adjust wages to the same
                    level. As soon, however, as this adjustment was effected, the exchangeable
                    values of these commodities would be precisely the same as before the rise of
                    wages. The glove manufacturer could not say to the stocking manufacturer that he
                    must have a greater quantity of stockings in exchange for gloves, inasmuch as he
                    paid a higher rate of wages, for the other would have it in his power to answer
                    that the rise of wages affected him to exactly the same exstent. Commodities
                    would, therefore, continue to sell after the rise for the same price as before,
                    but that price would be differently divided. A greater share would belong to the
                    labourer, and a less to the capitalist, or, which is the same thing, the profits
                    of stock would be diminished.</p>
                <p>Fluctuations in the value of money obscure, but do not in any degree affect, the
                    relation of profits and wages. A rise or a fall in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >real</hi> wages of labour, the only one we are here considering, results
                    entirely from a greater or less proportion of its produce going at one time to
                    workmen and at another to capitalists. When a greater share is assigned to the
                    workman, his wages are really augmented, and when a smaller share, they are as
                    really diminished, whatever may be the state of <hi rend="italic">money</hi>
                    wages.</p>
                <p>It has, indeed, been contended, that the price of labour has no connection with
                    the price of food, and that the former being regulated solely by the supply and
                    demand, a rise in the price of corn does not necessarily cause any increase in
                    the wages of labour, nor consequently any reduction in the profits of stock. But
                    the cost of rearing and maintaining labourers, independent of all other
                    considerations, determines the lowest limit to which the price of labour can
                    permanently fall. In a manufacturing country the rate of wages is, no doubt,
                    exposed to great fluctuations, and a stagnation may take place in trade at the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751770" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1770-0346"/> same time
                    that corn is rising, so that the labouring class may at once experience an
                    increase in the price of provisions and a fall of wages. But if the rise in the
                    price of corn be of a permanent nature, and if the demand do not occasion a
                    corresponding rise in the price of labour, the principle of increase will be
                    affected, and the number of workmen will be gradually reduced, until wages be
                    raised to their proper level.</p>
                <p>It may perhaps be objected, that in countries where labour is well rewarded, and
                    where not more than a third or two fifths of the wages of workmen are expended
                    in the purchase of corn, an increase in the price of bread and meal would act
                    rather as an inducement to retrench from what was not essentially necessary,
                    than in diminution of the rate of increase. Few, however, of the countries of
                    Europe are in this situation; and as· labourers constitute by far the greatest
                    portion of every society, no system of policy should be recommended which has
                    any tendency to diminish their hard-earned coinforts. The experience of all ages
                    has shown that a needy populace lose a just sense of their dignity and rights as
                    men, and become depraved and enslaved. It is in vain to expect industry where it
                    does not meet with a suitable reward; men will not submit to privations and
                    labour, unless in the hope of securing corresponding comforts.</p>
                <p>According to Mr A. Young, to whose meritorious exertions we are indebted for much
                    valuable information respecting political and rural economy, the mean price of
                    agricultural labour in 17G7, 1768, and 1770, was about 7s. 6d. per week, or Is.
                    3d. per day. Mr Young further states the mean price of labour in 1810 and 1811
                    at 14s. 6d. per week, or 2s. 5d. per day, being a rise of nearly cent, per cent,
                    on the former period. But he estimates the average rise on bread, meat, butter,
                    and cheese, during the same interval, at 135 per cent.; and, consequently, wages
                    were really higher in 1770 than in 1810, by the difference, or 35 per cent.</p>
                <p>Since 1813, however, the prices of bread, butcher’s meat, cheese, butter, sugar,
                    candles, and most articles of provision, have fallen at an average from 40 to 50
                    per cent. But during this period the wages of some sorts of labour have hardly
                    declined any thing; while, though the fall in other departments has been
                    considerable, it has been decidedly less than the fall in the price of
                    provisions. This circumstance satisfactorily accounts for a part at least of the
                    rise of profits during the war, and of their decline since the peace; for the
                    previous statements make it quite clear that during the war the labourers were
                    receiving a less share of the produce of their industry than they received
                    before it began, or since its termination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    The improvement in the condition of the labouring class since 1815 is indeed too
                    obvious to admit of dispute. It is true, that in some districts of the south,
                    where the pernicious practice of mixing poor-rates and wages has been adopted,
                    the situation of the lower classes is far from satisfactory. This, however, is
                    only a local, and, it is to be hoped, also a temporary evil; for it has been
                    shown again and again that a stop may be put to its further progress, and that
                    it may be rooted out, by merely reverting to the system of poor-laws established
                    previously to 1795. Throughout all the north of England, in Scotland, and
                    wherever, indeed, the practice of eking out wages by allowances from the
                    poor-rates has not obtained, the poor are decidedly better off at this moment
                    than at any former period of our history.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>If the number of labourers were suddenly increased when wages rise, or suddenly
                    reduced when they fall, such fluctuations would have very little influence over
                    their condition. But the number of labourers, though notfixed, can, speaking
                    generally, be increased or diminished only by slow degrees. When wages rise, the
                    condition of the labourers is improved; for the stimulus given to population by
                    such rise cannot have any sensible influence on the supply of labour for more
                    than twenty years, and during this lengthened period the labourer has time to
                    acquire improved tastes and habits; the standard of his enjoyments is raised;
                    and he hesitates about marrying unless he supposes he can maintain his wife and
                    children in the improved condition to which he has attained. The opposite
                    circumstances take place when wages fall. The labourers are in that case obliged
                    to economize; to descend, as it were, to a lower station, and to content
                    themselves with inferior accommodations; so that when wages rise after having
                    been for a considerable time depressed, a good deal of the influence of the
                    rise, or perhaps the whole, is exhausted in elevating the labourers to the point
                    whence they had been sunk by the fall.</p>
                <p>Hence, in stating that money wages are always governed by variations in the price
                    of food and other necessaries, the proposition must be understood with its
                    necessary limitations∙ There is in all cases a <hi rend="italic">vis
                    inertiae</hi> to be overcome, that prevents any change of prices from having
                    what may be considered its proper effect on wages. When the former rise, money
                    wages do not immediately rise in the same proportion, nor do they immediately
                    fall when prices fall. But they always vary in <hi rend="italic">the. same
                    direction,</hi> and depend mainly upon and are materially influenced by each
                    other.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a further
                    development of this principle, see the chapter on Wages, in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Political Ecoaomy</hi> in this wort.</p></note></p>
                <p>If, therefore, speaking generally, a bounty on exportation, or restrictions on
                    importation, raise the exchangeable value, or real price of corn, they will also
                    raise the rate of wages. But as the exchangeable value of manufactured
                    commodities is not enhanced by a rise in the price of labour, it is evident that
                    the profits ∙of stock, and the power of accumulating capital, must be diminished
                    proportionally to the fictitious increase in the price of corn.</p>
                <p>By extending the market for corn, when a bounty is first granted, the money <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> price of raw produce is raised, and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> agricultural profits being elevated above the general
                    level, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> there is an influx of capital from other
                    departments, until· they are again reduced. Thus far a bounty accomplishes, its
                    object, and gives at least a temporary stimulus to cultivation. If the newly
                    employed capital rendered the same returns as the capital previously <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> engaged in raising corn, its real price would not be
                    increased. But, as we have already observed, this cannot be the case for any
                    considerable period. Discoveries in agriculture may, for a while, prevent
                    recourse being had to poor soils; but the constant increase of population will
                    in the end force their cultivation. Now, the bounty has in this respect
                    precisely the same effects as an increase of population. Both increase the
                    demand for corn; and as by this increase we areat length forced to employ
                    inferior machinery, or worse land, in order to raise the additional supplies,
                    their value must be augmented.</p>
                <p>Were the prices of corn in Britain and Spain, for example, nearly on a level, no
                    exportation would take place from the one to the other. But if, when prices are
                    in this situation, a bounty of 5s. per quarter were granted by our government,
                    corn would be immediately poured from England into Spain. Limits would, it is
                    true, be soon set to its exportation. The competition which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751783" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1783-0347"/>3 takes place among
                    exporters, as among every other class of traders, prevents then* realizing more
                    than the ordinary 'profits of stock, so that grain would be exported from
                    England to Spain, not in the expectation of realizing the whole bounty as
                    profit, but in the view merely of securing the <hi rend="italic">ordinary
                    rate</hi> of profit on the capital employed in its transfer. A rise of prices,
                    though not to the whole extent of the bounty, would therefore immediately take
                    place in this country, 'and a corresponding fall in Spain. Nor would this rise
                    and fall be temporary. Corn would be permanently reduced in Spain, because the
                    unusual cheapness of the foreign supplies would throw the poorest lands out of
                    tillage; and it would be permanently raised in England, because the increased
                    demand would stimulate the bringing of them under cultivation. A bounty to the
                    extent ŵe have supposed would perhaps depress prices 2s. 6d. per quarter in
                    Spain, and raise them as much in Britain. To the Spaniards it would be extremely
                    advantageous, as it would enable them to purchase the most indispensable
                    necessary of life at so much less than they could otherwise do; in Britain,
                    however, its effects would be directly opposite. A few more of our heaths and
                    bogs might be cultivated, but every class of persons, landlords alone excepted,
                    would find it more difficult to procure food than before. The higher price of
                    corn (supposing it not to raise wages and diminish profits, which it would most
                    unquestionably do) would obviously be of no advantage, and could not enrich the
                    public, since it would in the end be exactly proportioned to the greater
                    difficulty experienced in raising the additional quantity.</p>
                <p>Every bounty is objectionable, as producing an unnatural distribution of the
                    national capital; but a bounty on a manufactured commodity does not increase the
                    quantity of labour necessary for its production, and would not, of course, raise
                    its exchangeable value. In this respect, a bounty on the raising of raw produce
                    is the most impolitic of any, inasmuch as it not only occasions a faulty
                    distribution of capital, but also raises the cost of production, and,
                    consequently, the real price of the articles produced.</p>
                <p>The argument that Dr Smith has brought forward against granting a bounty is not
                    therefore tenable. The nature of things has not, as he imagined, stamped upon
                    corn a real and unalterable value. The variations in its exchangeable worth,
                    excluding the effects of scarcity and of extraordinarily luxuriant crops, though
                    somewhat slow, are extremely perceptible at distant periods. Wheat raised at an
                    immense expense from a worthless bog or morass, must have a greater value than
                    that which, in an earlier stage of society, is raised almost spontaneously from
                    rich alluvial lands. “It is natural,” as he has himself observed, “that what is
                    usually the produce of two days’ or two hours’ labour, should be worth double of
                    what is usually the produce of one day’s or one hour’s labour.”</p>
                <p> “If good land existed in a quantity much more abun- ’dantthan the production of
                    food for an increasing population required, or if capital could be indefinitely
                    employed without a diminished return on the old land, there could be no rise of
                    rent; for rent invariably proceeds from the employment of an additional quantity
                    of labour with a proportionally less return.” (Ilicardo, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principles of Political Economy,</hi> p. 58.) Now, as bounties force recourse
                    to poor soils, and consequently diminish the productive power of fresh capital
                    when applied to land, they contribute to raise rent, and are in so far
                    beneficial to the landlords. But the other classes of society, besides being
                    burdened with the tax necessary to pay the bounty, and compelled to pay an
                    additional price for their most indispensable necessaries, derive a less return
                    from their capitals. Farmers may, indeed, reap during the currency of their
                    leases some advantage from a bounty, but it cannot be permanent. An increase in
                    the cost of raising raw produce reduces agricultural as well as all other
                    profits. At the expiration of the farmer’s lease his rent is raised, and' he is
                    obliged to employ an additional number of labourers, and to pay them higher
                    wages, while the rise in the price of produce, as it is proportioned only to the
                    <hi rend="italic">rise of rent,</hi> or to the <hi rend="italic">additional
                    number</hi> of labourers, does not compensate the farmer for the rise in the
                    rate of wages.</p>
                <p>In as far, therefore, as bounties on exportation, or restrictions on the
                    importation of corn, tend to raise its real price; or to prevent it from
                    falling, they tend to diminish the general profits of stock, or to prevent their
                    rising to what they would be did no bounties or restrictions on importation
                    exist.</p>
                <p>But bounties in every case, and restrictions on importation where, as in Britain,
                    they are effectual, not only tend to lessen the profits of stock, and to check
                    the accumulation of capital, but they stimulate its transference toother
                    countries. The love of country, the thousand ties of society and friendship, the
                    ignorance of foreign languages, and the desire of having one’s funds employed
                    under their own inspection, will no doubt in many cases render capitalists
                    satisfied with a less rate of profit in their own country' than they might
                    derive by employing their funds in another. But the love of country has its
                    limits. The love of gain is a no less powerful and constantly operating
                    principle; and if capitalists be once assured that their stock may be laid out
                    with equal security, and with considerably greater advantage, in foreign states,
                    its transference to a greater or less degree will unquestionably·take place.</p>
                <p>Mr Malthus has dwelt at considerable length on the superior advantages enjoyed by
                    a manufacturing country possessing great resources in land. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Essay on Population,</hi> 5th edition, vol. ii. p. 24fi.) He conceives that
                    such a country “would go on increasing in riches and strength, although
                    surrounded by Bishop Berkeley’s wall of brass.” When manufacturing capital
                    became redundant, and manufactured commodities too cheap, it would have no
                    occasion to wait for the increasing raw produce of its neighbours. Its own
                    redundant manufacturing capital would be transferred to land; and, on the same
                    principle, when the price of raw produce fell too low, the capital employed in
                    raising it would be consigned to manufactures. In this way the national
                    prosperity might, in Mr Malthus’s opinion, be indefinitely prolonged.</p>
                <p>Had Mr Malthus extended this reasoning to the world at large, or at least to the
                    commercial part of it, it would have been unexceptionable. But unless this
                    particular country were <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> surrounded by a wall of
                    brass, capital would be withdrawn from it as soon as the increase of population
                    forced the cultivation of poorer soils than those cultivated in its immediate
                    vicinity, or as soon as the real price of its raw produce had become
                    comparatively high. Mr Malthus would readily admit that no capitalist would rest
                    satisfied with a less rate of profit in Devonshire, and would not continue to
                    pay his labourers at a higher rate in that county’, than in Yorkshire: but would
                    affirm, with every one else, that either the profits of stock must increase, and
                    the rate of wages be reduced in Devonshire, or that capital will be transferred
                    from it to York. And had lie recollected that the laws which regulate the
                    distribution of capital between different provinces of the same kingdom, are the
                    same with those which regulate its distributicn among different and independent
                    kingdoms, he could not have failed to perceive the erroneousness of his
                    conclusions when applied to the case of a nation having any intercourse with its
                    neighbours.</p>
                <p>This is the worst view that can be taken of bounties and restrictions. To
                    establish their impolicy, it is sufficient to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751796" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1796-0348"/>show that they necessarily
                    check the increase of that capital which alone supports labour and sets it in
                    motion, and by whose extent the extent of the industry of the country must be
                    regulated. But if they do not merely check the accumulation of capital, but also
                    force it abroad, we must be satisfied that they are among the very worst
                    expedients to which, in order to secure some temporary advantage, or to remedy
                    some temporary difficulty, a shortsighted policy can have recourse.</p>
                <p>It has, however, been contended, that although the first effect of the bounty may
                    be to raise prices, yet that, by attracting an unusually great capital to land,
                    it ultimately causes a glut of the market, and a fall of price. That this
                    statement may to a certain extent be consistent with fact, and that a glut of
                    the market, sufficient to cause a <hi rend="italic">temporary</hi> depression of
                    prices, may be produced by a bounty, we do not mean to deny; but such depression
                    cannot last for any lengthened period, unless the real price of corn, that is,
                    unless the labour necessary for its production, be diminished.</p>
                <p>When an unusual demand is experienced for corn, and capital is in consequence
                    moving from manufactures to land, prices may subsequently be higher, lower, or
                    the same as before. Their rise or fall depends entirely on the circumstance of
                    equal quantities of this newly employed capital being less or more productive
                    than the capital previously engaged in agriculture. The fresh capital cannot,
                    however, be more productive, except from an improvement in the manner of working
                    land, or from a saving of labour, which it is evident might take place without
                    any bounty, and cannot be occasioned by it; and if it be expended unaccompanied
                    by any such improvement, it must either raise prices or be in a great measure
                    lost to the proprietors; for if the poorest soils in tillage do not yield the
                    ordinary rate of profit, their cultivation must be abandoned.</p>
                <p>In reference to a glut of the home market caused by a bounty, it may be observed
                    that that will very seldom happen, except in seasons when there is an
                    extraordinarily luxuriant crop, and of course very low prices, in the country to
                    which the grain exported by means of the bounty is usually sent. Were Great
                    Britain <hi rend="italic">regularly</hi> in the habit of exporting corn, either
                    by a bounty or otherwise, to Spain, the <hi rend="italic">average</hi> prices of
                    both kingdoms would ere long become nearly stationary, at a rate such,'that the
                    cost of a quarter of wheat in Spain would exceed that of a quarter in England,
                    by the cost of transporting it from the one to the other, including in that cost
                    the profits of the capital employed, insurance, &amp;c. But though such would be
                    the case in ordinary years, it would be very different when there was any great
                    diversity in the crops in either country. When prices suddenly fell in Spain,
                    owing to a luxuriant harvest, exportation from England would as suddenly cease,
                    and would not be renewed until the fall in this country, caused by the cessation
                    of the foreign demand, had been as great as in Spain. A nation which exports
                    corn is liable to fluctuations of price, not merely from the state of its own
                    harvests, but also from those of its customers; and inasmuch as a bounty gives a
                    factitious extension to exportation, it must also tend to render prices less
                    steady.</p>
                <p>But supposing the accuracy of this statement to be admitted, it may still be
                    contended, that a nation which exports an extra quantity of corn by means of a
                    bounty, has at least a greater resource in years of scarcity than a nation in a
                    different situation. This idea, however, though plausible, and to a certain
                    extent correct, is in the main fallacious. If the deficiency of the crop did not
                    exceed the ordinary quantity of corn exported, there would not certainly be any
                    considerable rise of price; but if the deficiency exceeds that quantity, the
                    situation of an exporting country must evidently be a good deal worse than that
                    of a regularly importing one. In the latter, a slight rise of prices would
                    occasion a much greater importation; but in an exporting country, prices must
                    not only be raised by the whole cost of the carriage from foreign ports, but by
                    an additional sum, sufficient to determine importation into new channels.</p>
                <p>Thus, a deficiency of the crop of Poland not exceeding the quantity of corn
                    ordinarily exported from that country would not have any material effect on
                    prices; but no importation to make up for a larger deficiency could takeplace,
                    until prices had risen, not merely higher than ordinary, but decidedly higher
                    than the prices of the countries to which Poland is in the habit of
                    exporting.</p>
                <p>Again, in seasons when there is a luxuriant crop in a country exporting by means
                    of a bounty, it operates with double effect, and very little of the surplus is
                    stored up to answer the home consumption in case of future exigencies. By
                    forcing exportation, it hinders, as Dr Smith has observed, the plenty of one
                    year from relieving the distresses of another, and therefore occasions, in years
                    of scarcity, a greater importation than would otherwise be necessary.</p>
                <p>These conclusions do not depend on theory only. If we compare the prices from
                    1688 to 1766, the period of the operation of the bounty, and when the exports
                    almost always exceeded the imports, with the prices of the period from 1765 to
                    1792, when the corn trade enjoyed a tolerable degree of freedom, and when
                    importation and exportation were regulated nearly by the state of the supply and
                    demand, we shall find that prices varied a great deal more in the former period
                    than in the latter. Keeping out of view the years in which the coin was
                    degraded, or its value fluctuating, in 1724 the price of the Winchester quarter
                    of middling wheat was 32s. lθfd. and in the following year it had risen to 43s.
                    l∣d.; in 1727 it fell to 37s. 4d. and in 1728 it rose to 48s. 6d. The average
                    price of 1740 and 1741 was 43s. 4d. and of 1743 and 1744 only 22s. Id. a fall of
                    almost cent, per cent. And, again, in 1754 and 1755, the average price was 30s.
                    5d. and in 1756, 1757, and 1758, it was as high as 46s. 8d. ‘ The greatest
                    difference of price from 1711 to 1765 is that between the price of 1744, or 22s.
                    Id., and that of 1757, or 53s. 4d∙, amounting to no less than 148 per cent. On
                    the other hand, the lowest price of the period from 1765 to 1792 is that of
                    1776, or 36s. 2d., and the highest that of 1773, or 59s. 2d., a difference of 86
                    per cent. So much for the bounty equalizing prices.</p>
                <p>We have now said enough to show the pernicious tendency of a bounty'. At present,
                    indeed, we arc secure against its operation, should it be attempted to renew it,
                    as nothing but an extremely large bounty, or, which is the same thing, the
                    imposition of an extremely heavy tax on the country, to force exportation, could
                    render our corn, in ordinary years, sufficiently cheap for the foreign market.
                    The following remarks shall therefore be directed solely to the <hi
                    rend="italic">restriction of importation</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and as we
                    have already shown that restrictions, wherever they prevent access to the
                    cheapest markets, and thereby fictitiously keep up the price of corn, are, as
                    well as the bounty, exposed to the fundamental objection of diminishing the
                    profits of capital and forcing it abroad; we shall now advert, <hi rend="italic"
                    >first,</hi> to the security which the restrictive system is supposed to afford,
                    of furnishing an independent and ample supply of provisions; and, <hi
                    rend="italic">second,</hi> to its influence in maintaining prices uniformly at a
                    high level.</p>
                <p>I. Where one nation has been for a series of years in the habit of iŕńporting
                    corn from another, it must have exported some more acceptable produce as an
                    equivalent The farthers of the corn-growing country will, after this <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194751809" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1809-0349"/> commerce is
                    established, calculate as much upon the demand of the importing country, as on
                    that of their own 'citizens. - They will cultivate an additional quantity of
                    land, raise larger crops, and consequently pay higher rents, solely, because
                    they are assured of this vent for their produce. The benefits of this
                    intercourse are. therefore reciprocal, and the corn growers, as much as the corn
                    buyers, are interested in a continuance of the traffic, and would suffer as much
                    by its cessation. “When we consider,” says Mr Ricardo, “the value of even a few
                    weeks consumption of corn in England, no interruption could be given to the
                    export trade, if the Continent supplied us with any considerable quantity of
                    corn, without the most extensively ruinous commercial distress, distress which
                    no sovereign, or combination of sovereigns, would be willing to inflict on their
                    people; and, though willing, it would be a measure to which probably no people
                    would submit. It was the endeavour of Bonaparte to prevent the exportation of
                    the raw produce of Russia, more than any other cause, which produced the
                    astonishing efforts of the people of that country against the most powerful
                    fbree, perhaps, ever assembled to subjugate a nation?’ <hi rend="italic">(Essay

                <p>But when a nation adopts a policy like that on which we are now acting, and
                    refuses to admit any foreign corn, except when the home price reaches a height
                    indicating scarcity, she must then, it is obvious, contend in a market to which
                    no,corn has been brought, with a view to answer her demand. The difficulties we
                    have occasionally experienced in importing have been greatly exaggerated; but
                    they result, in fact, from the nature of our own policy respecting it.
                    Perpetually fluctuating between bounties, restrictions, and prohibitions, no
                    foreign country can ever calculate on our continuing to import their corn. We
                    may buy a million of quarters to-day, but we may buy no more for a couple of
                    twelvemonths. If our demand were steady, if we regularly imported, additional
                    supplies would be raised for our market; rents would be increased; and foreign
                    farmers, landlords, merchants, shipowners, &amp;c. would be deeply interested in
                    procuring us whatever quantity of corn we might require; but at present we enter
                    the foreign market as strangers only. Our orders may be expected, but they
                    cannot be reckoned on. Whatever supplies we may procure are withdrawn from the
                    <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi><hi rend="italic">stoch;</hi> so that prices
                    abroad are unnaturally raised, exportation checked, and the home price allowed
                    to reach a comparatively great height.</p>
                <p>Most foreign states have indeed fixed a statutory price at which exportation
                    shall always cease. But this price is much higher than the average; and were our
                    corn trade unrestricted, the importations into this country would not have so
                    much effect in raising prices abroad as is commonly supposed, as a greater
                    production would universally take place; and it is probable that foreign powers,
                    becoming sensible of the advantages of a free trade, would soon repeal this
                    limitation.</p>
                <p>When a merely temporary liberty is granted to import, the operations and the
                    enterprise of merchants are alike cramped. They cannot safely order corn from
                    <hi rend="italic">distant</hi> countries, lest the price should fall before it
                    arrives, and the ports be shut. They are compelled to have recourse to countries
                    in our immediate vicinity; their orders must be given on the spur of the moment,
                    and all that consideration and combination necessary to insure the success of
                    every complex transaction are unavoidably excluded.</p>
                <p>The law of 1815, and those enacted since, give liberty to import and warehouse
                    foreign grain duty free, either for re-exportation or for home consumption, when
                    the price reaches the limit at which it is admissible; but this liberty is not
                    of so much consequence as might be sup posed. Corn is at once a bulky and a
                    perishable commodity; and capitalists seldom employ large funds in importing it,
                    unless there be at the time a strong probability that prices will very soon
                    attain the limit when it may be sold. Corn will at all times be stored up for a
                    market like Amsterdam, because it may be disposed of aţ the pleasure of the
                    holder, and its sale is not regulated by any contingent circumstance. In this
                    country the case is very different. An unforeseen change of weather often checks
                    a rise of prices at the very time that a further rise was confidently expected;
                    and even the warehousing of any considerable quantity of foreign grain would of
                    itself have a similar, though a less effect. By giving little freedom to
                    mercantile operations, and preventing the importer from disposing of his
                    commodity when he thinks proper, this system, in ordinary years, tends to
                    suppress warehousing altogether, and, consequently, tends to deprive the country
                    of one of its main securities against a sudden rise of prices in deficient
                    years.</p>
                <p>It may be further observed, that the wider the surface from which a country
                    derives its supplies of food, the less is it exposed to fluctuations of price
                    arising from favourable or unfavourable seasons. A general failure of the crops
                    of an extensive kingdom is a calamity that but seldom occurs. The weather that
                    is unfavourable to vegetation in one species of soil is frequently advantageous
                    to it in another. If moist clay lands suffer from a wet summer, the crops are
                    rendered more luxuriant in dry rocky districts. The excess of produce in one
                    province compensates for its deficiency in another; and, except in anomalous
                    cases, the total supply is nearly the, same; but if this be generally true of a
                    single nation, it is <hi rend="italic">always</hi> true of the world at large.
                    No instance of universal scarcity darkens the history of mankind; but it is
                    constantly found, that when the crops of one country fail, plenty reigns in some
                    other quarter. A freedom of trade is alone wanted to guarantee a country like
                    Britain, abounding in all the varied products of industry, in merchandise suited
                    to the wants of every society, from the possibility of a scarcity. The nations
                    of the earth are not condemned to throw the dice to determine which of them
                    shall submit to be starved. There is always abundance of food in the world. To
                    enjoy a constant plenty, we have only to lay aside our prohibitions and
                    restrictions, and to cease to counteract the benevolent wisdom of
                    Providence.</p>
                <p>The case of Holland strongly corroborates the truth of this statement. In the
                    days of her greatest prosperity she was chiefly fed with imported corn, and the
                    prices at Amsterdam were extremely moderate, and, what is of infinite
                    consequence, were steadier than in any other market of Europe. Even during the
                    convulsions of the late war, and when her former commercial connections were
                    almost all dissolved, prices fluctuated very little.</p>
                <p>II. But, independently altogether of the circumstances already alluded to, it is
                    easy to see that restrictions on the importation of corn into such a country as
                    this must necessarily occasion ruinous fluctuations of price, raising it
                    sometimes far above, and at other times sinking it as much below, the common
                    level.</p>
                <p>The ability to export is indispensable to the equality of prices in a country
                    that grows nearly its own supply of corn; for, without such ability, all the
                    increased produce of an unusually luxuriant harvest being thrown upon the home
                    market, prices are sunk to such an extent as to be destructive of the interests
                    of the agriculturists. But the mere absence of any legal obstacle will not
                    insure the power of exportation. This maybe aboutas effectually prevented by the
                    influence of restrictions Qn importation, as by a prohibition of export. Suppose
                    that a country, either more, densely peopled, or less abundantly supplied <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194751822" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1822-0350"/> with fertile
                    land, than her neighbours, lays a restriction oil importation, and that, in
                    consequence, her average prices are raised 10s. or 15s. a quarter above those of
                    the surrounding states: This increase of price will give such a stimulus to
                    agriculture, that the corn produced at home may, and most probably will, at no
                    distant period, become adequate to supply the consumption. But should such be
                    the case, it is plain that the first unusually productive harvest would cause a
                    glut of the borne market; and that it would be impossible to set about relieving
                    this glut by exporting to other countries, till the prices fell to their
                    level—that is, till they had sunk 10s. or 15s. a quarter more than they would
                    have done, but for the previous enhancement caused by the restriction on
                    importation.</p>
                <p>The practical operation of the principle thus hypothetically stated, has defeated
                    the expectations and baffled all the efforts of the landholders of England to
                    keep up prices since 1815. Owing to the extraordinary encouragement given by the
                    high prices to agriculture during the latter years of the war, we grew, in 1811,
                    1812, and 1813, a sufficient supply for our own consumption, the imports in
                    these years being fully balanced by the exports to the Peninsula on account of
                    the British army. This showed conclusively that the restrictive system had
                    attained its <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> degree of influence; and any one who
                    attended to the circumstances might have foreseen that the first particularly
                    luxuriant crop would inevitably occasion a heavy fall of prices. No one,
                    however, seems to have taken this view of the matter; and, in consequence, the
                    agriculturists entertained the most unfounded expectations of relief from the
                    act of 1815. They imagined that the exclusion of foreign corn till prices
                    reached 80s. a quarter, would make them immediately rise to that level, and
                    prevent them from again sinking materially below it. Had the home supply been
                    decidedly under the consumption, or had it been impossible to cultivate any
                    considerable portion of the lands under tillage in 1813 at so low a rate as
                    80s., the anticipations of the agriculturists might have been realized; but such
                    was very far indeed from being the case. The home production had become about
                    equivalent to the demand; and experience proved that a price considerably under
                    80s. was sufficient to enable the culture of the greater part of the inferior
                    lands, that had been broken up during the war, to be carried on. It is no doubt
                    true, that a good deal of the fall of price in 1814 and 1815 was apparent rather
                    than real, and resulted as much from the rise that then took place in the value
                    of the currency, in consequence of the destruction of country bank paper, as
                    from an increased·supply of corn. Still, however, the fall in the value of corn,
                    brought about by the rise in the vaine of money, contributed equally with that
                    occasioned by increased production, to disappoint the agriculturists. The
                    exclusion of foreign corn till the home price reached 80s. rendered its price in
                    ordinary years, though considerably under that limit, a good deal higher than in
                    the surrounding European countries. But when, as in 1816 and 1817, the crops
                    were materially deficient, the restriction operated with increased efficacy, and
                    powerfully contributed, in the way already pointed out, to stint importation,
                    and consequently to increase the pressure of the scarcity, and to raise prices.
                    Unlooked for, however, as it certainly was, this effect of the restriction
                    proved in the end quite as injurious to the agriculturists as to the other
                    classes; for by adding materially to that rise of prices which a scarcity must
                    under any circumstances occasion, the stimulus it gives to agriculture is
                    proportionally augmented; so that when a luxuriant crop again occurs, the market
                    is much more overloaded than it would have been under a free system, and prices
                    sink in a corresponding degree.</p>
                <p>Owing partly to the deficient crop of 1816, but more to the obstacles in the way
                    of importation, the price of corn in 1817 rose to 94s. 9d. and in 1818 to 84s.
                    Id. Now mark the effects of these high prices. They revived the drooping spirits
                    of the farmers, who imagined that the corn laws were at length beginning to
                    produce the effects anticipated from them, and that the golden days of 1812,
                    when wheat sold for 125s. a quarter, were about to return! This, however, was
                    only a transient gleam. The increased prices led to a fresh extension of
                    tillage, improvements were recommenced with new energy, vast additional sums of
                    capital were expended upon the land; and these circumstances conspiring with
                    luxuriant harvests, and the <hi rend="italic">impossibility of exportation,</hi>
                    sunk prices to such a degree, that they fell, in October 1822, so low as 38s.
                    Id., the average price of that year being only 43s. 3d.!</p>
                <p>It is nugatory, therefore, to attempt to obviate the recurrence of periods of low
                    prices and agricultural distress by imposing restrictions on importation.
                    Freedom is the only effectual security against injurious vicissitudes.
                    Restrictions occasion the very evils they are said to remove or palliate. By
                    preventing importation in ordirtary years, and raising average prices above the
                    common level, they make exportation in favourable seasons impracticable, till
                    prices have sunk unnaturally lowi This is a defect inherent in .the restrictive
                    system, which nothing but the adoption of the Dutch plan of destroying a portion
                    of the produce of a plentiful harvest will ever be able to get rid ofl
                    Protection cannot be carried farther than monopoly; and monopoly cannot sustain
                    prices in abundant years in countries where the supply and consumption are
                    nearly balanced, nor prevent the consequent destruction of agricultural capital,
                    and the ruin of a large proportion of the agriculturists.</p>
                <p>We should mistake, however, if we supposed that the injury resulting from a heavy
                    fall of prices is confined to the agriculturists. It is idle, indeed, to suppose
                    that a system ruinous to the producers can be otherwise to the consumers. A glut
                    of the market, occasioned by luxuriant harvests, and the want of the power to
                    export, cannot be of long continuance; for, while it continues, it can hardly
                    fail, by distressing all classes of farmers, and ruining many, to check every
                    species of agricultural improvement, and to lessen the extent of land in
                    tillage. When, therefore, an unfavourable season recurs, the re-action is for
                    the most part appalling. The supply, being lessened not only by the badness of
                    the season, but also by a diminution of the quantity of land in crop, falls very
                    far below an average, and a severe scarcity’ generally ensues. Restrictions on
                    importation turn what ought to be a blessing into a curse. They make an abundant
                    crop productive of great injury to the farmer, and go far to render two or three
                    such crops in succession sure forerunners of scarcity, and perhaps of
                    famine!</p>
                <p>The principles now laid down are so obvious, and are so completely corroborated
                    by the history of the period since 1814, that it is unnecessary’ perhaps to
                    enlarge further on this part of our subject. But the following extract from a
                    speech of Mr Huskisson in 1825 exposes the principal defects of the existing
                    system, in so forcible, and at the same time so popular a manner, that we shall
                    take the liberty’ to lay it before the reader:</p>
                <p>“He had always understood that the great desideratum in this important question
                    was to provide for steady prices, and to guard against excessive fluctuations
                    from the vicissitudes of trade. How did the present law provide for these ends?
                    By limiting the markets from which we draw our supplies, by destroying the vent
                    which we should otherwise ĩiave for our produce whenever we are blessed with a
                    superabundant harvest, or by exposing us <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751835"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1835-0351"/>to an alternate fluctuation of high and low
                    prices. To say of a system which affected the price of labour and the comforts
                    of the labourer, and which cramped the resources, not only of the‘manufacturer,
                    but of the farmer himself—to say of such a system, that it <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 44</hi> worked well,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Alluding to the statement of a preceding speaker.</p></note>
                    ” was so completely refuted by the fact, that he was surprised that any man
                    should be bold enough to make it. What did they think of its working well in
                    1822, when corn was as low as 38s. a quarter? Within two years and a half the
                    price of corn had varied from 112s. to 38s. a quarter. <hi rend="italic">Such
                    fluctuations deprived the farmer of all security, and converted his business
                    into mere gambling.</hi> The man who engaged in a long lease could not at
                    present be aware of the conditions on which he was taking it, nor of the results
                    which it might produce upon his family arrangements. But this was not the only
                    inconvenience of the system. Look at the situation in which we were placed when
                    a bad harvest made, it necessary for us to go to the foreign markets. The price
                    of corn immediately advanced then. The foreign government, seeing our demand for
                    it, laid a tax upon the article; this further increased the price; and the
                    result was, that our exchanges were suddenly altered, so that we obtained the
                    required supply under the greatest possible disadvantages. He had heard it said,
                    and by gentlemen who had reflected on the subject, that if we had great
                    fluctuations, there was in them, notwithstanding, a ĵ¾î’r <hi rend="italic"
                    >average price .</hi> ’ He wondered what this phrase meant when applied to the
                    subsistence of the people. He should like to know how any gentleman accustomed
                    to eat a good dinner every day would like to be kept a week without food, and to
                    be supplied the next with twice as much as he wanted. Would he be satisfied with
                    being told that he had got a fair average quantity of provisions for each day in
                    the two weeks? He thought that the gentleman would not be satisfied; that he
                    would find such an average system was neither wholesome to his constitution nor
                    pleasant to his stomach.” <hi rend="italic">(Debates, 2èth April</hi> 1825.)</p>
                <p>The previous reasonings and statements have sufficiently established, 1<hi
                    rend="italic">st,</hi> That the laying of restrictions on the importation of
                    corn into a country that would generally or occasionally import, occasions an
                    increased cultivation of bad land, and by so doing raises prices and depresses
                    profits; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, That any obstacle to the free importation of
                    corn tends in so far to throw a country on her own resources, and lessens her
                    ability to profit by the provision made by Providence for equalizing the
                    deficiencies in the harvests of particular countries by a corresponding surplus
                    in others; 3cř, That the prevention of importation in ordinary years, by raising
                    the average price of corn to a comparatively high level, renders exportation in
                    a peculiarly abundant year impossible, till prices sink so as to be productive
                    of great agricultural distress; and, <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> That this
                    distress, by defeating the plans of the cultivators, discouraging improvements,
                    and lessening the quantity of land sown, tends materially to diminish the home
                    supply; and when the produce of a year, diminished by these causes, happens also
                    to be diminished by a bad season, the combined influence of the two is most
                    disastrous, and there is both an enormous increase of price, and the severest
                    pressure upon the industrious classes.</p>
                <p>Such being the inevitable consequences of restrictions on the corn trade, it is
                    surely high time that they were abolished, and a return made to a free system.
                    The increased importation that would take place were the ports always open as
                    soon as any considerable deficiency in the crops was apprehended, would prevent
                    any exorbitant rise of prices; while, on the other hand, when the crops were
                    universally luxuriant, a ready outlet would be found for the surplus in foreign
                    countries, without its occasioning any very heavy fall. ' To expect to combine
                    steadiness of prices with restrictions on importation, is to expect to reconcile
                    what is contradictory and absurd. The higher the limit at which the importation
                    of foreign corn into a country like England is fixed, the greater will be the
                    oscillation of prices. If we would secure for ourselves abundance, and avoid
                    fluctuation, we must renounce all attempts at exclusion, and be ready to deal in
                    corn, as we ought to be in every thing else, on fair and liberal principles.</p>
                <p>We are, however, willing to admit, that the restrictions imposed on the corn
                    trade during the last ten years have not been so productive of disastrous
                    consequences as we should have been led, looking as well to experience as to
                    theory, to anticipate. This modified action is, we believe, principally
                    ascribable to the very great increase of the imports from Ireland. Previously to
                    1806, when a perfectly free corn trade between Great Britain and Ireland was,
                    for the first time, established, the imports did not amount to 400,000 quarters
                    a year, whereas they now amount to 2,400,000; and any one who has ever been in
                    Ireland, or is aware of the wretched state of agriculture in it, and of the
                    amazing fertility of the soil, must be satisfied that a very slight improvement
                    would occasion an extraordinary increase in the imports from that country; and
                    notwithstanding the disturbances that have recently grown out of the collection
                    of tithes, which, it is to be Imped, may be speedily abolished, it is believed,
                    by those best qualified to form an opinion, that improvements are at present
                    going forward with considerable spirit. The settlement of the catholic question,
                    and the disfranchisement of the forty-shilling freeholders, by putting an end to
                    degrading distinctions, promoting tranquillity, and taking away one of the
                    principal inducements to the pernicious practice of splitting farms, have
                    already had great influence in accelerating the progress of industry, and will,
                    it maybe presumed, eventually lead to the most material improvements. Hence it
                    is by no means improbable that the growing imports from Ireland may at no
                    distant period reduce our prices to a level with those of the Continent, and
                    even render this an occasionally exporting country. These, however, are
                    contingent and uncertain results; and, supposing them to be ultimately realized,
                    the corn laws must in the mean time be productive of great hardship, and must,
                    in all time to come, aggravate to a frightful extent the misery inseparable from
                    bad harvests.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most imposing of the arguments urged against an unrestricted corn
                    trade proceeds on the assumption, that ultimately every agricultural nation will
                    manufacture for itself, and will cease purchasing from abroad. But surely it is
                    not meant to be insinuated that, in the progress of society, there will be no
                    interchange by different nations of manufactured commodities for raw produce. It
                    is evidently impossible such a state of things can ever exist until the cost of
                    raising raw produce in different countries becomes the same. America may, and it
                    is most probable <hi rend="italic">will,</hi> at some future period, manufacture
                    cotton goods for her own consumption; but while the cost of raising wheat is
                    less in that republic than in England, it will be sent thither in return for
                    some species of our produce. Nothing but the revival of the enactments of the
                    thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and prohibiting exportation al
                    together,-can possibly prevent corn finding its way to those places where its
                    value is greatest.</p>

                <p>Ιhat the profits of stock are diminished by the accumulation of capital, is
                    supposed by many. This opinion is, however, fundamentally erroneous. Commodities
                    being, in every case, bought by commodities, their multiplication cannot
                    occasion any fall in the value of each other. If, under any circumstances, a
                    pair of gloves exchange for a pair of stockings, and a quarter of wheat for a
                    pair of boots, they will continue, <hi rend="italic">provided they are all
                    increased in the same proportion to the demand,</hi> to preserve precisely the
                    same exchangeable value one with another, to whatever extent their quantities
                    may be augmented. Thus, supposing the capital engaged in the different branches
                    of trade and industry is adjusted in such a manner that, all things considered,
                    every branch yields nearly the same rate of profit, it is evident that any
                    additional capital invested in them all, according to the same ratio of
                    distribution, would not sink the price of any one article; each would sell for
                    precisely the same sum as before; and if wages remained stationary, the profits
                    of stock would neither be increased nor diminished. If too much of one
                    commodity, as of cotton, be manufactured, its relative value will fall, and the
                    profits of the stock employed in the cotton trade will be reduced; but such an
                    effect can only be temporary. Some other department must, at the same time, be
                    understocked, and, yielding larger profits, will attract the surplus capital
                    employed in the cotton manufacture. We have therefore no reason to be alarmed at
                    the effects of competition in any department. The manufacture of one commodity
                    opens a market for the exchange, that is, for the <hi rend="italic">sale</hi> of
                    some other commodity; and no commercial nation has any thing to fear from the
                    progress of its neighbours. What it has to fear is, that the average profits of
                    its capital should fall below the average rate of profit in the surrounding
                    nations. If this be the case, its future progress will be retarded, and it will
                    ultimately languish and decline. Neither the skill, industry, and perseverance
                    of artisans, nor the most improved machinery, can permanently bear up against a
                    constantly diminishing rate of profits. And let it be recollected that such <hi
                    rend="italic">comparative</hi> diminution of profit <hi rend="italic">is sure to
                    be produced by a fictitious enhancement of the price of corn.</hi></p>
                <p>The most popular defence of the corn laws, and the only additional one we shall
                    notice, rests on the ground that, as exclusive advantages are granted to
                    different manufactures, agriculture ought in justice to be placed in the same
                    favoured situation. But it was long ago demonstrated that it cannot be for the
                    interest of a state to manufacture at home what it may purchase cheaper abroad.
                    If, therefore, any of onr manufactures could not exist were a free trade
                    allowed, it would be for the general advantage that they were abandoned, and the
                    capital vested in them employed in some other way. The manufacturers of
                    Gloucestershire, in their resolutions against the corn bill of 1815, expressed,
                    in the strongest manner, their acquiescence in the doctrine of free trade, and
                    stated their perfect willingness to sacrifice whatever exclusive privileges they
                    enjoyed to the attainment of that desirable object. It is, indeed, beyond all
                    question that a free trade would be very much for the advantage of all those
                    manufactures of which any part is at present exported. The fall it would
                    occasion in the price of provisions would much more than compensate any
                    disadvantage that even the silk or linen manufacturers might experience from the
                    gradual withdrawal of their protection.</p>
                <p>“Because,” says Mr Ricardo, referring to this argument, “the cost of production,
                    and therefore the prices, of various manufactured commodities, are raised by one
                    error in legislation, the country has been called upon, on the plea of justice,
                    quietly to submit to fresh exactions. Because we all pay an additional price for
                    our linen, mus lin, and cottons, it is thought just that we should pay also an
                    additional price for our corn. Because, in the general distribution of the
                    labour of the world, we have prevented' the greatest amount of productions from
                    being obtained by that labour in manufactured commodities, we should further
                    punish ourselves by diminishing the productive powers of the general labour in
                    the supply of raw produce. It would be much wiser to acknowledge the errors
                    which a mistaken policy has induced us to adopt, and immediately to commence a
                    gradual recurrence to the sound principles of an universal free trade.” <hi

                <p>Notwithstanding the restraints on importation that have existed since 1815, the
                    fall of prices originating in the circumstances already described, has been such
                    as to occasion the cessation of tillage.on some of the poorer soils that were
                    broken up between 1809 and 1814. Had the restraints referred to not been
                    imposed, the fall of prices would have been decidedly greater; but the facts and
                    statements collected in a subsequent part of this article show that prices, even
                    under a perfectly free system, would not have fallen to any thing like the
                    extent that is commonly believed; and supposing that a duty of 7s. or 8s. a
                    quarter had been laid on importation, the fall during the last ten years would
                    have been quite inconsiderable, and any loss the agriculturists might have
                    sustained from it would have been far more than balanced by the greater
                    steadiness of prices. But though it were not so, is a system that is vitally
                    injurious to the well-being of the community to be kept up for the sake of a
                    particular class? The rents <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> landlords are not to
                    be maintained at an artificial elevation by means that depress profits, and
                    occasion an incessant alternation of glut and scarcity. It was not contended,
                    when the steam-engine, or when Sir R. Arkwright’s cotton-mill was introduced,
                    that they should not be employed, because the old clumsy machinery would be
                    superseded, and the capital vested in it lost. No such ridiculous notion was
                    ever entertained; but in what respect would it have been more absurd than to
                    persist, for the sake of a trifling advantage to the landlords, in raising
                    produce from a poor soil at an immense expense, when we may purchase plentiful
                    supplies at a cheaper rate elsew here? λVhy should not the best machinery be
                    employed in raising corn as well as in spinning cotton. If an expenditure of
                    L.1000 suffice to manufacture cottons or hardware at Glasgow or Birmingham, that
                    would exchange for 400 or 500 quarters of Polish or American corn; and if the
                    same sum, applied directly to the raising of corn, would not in this country
                    yield more than 250 or 300 quarters, what folly can be greater than to continue
                    so disadvantageous a production, and to refuse to buy corn from foreigners with
                    manufactured goods? Were private interests in such cases not to give way to the
                    general good, society would at once come to a stand, and mere routine take the
                    place of genius and invention. “Certainly,” says Mr Malthus, who is by far the
                    ablest defender of the restrictive system, “the legislature has nothing to do
                    with securing to any class of its subjects a particular rate of profits in their
                    different trades. <hi rend="italic">This is not the province of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">government</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and it is unfortunate that any language should have been used which may convey
                    such an impression, and make people believe that their rulers ought to listen to
                    the accounts of their gains and losses.”</p>
                <p>The unparalleled weight of our taxation, provided it be equally imposed, and the
                    comparatively high wages of labour in this country, furnish no apology for the
                    restrictive system. Equal taxes affect every part of the community, and do not
                    fall heavier on the agriculturists than on any other class. It is only in the
                    event of taxation <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751861"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-1861-0353"/>being unequal, of its pressing with greater
                    severity on those engaged in a particular business than on their neighbours,
                    that it affords an adequate ground for laying a duty on the importation of the
                    produce of the overtaxed class, though it can never be a reason why it should be
                    prohibited. We shall immediately inquire into the degree of influence that ought
                    to be attached to this principle in legislating as to the importation of corn
                    into Great Britain.</p>
                <p>It is generally alleged that the landlords are interested in the support of the
                    existing system of corn laws, and that they would be materially injured by its
                    repeal or modification. But though it is probable that many landlords are
                    themselves of this opinion, we look upon it as wholly destitute of foundation.
                    There is not at bottom any real opposition between the interests of the owners
                    of land, and those of the other classes. To borrow the just and forcible
                    expressions of Sir Josiah Child, “Land and trade are twins, and have always, and
                    ever will, wax and wane together. It cannot be ill with land but trade will feel
                    it, nor ill with trade but land will fall.” To those only who take a superficial
                    view of the question, their interests may seern to be opposed; but those who
                    look ever so little below the surface, and reflect on the motives which
                    stimulate the different classes to industry and enterprise, will be satisfied
                    that they are really identical. What is the genuine, and, indeed, only effectual
                    encouragement to agriculture? What is it that stimulates the occupiers to adopt
                    the best system of cultivation, or to make the ground yield the largest crops?
                    Can any one doubt that it is the demand of the other classes for their peculiar
                    products? Flourishing manufactures and commerce are indispensable to a
                    flourishing agriculture. To suppose that the latter should exist without the
                    former, is to suppose that men may be industrious without*a mo-five—that there
                    may be an effect without a cause. But we have seen that every artificial
                    enhancement of the price of corn lessens the rate of profit, and the power to
                    accumulate capital, at the same time that it occasions its transfer to other
                    countries. It must therefore be exceedingly injurious to the buyers of corn,
                    that is, to those classes whose prosperity is essential to the prosperity of the
                    agriculturists. Hence it is obvious that any advantage gained in the first
                    instance by the landlords from the restriction of importation, can only be
                    evanescent and illusory. It may be compared to the influence of doses of brandy
                    or opium on the human body, which, while they intoxicate and exhilarate,
                    enfeeble and shatter the constitution, occasioning premature old age and
                    death.</p>
                <p>At the time when the law of 1Ö15 was enacted, the derangement which must always
                    attend a sudden fall of prices was nearly over. Bents were generally reduced, a
                    considerable portion of inferior land was sown down with grass seeds, and wages
                    were on the decline. To have opened the ports under a reasonable duty would, in
                    these circumstances, have been attended with very little inconvenience.
                    Occurrences beyond the reach of control had paved the way for the introduction
                    of a liberal system of policy, and it must ever be lamented that the opportunity
                    was not embraced. But the restrictive system might at present be relinquished
                    with still less difficulty. It will be immediately seen that priées during the
                    last six or seven years have been such, that the opening of the ports, with a
                    duty sufficient to balance the excess of taxes laid on the agriculturists, would
                    give no sudden, nor even considerable shock to agriculture, while it would
                    afford the best attainable security for moderate prices, and against injurious
                    fluctuations in future.</p>
                <p>When this happy event shall have taken place, it will be no longer necessary to
                    force nature. The capital and enterprise of the country will be turned into
                    those departments of industry in which our physical situation, national
                    character, or political institutions, fit us to excel. The corn of Poland and
                    the raw cotton of Carolina will be exehanged for the wares of Birmingham and the
                    muslins of Glasgow. The genuine commercial spirit, that which permanently
                    secures the prosperity of nations, is altogether inconsistent with the dark,
                    selfish, and shallow poliey of monopoly. The nations of the earth are like
                    provinces of the same kingdom, a free and unfettered intercourse being
                    productive alike of general and of local advantage.</p>
                <p>Though advocates for the entire repeal of the restrictive system, and of all
                    regulations framed for the sake of protection, we are not of the number of those
                    who propose throwing the ports open without any duty. We should do this if we
                    were satisfied that the agriculturists were not more heavily taxed than the
                    other classes; for, however heavy, if taxes press equally on all businesses, no
                    one in particular has any right to be protected more than others; and to attempt
                    to protect them <hi rend="italic">all</hi> would be absurd. But though the
                    question be by no means free from difficulty, we incline to think, that owing to
                    the parochial and other burdens laid on the land, those occupying it are really
                    subject to heavier taxes than most other classes. It is very difficult, or
                    rather perhaps impossible, to estimate with any degree of precision what the <hi
                    rend="italic">excess of</hi> taxes laid on the agriculturists, beyond those laid
                    on manufacturers and merchants, may amount to; but we have elsewhere endeavoured
                    to show, that if we estimate it as making an addition of 6s. or 7s. to the
                    quarter of wheat, we shall certainly be up to, and most probably beyond the
                    mark. <hi rend="italic">(Wealth of Nations,</hi> M <hi rend="superscript">
                    ς</hi> Culloch’s edition, iv. p. 369.) However, we should in a ease of this sort
                    reekon it safer to err on the side of too much protection, than of too little,
                    and would not therefore object to a fixed duty of 6s. or 7s. a quarter being
                    laid on wheat, and a proportional duty on other species of grain. Under such a
                    system the ports would be always open. The duty would not be so great as to
                    interpose any very formidable obstacle to importation. Every one would know
                    beforehand the extent to which it would operate, at the same time that the just
                    rights and interests of the agriculturists, and of every other class, would be
                    maintained unimpaired. It will be seen from No. VIII. of the following accounts,
                    that the duty actually levied on the very large quantity of wheat admitted under
                    the present law, has amounted at an average to 6s. Id. a quarter. Nothing,
                    therefore, can be a greater error, than to suppose that, with the proposed
                    constant duty, the importations would be excessive. It may in fact be doubted
                    whether they would be materially increased. Additional facilities would be given
                    to the regular dealer; but the temptation to gambling adventurers would at the
                    same time be materially diminished.</p>
                <p>When a duty is laid on the importation of foreign corn, for the equitable purpose
                    of countervailing the peculiar duties laid on the corn raised at home, an <hi
                    rend="italic">equivalent draw ∙ back</hi> ought to be allowed on its
                    exportation. “In allowing this drawback, we are merely returning to the farmer a
                    tax which he has already paid, and which he must have, to place him in a fair
                    state of competition in the foreign market, not only with the foreign producer,
                    but with his own countrymen who are producing other commodities. It is
                    essentially different from a bounty on exportation, in the sense in which the
                    word bounty is usually understood; for by a bounty is generally meant a tax
                    levied on the people for the purpose of rendering corn unnaturally cheap to the
                    foreign consumer; whereas, what I propose, is to sell our corn at the price at
                    which we can really afford to produce it, and not to add to its price a tax
                    which shall <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751874" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1874-0354"
                    />induce the foreigner rather to purchase it from some other country, and
                    deprive us of a trade which, under a system of free competition, we might have
                    selected.” (Ricardo <hi rend="italic">on Protection to Agriculture,</hi> p.
                    53.)</p>
                <p>A duty accompanied with a drawback, as now stated, would not only be an equitable
                    arrangement, but it would be highly for the advantage of farmers, without being
                    injurious to any one else. The radical defect, as already shown, of the system
                    followed from 1815 down to the present moment, in so far at least as respects
                    agriculture, is, that it forces up prices in years when the harvest is
                    deficient, while it leaves the market to be glutted when it is abundant. But
                    while a constant duty of 7s. would secure to the home growers all the increase
                    of price which the regard due to the interests of others should allow them to
                    realise in a bad year, the drawback of 7s., by enabling them to export in an
                    unusually plentiful year, would prevent the markets from being overloaded, and
                    prices from falling to the ruinous extent that they now occasionally do. Such a
                    plan would render the business of a corn dealer, and of agriculture,
                    comparatively secure, and would therefore provide for the continued prosperity
                    of them both. We are astonished that the agriculturists have not taken this view
                    of the matter. If they be really entitled to a duty on foreign corn, on account
                    of their being heavier taxed than other classes of their fellow-citizens, they
                    must also be entitled to a corresponding drawback. And it admits of
                    demonstration that <hi rend="italic">their</hi> interests, as well as those of
                    the community, would be far better promoted by such a duty and drawback as w¢
                    have suggested, than they can ever be by any system of mere duties, how high
                    soever they may be carried.</p>
                <p>The principal objection to this plan is, that it would not be possible to levy
                    the duty when the home price became very high, and that consequently every now
                    and then it would be necessary to suspend it. But this objection does not seem
                    to be by any means so formidable as it has sometimes been represented. It may,
                    we think, be concluded on unassailable grounds, that were the ports constantly
                    open under a moderate fixed duty and an equivalent drawback, extreme
                    fluctuations of price would be very rare. Supposing it were enacted, that when
                    the home price rises above a certain high level, as 75s., the duty should cease,
                    we believe the clause would very seldom come into operation; and those who
                    object that it is not fair to the farmers to deprive them of the full advantage
                    to be derived from the highest prices, should recollect, that in matters of this
                    sort it is not always cititer possible, or, if possible, prudent, to carry the
                    soundest principles to an extreme length; and that, generally speaking, the
                    public interests will be better consulted by guarding against scarcity and
                    dearth, than by securing at all hazards a trifling though just advantage to a
                    particular class.</p>
                <p>III. PRESENT STATE OF THE BRITISH CORN TRADE.</p>
                <p>It has sometimes been attempted to estimate the quantity of corn raised in a
                    country, from calculations founded on the number of acres in tillage, and the
                    average produce per acre. But no accurate account can be obtain- ∣ed of the
                    extent of land under cultivation. It is perpetually changing from year to year;
                    and the amount of produce varies not only with the differences in the seasons,
                    but with every improvement of agriculture. This method, therefore, has been very
                    generally abandoned, and statisticians are now in the habit of estimating the
                    growth of corn by its consumption. But although this is certainly the preferable
                    mode, still the conclusions to wh;ch it leads are necessarily very loose. The
                    consumption varies considerably from one year to another, according as the
                    ability of the consumers to purchase happens so be greater or less. And
                    supposing this to remain the same, the average quantity and species of corn
                    consumed by each person can only be ascertained by approximation. Mr Charles
                    Smith gave a great deal of attention to this important investigation <hi
                    rend="italic">(Tracts on the Corn Trade)·,</hi> and his estimate of our
                    aggregate produce deserves particular attention, from its having been
                    corroborated, in its more important particulars, by subsequent researches both
                    at home and abroad, and from its forming the groundwork of almost all the
                    estimates that have been more recently framed. Having taken the population of
                    England and Wales in 1765 at 6,000,000, Mr Smith reckoned the consumers of each
                    kind of grain, the quantity consumed by each individual, and hence the whole
                    consumed by man, as follows :—</p>

                <p>This estimate, it will be observed, does not include either Scotland or Ireland,
                    and later inquiries have rendered it probable that Mr Smith underrated the
                    population of England and Wales by nearly a million. The allowance for seed is
                    also too small.</p>
                <p>Mr Chalmers, availing himself of the information respecting the numbers of the
                    people, furnished under the population act of 1800, estimated the total
                    consumption of the different kinds of grain in Great Britain at that epoch at
                    27,185,300 quarters, whereof wheat constituted 7,676,100 quarters. The crops of
                    1800 and of 1801 being unusually deficient, the importation in these years was
                    proportionally' great; but excluding these scarcities, the total average excess
                    of all sorts of grain imported from Ireland and foreign countries into Great
                    Britain over the exports, had previously amounted to about a million of
                    quarters, which, deducted from 27,185,300, leaves 26,185,300, to which, if we
                    add <hi rend="italic">one seventh</hi> as seed, we shall have 29,925,057
                    quarters as the average growth of Great Britain in 1800.</p>
                <p>The population of Ireland amounts at present to about 8,000,000. The greater
                    portion of its inhabitants are, it is true, supported by the potato, and seldom
                    or never taste bread, but we shall probably be within the mark if we estimate
                    the number of those fed by the various kinds of corn (principally oats) at three
                    millions, and the average quantity consumed by each individual at two quarters.
                    This would give 6,000,000 of quarters as the total consumption of Ireland.</p>
                <p>The population of Great Britain has increased, from <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194751887" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1887-0355"/>about eleven millions in
                    1800, to about sixteen and a half millions in 1831. Mr Western and Dr Colquhoun
                    concurred in estimating the average consumption of the whole empire in 1812 and
                    1814 at about thirty-five millions of quarters.</p>
                <p>The following is Dr Colquhoun’s estimate :—</p>

                <p>Dr Colquhoun has made no allowance for seed in this estimate; and there can be no
                    doubt that he has underrated the consumption of oats by at least half a quarter
                    in the consumption of each of the 4,500,000 individuals he supposes fed on them,
                    or by 2,250,000 quarters. Adding, therefore, to Dr Colquhoun’s estimate
                    5,500,000 quarters for seed, and 2,250,000 quarters for the deficiency of oats,
                    it will bring it to 42,750,000 quarters; and taking the increase of population
                    since 1813 into account, it does not appear that the annual average consumption
                    of the different, kinds of grain in the united kingdom can now be estimated at
                    less than <hi rend="italic">forty-four</hi> millions' of quarters exclusive of
                    seed, and at <hi rend="italic">fifty-two</hi> millions when it is included.
                    Assuming this estimate to be correct, and the proportion of wheat to amount to
                    <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> millions of quarters, the progressive consumption

                <p>The total imports of foreign corn in 1831 amounted to 3,541,809 quarters, being
                    the largest quantity ever brought to Great Britain in any one year. Now, as this
                    quantity does not amount to one fourteenth part of the entire produce, it would
                    seem as if the greatest importation could have but a very slight influence on
                    prices; but a very large proportion, we believe <hi rend="italic">fully a
                    half,</hi> of the entire corn produced in the empire is never brought to market,
                    but is partly consumed by the agriculturists, and partly used as seed, and in
                    the feeding of farm horses, &lt;⅛c. Hence, if we are nearly right in this
                    estimate, it follows that an importation of 3,500.,000 quarters is really
                    equivalent to about <hi rend="italic">one seventh</hi> part of the produce
                    brought to market in an average year, and must consequently have a very material
                    influence in alleviating the pressure of scarcity in a bad year, and in checking
                    the rise of prices.</p>

                    it ought further to be observed, that the freight from Warsaw to Dantzic, and

                    consumption of the inhabitants when no extraordinary circumstances occur to
                    excite or check cultivation.” <hi rend="italic">{Report,</hi> p. 49.)</p>
                <p>We, however, have been assured by gentlemen well acquainted with the country
                    traversed by the Vistula, thatwere the free importation of corn under a duty of
                    6s. or 7s. permitted in England, the exports from Dantzic might be fairly
                    estimated at from 350,0C0 to 450,000 quarters.</p>
                <p>Mr Grade of Dantzic furnished the committee of 1821 with the following table of
                    the average prices of corn at that city, free on board, in decennial periods,
                    from 1770 to 1820.</p>

                    of Com, free on board, per Quarter, in Sterling Money, at Dantzic.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1823, 1824, and 1825, prices, owing to the cessation of the demand from
                    England, were very much depressed; but during the last three years they have
                    recovered their former elevation. In September 1830 the best high mixed wheat
                    cost 44s. to 48s. free on board, and the ordinary from 34s. to 37s.; so that it
                    could not, allowing for freight and a duty of 6s. or 7s. a quarter, be sold in
                    this country in ordinary years for less than 56s. a quarter.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Corn Trade of the Elbe,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    &amp;ĵc.</hi> Next to Dantzic, Hamburg is perhaps the greatest corn market in
                    the north of Europe, being a depot for large quantities of Baltic corn, and for
                    the produce of the countries traversed by the Elbe. But the excess of w heat
                    exported from Hamburg over that which is imported, is less than might have been
                    expected, and amounted, at an average of the ten years ending with 1825, to only
                    48,263 quarters a year. The average price of wheat at Hamburg, during the six
                    years ending with 1822, was 47s. 4d. a quarter. Bohemian wheat is occasionally
                    forwarded by the river to Hamburg; but the charges attending its conveyance from
                    Prague amount, according to Mr Jacob, to full 17s. a quarter, and prevent its
                    being sent down, except when the price is comparatively high. We, however, are
                    inclined to think that Mr Jacob has underrated the supplies of wheat that might
                    be obtained from Hamburg were our ports constantly open under a reasonable duty.
                    In 1830 there were shipped from Hamburg for British ports 271,700 quarters of
                    wheat, 1900 of rye, 18,200 of barley, and 2800 of oats. Prices that year were
                    lower than at Dantzic, but the quality of the grain is inferior.</p>
                <p>Mr Jacob mentions, that the quantity of wheat exported from Denmark in the six
                    months which followed the abundant harvest of 1824 amounted to only 57,561
                    quarters; and he doubts whether there were 20,000 quarters instore in that
                    kingdom in October 1825. <hi rend="italic">{Report,</hi> p. 10.) Undoubtedly,
                    however, a greater quantity of grain would be obtained from Denmark were our
                    ports constantly open; and perhaps we might, did our prices average about 50s.
                    import in ordinary years from 250,000 to 300,000 quarters of wheat from Denmark
                    and the countries intersected by the Weser and the Elbe.</p>
                <p>Amsterdam is merely a dépôt, though a very important one, for foreign corn; a
                    small part only of its consumption is supplied from corn of the growth of
                    Holland, so that prices there are for the most part dependent upon the prices at
                    Dantzic and the other great northern markets.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">French Corn Trade.</hi> It appears from the accounts given
                    by the Marquis Garnier, in the last edition of liis <hi rend="superscript">
                    l</hi> translation of the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations,</hi> that the
                    price of the <hi rend="italic">hectolitre</hi> of wheat at the market of Paris
                    amounted, at an average of the nineteen years beginning with 1801 and ending
                    with 1819, to 20 fr. 53 cents, which is equal to 30 fr. 80 cents the septier;
                    or, taking the exchange at 25 fr. to 45s. 6d. the quarter. Count Chaptai, in his
                    valuable work <hi rend="italic">Sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ιIndustrie
                    Françoise,</hi> tom. i. p. 226, published in 1819, estimates the ordinary
                    average price of wheat throughout France at 18 fr. the hectolitre, or 42s. 10d.
                    the quarter. The various expenses attending the importation of a quarter of
                    French wheat into London may he taken at a medium at about 6s. a quarter.
                    France, however, has very little surplus produce to dispose of; so that it would
                    be impossible for us to import any considerable quantity of French corn without
                    occasioning a great advance of price; and in point of fact our imports from
                    France have been at all times quite inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>The mean of the different estimates framed by Vauban, Quesnay, Expilly,
                    Lavoisier, and Arthur Young, gives 61,519,672 septiers, or 32,810,000 quarters,
                    as the total average growth of the different kinds of grain in France. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Peuchet</hi><hi rend="italic">Statistique Elémentaire,</hi> p.
                    290.) We, however, took occasion in a former article on this subject to observe,
                    that there could not he a doubt that this estimate was a great deal too low; and
                    the more careful investigations of late French statisticians fully confirm this
                    remark. It is said that the mean annual produce of the harvests of France, at an
                    average of the four years ending with 1S28, amounted to 60,533,000 hectolitres
                    of wheat, and 114,738,000 ditto of other sorts of grain, making in all
                    175,271,000 hectolitres, or 62,221,205 Winchester quarters. Of this quantity it
                    is supposed that sixteen per cent, is consumed as seed, nineteen per cent, in
                    feeding different species of animals, and two per cent, in distilleries and
                    breweries. <hi rend="italic">(Bulletin des Sciences</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Géographiques,</hi> tom. XXV. p. 34.) This estimate is believed to be pretty
                    nearly accurate; perhaps, however, it is still rather under the mark.</p>
                <p>The foreign corn trade of France has been regulated during the last few years by
                    a law which forbids exportation except when the home prices are below certain
                    limits, and restrains and absolutely forbids importation when they are above
                    certain other limits. The prices regulating importation and exportation differ
                    in the three different districts into whiclκthe kingdom is divided; and it has
                    not unfrequently happened that corn warehoused at a particular port where it was
                    either not admissible at all, or not admissible except under payment of a high
                    duty, has been carried to another port in another district, and admitted duty
                    free. But by an ordinance dated the 2d June 1831, some of the regulations in
                    this law were suspended; and it is believed that a new law will speedily be
                    enacted, admitting importation at all times under a graduated duty.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">S1)anish Corn Trade.</hi> The exportation of corn from Spain
                    was formerly prohibited under the severest penalties. But in 1820 grain and
                    flour were both allowed to be freely exported, and in 1823 this privilege was
                    extended to all productions <hi rend="italic">{frutos')</hi> the growth of the
                    soil. There is now in fact no obstacle whatever, except the expense <pb

                    the conveyance of corn to the sea-ports, and thence to the foreigner. Owing,
                    however, to the corngrowing provinces being principally situated in the
                    interior, and to the extreme badness of the roads, which renders carriage to the
                    coast both expensive and difficult, the exports are comparatively trifling; this
                    difficulty of carriage frequently gives rise to very great differences of prices
                    at places in all parts of the country only a few leagues distant.</p>
                <p> 5. <hi rend="italic">Corn Trade of Odessa.</hi> Odessa, on the Black Sea, is the
                    only port in southern Europe from which any considerable quantity of grain is
                    exported. We believe, indeed, that the fertility of the soil in its vicinity has
                    been much exaggerated; but the wheat shipped at Odessa is principally “brought
                    from Volhynia and the Polish provinces to the south of Cracow, the supplies from
                    which are susceptible of an indefinite increase. Owing to the cataracts in the
                    Dnieper, and the Dniester having a great number of shallows, most part of the
                    corn brought to Odessa comes by land carriage. The expense of this mode of
                    conveyance is not, however, nearly so great as might be supposed. The carts with
                    corn are often in parties of 150; the oxen are pastured during the night, and
                    they take advantage of the period when the peasantry are not occupied with the
                    harvest, so that the charge on account of conveyance is comparatively
                    trifling.</p>
                <p>Both soft and hard wheat are exported from Odessa; but the former, which is by
                    far the most abundant, is only brought to England. Supposing British wheat to
                    sell at about 60s. Odessa wheat in good order would not be worth more than 52s.
                    in the London market; but it is a curious fact, that in the Mediterranean the
                    estimation in which they are held is quite the reverse; at Malta, Marseilles,
                    Leghorn, &amp;c. Odessa wheat fetches a decidedly higher price than British
                    wheat. -</p>
                <p>The hard wheat brought from the Black Sea comes principally from Taganrog. It is
                    a very fine species of grain; it is full ten per cent, heavier than British
                    wheat, and has less than half the bran. It is used in Italy for making macaroni
                    and vermicelli, and things of that sort. Very little of it has found its way to
                    England.</p>
                <p>The voyage from Odessa to Britain is of uncertain duration, but generally very
                    long. It is essential to the importation of wheat in a good condition, that it
                    should be made during the winter months. When the voyage is made in summer,
                    unless the wheat be very superior, and be shipped in exceedingly good order, it
                    is almost sure to heat, and has sometimes indeed been injured to suelva degree
                    as to require to be dug from the hold with pickaxes. Unless, therefore, some
                    means can be devised for lessening the risk of damage during the voyage, there
                    is little reason to think that Odessa wheat will ever be largely imported into
                    Britain. (See the evidence of J. H. Lander, Esq. and J. Schneider, Esq. before
                    the Lords’ committee of 1827, on the price of foreign corn.)</p>
                <p>The entire expense of importing a quarter of wheat from Odessa to London may be
                    estimated at from 16s. to 19s. In December 1830 prices at Odessa varied from
                    22s. 4d. to 34s. 6d. a quarter.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">American Corn Trade.</hi> The prices of wheat at New York
                    and Philadelphia may be taken at an average at from 37s. to 40s. a quarter; and
                    as the cost of importing a quarter of wheat from the United States to England
                    amounts to from 8s. to 12s. it is seen that no considerable supply could be
                    obtained from that quarter were our prices under 50s. or 52s. It ought also to
                    be remarked, that prices in America are usually higher than in the Baltic; so
                    that but little can be brought from the former except when the demand is
                    sufficient previously to take off the cheaper wheats of the northern ports. The
                    usual price of wheat in Canada, when there is a demand for the English market,
                    is about 40s. a quarter; but taking it as low as 35s. if we add to this 10s. a
                    quarter as the expenses of carriage, it will make its cost price in Liverpool
                    45s.; and being spring wheat, it is not so valuable, by about 6s. a quarter, as
                    English wheat.</p>
                <p>We may therefore conclude that, in the event of all restrictions on the
                    importation of foreign corn being abolished, the price for which it could be
                    obtained would not, in ordinary years, be less than 48s. a quarter, and would
                    most probably range from 50s. to 55s.</p>
                <p>Now it appears, from the official accounts laid before the House of Commons, that
                    the average price of wheat in England and Wales, for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ten</hi> years ending with 1829, amounted to 58s. 4^d. a quarter; and lest we
                    should be accused of overstating the ordinary importation price of foreign
                    wheat, we shall estimate it at the low rate of only 46s.; so that, provided it
                    were burdened, as we have already shown it ought to be, with a fixed duty of 7s.
                    a quarter, it might still be sold at an average price of 53s.; and, even on this
                    most reasonable hypothesis, there is no ground whatever to suppose, in the event
                    of the ports being thrown open, that prices would be reduced more than 5s. or
                    6s. a quarter below the average of the last <hi rend="italic">ten</hi>
                    years.</p>
                <p>We feel pretty confident that the statements now made cannot be controverted; and
                    they show conclusively how erroneous it is to suppose that the repeal of the
                    existing corn laws, and the opening of the ports for importation, under a duty
                    of 7s. would throw a large proportion of our cultivated lands into pasture, and
                    cause a ruinous decline in the price of corn. The average price of wheat in
                    England and Wales in 1802, 1803, and 1804, years of decided agricultural
                    improvement, was exactly 6Is. a quarter, being only 8s. or 9s. above its
                    probable future average price under a free system; while the greater cheapness
                    of labour, and the various improvements that have been made in agriculture since
                    1804, would enable corn to be raised from the same soils at a much less expense
                    in this than in that year. It cannot be justly said that even 1823 was by any
                    means an unfavourable year for the farmer; and yet the average price was then
                    only 51s. 9d., being at least Is. a quarter less.than its future probable
                    average price under the system we have ventured to propose. The landlords and
                    farmers may therefore take courage. Their prosperity does not depend on
                    restrictive regulations, but is the result of the fertility of the soil which
                    belongs to them, of the absence of all oppressive feudal privileges, and of the
                    number and wealth of the consumers of their produce. The unbounded freedom of
                    the corn trade would not render it necessary to abandon any but the most
                    worthless soils, which ought never to have been broken up, and would
                    consequently have but a very slight effect on rent; while it would be in other
                    respects supremely advantageous to the landlords, whose interests are closely
                    identified with those of the other classes.</p>
