                <p><label type="entry">CONGRUITY</label>, a suitableness or relation of agreement
                    between things.</p>
                <p>The terms <hi rend="italic">congruity</hi><hi rend="italic">Άηά</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">propriety</hi> are not applicable to any single object; they imply
                    a plurality, and obviously signify a particular relation between different
                    objects. Thus we are accustomed to say, that a decent garb is suitable or proper
                    for a judge, modest behaviour for a young woman, and a lofty style for an epic
                    poem; and, on the other hand, that it is unsuitable or incongruous to see a
                    little woman sunk in an overgrown farthingale, a coat richly embroidered
                    covering coarse and dirty linen, a mean subject in a pompous style, an elevated
                    subject in mean language, a first minister darning his wife’s stocking, or a
                    reverend prelate in lawn sleeves dancing a hornpipe.</p>
                <p>The perception w e have of this relation, which seems peculiar to man, cannot
                    proceed from any other cause than a <hi rend="italic">sense</hi> of congruity or
                    propriety; for, supposing us destitute of this sense, the terms would be to us
                    unintelligible.</p>
                <p>It is a matter of experience that congruity or propriety, wherever perceived, is
                    agreeable; and that incongruity or impropriety, wherever perceived, is
                    disagreeable. The only difficulty is to ascertain what are the particular
                    objects which in conjunction suggest these relations; for there are many objects
                    that do not. The sea, for example, viewed in conjunction with a picture, or a
                    man viewed in conjunction with a mountain, suggest not either congruity or
                    incongruity. It seems natural to infer, what indeed will be found true by
                    induction, that we never perceive congruity or incongruity except among things
                    which are connected together by some relation; such as a man and his actions, a
                    principal and his accessories, a subject and its ornaments. We are indeed so
                    framed by nature, that things thus connected require a certain suitableness or
                    correspondence, termed <hi rend="italic">congmity</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >propriety</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence we feel displeasure when we
                    discover the opposite relation of <hi rend="italic">incongruity</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">impropriety.</hi></p>
                <p>If things connected be the subject of congruity, it is reasonable to expect that
                    a degree of congruity proportioned to the degree of the connexion should be
                    required; and, upon examination, we find this to be fact. Where the relation is
                    intimate, as between a cause and its effect, a whole and its parts, we require
                    the strictest congruity; but where the relation is slight or accidental, as
                    among things jumbled together in the same place, we require little or no
                    congruity. The strictest propriety is required in behaviour and manner of
                    living, because a man is connected with these by the relation of cause and
                    effect. The relation between an edifice and the ground it stands upon is of the
                    most intimate kind; and, therefore, the situation of a great house ought to be
                    lofty; its relation to neighbouring hills, rivers, plains, being that of
                    propinquity only, demands but a small share of congruity. Among members of the
                    same club the congruity ought to be considerable, as well as among things placed
                    for show in the same niche; among passengers in a stage-coach we require very
                    little congruity, and less still at a public spectacle.</p>
                <p>Congruity is so nearly allied to beauty, as commonly to be held a species of it;
                    and yet they differ so essentially as never to coincide. Beauty, like colour, is
                    placed upon a single subject; congruity upon a plurality; and a thing beautiful
                    in itself may, with relation to other things, produce the strongest sense of
                    incongruity.</p>
                <p>Congruity and propriety are commonly reckoned synonymous terms, but they are
                    distinguishable, and the precise meaning of each must be ascertained. Congruity
                    is the genus of which propriety is a species; for we call nothing proper, but
                    that congruity or suitableness which ought to subsist between sensible beings
                    and their thoughts, words, and actions.</p>
