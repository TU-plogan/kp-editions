                    crosswise, whether they cross at right angles at the top, thus j-, or in the
                    middle of their length, thus × . The cross to which our Saviour was fastened,
                    and on which he died, was of the former kind, at least it is thus represented on
                    old monuments and coins; and St Jerome compares it to a bird flying, and a man
                    swimming, or praying with his arms extended. The punishment of the cross was
                    common amongst the Syrians, Egyptians, Persians, Africans, Greeks, Romans, and
                    Jews.</p><p>The death of the cross was the most dreadful of all punishments, by reason of the
                    ignominy and suffering which attended it; and hence it was inflicted as the last
                    mark of detestation upon the vilest of people. It was the punishment of robbers
                    and murderers, provided that they were slaves too; but otherwise, if they were
                    free, and had the privileges of the city of Rome, this was then thought too
                    infamous a punishment for such a one, let his crimes be what they might.</p><p>The Mosaic law ordained that the persons executed should not be left upon the
                    tree after sunset, because he who was hanged in this manner was deemed accursed
                    of God. The Jews believe, that the souls of those who remain upon the gibbet,
                    without burial, enjoy no peace, and receive no benefit from the prayers of other
                    people; but that they wander up and down until their bodies are interred. This
                    agrees with the notions which the Greeks and Romans entertained, as may be seen
                    in Homer and in Virgil <hi rend="italic">(Iliad,</hi> iv. and <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> vi.)</p><p>The form of a cross being such as has been already described, the body of the
                    criminal was fastened to the upright piece by nailing the feet to it, and on the
                    transverse piece generally by nailing the hands on each side. <hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> But, as these parts of the body, being the
                    instruments of action and motion, are provided by nature with a much greater
                    quantity of nerves than others have occasion for, and as all sensation depends
                    upon the spirit contained in these nerves, it follows, as Stanhope observes,
                    that where-cver they abound the sense of pain must needs be in proportion more
                    quick and agonising.</p><p>The Jews confess that they indeed crucified people in their nation, but deny that
                    they inflicted this punishment upon any one alive. They first put them to death,
                    and then fastened them to the cross either by the hands or by the neck. But
                    there are indisputable proofs of their having frequently crucified men alive.
                    The worshippers of Baal-peor and the king of Ai were hung up alive; as were also
                    the descendants of Saul, who were put into the hands of the Gibeonites.</p><p>Before crucifixion, the criminal was generally scourged with cords; and sometimes
                    little bones, or pieces of bones, were tied to these scourges, that the
                    condemned person might suffer more severely. It was also a custom that the
                    person condemned to be crucified should bear his own cross to the place of
                    execution. After this manner we find that Christ was compelled to bear his own
                    cross; and, as he sunk under the burden, Simon the Cyrenian was constrained to
                    bear it after him and with him. But as it is generally supposed that our Lord
                    bore the whole cross, that is, both the long and the transverse part, this seems
                    to be impossible; and therefore Lipsius <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Supplicio Crucis)</hi> has set the matter in its true light when
                    he tells us that Jesus only carried the transverse beam; because the long beam,
                    or the body of the cross, was either fixed in the ground before, or made ready
                    to be set up as soon as the prisoner arrived; and from hence he observes that
                    painters are very much mistaken in their description of our Saviour carrying the
                    whole cross.</p><p>There were several ways of crucifying; sometimes the criminal was fastened with
                    cords to a tree, sometimes he was crucified with his head downwards. This last
                    way St Peter chose out of respect to his master Jesus Christ, not thinking
                    himself worthy to be crucified like him; though the common way of crucifying was
                    by fastening the criminal with nails, one through each hand, and one through
                    both feet, or one through each of them; for this was not always performed in the
                    same manner, the ancients sometimes representing Jesus Christ crucified with
                    four nails, and sometimes with three. The criminal was fixed to the cross quite
                    naked; and in all probability the Saviour of the world did not experience any
                    greater tenderness than others upon whom the punishment was inflicted. The
                    soldiers divided his clothes amongst them, and cast lots for his tunic, which is
                    an under garment worn over the flesh like a shirt.</p><p>Sometimes they who were fastened upon the cross lived a good while in that
                    condition. St Andrew is believed to have continued three days alive upon it.
                    Eusebius speaks of certain martyrs in Egypt who were kept upon the cross till
                    they were starved to death. Pilate was amazed at Jesus Christ dying so soon;
                    because naturally he must have lived long, if it had not been in his power to
                    have laid down his life and taken it up again. The thighs of the two thieves who
                    were crucified together with our Saviour were broken, in order to hasten their
                    death, that their bodies might not remain suspended upon the cross on the
                    Sabbath day, and to comply with the law of Moses, which forbade the bodies to be
                    left there after sunset. But among other nations they were suffered to remain
                    upon the cross for a long time; sometimes they were devoured alive by birds and
                    beasts of prey; and guards <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753525" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3525-0481"/>were appointed to observe that none of their
                    friends or relations should take them down and bury them. The story of the
                    Ephesian matron and the soldier who was set to guard the cross, is very well
                    known. The Roman soldiers who had crucified Jesus Christ and the two thieves
                    continued near the crosses till the bodies were taken down and buried.</p><p>In former times, crosses were usually erected on the tops of houses, by which
                    tenants pretended to claim the privileges of the Templars hospitallers, to
                    defend themselves against their rightful lords. But this was condemned by the
                    statute Will. II. c. 37. It was usual also, in those days, to set up crosses in

                    of Christ deep in the ground on Mount Calvary, where she erected a church for
                    the preservation of part of it; and the rest being brought to Rome, was

                    The place is said to have been pointed out to her by St Quiriacus, then a Jew,

                    an ancient feast held on the 14th of September, in memory of the restoration to
                    Mount Calvary in 642, of the true cross, which had been carried off fourteen
                    years before by Cosroes, king of Persia, upon his taking Jerusalem from the
                    Emperor Phocas, and afterwards recovered by Heraclitus.</p><p>The adoration of the cross appears to have been practised in the ancient church;
                    for the heathens, particularly Julian, reproach the primitive Christians with
                    this species of idolatry, and we do not find that their apologists disclaim the
                    charge. Mornay indeed asserted that this had been done by St Cyril, but could
                    not support his allegation at the conference of Fontainbleau. St Helena is said
                    to have reduced the adoration of the cross to its just principle, since she
                    worshipped in the wood, not the wood itself, which would have been direct
                    idolatry and heathenism, <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> but him who had been
                    nailed to this wood. With such modifications some Protestants have been induced
                    to admit the adoration of the cross. John Huss allowed the phrase, provided it
                    were expressly added, that the adoration was relative solely to the person of
                    Christ. But, however Roman I Catholics may seem to triumph in virtue of such
                    distinctions and mitigations, it is well known that these have no great place in
                    their own practice. Imbert, the good prior of Gascony, was severely prosecuted
                    in 1683 for telling the people, that, in the ceremony of adoring the cross
                    practised in that church on Good Friday, they were not to adore the wood, but
                    Christ who was crucified on it. The curate of the parish, however, told them the
                    contrary, affirming that it was the wood, and the wood only, they were to
                    worship. Imbert replied, it was Christ, not the wood; and for this he was cited
                    before the Archbishop of Bordeaux, suspended from his functions, and threatened
                    with chains and perpetual imprisonment. It little availed him to cite the Bishop
                    of Meaux’s distinction; it was answered that the church allowed it not.</p><p><hi rend="italic">CROss-Bearer</hi><hi rend="italic">(port-croix,</hi><hi rend="italic">cruci</hi><hi rend="italic">ger),</hi> in the Roman Catholic
                    church, the chaplain of an archbishop or a primate, who bears a cross before him
                    on solemn occasions.</p><p>The pope has the cross borne before him everywhere; a patriarch anywhere out of
                    Rome; and primates, metropolitans, and those who have aright to the pallium,
                    throughout their respective jurisdictions. Gregory XI. forbade all patriarchs
                    and prelates to have it borne in presence of cardinals. A prelate bears a single
                    cross, a patriarch a double cross, and the pope a triple one on his arms.</p><p><hi rend="italic">CROSS-Bearers</hi> also denote certain officers in the

                    Catholic faith, though with the loss of fortune and life. Their business is to
                    provide the inquisitors with necessaries; and they were formerly of great use;
                    but in process of time their constitutions were changed, and they were called to
                    undergo the penance of St Dominic.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Pectoral</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Cross,</hi> is a

                    of the true cross, from the ashes of part of the palace, which had been
                    consumed. It seems the fire had burnt the case in which it was inclosed, and
                    melted the crystal, yet the wood remained untouched.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Maids of the</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Cross,</hi> a

                    poverty, chastity, and obedience, while others retained their liberty. They were
                    under the direction of a superior.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cross,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Heraldry,</hi> defined by
                    Guillim an ordinary composed of fourfold lines, of which two are perpendicular,
                    and the other two transverse; for so we must conceive of them, though they be
                    not drawn throughout, but meet by couples, in four right angles, near the fesse
                    point of the escutcheon.</p><p>This bearing was first bestowed on such as had performed, or at least undertaken,
                    some service for Christ and the Christian profession; and it is held by many to
                    be the most honourable charge in all heraldry. What brought it into such
                    frequent use, was the expeditions into the Holy Land; for the pilgrims, after
                    their return, took the cross as their cognizance, and the ensign of that war was
                    the cross on the shoulder. In those expeditions the Scots carried a St Andrew’s
                    cross; the French, a cross argent; the English, a cross or; the Germans, a cross
                    sable; the Italians, a cross azure; the Spaniards, a cross gules.</p><p><hi rend="italic">St Georges</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Cross,</hi> or the

                    many other bearings, and particularly in lions, and in parts of them, of which
                    Columbière gives us no less than ninety-six varieties. Leigh mentions forty-six
                    different crosses; Sylvanus Morgan, twenty-six; Upton, thirty; Johannes de Bado
                    Aureo, twelve; and others, whom it is needless to mention, other numbers.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
