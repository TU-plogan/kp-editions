                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                    rend="italic">Optics,</hi> a luminous circle, surrounding the sun, the moon, the
                    planets, or fixed stars. Sometimes these circles are white, and sometimes
                    coloured like the rainbow; sometimes one only is visible, and sometimes several
                    concentric coronas make their appearance at the same time. Those which have been
                    seen about Sirius and Jupiter were never more than three, four, or five degrees
                    in diameter; those which surround the moon are also sometimes no more than three
                    or five degrees; but these, as well as those which surround the sun, are of very
                    different magnitudes, viz. of 12° O', 22° 35', 30° O', 38° O', 41° 2', 45° O',
                    46° 24', 47° O', and 90°, or even larger than this. Their diameters also
                    sometimes vary during the time of observation, and the breadths both of the
                    coloured and white circles are very different, viz. of two, four, or seven
                    degrees.</p>
                <p>The colours of these coronas are more diluted than those of the rainbow; and they
                    are in a different order, according to their size. In those which Newton
                    observed in 1692, they were in the following order, reckoned from the inside: In
                    the innermost were blue, white, and red; in the middle were purple, blue, green,
                    yellow, and pale red; in the outermost, pale blue and pale red. Mr Huygens
                    observed red next the sun, and a pale blue outwards. Sometimes they are red on
                    the inside and white on the outside. Mr Weidler observed one that was yellow on
                    the inside and white on the outside. In France one was observed in 1683, the
                    middle of which was white; after which followed a border of red; next to it was
                    blue, then green, and the outermost circle was a bright red. In 1728 one was
                    seen of a pale red outwardly, then followed yellow, and then green, terminated
                    by a white.</p>
                <p>These coronas are very frequent. In Holland, Μ. Muschenbroeck says, fifty may be
                    seen in the day-time, almost every year; but they are difficult to be observed,
                    unless the eye be so situated that not the body of the sun, but only the
                    neighbouring parts of the heavens, can be seen. Mr Middleton says that this
                    phenomenon is very frequent in North America; that there is generally one or two
                    about the sun every week, and as many about the moon every month. Halos round
                    the sun are very frequent in Russia. Μ. Aepinus says, that from the 23d of April
                    1758 to the 20th of September, he himself had observed no less than twenty-six,
                    and that he has sometimes seen twice as many in the same space of time.</p>
                <p>Coronas may be produced by placing a lighted candle in the midst of steam in cold
                    weather; also, if glass windows be breathed upon, and the flame of a candle be
                    placed some feet from it, while the spectator is also at the distance of some
                    feet from another part of a window, the flame will be surrounded with a coloured
                    halo; and if a candle be placed behind a glass receiver, when air is admitted
                    into the vacuum within it, at a certain degree of density, the vapour with which
                    it is loaded will form a coloured halo round the flame. This was observed by
                    Otto Guericke. In December 1756, Μ. Muschenbroeck observed, that when the glass
                    windows of his room were covered with a thin plate of ice on the inside, the
                    moon appearing through it was surrounded with a large and variously coloured
                    halo; and, opening the window, he found that it arose entirely from that thin
                    plate of ice, for none was seen except through it.</p>
                <p>Similar in some respects to the halo, was the remarkable appearance which Μ.
                    Bouguer describes, as observed by himself and his companions on the top of Mount
                    Pichincha, in the Cordilleras. When the sun was just rising behind them, so as
                    to appear white, each of them saw his own shadow projected upon it, and no
                    other. The distance was such, that all the parts of the shadow were easily
                    distinguishable, as the arms, the legs, and the head; but what surprised them
                    most was, that the head was adorned with a kind of glory, consisting of three or
                    four small concentric crowns, of a very lively colour, each exhibiting all the
                    varieties of the primary rainbow, and having the circle of red upon the outside.
                    The intervals between these circles continued equal, though the diameters of all
                    of them were constantly changing. The last was very faint; and at a considerable
                    distance was another great white circle which surrounded the whole. As nearly as
                    Μ. Bouguer could compute, the diameter of the first of these circles was about
                    5⅛ degrees, that of the second 11, that of the third 17, and so on; but the
                    diameter of the white circle was about 76 degrees. This phenomenon never
                    appeared but in a cloud consisting of frozen particles, and never in drops of
                    rain like the rainbow. When the sun was not in the horizon, only part of the
                    white circle was visible, as Μ. Bouguer frequently observed afterwards.</p>
                <p>Similar also to this curious appearance was one observed by a gentleman in
                    Scotland. This individual observed a rainbow round his shadow in the mist, when
                    he stood upon an eminence above it. In this situation the whole country seemed,
                    as it were, buried under a vast deluge, and nothing but the tops of distant
                    hills appeared here and there rising above the flood; so that one could not
                    think of diving down into it without a kind of horror. In those upper regions
                    the air, he says, is at that time very pure and agreeable to breathe in. At
                    another time he observed a double range of colours round his shadow in these
                    circumstances. The colours of the outermost range were broad and very distinct,
                    and everywhere about two feet distant from the shadow. Then there was a darkish
                    interval, and after that another narrower range of colours, closely surrounding
                    the shadow, which was very much contracted. This person was of opinion that
                    these ranges of colours arc caused by the inflection of the rays of light, the
                    same that occasioned the ring of light which surrounds the shadows of all
                    bodies, observed by Μ. Maraldi and others. But the prodigious variety with which
                    these appearances are exhibited seems to show that many of them do not result
                    from the general laws of reflection, refraction, or inflection, belonging to
                    transparent substances of a large mass; but depend upon the alternate reflection
                    and transmission of the different kinds of rays, peculiar to substances reduced
                    to the form <pb break="no" facs="nls:194752108" xml:id="kp-eb0707-2108-0372"/>of
                    thin plates, or consisting of separate and very minute parts. But where the
                    dimensions of the coronas are pretty constant, as in the usual and larger halo,
                    which is about half the diameter of the rainbow, they may perhaps be explained
                    on the general principles of refraction only.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton does not appear to have given any particular attention to the
                    subject of halos, but he has hinted at his sentiments concerning them
                    occasionally; by which we perceive that he considered the larger and less
                    variable appearances of this kind as produced according to the common laws of
                    refraction, but that the less and more variable appearances depend upon the same
                    cause with the colours of thin plates.</p>
                <p>He concludes his explication of the rainbow with the following observations on
                    halos and parhelia: “The light which comes through drops of rain by two
                    refractions, without any reflection, ought to appear the strongest at the
                    distance of about twenty degrees from the sun, and to decay gradually both ways
                    as the distance from him increases; and the same is to be understood of light
                    transmitted through spherical hailstones; and if the hail be a little flatted,
                    as it often is, the transmitted light may be so strong, at a little less
                    distance than that of twenty-six degrees, as to form a halo about the sun or
                    moon; which halo, as often as the hailstones are duly figured, may be coloured,
                    and then it must be red within by the least refrangible rays, and blue without
                    by the most refrangible ones; especially if the hailstones have opaque globules
                    of snow in their centres to intercept the light within the halo, as Mr Huygens
                    has observed, and make the inside of it more distinctly defined than it would
                    otherwise be; for such hailstones, though spherical, by terminating the light by
                    the snow, may make a halo red within and colourless without, and darker within
                    the red than, without, as halos used to be. For of those rays which pass close
                    by the snow, the red-making ones will be the least refracted, and so come to the
                    eye in the straightest lines.”</p>
                <p>Some further thoughts of Sir Isaac Newton on the subject of halos we find
                    subjoined to the account of his experiments on the colours of thick plates of
                    glass, which he conceived to be similar to those which are exhibited by thin
                    ones. “As light reflected by a lens quicksilvered on the back side makes the
                    rings of the colours above described, so,” he says, “it ought to make the like
                    rings in passing through a drop of water. At the first reflection of the rays
                    within the drop, some colours ought to be transmitted, as in the case of a lens,
                    and others to be reflected back to the eye. For instance, if the diameter of a
                    small drop or globule of water be about the 500th part of an inch, so that a
                    red-making ray, in passing through the middle of this globule, has 250 fits of
                    easy transmission within the globule, and all the red-making rays which are at a
                    certain distance from this middle ray round about it have 249 fits within the
                    globule, and all the like rays at a certain further distance round about it have
                    248 fits, and all those at a certain farther distance 247 fits, and so on; these
                    concentric circles of rays, after their transmission, falling on a white paper,
                    will make concentric rings of red upon the paper, supposing the light which
                    passes through one single globule strong enough to be sensible; and in like
                    manner the rays of other colours will make rings of other colours. Suppose now
                    that in a fair day the sun should shine through a thin cloud of such globules of
                    water or hail, and that the globules are all of the same size, the sun seen
                    through this cloud ought to appear surrounded with the like concentric rings of
                    colours, and the diameter of the first ring of red should be 7, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> t</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    o</hi>, that of the second 10∣- <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, that of the
                    third 12° 33', and according as the globules of water are bigger or less, the
                    ring should be less or bigger.”</p>
                <p>This curious theory, our author informs us, was confirmed by an observation which
                    he made in the year 1692. He saw by reflection, in a vessel of stagnating water,
                    three halos, crowns, or rings of colours about the sun, like three little
                    rainbows concentric to his body. The colours of the first, or innermost crown,
                    were blue next the sun, red without, and white in the middle, between the blue
                    and red. Those of the second crown were purple and blue within, and pale red
                    without, and green in the middle; and those of the third were pale blue within,
                    and pale red without. These crowns inclosed one another immediately, so that
                    their colours proceeded in this continual order from the sun outward; blue,
                    white, red; purple, blue, green, pale yellow, and red; pale blue, pale red. The
                    diameter of the second crown, measured from the middle of the yellow and red on
                    one side of the sun, to the middle of the same colour on the other side, was 9ļ
                    degrees' or thereabouts. The diameters of the first and third he had not time to
                    measure, but that of the first seemed to be about five or six degrees, and that
                    of the second about twelve. The like crowns appear sometimes about the moon; for
                    in the beginning of the year 1664, on February 19th, at night, he saw two such
                    crowns about her. The diameter of the first or innermost was about three
                    degrees, and that of the second about five degrees and a half. Next about the
                    moon was a circle of white; and next about that the inner crown, which was of a
                    bluish green within, next the white, and of a yellowish and red without; and
                    next about these colours were blue and green on the inside of the outer crown,
                    and red on the outside of it.</p>
                <p>At the same time there appeared a halo at the distance of about 22° 35' from the
                    centre of the moon. It was elliptical, and its long diameter was perpendicular
                    to the horizon, verging below farthest from the moon. He was told that the moon
                    had sometimes three or more concentric crowns of colours encompassing one
                    another next about her body. The more equal the globules of water or ice are to
                    one another, the more crowns of colours will appear, and the colours will be the
                    more lively. The halo, at the distance of 22ļ degrees from the moon, is of
                    another sort. By its being oval and more remote from the moon below than above,
                    he concludes that it was made by refraction in some kind of hail or snow
                    floating in the air in an horizontal posture, the refracting angle being about
                    50 or 60 degrees. Dr Smith, however, makes it sufficiently evident, that the
                    reason why this halo appeared oval and more remote from the moon towards the
                    horizon, is a deception of sight, and the same with that which makes the moon
                    appear larger in the horizon.</p>
