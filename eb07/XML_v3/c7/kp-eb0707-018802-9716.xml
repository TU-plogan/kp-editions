                    instrument for describing circles, measuring figures, and the like.</p><p>The common compasses consist of two sharp-pointed branches or legs of iron,
                    steel, brass, or other metal, joined together at the top by a rivet, whereon
                    they move as on a centre. Those compasses are the best in which the pin or axle
                    on which the joint turns, and also half the joint itself, are made of steel, as
                    the opposite metals wear more equably. The perfection of compasses may be known
                    by the easy and uniform opening and shutting of their legs; one of which is
                    sometimes made to take in and out, in order to make room for two other points to
                    describe with ink, black-lead, or other materials. There are compasses of
                    various kinds and contrivances, accommodated to the various uses they are
                    intended for.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Compasses</hi><hi rend="italic">of Three Legs,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Triangular Compasses,</hi> are, setting aside the excess of
                    a leg, of the same structure with the common ones: and their use is to take
                    three points at once, so as to form triangles; to lay down three positions of a
                    map, to be copied at once, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Beam-CθMPAssES</hi> consist of a long branch, or beam, made of
                    brass or wood, carrying two brass cursors, the one fixed at one end, the other
                    sliding along the beam, with a screw to fasten it occasionally. To the cursors
                    may be screwed points of any kind, whether steel for pencils, or the like.
                    Beam-compasses are used to draw large circles, to take great extents, &amp;c. To
                    the fixed cursor is sometimes applied an adjusting or micrometer screw, by which
                    an extent is obtained to extreme nicety.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Clockmakers'</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Compasses</hi>
                    are joined like the common compasses, with a quadrant or bow like the spring
                    compasses, only of different use, as here it serves to keep the instrument firm
                    at any opening. They are made very strong, with the points of their legs of
                    well-tempered steel, being used to draw lines on pasteboard or copper.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Cylindrical and Spherical</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                    Compasses</hi> consist of four branches, joined in a centre, two of which are
                    circular and two flat, being a little bent on the ends. Their use is to take the
                    diameter, thickness, or calibre of round or cylindric bodies, such as cannons,
                    pipes, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Elliptic</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Compasses</hi> are
                    used to draw ellipses, or ovals of any kind. They consist of a beam about a foot
                    long, bearing three cursors, to one of which may be screwed points of any kind.
                    To the bottom of the other two are rivetted two sliding dovetails, adjusted in
                    grooves made in the cross branches of the beam. As the dovetails have a motion
                    every way, by turning about the long branch, they go backwards and forwards
                    along the cross; so that when the beam has gone half way about, one of these
                    will have moved the whole length of one of the branches; and when the beam has
                    got quite round, the same dovetail will have got back the whole length of the
                    branch. The use of this compass is easy; by turning round the long branch, the
                    ink, pencil, or other point, will draw the ellipsis required.</p><p><hi rend="italic">German</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Compasses</hi> have

                    are a piece of wood, in form of the shaft of a plane, cleft at top, as far as
                    half its length; and with this the angles, &amp;c. of jewels and precious stones
                    are measured. There is in the cleft a little brass rule, fastened at one end by
                    a pin, but so that it may be moved in the manner of a brass level. With this
                    kind of square lapidaries take the angles of the stones, laying these on the
                    shaft as they <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> cut them.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Proportional</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Compasses</hi>
                    are those whose joint lies between the points terminating each leg. They are
                    either simple or compound. In the former sort the centre is fixed, so that one
                    pair of these serves only for one proportion. The latter consist of two parts or
                    sides of brass, which lie upon each other so nicely as to appear but one when
                    they are shut. The sides open easily, and move about a centre, which is itself
                    moveable in a hollow canal cut through the greater part of their length. To this
                    centre, on each side, is affixed a sliding piece, of a small length, with a fine
                    line drawn on it, serving as an index, to be set against other lines or
                    divisions placed upon the compasses on both sides. These lines are,· 1. a line
                    of lines; 2. a line of superficies, areas, or planes; 3. a line of solids; 4. a
                    line of circles, or rather of polygons to be inscribed in circles. These lines
                    are all unequally divided; the three first from one to twenty, the last from six
                    to twenty.</p><p>The use of the first is to divide a line into any number of equal parts; by the
                    second and third are found the sides of like planes or solids in any given
                    proportions; and by the fourth, circles are divided into any number of equal
                    parts, or any polygons inscribed in them.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Spring</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Compasses,</hi> or

                    with its radius, which is fastened with one of the central rules, like the two
                    legs of a sector, in order that the central rule may be carried through all the
                    points of the circumference or the arch. The radius and rule should be as thin
                    as possible; the rule fastened to the radius should be hammered cold, to attain
                    the greater elasticity; and the breadth of the central rule should be triple
                    that of the radius. There must also be a groove in this rule, with a dovetail
                    fastened on it for its motion, and a hole in the centre of each rule. The use of
                    this instrument is to facilitate the trisection of angles geometrically.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Turn-ιιp-</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Compasses.</hi> The
                    body of this instrument is like the common compasses; but towards the bottom of
                    the legs, outside, are added two other points besides the usual ones, the one of
                    which carries a drawing pen point, and the other a port-crayon, both adjusted so
                    as to turn round, and be in the way of use, or out of it, as occasion requires.
                    These compasses have been contrived to save the trouble of changing the
                    points.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
