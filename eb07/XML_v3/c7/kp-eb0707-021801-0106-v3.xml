                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> mathematicians of antiquity regarded the straight
                    line and the circle as the most simple of all geometrical lines, and the
                    celebrated geometer Euclid has employed no other in his well known <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements.</hi> By these alone the ancients resolved a great number
                    of problems, of which the more simple are contained in Euclid’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but many of higher
                    difficulty were resolved in his other writings, and in treatises of Archimedes
                    and Apollonius, which have only in part reached our times. There is, however,
                    from the very nature of geometrical science, a limit to the applicability of the
                    straight line and circle. Some problems admit of only one solution: these can be
                    resolved by the intersection of two straight lines. Others again admit of two
                    solutions, and such require lines which intersect each other in two points;
                    therefore they may be resolved by the straight line and circle, or two
                    circles.</p>
                <p>If, however, a problem be of such a nature as in its most general form to admit
                    of three solutions, it must necessarily be determined by the intersection of two
                    lines which intersect each other in three points: it therefore cannot be
                    resolved by the straight line and circle alone. Now the ancients had actually
                    proposed to themselves such problems, and in this way it may be supposed they
                    had discovered the necessity of admitting other lines, in addition to the
                    straight line and circle, into their geometry.</p>
                <p>The interest which mankind take in mathematical speculations is but little in
                    comparison to that which is excited by works of poetry, oratory, or history;
                    hence it has happened that ancient treatises on these subjects have had a better
                    chance of descending to our times. It is not, therefore, wonderful that none of
                    the works of the more early Greek geometers have reached us, nor have we any
                    work of great antiquity professedly written on the subject of the conic
                    sections. Our curiosity must therefore rest satisfied with the knowledge of a
                    few accidental notices and facts gleaned from different authors.</p>
                <p>The discovery of the conic sections seems to have originated in the school of
                    Plato, in which geometry was. highly respected and much cultivated. It is
                    probable that the followers of that philosopher were led to the discovery of
                    these curves, and to the investigation of many of their properties, in seeking
                    to resolve the two famous problems of the duplication of the cube, and the
                    trisection of an angle, for which the artifices of the ordinary or plane
                    geometry were insufficient. Two solutions of the former problem, by the help of
                    the conic sections, are preserved by Eutocius,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Arch. lib. ii. <hi rend="italic">De
                    Sph.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Cyĩ.</hi></p></note> and are
                    attributed by him to Menaechmus, the scholar of Eudoxus, who lived not much
                    posterior to the time of Plato: and this circumstance, added to a few words in
                    an epigram of Eratosthenes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note> has been thought sufficient
                    authority, by some authors, to ascribe the honour of the discovery of the conic
                    sections to Menaechmus. We may at least infer that, at this epoch, geometers had
                    made some progress in developing the properties of these curves.</p>
                <p>The writings of Archimedes that have reached us explicitly show that the
                    geometers before his time had advanced a great length in investigating the
                    properties of the conic sections, 'this author expressly mentions many principal
                    propositions to have been demonstrated by preceding writers; and he often refers
                    to properties of the conic sections, as truths commonly divulged and known to
                    mathematicians. His own discoveries in this branch of science are worthy of the
                    most profound and inventive genius of antiquity. In the quadrature of the
                    parabola he gave the first and the most remarkable instance that has yet been
                    discovered, of the exact equality of a curvilinear to a rectilinear space. He
                    determined the proportion of the elliptic spaces to the circle; and he invented
                    many propositions respecting the mensuration of the solids formed by the
                    revolution of the conic sections about their axes.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly from the writings of Apollonius of Perga, a town in Pamphylia, on
                    the subject of the conic sections, that we know how far the ancient
                    mathematicians carried their speculations concerning these curves. Apollonius
                    flourished under Ptolemy Philopater, about forty years later than Archimedes. He
                    formed his taste for geometry, and acquired that superior skill in the science,
                    to which he is indebted for his fame, in the school of Alexandria, under the
                    successors of Euclid. Besides his great work on the conic sections, he was the
                    author of many smaller treatises relating chiefly to the geometrical analysis,
                    the originals of which have all perished, and are only known to modern
                    mathematicians by the account given of them by Pappus of Alexandria, in the
                    seventh book of his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Collections.</hi> (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Apollonius.)</hi></p>
                <p>The work of Apollonius on the conic sections, written in eight books, was held in
                    such high estimation by the ancients, as to procure for him the name of the
                    great geometer. The first four books of this treatise only have come down to us
                    in the original Greek. It is the purpose of these four books, as we are informed
                    in the prefatory epistle to Eudemus, to deliver the elements of the science; and
                    in this part of his labour the author claims no further merit than that of
                    having collected, amplified, and reduced to order, the discoveries of preceding
                    mathematicians. One improvement introduced by Apollonius is too remarkable to be
                    passed over without notice. The geometers who preceded him derived each curve
                    from a <hi rend="italic">right cone,</hi> which they conceived to be cut by a
                    plane perpendicular to its slant side. It will readily be perceived, from what
                    is shown in the first section of the fourth part of the following treatise, that
                    the section would be a parabola when the vertical angle of the cone was a right
                    angle, an ellipse when it was acute, and a hyperbola when it was obtuse. Thus
                    each curve was derived from a different sort of cone. Apollonius was the first
                    to show that all the curves are produced from any sort of cone, whether right or
                    oblique, according to the different inclinations of the cutting plane. This fact
                    is one remarkable instance of the adherence of the mind to its first
                    conceptions, and of the slowness and difficulty with which it generalizes.</p>
                <p>The original of the last four books of the treatise of Apollonius is lost; nor is
                    it easy to ascertain in what age it disappeared. In the year 1C58 Borelli
                    discovered at Florence an Arabic manuscript entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apolloìiii Pergoei</hi><hi rend="italic">Conicoum Libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Octo.</hi> By the liberality of the Duke of Tuscany, he was permitted to carry
                    the manuscript to Rome, and, with the aid of an Arabic scholar, Abraham
                    Ecchellensis, he published in 1661 a Latin translation of it. The manuscript,
                    although from its title it was expected <pb break="no" facs="nls:194750119"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-0119-0219"/>to be a complete translation of all the eight
                    books, yet was found to contain only the first seven books: and it is
                    remarkable, that another manuscript, brought from the East by Golius, the
                    learned professor of Leyden, so early as 1664, as well as a third, of which
                    Ravius published a translation in 1669, have the same defect. All the three
                    manuscripts agreeing in the want of the eighth book, we may now consider that
                    part of the work of Apollonius as irrecoverably lost. Fortunately, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collectiones Mathematica</hi> of Pappus, in whose time the entire
                    treatise of Apollonius was extant, there is preserved some accountof
                    thesub-jects treated in each book, and all the <hi rend="italic">Lemmata</hi>
                    required in the investigations of the propositions they contain. Dr Halley, who
                    in 1710 gave a correct edition of the Conics of Apollonius, guided in his
                    researches by the lights derived from Pappus, has restored the eighth book with
                    so much ability as to leave little room to regret the original.</p>
                <p>The last four books of the Conics of Apollonius, containing the higher or more
                    recondite parts of the science, are generally supposed to be the fruit of the
                    author’s own researches; and they do much honour to the geometrical skill and
                    invention of the great geometer. Even in our times the whole treatise must be
                    regarded as a very extensive, if not a complete work on the conic sections.
                    Modern mathematicians make important applications of these curves, with which
                    the ancients .were unacquainted; and they have been thus led to consider the
                    subject in particular points of view, suited to their purposes; but they have
                    made few discoveries of which there are not some traces to be found in the work
                    of the illustrious ancient.</p>
                <p>The geometers who followed Apollonius seem to have contented themselves with the
                    humble task of commenting on his treatise, and of rendering it of more easy
                    access to the bulk of mathematicians. Till about the middle of the 16th century,
                    the history of this branch of mathematical science presents nothing remarkable.
                    The study of it was then revived; and since that time this part of mathematics
                    has been more cultivated, or has been illustrated by a greater variety of
                    ingenious writings.</p>
                <p>Among the ancients the study of the conic sections was a subject of pure
                    intellectual speculation. The applications of the properties of these curves in
                    natural philosophy have, in modern times, given to this part of the mathematics
                    a degree of importance that it did not formerly possess. That which, in former
                    times, might be considered as interesting only to the learned theorist and
                    profound mathematician, is now a necessary attainment to him who would not be
                    ignorant of those discoveries in nature that do the greatest honour to the
                    present age.</p>
                <p>It is curious to remark the progress of discovery, and the connexion that
                    subsists between the different branches of human knowledge; and it excites some
                    degree of admiration to reflect, that the astronomical discoveries of Kepler,
                    and the sublime theory of Newton, depend on the seemingly barren speculations of
                    Greek geometers concerning the sections of the cone.</p>
                <p>Apollonius, and all the writers on conic sections before Dr Wallis, derived the
                    elementary properties of the curves from the nature of the cone. In the second
                    part of his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Sectionibus
                    Conicis,</hi> published in 1665, Dr Wallis laid aside the consideration of the
                    cone, deriving the properties of the curves from a description <hi rend="italic"
                    >in piano.</hi> Since his time authors have been much divided as to the best
                    method of defining those curves, and demonstrating their elementary properties;
                    many of them preferring that of the ancient geometers, while others, and some of
                    great note, have followed the example of Dr Wallis.</p>
                <p>In support of the innovation made by Dr Wallis, it is urged, that in the ancient
                    manner of treating the conic sections, young students are perplexed and
                    discouraged by the previous matter to be learnt respecting the generation and
                    properties of the cone; and that they find it no easy task to conceive steadily,
                    and to understand, diagrams which represent lines drawn in different planes; all
                    these difficulties are avoided by defining the curves <hi rend="italic">in
                    piano</hi> from one of their essential properties. It is notour intention
                    particularly to discuss this point; and we have only to add, that in the
                    following treatise we have chosen to deduce the properties of the conic sections
                    from their description <hi rend="italic">in piano,</hi> as better adapted to the
                    nature of a work designed for general readers.</p>
                <p>A geometrical treatise on the conic sections must necessarily be founded upon the
                    elements of geometry. As Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geometry</hi>
                    are generally studied, and in every one’s hands, we have chosen to refer to it
                    in the demonstrations. The edition we have used is that published by the late
                    Professor Playfair of Edinburgh. Although the references arc made to Euclid’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> yet they will also apply to the treatise on <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Geometry</hi> given in this work; for a table is there given,
                    indicating the particular proposition of our treatise that corresponds to each
                    of the most material propositions in Euclid’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements.</hi></p>
                <p>The references are to be thus understood: (20, 1, E.) means the 20th prop, of the
                    first book of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    (2 Cor. 20, 6, E.) means the second corollary to the 20th prop, of the sixth
                    book of the same work; and so of others. Again, (7) means the seventh
                    proposition of that Part of the following treatise in which such reference
                    happens to occur; (Cor. 1) means the corollary to the first proposition; (2 Cor.
                    3) means the second corollary to the third proposition, &amp;c.—such references
                    being all made to the propositions in the division of the treatise in which they
                    are found.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude this brief history of this most interesting part of the ancient
                    geometry, with a catalogue of authors and their works.</p>

                <p>There is much valuable matter relating to the conic sections in several works

                <p>PART I.—OF THE PARABOLA.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Definitions.</hi></p>
                <p>I. If a straight line BC, and a point without it F, be given in position in a
                    plane, and a point D be supposed to move in such a manner that DF, its distance
                    from the given point, is equal to BD, its distance from the given line; the
                    point D will describe a line DAD', called a <hi rend="italic">Parabola.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>'II. The straight line BC, which is given imposition, is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Directrix of the parabola.</hi></p>
                <p>III. The given point F is called the <hi rend="italic">Focus.</hi></p>
                <p>IV. A straight line perpendicular to the directrix, terminated at one extremity
                    by the parabola, and produced indefinitely within it, is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">Diameter.</hi></p>
                <p>V. The point in which a diameter meets the parabola is called its <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertex.</hi></p>
                <p>VI. The diameter which passes through the focus is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Axis of the parabola</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the vertex of the axis is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Principal Vertex.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Corollary.</hi> A perpendicular drawn from the focus to the directrix is
                    bisected at the vertex of the axis.</p>
                <p>VII. A straight line terminated both ways by the -parabola, and bisected by a
                    diameter, is called an <hi rend="italic">Ordinate to that diameter.</hi></p>
                <p>VIII. The segment of a diameter between its vertex and an ordinate, is called an
                    <hi rend="italic">Absciss.</hi></p>
                <p>IX. A straight line quadruple the distance between the vertex of a diameter and
                    the directrix, is called the <hi rend="italic">Parameter.,</hi> also the <hi
                    rend="italic">Latus</hi><hi rend="italic">Rectum of that diameter.</hi></p>
                <p>X. A straight line meeting the parabola only in one point, and which everywhere
                    else falls without it, is said to <hi rend="italic">touch</hi> the parabola at
                    that point, and is called a <hi rend="italic">Tangent to the parabola.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Proposition</hi> I.</p>
                <p>The distance of any point without the parabola from the focus is greater than its
                    distance from the directrix; and the distance of any point within the parabola
                    from the focus is less than its distance from the directrix.</p>
                <p>Let DΛrf be a parabola, of which F is the focus, GC the directrix, and Ρ a point
                    without the curve, that is, on the same side of the curve with the directrix;
                    PF, a line drawn to the focus, will be greater than PG, a perpendicular to the
                    directrix. For, as PF must necessarily cut the curve, let D be the point of
                    intersection; draw DB perpendicular to the directrix, and join PB. Because D is
                    a point in the parabola, DB = DF (Definition 1), therefore PF = PD ∙+ DB; but PD
                    + L&gt;B is greater than PB (20, 1, E.), and ’ therefore still greater than PG
                    (19, 1, E.), therefore PF is greater than PG.</p>
                <p>Again, let Q be a point within the parabola; QF, a line drawn to the focus, is
                    less than QB, a perpendicular to the directrix. The perpendicular QB necessarily
                    cuts the curve; let D be the point of intersection; join DF. Then DF = DB (Der.
                    1), and QD + DF =± QB; but QF is less than QD + DF, therefore QF is less than
                    QB. <hi rend="superscript"> λ</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> A point is
                    without or within the parabola, according as its distance from the focus is
                    greater or less than its distance from the directrix. &gt; <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Prop.</hi> II. &gt;</p>
                <p>Every straight line perpendicular to the directrix meets the parabola, and every
                    diameter falls wholly within it.</p>
                <p>(See Figure to Prop. I.)</p>
                <p>Let the straight line BQ be perpendicular to the directrix at B; BQ shall meet
                    the parabola. Draw BF to the focus, and make the anglb BFP equal to FBQ; then,
                    because QBC is a right angle, Q.BF and P1 <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> B are
                    each less than a right angle, therefore QB and ΡΓ intersect each other; let D be
                    the point of intersection, then DB = DF (5, 1, E.); thexefore D is a point in
                    the parabola. Again, the diameter DQ falls wholly within the parabola; for take
                    Q any point in the diameter, and draw FQ to the focus, then QB or QD + DF is
                    greater than QF; therefore Q is within the parabola (Cor. 1).</p>

                    3, E.); and hence N, any other point in the circumference, is without the
                    directrix, and on the same side of it as the parabola; therefore the point L is

                <p>To find any number of points in a parabola, having given the focus and axis.</p>
                <p>Let F be the focus, AH the axis, and A the vertex. Suppose the problem resolved,
                    and that D is a point in the parabola. In FA produced take AC equal to AF, and
                    through C draw the directrix BCδ: draw DF to the focus, DE perpendicular to the
                    axis, and DB perpendicular to the directrix: Take AH equal to FD.</p>
                <p>Because AH is equal to DF, and DF is greater than AF (Cor. Prop. 2), therefore AH
                    is greater than AF, and II is always in AF produced.</p>
                <p>Now CE is equal to AH, for each is equal to DF; therefore, taking from these the

                    the centre of which is in the axis of the parabola.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scholium.</hi> From this proposition it appears that the

                    that the indefinite spaces between the curve and axis on each side are exactly
                    alike, so that if the whole space comprehended within the parabola were divided
                    into two portions by cutting it through the axis, and one of them were turned

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scholium.</hi> From this proposition it appears that an
                    ellipse is a curve, which returns into itself, thus inclosing a finite area;
                    also, that the spaces between the curve and the axis on each side are alike in
                    every way; so that if the ellipse were resolved into two portions, by cutting it
                    along the axis, the space ABD¢z, if turned over, would coincide entirely with
                    the space <hi rend="italic">Abda.</hi> Now it has been shewn that the same

                    Hence it follows that the two axes divide the whole ellipse into four portions

                    same as for the proposition, if it be considered that when D falls at either

                    the centre, both being in the same plane, and let the radius CH be half of the
                    radius OH; any given point A in the circumference of the generating circle will
                    always be in D√, some diameter given in position of the other circle.</p>
                <p>Let H be the point of contact of the circles: the points H, C, 0 are in a
                    straight line (11, 3, E.); and because the diameter of the inner circle is half
                    that of the outer circle, one of its extremities will always be at 0, the centre
                    of the fixed circle.</p>
                <p>Suppose that at the beginning of the motion the point A was at D, a given point
                    in the circumference of the fixed circle, and that by rolling along the arch DH,
                    the generating circle has come to the position 0AH: draw AC to its centre, and
                    bisect the angle ACH, and consequently the arch AH, by the radius BC.</p>
                <p>The arch DH is equal to the arch AH, because every element of the one has been
                    applied to an equal corresponding element of the other: therefore the arch DH is
                    double the arch BH, and the radius of the circle DH is by hypothesis double the
                    radius of the circle BH. Now in different circles, equal angles at their centres
                    stand on arches which have the same ratio as their circumferences or their
                    radii, therefore an angle at 0, the centre of the fixed circle, standing on the
                    arch DH, will be equal to the angle BCH, that is, to the angle A0H (20, 3, E.);
                    hence a straight line drawn through 0 and χA will pass through the given point
                    D; thus A will always be in the diameter DO&lt;Z, which is given by position,
                    and by the motion of the circle will describe that diameter.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scholium.</hi> The refined notion of generating lines by
                    supposing a curve to roll along a straight line or curve, is due to the
                    moderns.</p>
                <p>Galileo appears to have been the first who introduced it into geometry, and in
                    this way he indicated the <hi rend="italic">cycloid,</hi> the discussion of
                    which by Mersennc, Descartes, Pascal, and others, was the beginning of that
                    series of discoveries which has since gradually expanded into the modern
                    geometry. The ancients, however, in some cases employed motion in the formation
                    of geometrical figures. Euclid defined a sphere to be the solid figure described
                    by the revolution of a semicircle about its diameter, which remains unmoved; and
                    Archimedes defined his spiral by the uniform motion of a point along a straight
                    line which at the same time turns with an uniform angular motion about one of
                    its extremities. The preceding proposition, and the following, may be
                    established by the ordinary method of geometrical reasoning; or instead of
                    supposing one circle to roll on another, we might suppose the diameter of the
                    generating circle to turn about the centre of the fixed circle with a uniform
                    angular motion, while at the same time it turned uniformly about its own centre,
                    so as to make two complete revolutions in the time its diameter makes one. It
                    then might be easily shown, that the extremity of any radius of the revolving
                    circle would describe a diameter of a fixed circle.</p>
                <p>The property here demonstrated is elegant, and remarkable in having been applied
                    in mechanics to the production of a reciprocating rectilinear motion by means of
                    a rotatory motion.</p>

                    generating circle, within or without it, will describe an ellipse, of which
                    conjugate diameters will be given in position.</p>
                <p>Let DHED'E' be the fixed circle, 0 its centre, and AH BO the generating circle,
                    which rolls along the concave circumference DHE: any given point P (the
                    generating point) in the plane of this circle, within or without it, will
                    describe an ellipse given in position.</p>
                <p>Take a given point A anywhere in the circumference of the generating circle, and
                    draw a straight line through A, and the generating point P, meeting the
                    circumference in B: Thus A and B will be given points in the circle, and AP, PB
                    lines given in magnitude. Draw 0D, 0E, radii of the fixed circle, through the
                    points A and B: these will be lines given in position. (Preceding Prop.)</p>
                <p>Let OCH be the revolving diameter of the generating circle, and C its centre.
                    When OH has made a complete revolution about the centre 0, the point A will have
                    been twice at 0, and BP, one of the segments of AB, will have coincided entirely
                    with OM, OM', equal segments of the diameter DD', on opposite sides of the
                    centre; therefore, if in DD' there be taken 0M and 0M', each equal to the line
                    BP, M and M' will be given points in which the locus of P cuts the line DD'.</p>
                <p>For a like reason AP, the other segment of AB, will have coincided with segments
                    of the diameter EE' in two opposite positions, viz. ON, ON'; therefore, if ON
                    and ON' be taken each equal AP, N and N' will be also given points in which the
                    locus of P intersects the line EE'.</p>
                <p>By the motion of the generating circle, the point B, either of the extremities of
                    the revolving chord AB, will in the course of a revolution have come to Ľ, a
                    point in the circumference of the fixed circle. The angle OAB will then be in a
                    semicircle (of the generating circle), and AB will have the position of a
                    perpendicular to 0D. Let this be the line EE, which will be given in position,
                    and also in magnitude, because it is equal to the chord BA. Take FQ — AP,
                    therefore QE = PB; then Q. will be a fifth given point in the locus of P. Join
                    Q0, and take 0Q,' — 0Q,: the line QQ', which is bisected at 0, will be given in
                    position and magnitude. Draw BK perpendicu∙</p>

                    similar (4∙, 6, E.), therefore</p>
                <p>BI: IK = BP: PA = EQ: QF:</p>
                <p>Because the lines BK, EF are similarly divided at Q and I, the points O, I, Q,
                    are in a straight line (Lemma to Prop. 8, Part I.), so that I is in the line
                    QOQ'.</p>
                <p>Again, because E0: OB = Q0: OI, and that OB cannot exceed 0E, therefore 01 cannot
                    be greater that OQ; and when AB is not perpendicular to DD', the point I will
                    always be between Q and Q': in no case can it be beyond these limits.</p>
                <p>The triangles OQE, OIB, are similar (4, 6, E.), therefore their sides are
                    proportionals, and</p>

                    QI ♦ IQ' = BP <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: PI <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>;
                    hence, by alternation, and observing that BP = 0M, 0Q <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>: OM <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = QI ∙ IQ': PI <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>; therefore the point P is in an ellipse, of which QQ' and MM', lines
                    given in magnitude and position, are conjugate diameters (converse of 13).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 1. The ellipse described by the generating point P
                    depends entirely on the magnitude of the generating circle AOB, and the position

                    distance from the centre; therefore, whatever be the position of the revolving
                    chord AB, if it always pass through the same point P, the ellipse will be the
                    same, and have the same position on the plane of the fixed circle.</p>

                    entirely on the position of the chord in respect of the centre; they will be
                    different for different chords, but for the same chord they will have a fixed

                    and ON to PA, and the angle which the diameters MM', NN' make at the centre is
                    half the angle which the chord subtends at the centre of the generating circle;
                    for in the course of a revolution of the generating circle about the centre Q,
                    the segments PB, PA of the chord will have been applied upon the lines 0M, ON,
                    so as entirely to coincide with them: the rest is evident (20, 3, E.).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> 4. When the revolving chord AB comes into the

                    QOQ', which is the conjugate of MM', and in this position it is a normal to the
                    ellipse: for a tangent to the ellipse at Q is parallel to MM', and therefore
                    perpendicular to EF.</p>

                    principle that elliptic compasses and lathes for turning ovals are constructed.

                <p>Let A0B be the generating circle (fig. 1 and 2), and P the generating point, at
                    any point in the curve. It appears from Prop. XXVI. Cor. 4, that a chord in the

                    the axes, will also pass through B, the point in which it meets the other axis

                    3, E.), because the axes form right angles at the centre of the ellipse.
                    Therefore when the point P is within the circle AOB (fig. 1), the radius OC or

                    whose diameter is their difference; in the first way the generating point will

                    equal to the sum of the semidiameters when the generating point is within the

                <p>The property in question has suggested an instrument for generating an ellipse
                    elegantly, by continued motion. A and B are two wheels, the axes of which turn
                    in holes C, 0, near the ends of the connecting bar D. One of the wheels B must
                    be just half the diameter of the other A, which may be of any size, and a band
                    EF goes round them, outside; an arm CP is attached to the wheel B, and admits of
                    being lengthened or shortened by sliding along its surface in a socket which may
                    be anywhere on the wheel. Suppose now that the wheel A is fixed or kept from
                    turning, and that the bar D is turned round the centre 0, carrying at its other
                    extremity the wheel B; the action of the band EF will tl∣en turn this wheel B
                    round its centre C, and while the bar makes one revolution round the centre of
                    the fixed wheel, the other wheel will make two revolutions about its centre.</p>
                <p>The use of the sliding arm CP is to give extension to the surface of the wheel,
                    so that P, any point in the arm, may be regarded as a point in the plane of a
                    circle turning about a moveable centre C, while that centre revolves about a
                    fixed centre 0. From this description it is easy to see that C, the centre of
                    the wheel B, may be regarded as the centre of a circle which rolls on the inside
                    of a circle whose centre is 0; also that any point P in the plane which is the
                    extension of the surface of the wheel, is just a point in the plane of the
                    rolling circle; and since the circle of which C is the centre makes two turns in
                    going round that of which 0 is the centre, the radius of the one circle must be
                    double that of the other; and hence it follows from the proposition that the
                    path of the point P in space is an ellipse.</p>

                    one of the given points F, and then the other <hi rend="italic">f</hi> as that

                    the hyperbolas extend to a greater distance from the given points F,∕ than any
                    which can be assigned.</p>
                <p>II. The given points F,∕ are called the <hi rend="italic">Foci of the

                <p>V. A straight line passing through the centre, and terminated by the opposite
                    hyperbolas, is called a <hi rend="italic">Transverse Diameter.</hi> It is also
                    sometimes called simply a <hi rend="italic">Diameter.</hi></p>
                <p>VI. The extremities of a diameter are called its <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertices.</hi></p>
                <p>VII. The diameter which passes through the foci is called the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>IX. Any straight line terminated both ways by the hyperbola, and bisected by a

                    that diameter.</p>
                <p>X. Each of the segments of a transverse diameter produced, intercepted by its
                    vertices and an ordinate, is called an <hi rend="italic">Absciss.</hi></p>
                <p>XI. A straight line which meets the hyperbola in one point only, and which

                    let D be the point of intersection; Pfis less than PD + Df(20, 1, E.), therefore

                    thus the tangent DE, which is always perpendicular to ∕L, is perpendicular to

                    EL; and because MC, PD, RH, are parallel, and MP is equal to RN (1 Cor. 16), CD
                    is equal to HN. Now, by hypothesis, <hi rend="smallcaps">CD</hi>: CE = CE: CH,
                    therefore NH: LE = CE: CH; but CE: CH = HR: EQ (2 Cor. 17), therefore Nil: LE =

                <p>Now the angles at II and E are equal, therefore the triangles NUR, LEQ are

                    are parallel to KL, and are terminated by the hyperbola, it will bisect the area

                    and there will remain the hyperbolic sectors PCQ, RCQ equal to each other.

                    two straight lines intersecting each other in the vertex of the cone, and
                    forming with the straight line which joins the points in which they meet the
                    base, a triangle; 2. A circle; 3. An ellipse; 4. A parabola; 5. An hyperbola.
                    The first two of these, however, viz. the triangle and circle, may be referred
                    to the hyperbola and the ellipse; for if the axes of an hyperbola be supposed to
                    retain a constant ratio to each other, and, at the same time, to diminish
                    continually, till at last the vertices coincide; the opposite hyperbolas will
                    evidently become two straight lines intersecting each other in a point; and a
                    circle may be considered as an ellipse, whose axes are equal, or whose foci
                    coincide with the centre; so that the only three sections which require to be

                <p>Lastly, suppose that the segment LP of the diameter cut off by the circle is less

                <p>Now, when the ordinate Nw approaches toward the tangent PG, the point D will

                    and the same will be true for all positions nearer to the tangent. In these, NE

                <p>For if a greater circle be described, it will cut off a segment greater than its

                <p>KT <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = PT ∙ LP (Lemma); therefore KT is a

                    LQ, only one such point K can be found; therefore the circle of curvature cuts
                    the parabola in one point, be sides the vertex of the diameter, and in no more.

                    CP, CQ, and so on; thus dividing the sector ACB first into two equal sectors,
                    then into four, then into fight, and so on. Draw tangents to the curves at the

                    which join these points are ordinates to the semidiameters CP, CQ which pass
                    between them, the tangents will intersect each other at G and L, points in the

                <p>Since the series in the denominator approaches continually to a geometrical
                    series, of which the common ratio is any term is nearly three times the sum of
                    all the terms which follow it. If then a term be found which agrees in all the
                    figures with £ of that before it, then of that term may be taken as the sum of
                    the remaining terms.</p>
