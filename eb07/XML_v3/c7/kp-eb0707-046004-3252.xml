                    for his translations of ancient authors, both in prose and verse, was son of
                    Thomas Creech, and born near Sherborne, in Dorsetshire, in 1659. He was educated
                    in grammatical learning under Mr Curganven of Sherborne, to whom he afterwards
                    dedicated a translation of one of Theocritus’ Idylls, and entered as a commoner
                    of Wadħam College in Oxford, in 1675. Wood tells us that his father was a
                    gentleman; but Giles Jacob, in his <hi rend="italic">Lives and Characters of
                    English Poets,</hi> states, that the circumstances of his parents not being
                    sufficient to afford him a liberal education, his disposition and capacity for
                    learning raised him up a patron in Colonel Strangeways, whose generosity
                    supplied that deficiency. But be this as it may, Creech distinguished himself
                    much, and was accounted a good philosopher and poet, and a diligent student. On
                    the 13th June 1683, he took the degree of master of arts, and not long
                    afterwards was elected probationer fellow of All Souls College; to which, Jacob
                    observes, the great reputation acquired by his translation of Lucretius
                    recommended him. Wood informs us, that upon this occasion he gave singular
                    proofs of his classical learning and philosophical attainments. He also took the
                    degree of B. D. on the 18th of March 1696. He now began to be well known by the
                    works he had published; but Father Niceron observes, that they were of no great
                    advantage to his fortune, since his circumstances were always indifferent. In
                    1699, having taken holy orders, he was presented by his college to the living of
                    Welwynn, in Hertfordshire; but he had not long enjoyed his preferment when he
                    put an end to his own life. The motives of this fatal catastrophe have been
                    variously represented. The author of the <hi rend="italic">nouvelles de la
                    République des Lettres</hi> informs us, that in the year 1700 Mr Creech fell in
                    love with a woman who treated him with great neglect, although she was
                    complaisant enough to several others; that this affront he could not bear, and
                    resolved not to survive it; and that having shut himself up in his study, he
                    there hanged himself, about the end of June 1700, and was found suspended three
                    days afterwards. The Poetical Register, however, says nothing of the particular
                    manner of his death, but only mentions that he unfortunately made away with
                    himself in the year 1701; and ascribes this fatal catastrophe of Mr Creech’s
                    life to the moroseness of his temper,.which made him less esteemed than his
                    great merit deserved, and engaged him in frequent quarrifs^and disputes. But
                    from an original letter of Arthur CÎiarlett, preserved in the Bodleian Library,
                    it has since been discovered that this unhappy event was owing to a very
                    different cause. There was a fellow collegian, of whom Creech frequently
                    borrowed money; but repeating his applications too often, he met one day with
                    such a cold reception, that he retired in a fit of gloomy disgust, and in three
                    days was found hanging in his study. Creech’s principal performances are, 1. A
                    translation of Lucretius; 2. A translation of Horace, in which, however, he has
                    omitted some few odes; 3. The Idylls of Theocritus, with Rapin’s Discourse of
                    Pastorals; 4. A translation of Manilius’s <hi rend="italic">Astronomico</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> besides translations of several parts of Virgtl, Ovid, and
                    Plutarch, printed in different collections.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
