                <p><label type="entry">CREATION</label>, in its primary import, signifies the
                    bringing into being something which did not before exist. The term is therefore
                    generally applied to the original production of the materials out of which the
                    visible world was composed. It is also used, in a secondary or subordinate
                    sense, to denote those subsequent operations of the Deity upon the matter so
                    produced, by which the whole system of nature, and all the primitive orders of
                    things, received their form, qualities, and laws.</p>
                <p>There is no subject concerning which there have been more disputes than that of
                    creation. It is certain that none of the ancient philosophershad the smallest
                    idea of its being possible to produce a substance out of nothing, or that even
                    the power of the Deity himself could operate without materials to work upon.
                    Hence some of them, including Aristotle, asserted that the world was eternal
                    both as to matter and form; whilst others, though they believed that the gods
                    had given the world its form, imagined that the materials of which it is
                    composed were eternal. Indeed the opinions of the ancients, who had not the
                    benefit of revelation, are so confused and contradictory on this head, that
                    nothing of any consequence can be deduced from them. The freethinkers of our own
                    and of former ages have denied the possibility of creation, as being a
                    contradiction of reason; and consequently they have taken occasion to discredit
                    revelation upon this ground. On the other hand, many defenders of the sacred
                    writings have asserted, that creation out of nothing, so far from being a
                    contradiction of reason, is not only probable, but demonstrably certain. This,
                    however, is a subject with which human reason can never successfully grapple;
                    and it would, therefore, be vain to enter into arguments which prove nothing
                    except that the question is one beyond the reach of our comprehension.</p>
                <p>Concerning the periods of time at which the Deity executed his several works of
                    creation, it cannot be pretended that mankind have received very particular
                    information. From viewing the phenomena of nature, and considering the general
                    laws by which they are regulated, we cannot draw any conclusive or even
                    plausible inference with respect to the precise period at which the universe
                    began to exist. We know not, nor can we ever hope to ascertain, whether the
                    different systems of planets circulating round the sun, and the fixed stars,
                    were all created at one period, or each at a different period. We cannot even
                    determine, from any thing that appears on the face of nature, whether our earth
                    was not created at a later period than any of the planets which revolve round
                    the same sun. Astronomers are, from time to time, making new discoveries in the
                    heavens; but it is impossible to say whether these successive discoveries may
                    not be owing to successive creations.</p>
                <p>Philosophers have, indeed, formed curious conjectures concerning the antiquity of
                    the earth, from the appearances of its surface, and from the nature and
                    disposition of its interior strata. The beds of lava in the neighbourhood of
                    volcanoes have afforded ground for some calculations, which, though they do not
                    fix the period of the earth’s origin, are yet considered as proving that that
                    period was much more remote than the earliest age of sacred or profane history.
                    In the neighbourhood of Mount Aetna, and on the sides of that remarkable
                    mountain, there are beds of lava covered with a considerable thickness of earth;
                    but, on the other hand, there is one which, though known from ancient monuments
                    and historical records to have issued from the volcano at least two thousand
                    years ago, is almost entirely destitute of soil and vegetation. In one place a
                    pit has been cut through seven different strata of lava; and these have been
                    found separated from each other by almost as many beds of rich earth. Now, from
                    the fact that a stratum of lava two thousand years old is yet scantily covered
                    with earth, it has been inferred that the lowest of these strata which have been
                    found divided by so many beds of earth, must have been emitted from the volcanic
                    crater at least fourteen thousand years ago; and consequently that the age of
                    the earth, however it may exceed this term of years, cannot possibly fall short
                    of it. Other facts of a similar nature likewise concur in giving some degree of
                    plausibility to this conjecture.</p>
                <p>But all these facts are as nothing in comparison of the long series which would
                    be requisite to establish such a conjecture as an incontrovertible truth; and
                    besides, any evidence which they can be supposed to afford may be very easily
                    explained away. The bed of lava which in the course of two thousand years has
                    scarcely acquired a covering of earth, confessedly stands in a situation in
                    which it is exposed to the spray of the sea, and to all the violence of winds
                    and rains. In such a situation, it cannot be thought that a thick bed of earth
                    could, in any length of time, be formed upon it; and we might as well expect
                    depth of soil, or vigorous vegetation, on the craggy cliffs of hills. In certain
                    crevices here and there, in which the earth has been retained, there is a depth
                    of soil which supports large trees. This fact, therefore, admits of no such
                    inference as has been deduced from it.</p>
                <p>But by examining the composition and arrangement of the interior strata of the
                    globe, and by viewing the general appearance of its surface, the ingenuity of
                    philosophers has, with better hopes, sought to divine conjecturally the length
                    of time during which it must have existed. Observing the exuviae of marine and
                    land animals deposited at profound depths under ground, and accompanied with
                    vegetable bodies in a good state of preservation, as well as with oleaginous and
                    bituminous substances which have in all probability been formed from vegetable
                    bodies; and remarking, at the same time, with what confusion the other
                    materials, composing the crust of this terrestrial globe, are, in various
                    instances, not arranged,but thrown together; they have concluded that the earth
                    must have existed for many ages before the earliest events recorded in sacred or
                    profane history, and must have undergone numerous revolutions before it settled
                    into its present state. Such at least are the ideas with which Buffon and De
                    Luc, and Dr Hutton, seem desirous to impress us concerning its changes and
                    antiquity. It is only doing justice to these philosophers to acknowledge, that
                    they have collected, with amazing industry, almost every fact in the natural
                    history of the earth which can serve to give plausibility to their conjectures.
                    But still these facts, besides the inconsistency observable in many of them, are
                    too scanty to warrant the conclusions which they have deduced from them.</p>
                <p>The voice of profane history is far from being decisive <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194753187" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3187-0455"/>concerning the age of the
                    world; nor is it to be expected that it should. When the earth first arose into
                    existence, mankind were not spectators of the scene; and it may naturally enough
                    be imagined that the first human beings who occupied it were too much busied in
                    furnishing themselves with the immediate necessaries and conveniencies of life,
                    to think of curious, researches into its origin, or even into their own. Profane
                    history, however, is not without accounts of the age of the earth, and the
                    origin of human society; but those accounts are exceedingly various and
                    contradictory. Plato, in his dialogue entitled <hi rend="italic">Critias,</hi>
                    mentions that his Elysian Atalantis had been buried in the ocean about nine
                    thousand years before the age in which he wrote; and he affirms that this
                    circumstance was well known to the Egyptian priests and to the contemporary
                    inhabitants of Attica. The learned world, indeed, generally agree in regarding
                    his accounts of the island in question as fictitious, affirming that the author
                    himself did not design to be understood in any other sense; and if the existence
                    of such an island, at a period so distant, be admitted as a fact worthy of any
                    credit, the age of the world may be reckoned as at least considerably more than
                    twelve thousand years. The pretensions of the Chi-neserepresent the world as
                    several hundred thousand years older; and we arc also told that the astronomical
                    records of the ancient Chaldeans carried back the origin of society to a period
                    inconceivably remote, or not less than four hundred and seventy-three thousand
                    years. The Egyptian priests reckoned between Menes and Sethon three hundred and
                    forty-one generations, which, allowing thirty years to a generation, is a period
                    exceeding ten thousand years. But these accounts are so discordant, and so
                    slenderly supported by evidence, that we cannot hesitate to reject them as
                    false; indeed the fables of historians scarcely merit so much attention as the
                    hypotheses of philosophers.</p>
                <p>When from profane we turn to sacred history, we may reasonably expect more
                    accurate and more credible information concerning the antiquity of the earth. As
                    the authenticity of the Holy Scriptures is incontrovertibly established,
                    wherever they afford evidence concerning any fact, that evidence must be
                    regarded as decisive; and a fact so important as the present might be thought
                    highly worthy of a place in them. But unfortunately, even the sacred writings do
                    not fix the era of the creation with any degree of accuracy. They leave us, in
                    some measure, at a loss whether to extend what they say concerning the era in
                    question to the whole contents of created space, or to confine it to our earth
                    and its inhabitants: besides, different copies give different dates; and even in
                    the same copy, different parts relating the same events, either disagree or do
                    not speak decisively with regard to the length of the time in which these events
                    passed. In the beginning of the sixth chapter of the first book of Kings, the
                    time which elapsed between the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt,
                    and the period at which Solomon laid the foundation of his temple, is said to
                    have been four hundred and eighty years; and in the book of Judges, again, the
                    age of all the patriarchs amounts to five hundred and ninety-two years. The
                    Hebrew copy of the Bible, which Christians for good reasons consider as the most
                    authentic, dates the creation of the world three thousand nine hundred and
                    forty-four years before the Christian era. The Samaritan Bible, again, I fixes
                    the era of the creation four thousand three hundred I and five years before the
                    birth of Christ. And the Greek I translation, known by the name of the
                    Septuagint version of the Bible, gives five thousand two hundred and seventy as
                    the number of the years which intervened between these two periods. Many other
                    calculations of the years contained in the same intermediate space of time might
                    be formed upon the various dates in the sacred volume, which differ in the
                    different copies. By comparing the dates in the sacred writings, examining how
                    these have come to disagree in different copies, endeavouring to reconcile the
                    most authentic profane with sacred chronology, and eking out the deficiency of
                    dates and of evidence with conjecture, some ingenious men have formed schemes of
                    chronology, plausible indeed, but not supported by sufficient authorities, which
                    they would gladly persuade us to receive in preference to any of those above
                    mentioned. From the Hebrew Bible Usher deduces four thousand and four years as
                    the term between the creation and the birth of Christ; Josephus, according to Dr
                    Wills and Mr Whiston, makes it four thousand six hundred and fifty-eight years;
                    and Μ. Pezron, with the help of the Septuagint, extends it to five thousand
                    eight hundred and seventy-two years. But Usher’s system is that most generally
                    received.</p>
                <p>But though these different systems of chronology are inconsistent, and slenderly
                    supported, yet the differences among them are so inconsiderable in comparison
                    with those which arise when we contemplate the chronology of the Chinese, the
                    Chaldeans, and the Egyptians, and they agree so well with the general
                    information of authentic history, and with the appearances of nature and of
                    society, that they may be considered as nearly fixing the true period of the
                    creation of the earth.</p>
                <p>Moses relates (Gen. i. 1) that, “in the beginning God created the heavens and the
                    earth. And the earth,” continues he, “was without form and void; and darkness
                    was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
                    waters. And God said, Let there be light, and there was light. And God saw the
                    light, that it was good; and God divided the light from the darkness. And God
                    called the light day, and the darkness he called night; and the evening and the
                    morning were the first day.” During five succeeding days the work of creation
                    was carried on. On the second day, a firmament was made to separate the waters,
                    and that firmament was called heaven. On the third day the waters were collected
                    into seas, and the land from which the waters had retired was caused to produce
                    grass, and trees, and other plants. On the fourth day, lights were made to
                    appear in the firmament, in order to enlighten the earth, to divide the day from
                    the night, and to distinguish time into seasons and years. On the fifth day the
                    seas were peopled with whales and other fishes, and the air with fowls. On the
                    sixth day, the earth was furnished with reptiles and quadrupeds of all kinds;
                    and on the same day, the first human pair, the progenitors of the human race,
                    were created in God’s own image.</p>
                <p>Some difficulties occur in comparing this account of the creation with the laws
                    which appear at present to regulate the system of nature. We find it hard to
                    conceive how the earth, whilst yet a stranger to the influence of the sun, could
                    experience the vicissitudes of day and night, and are astonished at the rapidity
                    with which trees and herbage first overspread its surface. The condition of
                    matter when the earth was without form and void, and the operation of the Spirit
                    of God on the face of the waters, are equally mysterious.</p>
                <p>'Some ingenious men have eagerly laboured to remove the difficulties here
                    indicated. Among these is Dr Burnet, whose theory of the earth has long been
                    considered as fanciful and ill founded. He supposes that the celestial bodies,
                    even the sun and all the other planets of the solar system,, existed long before
                    the earth. The chaos on which the Spirit of God moved, consisted, according to
                    him, of the first principles from which terrestrial bodies were formed. When
                    those laws by which the material world is regulated first began to operate on
                    the mass, he supposes that its <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753200"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-3200-0456"/>grosser and heavier parts sank towards the centre,
                    and there formed a solid ball; and that around this solid ball two species of
                    particles still floated together in confusion. Of these, one being more
                    volatile, would by degrees make its escape from the other, leave it still
                    recumbent on the solid centre, and spread around it in an atmosphere. The middle
                    stratum he composes of aqueous and oleaginous fluids; and he has no doubt, that
                    after the air had made its escape, the levity of the oleaginous fluids would
                    enable them to rise above the aqueous, and dispose themselves next the surface
                    of the liquid mass. On this he supposes the impure atmosphere to have then
                    deposited a quantity of terrene particles, sufficient to form, by intermixture
                    with the oils, a thick crust of rich earth for the production of plants and
                    herbage, and for affording a habitation to animals. This delicate shell he was
                    careful not to furrow with seas or load with mountains, either of which would
                    have reduced all to confusion. Such is his earth; but after moulding it with so
                    much ingenuity, he refrains from using the same freedom with the remainder of
                    Moses’s account of the creation.</p>
                <p>Moses, however, affords nothing which can with any propriety be used in the
                    foundation of such a theory. He tells not whether the chaos consisted of those
                    terrene, aqueous, oleaginous, and aerial particles which Dr Burnet finds in it;
                    he confines not the seas within a crust of earth; nor does he inform us that the
                    scenery of nature was not diversified by hills and valleys. Besides, the author
                    of this theory has, without any evidence, supposed matter to have been
                    originally under the influence of laws very different from those by which it is
                    at present regulated. Oil, indeed, whilst in a fluid state, floats on water; but
                    in a concrete state it sinks like other solid bodies. If reduced into that state
                    by combination with terrene matters, sufficient to render the mixture proper for
                    the nourishment and production of vegetables, its specific gravity would be
                    still greater, and it would consequently sink so much the sooner. How a concrete
                    substance consisting of earth and oil could float on water appears an
                    inexplicable enigma. But we need not take any pains in combating a theory which
                    has long since sunk into neglect and oblivion.</p>
                <p>Mr Whiston treats both the scriptures and the laws of nature with greater
                    reverence; yet he certainly involves himself in no trifling difficulties in
                    attempting to solve those which the account of Moses presents. He supposes that
                    the sun, moon, and stars, are all more ancient than the earth. The chaos from
                    which the earth was formed he represents as having been originally the
                    atmosphere of a comet. The six days of the creation he considers as equal to six
                    of our years; and he is of opinion that the earth did not revolve daily round
                    its axis, but only annually round its orbit, till after the fall of man.</p>
                <p>On the first day or year, therefore, the more ponderous parts of the chaos were,
                    according to this theory, conglomerated into an orb of earth; the chinks and
                    interstices in that orb were filled up with water; and the exterior part or
                    atmosphere was rarefied, so as to admit some faint glimmering of the rays of the
                    sun. On the second day, the atmosphere was diffused to its due extent around the
                    earth, and reduced to a degree of rarity and purity which rendered it still more
                    suitable for the transmission of light; the earth was still more consolidated;
                    and the waters being almost entirely excluded from the interstices which they
                    before occupied, were partly spread over the surface of the earth, and partly
                    raised in vapour into the atmosphere or firmament. On the third day, the earth’s
                    surface became so irregular, in one place rising into hills, in another sinking
                    into valleys, as to cause the waters, which before were equally diffused, to
                    collect into seas and lakes, leaving large tracts of ground unoccupied. And no
                    sooner had part of the earth’s surface been left bare by the waters than the
                    genial influence of the sun produced on it a rich covering of herbage, and all
                    the different species of vegetables. On the fourth day, the earth was rendered
                    subject to the regular influence of the sun, moon, and stars. On the fifth day
                    or year, things were so far advanced that fishes and fowls were produced from
                    the waters. On the sixth day the earth was furnished with animals; and the lord
                    of all the other animals, man, was also created.</p>
                <p>Such is Mr Whiston’s account of the phenomena of the Mosaic creation. But he
                    likewise assumes much more than can reasonably be granted. The atmosphere of a
                    comet could not well be the primitive chaos. It is not an obscure, but a
                    pellucid fluid; and its exterior strata, if of the same nature with the matter
                    of our earth, must be rarefied by its near approaches to the sun. Had the earth
                    not begun to revolve round its axis until after the work of creation was
                    completed, the immoderate degrees of heat and cold which its different parts
                    would have alternately felt would in all probability have proved fatal to both
                    plants and animals. Even the most distorted interpretation of Moses’s words
                    cannot represent him as meaning to inform us that the sun and moon were created
                    at different periods. But philosophy will scarcely permit us to imagine that the
                    moon was formed before the earth, of which she is the satellite; and therefore
                    we cannot agree with Mr Whiston that the creation of the earth was later than
                    that of the remaining bodies of the solar system.</p>
                <p>Among those who have endeavoured to explain the original formation of the earth,
                    and the changes which it has undergone, is Μ. de Luc. This cosmogonist, like Mr
                    Whiston, conceives that the days of the creation were much longer periods of
                    time than our present days. He seems to think that the earth had existed long
                    before the Mosaic creation, but that it began at that era to experience new
                    changes, and to be regulated by new laws; that all the different events
                    described by Moses in his history of the creation actually took place in the
                    order in which he relates them; and that the days of Moses are indefinite spaces
                    of time, which must have been very long, but of which we cannot hope to
                    ascertain the precise length. These are ingenious conjectures; but they do not
                    appear necessary, nor are they justified by facts.</p>
                <p>It has been conjectured <hi rend="italic">(^Universal History,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    85), with some probability, that the creation of which Moses is the historian
                    was neither confined to the earth alone, nor extended to the whole universe. The
                    relation which all the planets of the solar system bear to the same illuminating
                    body countenances the conjecture that they, together with the luminary by which
                    they are enlightened, were all created at one period; but it would perhaps be
                    conceiving too meanly of the benevolence, wisdom, and active power of the Deity
                    to suppose that, before that period, these had never been exerted in any work of
                    creation. Yet even here we have not demonstrative evidence.</p>
                <p>On the supposition that the whole solar system was created at once—a supposition
                    which has at least the merit of doing no violence to the narrative of Moses—the
                    creation of the sun and the other planets may be understood as having been
                    carried on at the same time with the creation of the earth. In that case, even
                    in the course of the first day, though not longer than our present days, these
                    bodies might be reduced to such order, and their relative motions so far
                    established, as to begin the distinction between light and darkness, or day and
                    night.</p>
                <p>On the second day, we may collect from Moses’s narrative, that the atmosphere was
                    purified, and the specific gravities of aqueous vapour and atmospherical air so
                    adjusted as to render the latter capable of supporting the former.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753213" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3213-0457"/>
                <p>On the third day the waters were first collected into lakes and seas, but in what
                    manner it is of course impossible to determine. Some call in the operation of
                    earthquakes; whilst others tell us that, when the earth was first formed, the
                    exterior strata were, at different parts of its surface, of different specific
                    gravities, and that the more ponderous parts now sank nearer the common centre,
                    whilst the lighter, still remaining equally remote from it as before, formed
                    islands, continents, hills, and mountains. But these are mere fancies; and we
                    have no facts to offer in their stead. On the latter part of this day vegetables
                    were caused to spring up on the earth; and their growth must have been much more
                    rapid than we ever behold it now; but by what particular act of supernatural
                    power this was effected it would be vain to inquire.</p>
                <p>• On the fourth day the sun, moon, and stars appeared in the heavens. But
                    according to the conjecture which we have mentioned as plausible, though without
                    ascribing to it the evidence of certain truth, those heavenly bodies are to be
                    considered as having been created before this day. They might now begin to exert
                    their full influence on the earth, in the same manner as they have ever since
                    continued to do.</p>
                <p>The creation of the inanimate world was thus finished, and the earth prepared for
                    the reception of animals. On the fifth day, therefore, were the living
                    inhabitants of the air and the waters created.</p>
                <p>On the sixth day the inferior animals inhabiting the earth were first created;
                    and after that the whole work was crowned by the creation of a male and female
                    of the human species. To the account of the creation of the animals, nothing
                    certain can be added in explanation of Moses’s narrative. As no more than one
                    pair of the human species were at first created, the same economy might possibly
                    be observed in the creation of the inferior animals.</p>
