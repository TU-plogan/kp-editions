                    the Vauban of Holland, and the contemporary as well as rival of the celebrated
                    French engineer, was born at Lecuwarde, in Friseland, in 1641. His father, an
                    officer of distinguished merit, early inspired him with a taste for military
                    science; and having studied mathematics, in which he made great proficiency,
                    under his uncle Fullenius, professor at Franeker, he entered the service with
                    the rank of captain, at the age of only sixteen. In 1673, he attracted notice at
                    the siege of Maëstricht, and afterwards distinguished himself so much in the
                    bloody battles of Sener, Cassel, St Denis, and Fleurus, that he was promoted to
                    the rank of colonel. In the campaign of 1675, he performed an important service
                    at the siege of Grave, by successfully employing the means which he had invented
                    for crossing the fosses of fortified places, and thus carrying a bastion without
                    a counterscarp, the access to which was defended only by the river Meuse; a
                    service for which he received, on the spot, the warmest commendations of Vauban.
                    At a subsequent period Cò’horn ably applied his theory of fortification to the
                    fortress of Coverden, the works of which he directed; and when war broke out in
                    1689 between Holland and France, he distinguished himself by new exploits. At
                    the siege of Namur he was opposed to Vauban, and at the head of his own regiment
                    defended Fort William, which he had himself constructed, in the most gallant and
                    determined manner; but he was at last compelled to yield to superior force, and
                    surrendered the work to his great rival. He had his revenge, however, in 1695,
                    when he participated in the capture of the same place, which had been fortified
                    by himself, but which Bouffiers was unable to hold out against King William. The
                    alternate taking and retaking of Namur, under the direction respectively of
                    Vauban and Cò’horn, is considered as illustrative of the different styles or
                    systems of these celebrated engineers; Vauban employing no more artillery than
                    was absolutely necessary, using his influence to moderate the ardour of the
                    troops, whom he never permitted to advance except under the cover of works, and
                    placing his glory in the most rigid economy of life; whilst Cò’horn, on the
                    other hand, accumulating artillery of all kinds, and sacrificing every thing to
                    the desire of abridging the siege, by striking the besieged with surprise and
                    terror, was equally prodigal of means and of men. “Vauban avait cerné, reserré,
                    coupé, morcelé les assiégés; Cohorn ne s’était occupé que de les accabler.
                    C’était la force substituée à l’industrie, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194747662"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-7662-0030"/>ou plutôt l’industrie employée à multiplier les
                    moyens de destruction.” In 1702, Ccihorn, now appointed lieutenant-general,
                    published in Dutch h is <hi rend="italic">New Method of Fortifying Places,</hi>
                    Leewarde, folio; a classical work, which, several years afterwards, was
                    translated into French under the title of <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Fortification,</hi><hi rend="italic">tant pour un</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">terrain</hi><hi rend="italic">bas et humide que</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sec</hi><hi rend="italic">et élevé.</hi> Hague, 1706, 1711, 1713,
                    8vo. In 1703 Cöhorn conducted several sieges according to the system above
                    described, forced Bonn to capitulate in the space of three days, and performed
                    other important services. But his active career was now approaching to a close,
                    for, on the 17th March 1704-, he died of apoplexy, at the Hague, whither he had
                    gone, at the invitation of Marlborough, to concert measures with that great
                    commander for opening the ensuing campaign. Bergen-op-Zoom, which was fortified
                    by Cöhorn, is generally and justly considered as his masterpiece, and was for
                    many years believed to be impregnable; but, to the surprise of all Europe, it
                    was taken by the French under Lowendahl in 1647, though not without suspicion of
                    treachery on the part of the garrison, which certainly made a very feeble
                    defence; and, in 1814, an attempt to carry it by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >coup-de-niain,</hi> planned by the gallant Lord Lyndoch, had nearly succeeded,
                    and, in truth, misgave only by an extraordinary accumulation of adverse
                    accidents, to which indeed night attacks are all more or less exposed.</p>
