                    name of the males of gallinaceous birds, but more especially used for the common
                    dunghill cock. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Ornithology.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cock-Pit,</hi> a sort of theatre upon which game-cocks fight.</p>
                <p>It must appear astonishing to every reflecting mind that a mode of diversion so
                    cruel and inhuman as that of cock-fighting should so generally prevail; that not
                    only the ancient Greeks and Romans should have adopted it, but that a practice
                    so savage and heathenish should be continued by Christians of all sorts, and
                    even pursued in these better and more enlightened times.</p>
                <p>The ancient Greeks and Romans, as is well known, were wont to call all the
                    nations in the world barbarians; yet certainly, if we consider the many
                    instances of cruelty practised among them, there was very little reason for the
                    distinction. Human sacrifices were common both to them and the barbarians; and
                    the exposing of infants, the combats of men with wild beasts, and of men with
                    men in the gladiatorial scenes, were spectacles of delight and festivity to
                    these self-styled polished nations.</p>
                <p>The islanders of Delos, it seems, were great lovers of cock-fighting; and
                    Tanagra, a city in Boeotia, the isle of Rhodes, Chalcis in Euboea, and the
                    country of Media, were famous for their generous and magnanimous race of
                    chickens. There was probably included in the last the kingdom of Persia, whence
                    this kind of poultry was first brought into Greece; and if one may judge of the
                    rest from the fowls of Rhodes and Media, the excellency of the broods at that
                    time consisted in their weight and largeness, the fowls of those countries being
                    heavy and bulky, and of the nature of what our sportsmen call <hi rend="italic"
                    >shakebags</hi> or <hi rend="italic">turnpokes.</hi> The Greeks, moreover, had
                    some method of preparing the birds for battle by feeding, as may be collected
                    from Columella.</p>
                <p>It should seem that cock-fighting was at first partly a religious and partly a
                    political institution at Athens, and was continued there for the purpose of
                    improving the seeds of valour in the minds of their youth; but it was afterwards
                    abused and perverted both in Athens and in the other parts of Greece to a common
                    pastime, without any moral, political, or religious intention, just as it is now
                    followed and practised among us.</p>
                <p>As the Romans were prone to imitate the Greeks, we may expect to find them
                    following the example of the latter in this mode of diversion, and in the worst
                    way, namely, without any good or laudable motives; since, when the Romans
                    brought it to Rome, the Greeks had forgotten every thing that was commendable in
                    it, and had already perverted it to a low and unmeaning sport. Signior Hyam
                    thinks the Romans borrowed the pastime from Dardanus, in Asia; but there is
                    little reason in making them go so far for it, when it was so generally followed
                    in Greece, whose customs the Romans were accustomed to borrow and imitate.
                    However, it is probable they did not adopt this practice very early; and it may
                    be gathered from Columella that the Romans did not use the sport in his time.
                    This author styles cock-fighting a <hi rend="italic">Grecian diversion</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and speaks of it in terms of ignominy, as an expensive
                    amusement, unbecoming the frugal householder, and often attended with the ruin
                    of the parties that followed it. His words are remarkable: “Nos enim censemus
                    instituere vectigal industrii patris familias, non rixosarum avium lanistae,
                    cujus plerumque totum patrimonium pignus aleae, victor gallinaceus pyctes
                    abstulit;” in which passage he describes the manner, not of the Romans, but of
                    the Greeks, who in his time had converted the diversion of cock-fighting into a
                    species of gaming, even to the total ruin of their families, as happens
                    sometimes in England at this day. The Romans, however, at last gave in to the
                    custom, though not till the decline of the empire. The first cause of contention
                    between the two brothers Bassianus and Geta, sons of the emperor Septimius
                    Severus, happened, according to Herodian, in their youth, about the fighting of
                    their cocks; and if this was the first instance of it, it is probable that these
                    princes had seen and learned it in Greece, whither they had often accompanied
                    the emperor their father.</p>
                <p>It is observable that cocks and quails pitted for the purpose of engaging one
                    another <hi rend="italic">à outrance,</hi> or to the last gasp, for diversion,
                    are frequently compared, and with much propriety, to gladiators. Hence Pliny’s
                    expression, <hi rend="italic">gallorum, ceu gladiatorum;</hi> and that of
                    Columella, <hi rend="italic">rixosarum</hi><hi rend="italic">avium
                    lanistae;</hi><hi rend="italic">lanista</hi> being the proper term for the
                    master of the gladiators. Consequently one would expect, that when the bloody
                    scenes of the amphitheatre <pb break="no" facs="nls:194747441"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-7441-0015"/>were discarded, as happened soon after the
                    Christian religion became the establishment of the empire, the wanton shedding
                    of men’s blood in sport being of too cruel and savage a nature to be patronised
                    and encouraged under such a humane dispensation, one might have expected that
                    the ogrüyoµawa and the αλ5%r^υ&lt;⅛u∙αwα would also have ceased. The fathers of
                    the church are continually inveighing against the spectacles of the arena, and
                    upbraiding their adversaries with these, which, indeed, were more unnatural and
                    shocking than a main of cocks; but the latter had a tendency towards infusing
                    the like ferocity and implacability into the dispositions of men. Besides, this
                    mode of diversion has been in fact the bane and destruction of thousands here,
                    as well as of those <hi rend="italic">lanistae</hi><hi rend="italic">avium,</hi>
                    “cock-feeders,” mentioned by Columella, whose patrimonial fortunes were totally
                    dissipated and destroyed by it.</p>
                <p>The cock is not only a useful animal, but stately in his figure, and magnificent
                    in his plumage. “Imperitant suo generi,” says Pliny, “et regnum in quacunque
                    sunt domo, exercent.” Aristophanes compares the cock to the king of Persia; most
                    authors also take notice of the “spectatissimum insigne, serratum, quod eorum
                    verticem regiae coronae modo exornat.” His tenderness towards his brood is such,
                    that, contrary to the custom of many other males, he will scratch and provide
                    for them with an assiduity almost equal to that of the hen; and his generosity
                    is so great, that on finding a hoard of meat, he will chuckle the liens
                    together, and, without touching one bit himself, will relinquish the whole of it
                    to them. He was called <hi rend="italic">the bird, ×ar iζo∙χr</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">v,</hi> by many of the
                    ancients; he was highly esteemed in some countries, and .in others was even held
                    sacred, insomuch that one cannot but regret that a creature so useful and noble
                    should, by a strange fatality, be so enormously abused by us. It is true, our
                    αλsκ-guoμαwα, or the massacre of Shrove Tuesday, is now fast declining, and in a
                    few years, it is to be hoped, will be totally disused; but the cock-pit still
                    continues a reproach to the humanity of Englishmen, and to their religion, the
                    purest, the tenderest, and most compassionate of all, not excepting even the
                    Brahminical.</p>
                <p>It is unknown when the pitched battle first entered England, but it was probably
                    brought hither by the Romans. This bird existed here before Caesar’s arrival,
                    but no notice of his fighting occurs earlier than the time of William
                    Fitz-Stephen, who wrote the life of Archbishop Becket, in the reign of Henry IL,
                    and describes cocking as a sport of school-boys on Shrove Tuesday. From this
                    time at least the diversion, however absurd, and even impious, was continued
                    amongst us. It was followed, though disapproved and prohibited by the 39 Edward
                    III.; also in the reign of Henry VIII., and afterwards in the year 1569. It has
                    by some been called a <hi rend="italic">royal diversion</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and, as every one knows, the cock-pit at Whitehall was erected by a
                    crowned head,'for the more magnificent celebration of it. There was another pit
                    in Drury Lane, and a third in Javin Street. It was prohibited, however, by one
                    of Oliver’s acts, 31st March 1664. What aggravates the reproach and disgrace are
                    those species of fighting which are called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >battle-royal</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Welsh-main,</hi> known nowhere in
                    the world but there; neither in China, nor in Persia, nor in Malacca, nor among
                    the savage tribes in America. These are scenes so bloody as almost to be too
                    shocking to relate; and yet, as many may not be acquainted with the nature of
                    them, it may be proper, for exciting aversion and detestation, to describe them
                    in a few words. In the former an unlimited number of fowls are pitted, and when
                    they have slaughtered one another for the diversion of the lookers-on, the
                    single surviving bird is esteemed the victor, and carries away the prize.</p>
                <p>The Welsh-main consists, we shall suppose, of sixteen pairs of cocks; of these,
                    the sixteen conquerors are pitted a second time, the eight conquerors of these
                    are pitted a third time; the four conquerors the fourth time, and, lastly, the
                    two conquerors of these are pitted the fifth time; so that thirty-one cocks are
                    sure to be murdered for sport and pleasure.</p>
