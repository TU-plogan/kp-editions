                    physician who was an ornament to his profession, was born of a respectable
                    family in the south of Scotland. His father was the minister of the parish of
                    Kirkpatrick Fleming, near Moffat, in Dumfriesshire; and his mother, Jean Boyd, a
                    woman of very superior understanding, was descended from the ancient family of
                    Kilmarnock. They had six daughters, and an only son, the subject of the present
                    article, who was born on the 31st of May 1756. Soon after this period, Mr Currie
                    removed with his family to Middlebie, a parish to the living of which he had
                    been preferred, and where he settled for the remainder of his life. He had here
                    the misfortune to lose his wife, who died of a consumption, whilst her family
                    were yet in early childhood; but the benevolent exertions of Miss Christina
                    Duncan, a half sister of Mrs Currie, who undertook the management of their
                    education, and the care of the household, and who performed <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754461" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4461-0553"/>towards them
                    all the duties of a mother with exemplary fidelity, compensated for a loss
                    which, under other circumstances, would have been irreparable. Under the
                    fostering care of this excellent person, young Currie was trained in the virtues
                    and estimable qualities which ever formed the distinguishing features of his
                    character.</p><p>He entered upon his grammatical education at the parochial school of Middlebie;
                    and was afterwards sent, at the age of thirteen, to a seminary at Dumfries, then
                    conducted by Dr Chapman, well known as the author of a work on education, and
                    under whose superintendence the school had justly acquired a high reputation. He
                    was fortunate in being admitted as a boarder into the house of the doctor; and
                    thus, in addition to the usual studies of the school, had the advantage of his
                    personal instructions in mathematics and in practical geometry.</p><p>The foundations of solid learning having thus been laid, young Currie was taken
                    by his father on a visit to sonic friends in Glasgow, where the spectacle of the
                    commercial activity so strikingly displayed in that flourishing city could
                    hardly fail to inspire his sanguine mind with a similar spirit of adventure;
                    and, relinquishing his original intention of qualifying himself for the medical
                    profession, he was induced, with the concurrence of his father, to engage in the
                    service of a company of merchants, who were going out on a speculation to
                    Virginia. Nothing could possibly be more unfortunate than this voyage, which
                    happened to be undertaken at a time when those dissensions that eventually led
                    to the separation of America from England were on the eve of breaking out, and
                    where the trade between the two countries became in consequence totally
                    interrupted. The treatment which Currie met with from the merchants with whom he
                    was connected, and who probably were soured by disappointment, was harsh and
                    ungenerous; and he had also to struggle with a long and dangerous illness which
                    seized him soon after his arrival. To complete the series of his misfortunes, he
                    also at this time lost his father, whose death at once bereft him of the only
                    friend in whose counsels he could confide, under the complicated difficulties of
                    his situation. But such is the spring inherent in the youthful mind, that the
                    depressing influence of those misfortunes which happen at an early period of
                    life is often merely temporary, and serves eventually to form a character of
                    energy which no other circumstances would have called forth. Having formed the
                    determination of trusting solely to his own exertions for his subsistence, he
                    generously divided among his sisters the scanty inheritance which had fallen to
                    his share. Renouncing the pursuits of commerce, with which he had been
                    completely sickened, he turned his attention to the political topics which were
                    then the universal subject of interest in America; and though convinced of the
                    impolitic conduct of the English government towards that country, he was
                    strenuous in maintaining the right it asserted of taxing the colonies. So warmly
                    did he espouse its cause, that he published a series of letters in its defence,
                    in an American newspaper, under the signature of “An Old Man.” These juvenile
                    essays, as far as he was known to be the author, procured him some reputation,
                    but at the same time necessarily exposed him to the ill-will of the adverse
                    party; and he began seriously to think of embracing some profession which might
                    raise him to that degree of independence to which he so honourably aspired. The
                    example and advice of a near relation, Dr Currie of Richmond, with whom he w ent
                    to reside, decided him in the choice of the profession of medicine, which, as we
                    have already mentioned, had been his original destination. Jt was therefore
                    settled that he should go to Edinburgh, and after taking his degree at that
                    university, that he should return to Virginia, with a view of practising at</p><p>Richmond; for it was confidently believed that the war would not be of any long
                    duration.</p><p>In pursuance of this plan he quitted America, where he had spent very
                    unprofitably five years of his life; and as the war had by this time
                    precluded’all direct communication with England, he proceeded thither by way of
                    the West Indies; and after a voyage, in which he underwent many hardships, and
                    was several times in imminent hazard of his life, arrived in London in 1776.
                    From thence he repaired to Edinburgh, and immediately began his academic
                    studies, which he prosecuted with unremitting assiduity and remarkable success
                    till the spring of 1780. He soon became conspicuous among the students by the
                    extent of his acquirements, and by the singular acuteness of his mind; and in
                    particular, he distinguished himself as a member of the Medical Society. The
                    papers which, according to custom, he contributed, bear the stamp of superior
                    talents, and are curious, as furnishing proofs that, even at this early period,
                    his attention had been actively directed to subjects which he afterwards
                    prosecuted with so much success, and illustrated by such important practical
                    discoveries.</p><p>But whatever might be the satisfaction he derived from the high reputation he was
                    acquiring at the university, the sense of his own dependence still weighed
                    heavily upon his mind, and created an anxious wish to possess the means of
                    supporting himself by some active professional employment, which might enable
                    him to relieve his aunt and sisters from the charge of maintaining him while
                    prosecuting his studies; a charge which, though it was afforded with the utmost
                    cheerfulness, he was sensible must occasion a serious diminution of their
                    comforts. Obstacles presented themselves in the way of every scheme that could
                    be devised; but he was not to be deterred by difficulties from the pursuit of an
                    object which he was eagerly bent upon obtaining; and the army affording the
                    readiest field of immediate advancement, he procured an introduction to General
                    Sir William Erskine, who gave him an ensigncy in his own regiment, with the
                    office of surgeon’s mate. He himself would have been contented with this humble
                    station; but his friends encouraged him to aim at a rank more consonant with his
                    abilities; and learning that a medical establishment was intended to be set on
                    foot for the ∙ service of the British army in Jamaica, they advised him to apply
                    for the appointment of physician or assistantphysician to the forces. One
                    requisite, however, was indispensable before he could even appear as candidate
                    for any office of that kind; namely, his having taken his degree. But the rules
                    of the University of Edinburgh precluded the possibility of his graduating
                    before the ensuing June, although he had studied the full period necessary for
                    that purpose. Fearful of missing the present opportunity of obtaining so
                    desirable an appointment, and knowing that no time was to be lost in making
                    application for it, he hastened to Glasgow, where he without difficulty procured
                    a degree, after complying with the customary forms. He now immediately entered
                    upon the arduous task of soliciting for the office which was the object of his
                    ambition; and after furnishing himself with numerous letters of recommendation,
                    and most ample and honourable testimonials from the professors of the
                    university, and the many friends whom his merit had procured him among his
                    fellow students, he proceeded to London. There he soon learned that the
                    appointment, for which he had taken such pains to qualify himself, was already
                    filled, having been given to a young Irish physician of considerable merit,
                    through the interest of Mr Surgeon-General Adair.</p><p>Though disappointed in his expectations of succeeding in the medical staff, he
                    still resolved to pursue his fortune in the West Indies, and to endeavour to
                    establish himself <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754474" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4474-0554"/>as physician in the island of Jamaica; a plan
                    which, in case of his failure there, would still admit of his proceeding to
                    Richmond, where he might ultimately settle, and have the advantage of being near
                    his friend and kinsman, who had promised to give him every assistance in the
                    commencement of his career. Dr Currie had already taken his passage on board a
                    ship which was expected soon to sail in company with a numerous fleet. This
                    fleet, however, happened to be detained for a considerable time, so that he
                    passed the greater part of the summer in London, and had thus an opportunity of
                    renewing his acquaintance with many of his college companions, and of mixing
                    with the society of the literary men in the metropolis, so well calculated to
                    draw forth, and so capable of appreciating talent. The superior abilities which
                    Dr Currie possessed were quickly discerned by those around him; and he was
                    strongly urged to abandon his plan of voluntary exile, and to endeavour to form
                    an establishment in some town in England, where his exertions might meet with an
                    adequate reward. With the diffidence which is usually attendant on real merit,
                    he was disposed at first to regard the prospects thus held out to him as little
                    likely to be ever realized; but the earnestness of his friends, and their
                    confident representation of the probability of his succeeding, gradually
                    inspired him with more sanguine views; and a severe illness which attacked him
                    whilst he was yet deliberating on his future plans, concurred in determining him
                    to relinquish, his design of crossing the Atlantic. After a long and painful
                    search for an eligible situation, during which he encountered many
                    disappointments, he at length repaired to Liverpool in October 1780, having
                    learned that a vacancy had occurred in the profession at that place, in
                    consequence of the removal of Dr Dobson to Bath.</p><p>No choice could be more fortunate for Dr Currie than that of a town which was so
                    rapidly increasing in opulence as Liverpool, of which the leading inhabitants
                    were distinguished for their enlarged and liberal views, and “where the society
                    afforded the most favourable field for the display of those excellent qualities,
                    both of a moral and intellectual nature, which adorned his character. On his
                    arrival he was unacquainted with a single individual, but by means of the
                    introductions which he brought with him, he soon became known to a great number
                    of respectable families, and ever rose in their esteem and regard in proportion
                    to the intimacy of their acquaintance with him. The suavity of his address, the
                    elegance and variety of his conversation, the strength and maturity of his
                    judgment, and the unaffected warmth of his benevolence, could not fail of
                    producing the most favourable impression on all who met him in society, and of
                    conciliating the attachment of those who enjoyed a more familiar intercourse.
                    His company was soon courted by all wļio had any relish for the acquirements of
                    literature, which in him derived a peculiar charm from the elegance of his
                    taste. Another talent, the result of a happy union of great natural sagacity
                    with quick feelings of sympathy, be possessed in a remarkable degree,—that of
                    inspiring the confidence and securing the attachment of his patients. His
                    success was now no longer doubtful. Gifted with the power of pleasing, and of
                    commanding respect, his skill was exerted to the best advantage. He was elected
                    one of the physicians to the infirmary, and soon rose to high eminence in his
                    profession. His domestic happiness was in the mean time secured by his marriage,
                    in 1783, with Miss Lucy Wallace, a lineal descendant of the Scottish patriot of
                    that name, and the daughter of a very respectable merchant in Liverpool.</p><p>Amidst the duties of an arduous profession, and the cares of a new establishment,
                    he found leisure for the cultivation of literature and science, a field
                    peculiarly suited to the exercise of his active and vigorous mind. Congeniality
                    of tastes and dispositions soon led to an intimacy between him and Mr Roscoe, a
                    name so well known in the republic of letters; and, in conjunction with the late
                    Mr William Rathbone, a gentleman distinguished by the excellence and high
                    integrity of his character, they laid the foundations of a literary club, which
                    deserves to be recorded as the first institution of the kind in Liverpool, and
                    as being the germ of those splendid literary establishments which have reflected
                    so much lustre on a town where the liberal and polite arts have flourished in
                    alliance with the exertions of commerce.</p><p>But the progress of Dr Currie, though it had commenced so auspiciously, was
                    unfortunately much retarded by ill health, which the fatiguing exertions he was
                    occasionally required to undergo tended considerably to aggravate. His assiduous
                    and anxious attendance on Dr Bell, an intimate friend of his who had settled in
                    Manchester, and who had been seized with a fatal disorder, together with the
                    frequent journeys which he was in consequence under the necessity of taking, in
                    the midst of winter, generally at night, and in addition to his other
                    professional labours, brought on a violent peripneumony, and placed his life for
                    some time in imminent danger. This was followed by a train of pulmonary
                    symptoms, which occurring in a frame already predisposed to consumption, a
                    disease that had been very fatal in his family, were of a highly alarming
                    nature. Experiencing, however, the good effects of carriage exercise, in
                    mitigating, and even preventing, the paroxysms of hectic fever, he determined
                    upon undertaking a journey of some length; and the climate of Bristol being in
                    repute for pulmonary complaints, he set out for that place in the middle of
                    April, and, travelling by easy stages, arrived at the beginning of May. During
                    the greater part of his journey his cough was severe, and he was obliged, in
                    general, to lie at length in the diagonal of the coach. The returns of hectic
                    were, however, rendered, by this mode of exercise, less regular and distinct
                    than they had been. At Bristol he experienced the shock of w itnessing the death
                    of one of his sisters. She had been lingering under the same fatal disorder,
                    which a year before had carried off another sister in her seventeenth year, and
                    which had by that time attacked a third sister, whose life, as well as his own,
                    there appeared little probability of preserving. Deriving no benefit from a
                    residence of a month at Bristol, he resolved to try the drier air of an inland
                    situation, and set out for Matlock, in Derbyshire. But here again his
                    expectations of relief were disappointed, and it appeared on reflection, that
                    continued exercise alone was capable of affording him any durable advantage. The
                    hopes of bidding adieu to his yet surviving sister, who was hastening rapidly to
                    the grave, conspired with this motive for travelling; and he again set out,
                    directing his course towards Scotland. The salutary influence of motion now
                    became more evident; and when he reached Dumfriesshire his strength was so far
                    recruited as to allow of his sitting on horseback for an hour together. But the
                    hope which had prompted his revisiting his native land was cruelly disappointed;
                    for, on the day on which he reached the end of his journey, the remains of his
                    sister had been committed to the grave. His fortitude, however, did not forsake
                    him, although so many victims to the disorder under which he laboured impressed
                    him strongly with the conviction that he himself was soon to experience a
                    similar fate. He persevered in taking exercise on horseback during a few weeks
                    that he resided at Moffat, gradually increasing the length of his rides in
                    proportion as his strength improved. As the progress of disease and debility
                    seemed to be arrested, the hope and <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754487" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4487-0555"/> the love of
                    life revived, and returning on horseback to Lancashire, by the lakes of
                    Cumberland, he arrived at Liverpool on the 1st of September, having rode the
                    last day of his journey forty miles. A very interesting narrative of his case,
                    and the means which he employed for his recovery, was drawn up by himself, and
                    is given by Dr Darwin in the second volume of his <hi rend="italic">Zoonomia.</hi></p><p>The first occupation to which he applied himself during his convalescence, was
                    prompted by a desire to do honour to the memory of his deceased friend Dr Bcll.
                    At the request of the members of the <hi rend="italic">Literary and
                    Philosophical Society of Manchester,</hi> he undertook a translation of the
                    inaugural dissertation of Dr Bell, “<hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Physiologia</hi><hi rend="italic">Plan-tarum”</hi>
                    which he accompanied with valuable notes, and to which he prefixed memoirs of
                    the author’s life. These were published by the society in the second volume of
                    their Transactions. The biographical sketch which he has there given, and which
                    was the first acknowledged production of his pen, is drawn up in a style of
                    peculiar neatness and elegance, and procured him considerable reputation as a
                    writer. The delineation of the character of Dr Bcll, in particular, which forms
                    the concluding part of his memoir, is executed with a bold and masterly hand,
                    and evinces a profound knowledge of the human heart. The failings as well as the
                    merits of his friend are traced with a delicate yet faithful pencil, exhibiting
                    a model of that manly candour, which seeksnot to extenuate faults by disguising
                    their extent, or concealing their pernicious tendency, but instructs us in the
                    sources from which they spring, the good qualities to which they are allied, and
                    the virtues with which they may be associated.</p><p>On being elected a member of the London Medical Society in 1790, he communicated
                    to it an essay on <hi rend="italic">Teta-ms and Convulsive Disorders,</hi> which
                    was published in the third volume of its Transactions. In 1791 he presented to
                    the Royal Society a paper containing <hi rend="italic">An account of the
                    remarhable effects of a shipwreck on the mariners, with experiments and
                    observations ωι the influence of. immersion in fresh and salt water, hot and
                    cold, on the powers of the living body,</hi> which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> of the same year; and soon
                    afterwards he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. The inquiries which
                    form the subject of this memoir were but a part of a long series of
                    investigations, in which he had been engaged for a considerable period, and
                    which had occupied him even when he was a student at the university. With a
                    keenness of observation peculiar to himself, we find him intent on the
                    collection of all the facts which bore upon the subject, and of which his
                    sagacity made him readily perceive the application. Imbued with the genuine
                    spirit of inductive philosophy, we find him proceeding with the caution of a
                    true disciple of Bacon, theorizing only when a sufficient foundation had been
                    laid for general deductions by an accurate and extensive observation of facts.
                    The more mature results of his experience and reflections were given to the
                    world in 1797, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Medical Reports on the
                    effects of water, cold and warm, as a remedy in Fever and other Diseases,
                    whether applied to the surface of the body or used internally</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a work by which his reputation as a physician was widely
                    extended, and which has effected a considerable revolution in the mode of
                    treating the most frequent and fatal of diseases. Few works, indeed, so strictly
                    medical, have met with so great a number of readers out of the profession; in
                    few do we find united, in such perfection, the graces of literature with the
                    severity of philosophical research. Dr Currie’s talent is particularly
                    conspicuous in his recital of the history of cases which fell under his
                    observation. He places every circumstance deserving attention in so clear a
                    light, and intersperses.his own reflections with such judgment and effect, that
                    we enter into all his reasonings without effort, and follow him through the
                    minute details of symptoms and of medical practice, not merely without fatigue,
                    but with a strong and increasing interest. The limits of the present article
                    will not admit of our entering into any exposition of the contents of this
                    valuable work, the fruit of so much experience and profound reflection; far less
                    of tracing the progress of his discoveries through all the generalizations which
                    they received from his penetrating and comprehensive mind. It maybe sufficient
                    to observe, that it will ever be held as a model of philosophical induction, in
                    a science where the application of such a method is attended with peculiar
                    difficulties; and that it has effected a very important improvement in the
                    treatment of febrile disorders, which are amongst the most universally
                    prevalent, and the most destructive to human life. The healing art is eminently
                    indebted to Dr Currie, for establishing on solid grounds the salutary agency of
                    cold applied to the surface of the body, under certain circumstances, and in
                    certain modes, both in fevers and in many convulsive diseases. The practice of
                    the cold affusion of water, or, in other cases, of cooling and moistening the
                    skin by means of a wet sponge, has, indeed, been attended with extraordinary
                    success; and although it had already been suggested, and even tried, by Dr
                    Wright, it was reserved for Dr Currie to determine the circumstances which
                    render its employment safe and salutary, and to point out the nature of its
                    operation, on clear and rational principles.</p><p>We have already seen the interest he took in the party discussions which agitated
                    the public in America at the commencement of its alienation from England, and
                    cannot, therefore, be surprised at the earnestness with which he viewed the
                    political concerns of his own country at so eventful a period of its history.
                    The first occasion on which he again obeyed the impulse of his feelings by the
                    publication of his sentiments, was during his residence in London, on the
                    occurrence of the disgraceful riots in St George’s Fields, excited by religious
                    fanaticism, and the cry of No Popery raised by Lord George Gordon. He wrote
                    three letters on the subject in the Public Advertiser, under the signature of
                    Caius: they were afterwards republished in a collection of political tracts.
                    These, as well as his writings in America, show that his earlier viervs of
                    politics were conformable to theprinciplesof thcToryparty, in favour of which
                    his education had given him an early bias. But in proportion as his experience
                    of the world increased, and his judgment acquired strength and maturity, his
                    solicitude for preserving the authority of those intrusted with power, which, in
                    these seasons of turbulence, seemed to be chiefly threatened, gave "place to a
                    deeper feeling of anxiety for the interests of the community at large, on whom
                    that power is exercised; and which, from the prejudices and passions inspired by
                    the course of events, and the war of anger into which we had recently been
                    plunged, appeared to him to be exposed to much greater danger. These sentiments
                    were strongly expressed in his <hi rend="italic">Letter, Commercial and
                    Political, addressed to the Right Honourable William Pitt,</hi> which he
                    published under the assumed name of <hi rend="italic">Jasper Wilson.</hi> The
                    mass of important information contained in this pamphlet, the enlarged and
                    profound views of political economy which it presented, and the nervous and
                    manly strain of eloquence in which they were enforced, attracted much attention;
                    it was read with avidity, and quickly went through several editions. The name of
                    its real author, although never publicly acknowledged by himself, could not long
                    remain concealed; and the reputation which accrued to Dr Currie from this
                    publication, in a limited circle of enlightened men, was gained at the expense
                    of much odium, which it <pb break="no" facs="nls:194754500" xml:id="kp-eb0707-4500-0556"/>entailed upon him from the opposite, and unhappily
                    more numerous party. A host of enemies, indeed, appeared in arms against him,
                    and he was assailed in various quarters with the coarsest and most illiberal
                    abuse. One writer amongst the number, apparently with the intention of doing him
                    irreparable injury, took the unwarrantable license of proclaiming him by name as
                    the author, and used all his endeavours to provoke him to reply. But Dr Currie
                    bore all the violence and malignity of these attacks with perfect evenness of
                    temper, mid abstained from gratifying his enemies, by engaging in a controversy
                    which he knew must be attended with certain detriment to his professional
                    interests, whilst it could add but little to the force of what he had already
                    published.</p><p>During an excursion which he made into Scotland in 1792, he had become personally
                    acquainted with Robert Burns, whom it was impossible to know without being
                    astonished at the glow of fancy, and fascinated by the social powers, displayed
                    by that brilliant and extraordinary genius. Dr Currie became an enthusiastic
                    admirer of those productions of his rustic muse which breathe the true spirit of
                    poetry, and will immortalize the dialect in which they are conveyed. The family
                    of this unfortunate man having been left nearly destitute at his death, a
                    subscription was set on foot in Scotland for their relief, and a design was
                    formed of publishing a complete edition of his works, for their exclusive
                    benefit. Knowing the warm interest which Dr Currie had taken in his fate, he was
                    strongly solicited by Mr Syme of Ryedalc, an old and intimate friend of the
                    doctor’s, to undertake the office of editor and biographer on this occasion, as
                    being the person in every respect best qualified for such a task. The request
                    was urged from so many quarters, that Dr Currie, however reluctant he felt to
                    engage in a work to the execution of which his multiplied avocations would prove
                    a serious obstacle, at length yielded to the opinion of his friends, and to his
                    own benevolent wishes in behalf of a distressed and deserving family.
                    Accordingly, in 1800, appeared, in four volumes 8vo, his edition of <hi rend="italic">The Works of Robert Burns, with an Account of his Life, and
                    Criticisms on his Writings</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">to
                    which are prefixed, some Observations on the Character and Condition of the
                    Scottish Peasantry.</hi> It is sufficient to say that they fully equalled the
                    high expectations which had been formed of them. The preliminary observations,
                    from the pen of Dr Currie, are marked with his usual felicity of manner, and
                    exhibit the same sagacity of remark, and liberality of sentiment, which pervade
                    all his writings. Dr Currie had also the still higher satisfaction of succeeding
                    in the object at which he had aimed, namely, that of securing, by his labours, a
                    provision for the widow and children of the poet, to whose genius he was raising
                    the monument it so well deserved.</p><p>His constitution had never completely recovered from the shock of the severe
                    illness which he had suffered in 1784. He was seldom long free from threatenings
                    of a return; but it was not till the year 1804 that his health began evidently
                    to decline. Notwithstanding he sought relaxation by revisiting his native
                    country, and enjoying the scenes where he had passed his early youth, the
                    alarming symptoms re-appeared on his return home, and he found it necessary in
                    the autumn to retire from the fatigues of his profession, and quit the climate
                    of Liverpool, where his loss, as may be well conceived, excited deep and
                    universal regret. He spent the ensuing winter alternately at Clifton and Bath,
                    and in March felt himself so much recovered that he ventured to take a house in
                    Bath and recommence the labours of his profession. From the extent to which his
                    practice very soon increased, there is no doubt that he would have been
                    eminently successful, if his convalescence had been permanent. But all his
                    complaints returning with new violence, he went, as a last resource, to
                    Sidmouth, where, after much suffering, which he bore with manly fortitude and
                    resignation, he expired <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> on the 31 st of August,
                    in the fiftieth year of his age. His disease was ascertained to be an
                    enlargement and flaccidity of the heart, accompanied with a remarkable wasting
                    of the left lung, without either tubercle or ulceration. Few men possessed a
                    more amiable or estimable character, or a more enlarged and cultivated mind,
                    than Dr Currie. His kind and affectionate disposition was conspicuous in all the
                    relations of social and domestic life, and endeared him to all around. As far as
                    his influence extended, few men have exerted more active and judicious
                    benevolence, or diffused more important benefits. Most of the public
                    institutions, literary and benevolent, of which Liverpool can boast, were
                    suggested, improved, or perfected by his advice and assistance. His political
                    views were guided always by a pure, and latterly by an enlightened patriotism.
                    His professional labours and discoveries are such as entitle him to an elevated
                    rank among medical philosophers; whilst the important improvement that has
                    resulted from them in the healing art, justifies us in enrolling his name
                    amongst the distinguished benefactors of mankind, (γ.)</p></div></body></text></TEI>
