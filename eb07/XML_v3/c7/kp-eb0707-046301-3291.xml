                    Mediterranean, situated between the 35th and 36th degrees of east longitude, and
                    between the 22d and 27th degrees of north latitude. The Cretan mythologists,
                    quoted by Diodorus Siculus, relate that the first inhabitants of the island were
                    the Dactyli Idaei, who dwelt around Mount Ida, and were regarded as magicians,
                    because they possessed a variety of knowledge, and were particularly skilled in
                    religious mysteries. Orpheus, who distinguished himself so highly in poetry and
                    music, was their disciple. They discovered the use of fire, iron, and brass, and
                    invented the art of working these metals in Berecynthius, a mountain near
                    Aptera. Those invaluable discoveries procured them divine honours. One of them,
                    named Hercules, rendered himself famous by his courage and exploits, and
                    instituted the Olympic games; though posterity, by a mistake, have ascribed that
                    institution to the son of Alemena, who, indeed, trocle in the footsteps of his
                    predecessor, and also raised himself to immortality.</p><p>The Dactyli Idaei were the ancestors of the Curetes. The latter originally
                    inhabited the forests and caves of the mountains; but they afterwards entered
                    into domestic life, and by their institutions contributed to the civilization of
                    mankind. They taught men to collect flocks of sheep, to tame wild animals for
                    domestic purposes, and to entice bees into hives, that they might rifle them of
                    the fruit of their labours; they first prompted men to the chase, and taught the
                    use of the bow; and they were the inventors of swords and of military dances.
                    The noise which they made, by dancing in armour, prevented Saturn from hearing
                    the cries of Jupiter, whose education Rhea had intrusted to them, and whom, with
                    the assistance of the nymphs, they brought up in a cave in Mount Ida, feeding
                    him with the milk of the goat Amalthea, and with honey.</p><p>To this period mythology assigns the origin of the Titans; their abode near
                    Gnossus, where stood the palace of Rhea; their travels over the whole earth;
                    their war against Ammon, and his defence by Bacchus; the nuptials of Jupiter and
                    Juno, celebrated near the river The-renus in Crete; and the gods, goddesses, and
                    heroes who descended from them.</p><p>Of these heroes the most illustrious were Minos and Rhadamanthus. They are said
                    to have been the sons of Jupiter and of Europa, who had been conveyed into the
                    ∣island on a bull. Minos having become king, built several cities; the most
                    considerable of which were Gnossus, on that side of the island which faces Asia,
                    Phoestus on the southern shore, and Cydon on the western side facing the
                    Peloponnesus. He gave to his subjects a code of admirable laws, which he
                    pretended to have received from his father Jupiter in the grotto of Mount
                    Ida.</p><p>i Rhadamanthus distinguished himself by the impartiality of his judgments, and by
                    the inflexible severity with which he inflicted punishment on the impious and
                    the wicked. His empire extended over the chief isles of the Archipelago; and the
                    inhabitants of the adjacent coasts of Asia submitted to him on account of his
                    high reputation for probity and justice. Mythologists ’ have constituted him
                    judge in the regions below, to determine the future state of the righteous and
                    the wicked: they have conferred on him the same honours which were bestowed on
                    Minos, the justest of kings.</p><p>Thus far have been followed the Cretan traditions as these are related by
                    Diodorus; but historians differ as to the degree of truth or probability which
                    they involve. There are a variety of opinions concerning the original
                    inhabitants of Crete. Strabo, who has discussed the sub-ect with great
                    erudition, says, “I am not fond of fables; yet I have detailed these at some
                    length, because they are connected with theology. Every discourse concerning the
                    gods should examine the religious opinions of antiquity, and distinguish them
                    from fable. The ancients were pleased to conceal their knowledge of nature under
                    a veil. It is now impossible to unfold the meaning of their enigmas. But by
                    exposing to light the numerous allegories which they have left us, and examining
                    attentively their mutual relations and differences, genius may perhaps be able
                    to unfold the truths which are couched under them.”</p><p>But leaving mythology for the more certain records and monuments of history, we
                    find that Crete received its name from Cres, the first of its monarchs, and the
                    author of several useful inventions, which contributed to the happiness of his
                    subjects. Prompted by gratitude, they endeavoured to perpetuate the memory of
                    his favours, and to immortalize his name, by naming the island after him. In
                    order to distinguish the true Cretans from strangers, they were named <hi rend="italic">Eteocretes.</hi> A number of colonies, from different parts of
                    Greece, settled in the island; the salubrity of the climate, and the fertility
                    of the soil, having induced them to fix their habitation there. The
                    Lacedaemonians, Argives, and Athenians, were the principal people who sent
                    colonies into Crete. “Crete,” says Homer, “is an extensive island in the midst
                    of the stormy main. The soil is rich and fertile. It contains an immense number
                    of inhabitants. It is adorned with a hundred cities. Its inhabitants speak in
                    various languages. We find there Achaeans, valiant Eteocretes, Cydonians,
                    Dorians, and godlike Pelasgians.” The Eteocretes inhabited the southern division
                    of the island, where they built the city of Proesus, and erected a temple to the
                    Dictaean Jove.</p><p>Cres was not the only monarch who reigned in the island of Crete. He had a series
                    of successors; but history affords little information concerning them. The names
                    of a few of them only are preserved, and a small number of events which happened
                    under the reign of others are related, but the latter are disfigured with an
                    intermixture of fable. Among these monarchs we find two of the name of Jupiter,
                    and two of that of Minos. However, most writers confound them, and ascribe to
                    one the transactions and exploits which should be shared between both.</p><p>This remark chiefly regards Minos, who was esteemed the wisest legislator of
                    antiquity. The office assigned him in the regions below is a certain proof of
                    his having gained an exalted reputation by his justice upon earth. Greece, says
                    Plato, has with great propriety adopted the laws of Crete; for they are founded
                    upon the solid basis of reason and equity, and have a natural tendency to render
                    the people who live in subjection to them opulent and happy. One of these laws
                    forbade the Cretans ever to carry their festivity so far as to intoxicate
                    themselves with wine. Another contained the following eminently conservative
                    provision: “Let young people not canvass the laws with an indiscreet curiosity;
                    let them not examine whether the lawgiver has done right or wrong in
                    promulgating them; but let them join unanimously in declaring them good, since
                    they proceed from the gods. If any of the old men perceive something in them
                    meriting amendment, let him mention it to the magistrate, or discuss it with his
                    equals, but never in the presence of the young people.” The Cretan code was
                    engraven on tablets of brass; and Talos, chief minister to Minos, visited all
                    the towns and cities in the island three times a year, to observe in what manner
                    the laws were executed and obeyed. The king of Crete, aware that an infusion of
                    the marvellous is useful in commanding the belief and enforcing the obedience of
                    the multitude, pretended that he had received those laws from his father
                    Jupiter, in the grotto of Mount Ida. In the same manner, Lycurgus, before
                    promulgating his laws, repaired to Delphi, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753304" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3304-0464"/>and gave out
                    that they had received the sanction of ' zYpollo. A like reason induced Numa to
                    pretend to an intimacy with the nymph Egeria, and Mahommed to ascribe his
                    doctrines and institutions to the revelation of the angel Gabriel.</p><p>In contradiction of this account, however, others of the ancients describe Minos
                    as a prince abandoned to the fury of his passions, and a barbarous conqueror.
                    Having fallen furiously in love with the nymph Dictynna, who refused to gratify
                    his wishes, he pursued her to the brink of the shore, and forced her to plunge
                    into the sea, where she was saved by some fishermen, who received’ her in their
                    nets. He was the first of the Greeks who appeared in the Mediterranean at the
                    head of a naval armament. He conquered the Cyclades, expelled the Carians,
                    established Cretan colonies in those islands, and committed the government of
                    them to his son.</p><p>Being informed, while he was at Paros, that his son Androgens was slain at
                    Athens, he declared war against Egeus, and imposed on him a disgraceful as well
                    as cruel tribute, from the payment of which Theseus delivered his country. He
                    took arms against Nisus, king of Megara; made him prisoner by the treachery of
                    his. daughter Scylla; and put him to death, together with Megarus, the son of
                    Hippomanes, who had brought some forces to his assistance. Daedalus, who had by
                    some means incurred his displeasure, despairing of pardon from so severe and
                    inflexible a prince, employed the resources of his inventive genius in order to
                    escape from his power. He fled to Sicily, gained the protection of King Cocalus,
                    and obtained an asylum in his court. Valerius Flaccus has described his flight
                    in a very lively and picturesque manner. “Thus Daedalus, with the wings of a
                    bird, ascended from Mount Ida. Beside him soared the comrade of his flight, with
                    shorter wings. They appeared like a cloud rising in the air. Minos, seeing his
                    vengeance thus eluded, glowed with impotent rage. In vain he followed with his
                    eyes the secure flight of his enemies through the wide expanse of heaven. His
                    guards returned to Gorty-nia with their quivers filled with arrows.” The Cretan
                    monarch did not, however, give up his prey. He equipped a fleet, pursued the
                    fugitive to Sicily, and fell before the walls of Camicum.</p><p>It is plain that these actions are unsuitable to the character of that just
                    monarch, whose merits raised him to the office of determining, in the regions
                    below, the unalterable fate of the righteous and the wicked. We may therefore
                    reasonably conclude that Minos the legislator was a different person from Minos
                    the conqueror; that it was the former who gained a lasting reputation by his
                    wisdom and justice; that, it was the latter who subdued most of the islands of
                    the Archipelago, but, being enslaved by his passions, tarnished his glory by
                    cruelty and a merciless thirst for vengeance.</p><p>The last king of Crete was Idomeneus. This prince, accompanied by Merion,
                    conducted twenty-four ships to the assistance of Agamemnon. Homer informs us of
                    the illustrious exploits by which he signalized himself before the walls of
                    Troy. At his departure he committed the government of his kingdom to Leucus, his
                    adopted son, promising him the hand of his daughter Clisithera if he governed
                    wisely in his absence. But that ambitious young man forgot the favours which had
                    been so lavishly bestowed on him; and having gained a number of partisans, he in
                    a short time aspired to the immediate possession of the crown. His impatience
                    would not wait till he should obtain it lawfully by marriage. Flattering
                    himself, from the long absence of the king, that he had perhaps fallen before
                    Troy, he determined to mount the throne. Mida, wife of Idomeneus, and the
                    princess Clisithera, were however obstacles to the gratification of his wishes.
                    But ambition knows no restraint, and tramples under foot the most sacred
                    obligations. This base wretch having seduced the people from their allegiance,
                    and captivated the affections of the nobles, sacrificed these unfortunate
                    victims in the temple. When Idomeneus, crowned with laurels, landed on the coast
                    of Crete, Leucus, who had now firmly established his power, attacked him with an
                    armed force, and obliged him to rcimbark. But a different account is given of
                    the banishment of Idomeneus. Servius says that he had vowed, in a storm, to
                    sacrifice to the gods the first person whom his eyes should behold on the Cretan
                    shore; that his son having met him first after his arrival, he fulfilled his vow
                    by sacrificing him; and that the island, being soon afterwards depopulated by
                    pestilence, the inhabitants looked upon that affliction as the effect of divine
                    vengeance, and expelled the parricide, who, having retired to Italy, founded
                    Salentum, on the Messapian coast. But this opinion appears to be entirely
                    groundless. History mentions no son of Idomeneus. If he had had a son of his own
                    blood, why did he adopt Leucus? Why did he trust to the latter the government of
                    the island, when he promised him his daughter in marriage? The more probable
                    opinion is, that the plague was introduced into the island by his ships, when he
                    returned from the siege of Troy; and that Leucus artfully made use of that
                    pretext to expel his lawful sovereign. This is the statement of Herodotus. But
                    it appears that the usurper did not long enjoy the fruit of his crimes. Soon
                    after the departure of Idomeneus, monarchy was abolished, and the government of
                    Crete became republican.</p><p>The Cretan government, soon after the expulsion of Idomeneus, became
                    aristocratical. The power was divided between the nobles and the people; yet as
                    the chief employments were occupied by the nobles, they directed the
                    administration of affairs. Ten magistrates were annually elected, by a majority
                    of voices, in the national assembly. They were named <hi rend="italic">cosmoi,</hi> and their public office and character were nearly the same with
                    those of the ephori at Sparta. They were the generals of the republic in time of
                    war, and directed all affairs of importance. They had the right of choosing
                    certain old men as counsellors. The latter, to the number of twenty-eight,
                    composed the Cretan senate. They were chosen from among those who had discharged
                    the office of cosmoi, or had distinguished, themselves by extraordinary merit
                    and blameless probity; and they continued in office during life, possessed a
                    weighty influence, and were consulted in every affair of importance. This body
                    formed a barrier which the wisdom of the legislator had opposed against the
                    ambition of the ten chief rulers. Another restraint was imposed on their power,
                    by limiting the period of their administration to one year; and as the suffrages
                    of the people might be obtained by bribery or personal influence, and of
                    consequence their choice might sometimes .fall on a man unworthy of so
                    honourable an office, it was provided that he who had been undeservedly advanced
                    to the dignity of cosmos should be degraded, either in a national assembly, or
                    simply by the voices of his colleagues. This, no doubt, is what Plato alludes to
                    when he says, “Neither the commonwealth, which approaches too near to a
                    monarchical constitution, nor that which affects a licentious liberty, is
                    founded on the solid basis of a just medium between anarchy and despotism. The
                    Cretans and Lacedaemonians, by establishing. theirs on firmer foundations,
                    avoided those fatal extremes.”</p><p>Such were the distribution of power and the administration of public affairs in
                    the Cretan government. Its simplicity was admirable. A people who were blessed
                    with the sacred enjoyment of liberty, but who possessed not sufficient knowledge
                    and discernment to direct themselves, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194753317" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3317-0465"/>elected
                    magistrates, to whom they delegated their ' authority. These magistrates, thus
                    clothed with sovereign authority, chose senators to assist and direct their
                    deliberations. But these counsellors could neither enact nor decide of
                    themselves; they held their office for life, and that circumstance contributed
                    to strengthen their influence and to increase their experience. The magistrates
                    were animated by the most powerful nſotives to distinguish themselves, when in
                    office, by unwearied activity in the public service. On one side they were
                    restrained by the fear of degradation; and on the other, actuated by the hope of
                    becoming one day members of the national council.</p><p>All the Cretans were subjected to the power of the magistrates, and divided into
                    two classes, the adults and the youth. Men arrived at maturity were admitted
                    into the first class. The second consisted of all the young men who were not
                    below the age of seventeen. The society of adults ate together in public halls.
                    There rulers, magistrates, poor and rich, seated together, partook, without
                    distinction, of the same simple fare. A large bowl, filled with wine and water,
                    which went round the company from one to another, was the only drink which they
                    were allowed. None but the old men had a right to call for more wine. A woman
                    was appointed to preside at each table; a circumstance which of itself indicates
                    a great advance in civilization; and in this capacity she openly distributed the
                    most exquisite meats to those who had distinguished themselves by their valour
                    or wisdom. This preference was so far from exciting envy or jealousy, that it
                    only prompted every person to deserve it by brave and prudent conduct. Near
                    where the citizens sat, two tables were laid, which they named <hi rend="italic">Hospitable,</hi> and where all strangers and travellers were entertained; and
                    there was also a particular house set apart by the ’public, in which they might
                    spend the night.</p><p>To supply the public expenses, every citizen was obliged to bring a tenth part of
                    his annual income into the treasury; and it was the duty of the chief
                    magistrates to take care that every person contributed his proportion. In Crete,
                    says Aristotle, one part of the fruits of the earth, of the produce of the
                    flocks, of the revenues of the state, and of the taxes and customs, is sacred to
                    the gods, and the other is distributed among the members of the community; so
                    that men, women, and children, all subsist at the public expense.</p><p>After dinner, the magistratesand senators usually spent some time in deliberating
                    on the affairs of the state; they next recounted the noble deeds which had been
                    done in war, celebrated the courage of their most distinguished warriors, and
                    animated the youth to heroic valour. These assemblies were the first school of
                    the youth. At the age ∣ of seven, the boy was permitted to handle the bow; and
                    from that time he was admitted into the society of the adults, where he
                    continued till the age of seventeen. There, sitting on the ground, and clothed
                    in a plain and coarse dress, he served the old men, and listened, with
                    respectful silence, to their admonitions. His young heart was inflamed by the
                    recital of noble deeds in arms, and glowed with ardour to imitate them; he
                    acquired habits of sobriety and temperance; and being constantly witness of
                    illustrious examples of moderation, wisdom, and patriotism, the seeds of virtue
                    were thus sown and fostered in his heart before he attained the full use of
                    reason.</p><p>He was early accustomed to arms and to fatigue, that he might learn to endure
                    excessive heat or cold, to 'clamber and leap among hills and precipices, and to
                    bear manfully the blows and wounds which he might receive amid the gymnastic
                    exercises or in battle. But his education was not confined to the gymnastic
                    exercises; he was also taught to sing the laws, which were written in verse,
                    with a certain species of melody, in order that the charms of music might
                    dispose him to learn them with more pleasure, and might impress them more deeply
                    on his heart, and that, if he should ever transgress them, he might not have the
                    excuse of ignorance to offer. He next learned hymns in honour of the gods, and
                    poems composed in praise of heroes. When he reached his seventeenth year, he
                    retired from the society of the adults, and became a member of that of the young
                    men.</p><p>But here his education was still carried on. He exercised himself in hunting,
                    wrestling, and fighting with his companions. Martial music was played on the
                    lyre; and he learned to follow exactly the sounds and measure of the musician.
                    Those sports and exercises were attended with danger, because arms of steel were
                    sometimes used in them. One dance, in which the youth aspired most ardently to
                    excel, was the Pyrrhic, originally invented in Crete. The performers in that
                    dance were arrayed in complete armour; they wore a light short coat, which did
                    not fall below the knee, and was bound with a girdle round the waist; on their
                    feet and legs were buskins; in their hands they bore their arms, and performed
                    various military evolutions to the sound of musical instruments. “The
                    Lacedaemonians and Cretans,” says Libanius, “cultivated dancing with amazing
                    ardour; they considered that tlíċir laws had directed them to practise it for
                    the most important purposes; and it was scarcely less dishonourable for a
                    Lacedaemonian or Cretan to neglect the military dance, than to desert his post
                    in battle.”</p><p>Those Cretans who were opulent and high born'were permitted to form societies of
                    young men of their own age; and they often strove with emulation who should form
                    the most numerous ones. The father of the young man who formed one of those
                    societies usually presided in it; and he had a right to educate the warlike
                    youth, to exercise them in running and in hunting, and to confer rewards and
                    inflict punishments.</p><p>Friendship was held in high estimation among the Cretans; but according to
                    Strabo, the manner in which they conducted the intercourse of friendship was
                    somewhat extraordinary. Instead of mild persuasion, they made use of violence to
                    gain the objects of their affections. He who conceived an affection for a young
                    man of his own age, and wished to attach him to himself by indissoluble bonds,
                    formed a scheme for carrying him off by violence. Three days before putting it
                    into execution he communicated it to his comrades. They could not then interfere
                    to prevent it, because if they had, they would have appeared to think the young
                    man unworthy of such an excessive attachment. At the appointed day they
                    assembled to protect their companion. If the ravisher appeared to them not
                    unworthy of the object of his affection, they made at first a faint resistance
                    in obedience to the law, but at last joyfully favoured his enterprise; if, on
                    the other hand, they thought him unworthy of the object of his choice, they made
                    such resistance as to prevent him from executing his design. The feigned
                    resistance continued till the ravisher had conducted his friend into the hall of
                    that society to which he belonged. They did not regard him who possessed
                    superior beauty and gracefulness of person as the most amiable, but him who had
                    most distinguished himself by his modesty and valour.</p><p>When the youth had finished their exercises, and attained the legal age, they
                    became members of the class of adults; being then considered as men, they were
                    permitted to vote in the national assemblies, and were entitled to stand
                    candidates for any public office. They were then obliged to marry, but did not
                    take home their wives till such time as they were capable of managing their
                    domestic concerns.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:194753330" xml:id="kp-eb0707-3330-0466"/><p>“The legislator," says Strabo, “had considered liberty as the greatest blessing
                    that cities can enjoy. Liberty alone can secure the property of the citizens of
                    any state. Slavery either robs them of it, or renders it precarious. The first
                    care of nations should therefore be to preserve their liberty. Concord
                    strengthens and supports her empire; she flourishes wherever the seeds of
                    dissension are extinguished. Almost all those hostilities which prevail among
                    nations or individuals spring either from an inordinate desire of wealth or the
                    love of luxury. Introduce, instead of those baneful principles, frugality,
                    moderation, and equality of conditions; you will thus banish envy, hatred,
                    injustice, and haughty disdain.” This was what the Cretan lawgiver happily
                    effected; and the community which was regulated by his wise institutions rose to
                    glory, opulence, and power, and was honoured with the panegyrics of the most
                    celebrated philosophers of Greece; but the highest honour it ever obtained was
                    that of serving Lycurgus as a model for the admirable form of government which
                    he established at Sparta.</p><p>Nations are effaced from the earth like the monuments of their power, and after
                    the revolution of ages we can scarcely trace in their posterity any remains of
                    their ancient character. Some of them exist longer, others shorter; but we may
                    almost always calculate the period of their duration by the excellence of their
                    laws, and the fidelity with which they support and obey them. The republic of
                    Crete, being established on a solid basis, knew no foreign master for a period
                    of ten centuries, and bravely repelled the attacks of those princes who
                    attempted to enslave it. At length the time arrived when the warlike and
                    victorious Romans aspired to the empire of the world, and would suffer none but
                    subjects or slaves to exist within the reach of their arms. Florus does not
                    scruple to acknowledge that the Romans had no other motive for invading Crete
                    but the ambitious desire of subduing the renowned native country of Jupiter. If
                    any person wished to know the reason which induced us to attack Crete, says he,
                    the true reason was our desire to subdue so celebrated an island. The Cretans
                    had appeared to favour Mithridates, and the Romans thought proper to declare war
                    against them on that pretext. Marc Antony, father of the triumvir, attacked them
                    with strong hopes of success, but was severely punished for his presumption and
                    imprudence. The Cretans took <hi rend="italic">a</hi> great part of his fleet,
                    hung up his soldiers and sailors on the masts amid the sails and cordage, and
                    returned in triumph into their harbours.</p><p>The Romans never forgot nor forgave a defeat. As soon as the Macedonian war had
                    been brought to a conclusion, they again took arms against the Cretans, in order
                    to revenge their ignominy and loss. Quintus Metellus was sent to Crete with a
                    powerful armament, but met with an obstinate and vigorous resistance. Panarus
                    and Lasthenes, two experienced leaders, collecting a body of twenty thousand
                    young warriors, all eager for battle, and of determined courage, employed their
                    arms and arrows successfully against the Romans, and protracted the fate of
                    Crete for three years. The conquerors could not make themselves masters of the
                    island without destroying its bravest warriors. They lost a great number of
                    tropps, and bought a bloody victory at the price of many a danger and much
                    fatigue. However, their usual good fortune at length prevailed; and the first
                    care of the conqueror was to abolish the laws of Minos, and to substitute those
                    of Numa. Strabo complains of this act of severity, and informs us, that in his
                    days the original laws of Crete were no longer in force, because the Romans
                    compelled the conquered provinces to adopt their civil code.</p><p>The island of Crete, united with the small kingdom of Cyrene, on the Libyan
                    coast, formed a Roman province, which was at first governed by a proconsul; but
                    a questor and an assistant were afterwards sent there, and at last, as Suetonius
                    informs us, it was put under the government of a consul. This island was one of
                    the first places in the world which were favoured with the light of the gospel.
                    St Paul introduced the Christian faith into Crete; and his disciple Titus, whom
                    he left there·to cherish and cultivate that precious plant, became the first
                    bishop of the island. In the reign of the emperor Leo it had twelve bishops, who
                    were all subject to the patriarch of Constantinople. Constantine separated Crete
                    from Cyrene in the new division which he made of the provinces of the empire;
                    and, in the distribution of territory among his three sons, this island,
                    together with Africa and Illyria, fell to the share of Constans.</p><p>When Michael Balbus sat on the throne of Constantinople, the rebellion of Thomas,
                    which lasted three years, caused him to neglect the other parts of the empire.
                    The Agarenians, a people of Arabia, who had conquered the finest provinces of
                    Spain, seized that opportunity, and having fitted ont a considerable fleet,
                    plundered the Cyclades, attacked the island of Crete, and made themselves
                    masters of it without opposition. In order to secure their conquest, they built
                    a fortress, which they named <hi rend="italic">hhan∙ dak,</hi> or intrenchment;
                    and from it the barbarians made inroads into the interior parts of the island,
                    carrying havock and devastation wherever they appeared. By repeated attacks they
                    subdued all the cities in Crete except Cydon. The emperor Michael made some
                    ineffectual efforts to expel them from Crete. Nor was the emperor Basilius the
                    Macedonian more successful. The barbarians defeated him in a bloody battle; but
                    being afterwards vanquished by one of hia ge'ιerals, they were subjected to the
                    payment of an annual tribute. At the end of ten years, the Arabians refused the
                    tribute. It was reserved for Nicephorus Phocas, who afterwards became emperor,
                    to deliver this fine island from the yoke of the infidels. He landed with a
                    numerous army, and having boldly attacked them, routed them in various
                    engagements; so that the Saracens, no longer daring to meet so formidable a
                    general in the field, fled for protection to their fortresses. But Phocas being
                    plentifully supplied with all the warlike machines necessary for a siege,
                    levelled their walls, took their cities and fortresses, and drove them into
                    Khandak. In the course of nine months he subdued the whole island, took their
                    king Curup and his lieutenant Aremas prisoners, and reunited to the empire a
                    province which had been a hundred and twenty-seven years in the hands of the
                    infidels. Crete remained under the dominion of the Romans until the time when
                    Baldwin, count of Flanders, being raised to the throne, liberally rewarded the
                    services of Boniface, marquis of Montferrat, by making him king of Thessalonica,
                    and adding this island to his dominions. But that lord, being more covetous of
                    gold than of glory, sold it in the year 1194 to the Venetians, under whom it
                    assumed the name of <hi rend="italic">Candia.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
