                <p><label type="entry">CONGREVE, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, a
                    younger brother of an ancient family in Staffordshire. His father was employed
                    in the stewardship of the great estate of the Earl of Burlington in Ireland,
                    where he resided many years, and where our author was born in the year 1672. Mr
                    Congreve, when he came to England, entered into the Middle Temple, and began to
                    study the law; but his bias was toward polite literature and poetry. His first
                    performance was a novel entitled <hi rend="italic">Incognita, or Love and Duty
                    reconciled.</hi> He soon afterwards began his comedy of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Old Bachelor,</hi> which was the amusement of some leisure hours during a slow
                    recovery from a fit of illness; yet was in itself so perfect, that Mr Dryden, on
                    its being shown to him, declared he had never in his life seen such a first
                    play. When brought on the stage in 1693, it met with such universal approbation
                    that Mr Congreve, although he was but nineteen years old at the time when he
                    wrote it, came to be considered as a prop of the declining stage, and a rising
                    genius in dramatic poetry. The next year he produced the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Double Dealer,</hi> which, for reasons which are not so obvious, did not meet
                    with so much success as the former. The merit of his first play, however, had
                    obtained him the favour and patronage of Lord Halifax, and some peculiar mark of
                    distinction from Queen Mary; on whose death, which happened in the close of this
                    year, he wrote a very elegant elegiac pastoral. In 1695, when Betterton opened
                    the new house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, Mr Congreve having joined him, produced
                    his comedy of <hi rend="italic">Love for Love,</hi> with which the company
                    opened their campaign, and which met with such success that they immediately
                    offered the author a share in the management of the house, on condition of his
                    furnishing them with one play yearly. This offer he accepted; but whether
                    through indolence, or from anxiety about correctness, which he looked upon as
                    necessary to his works, his <hi rend="italic">Mourning Bride</hi> did not appear
                    till 1697, nor his <hi rend="italic">Way of the World</hi> till two years
                    afterwards. The indifferent success which this last-mentioned play, though an
                    exceedingly good one, met with from the public, completed that disgust for the
                    theatre which a long contest with Jeremy Collier, who had attacked the
                    immoralities of the English stage, and more especially some of his pieces, had
                    begun to produce, and he determined never more to write for the stage. However,
                    though he quitted dramatic writing, he did not lay down the pen entirely, but
                    occasionally wrote many little pieces both in prose and verse, all of which have
                    been preserved as memorials of this celebrated dramatist. It is very possible,
                    however, that he might not so soon have given way to this disgust, had not the
                    easiness of his circumstances rendered any subservience to the opinions and
                    caprice of the town absolutely unnecessary to him; for his abilities having very
                    early in life raised him to the acquaintance of the Earl of Halifax, who was
                    then the Mecaenas of the age, that nobleman, desirous of raising so promising a
                    genius above the necessity of too hasty productions, made him one of the
                    commissioners for licensing hackney coaches, or, according to Coxeter, a
                    commissioner of the wine license. Lord Halifax also bestowed on him a place in
                    the pipe office, and not long afterwards gave him a post in the customs worth
                    L.600 per annum, while, in the year 1718, he was appointed secretary of Jamaica;
                    so that his income, towards the latter part of his life, was upwards of L.1200 a
                    year.</p>
                <p>The greater part of the last twenty years of his life was spent in ease and
                    retirement; and he either ceased, or affected not to give himself any trouble
                    about reputation.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:194750093" xml:id="kp-eb0707-0093-0217"/>
                <p>Yet this conduct might in part proceed from a degree of pride; and T. Cibber, in
                    his Lives of the Poets, relates the following anecdote of him: “When the
                    celebrated Voltaire was in England, he waited upon Mr Cöngreve, and passed some
                    compliments upon the merit and reputation of his works. Congreve thanked him,
                    but at the same time told that ingenious foreigner, that he did not choose to be
                    considered as an author, but only as a private gentleman, and in that light
                    expected to be visited. Voltaire answered, that if he had never been any thing
                    but a private gentleman, in all probability he had never been troubled with that
                    visit.” He observes, in his own account of the transaction, that he was not a
                    little disgusted with so unseasonable a piece of vanity.</p>
                <p>Towards the close of his life he was much afflicted with gout; and, making a tour
                    to Bath for the benefit of the waters, he was unfortunately overturned in his
                    chariot, by which it is supposed he got some inward bruise, as he ever after
                    complained of a pain in his side, and, on his return to London, continued
                    gradually declining in his health, till the 19th of January 1729, when he died,
                    at the age of fifty-seven. On the 26th of the same month, he was buried in
                    Westminster Abbey, the pall being supported by persons of the first
                    distinction.</p>
                <p>“Congreve,” says Dr Johnson, “has merit of the highest kind. He is an original
                    writer, who borrowed neither the models of his plot, nor the manner of his
                    dialogue. He formed a peculiar idea of comic excellence, which he supposed to
                    consist in gay remarks and unexpected answers; but that which he endeavoured, he
                    seldom failed of performing. His scenes exhibit not much of humour, imagery, or
                    passion; his personages are a kind of intellectual gladiators; every sentence is
                    to ward or to strike; the contest of smartness is never intermitted; his wit is
                    a meteor playing to and fro with alternate coruscations. His comedies have
                    therefore, in some degree, the operation of tragedies; they surprise rather than
                    divert, and raise admiration oftener than merriment. But they are the works of a
                    mind replete with images, and quick in combination.” It may be added, that their
                    licentiousness and immorality have been severely but justly censured. Of
                    Congreve’s miscellaneous poetry nothing favourable can be said. His powers seem
                    to desert him when he leaves the stage, and he becomes feeble, impotent, and
                    dull, without elevation of fancy, selection of language, or skill in
                    versification.</p>
                <p>There is an elegant edition of his works, in three volumes 8vo, printed by
                    Baskerville in 176L</p>
