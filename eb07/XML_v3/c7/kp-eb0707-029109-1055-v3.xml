                <p><label type="entry">CONSUL</label>, the chief magistrate of the Roman
                    common-wealth, invested with the regal authority for the space of one year. They
                    were two in number, called consuls, <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >consulendo,</hi> and annually chosen in the Campus Martius. The two first
                    consuls were L. Junius Brutus and L. Tarquinius Collatinus, who were chosen in
                    the year of Rome 244, immediately after the expulsion of the Tarquins. In the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194751068" xml:id="kp-eb0707-1068-0292"/>first times of
                    the republic, the two consuls were always chosen from patrician families or
                    noblemen; but, in the year of Rome 388, the people obtained the privilege of
                    electing one of the consuls from their own body, and sometimes both were
                    plebeians. The first consul elected from among the plebeians was L. Sextius. It
                    was required that every candidate for the consulship should be forty-three years
                    of age, which was called <hi rend="italic">legitimum tempus.</hi> He was always
                    to appear at the election as a private man without retinue; atìd it was
                    requisite, before he canvassed for the office, to have discharged the functions
                    of quaestor, edile, and praetor. But these qualifications were sometimes
                    disregarded. Valerius Corvinus was made consul in his twenty-third year, and
                    Scipio in his twenty-fourth. Young Marius, Pompey, and Augustus, were also under
                    the proper age when they were invested with the office; and Pompey had never
                    been quaestor nor praetor. The power of the consuls was unbounded, and they knew
                    no superior except the gods and the laws; but after the expiration of their
                    office their conduct was minutely scrutinized by the people, and misbehaviour
                    was often punished by the laws. The badge of their office was the <hi
                    rend="italic">proetexta,</hi> a robe fringed with purple, afterwards exchanged
                    for the <hi rend="italic">toga</hi><hi rend="italic">picta</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">palmata.</hi> They were preceded by twelve lictors carrying the
                    <hi rend="italic">fasces</hi> or bundles of sticks, in the middle of which
                    appeared an axe. The axe, as be⅛g the characteristic rather of tyranny than of
                    freedom, was removed from the <hi rend="italic">fasces</hi> by Valerius
                    Poplicola; but it was restored by bis successor. By turns monthly they were
                    preceded by the lictors while at Rome, lest the appearance of two persons
                    invested with the badges of royal authority should raise apprehensions in the
                    multitude. While one appeared publicly in state, only a crier walked before the
                    other, and the lictors followed behind without the fasces. Their authority was
                    equal; yet the Valerian law gave the right of priority to the elder, and the
                    Julian law to him who had most children; and he was generally called <hi
                    rend="italic">consul major</hi> or <hi rend="italic">prior.</hi> As their power
                    was absolute, they presided over the senate, and could convene and dismiss it at
                    pleasure. The senators were their counsellors; and among the Romans the manner
                    of reckoning their year was by the name of the consuls; hence, by <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. Tull. Cicerone</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >L. Antonio</hi><hi rend="italic">Consulibus,</hi> for instance, the year of
                    Rome 689 was always understood. This custom lasted from the year of Rome 244
                    till 1294, or the 541st year of the Christian era. In public assemblies the
                    consuls sat in ivory chairs, and held in their hand an ivory wand called <hi
                    rend="italic">scipio eburneus,</hi> which had an eagle on its top as a sign of
                    dignity and power. When they had drawn by lot the provinces over which they were
                    to preside during their consulship, they went to the capitol to offer prayers to
                    the gods, and entreat them to protect the republic; after which they departed
                    from the city arrayed in their military dress, and preceded by the lictors.
                    Sometimes the provinces were assigned them without drawing lots, by the will and
                    appointment of the senators. At their departure they were provided by the state
                    with whatever was requisite during their expedition. In their provinces they
                    were both attended by the twelve lictors, and equally invested with regal
                    authority. They were not permitted to return to Rome without the special command
                    of the senate; and they always remained in the province till the arrival of
                    their successor. At their return they harangued the people, and solemnly
                    protested that they had done nothing against the laws or interest of their
                    country, but had faithfully and diligently endeavoured to promote the greatness
                    and welfare of the state. No man could be consul for two years successively; yet
                    this institution was sometimes broken, and we find Marius, after the expiration
                    of his office, re-elected consul during the Cimbrian war. The office of consul,
                    so dignified during the times of the commonwealth, became a mere title under the
                    emperors, and retained nothing of its authority but the useless ensigns of
                    original dignity. Even the duration of the office, which was orginally annual,
                    was reduced to two or three months by Julius Caesar; but they who were admitted
                    on the first of January denominated the year, and were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ordinarii.</hi> Their successors during the year were distinguished by the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">suffecti.</hi> Tiberius and Claudius abridged the time of
                    the consulship; and the Emperor Commodus made no less than twenty-five consuls
                    in one year. Constantine the Great renewed the original institution, and
                    permitted them to remain a whole year in office.</p>
