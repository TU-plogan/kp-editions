                <p><label type="entry">NANTES</label>, a city of France, the capital of the
                    arrondissement of the same name, in the department of the Lower Loire. It is one
                    of the principal sea-ports of the kingdom, and owes much of its importance to
                    its local situation. It stands in a fine country on the right bank of the river
                    Loire, about thirty miles from its mouth, and opposite to the point where the
                    river Sèvre falls into that stream. The entrance to the Loire is very dangerous,
                    on account of the many sunken rocks near its mouth. Of these, the most
                    remarkable are, Le Turque, uncovered at low water; La Couronne, a most dangerous
                    reef, having ten fathoms of water close to it; and the Lamborde, a rock level
                    with the water at low spring tides. These are all on the north-west side of the
                    entrance; but on the southwest side the dangers to be avoided are, the Leven, a
                    rock nearly covered at half tide; Pierre Percée, an islet, elevated about thirty
                    feet above low water; the Bague-nard, another rock nearly covered at half tide,
                    upon which a bank of sand is visible; the Grand Charpentier, Petit Charpentier,
                    and La Vieille, three rocks of nearly equal height, and even with the sea at
                    neap tides; and Les Mo-rées and La Truye, appearing about eight feet above the
                    water at neap tides. The commercial importance of Nantes depends in a great
                    measure upon the length of the river Loire, which is nearly 500 miles, and the
                    means afforded, by the help of canals, which connect it with the Seine, the
                    Rhone, and the Soane, of conveying to its harbour a portion of the productions
                    of every department in France.</p>
                <p>The trade by sea is shown by the number and tonnage of vessels which entered the
                    port in the year 1831; the one being 3344, and the other 146,258 tons. Of the
                    foreign ships, seventeen were British, estimated at 1780 tons. The amount of
                    duty on exportation and importation, including that on salt, which is very
                    heavy, was, in 1831, 15,100,374 francs, or L.575,000; in 1832 it amounted to
                    13,907,400 francs, or L.522,000. Nantes is also a place of considerable
                    manufacturing industry. One of the most prominent branches is ship-building,
                    includin g thefabrica-tion of cables, cordage, sailcloth, and anchors, wit h
                    other articles made of iron. Weaving and spinning of woollen, linen, cotton, and
                    silk, occupy a great number of hands. Glass and earthen ware are also made, and
                    many hats, and much leather of all kinds. Sugar-mills, and other engines used in
                    the sugar colonies, are extensively prepared, and the refining of sugar is a
                    vast branch of trade. There are also many distilleries, in which the most
                    delicious cordials are prepared, and possess great celebrity.</p>
                <p>Nantes is finely situated on the banks of the river, some islands in which are
                    covered with houses. Though many of the buildings are old and not regular, some
                    are handsome, especially in the parts recently erected. <hi rend="italic"
                    >„The</hi> fortifications have been destroyed, and are now formed into fine
                    promenades. The river, which is very wide, is crossed by a succession of bridges
                    connecting the five islands, and the passage over them is nearly three miles.
                    The city has seventeen churches, and several other public buildings, amongst
                    which is the cathedral built in the Gothic style. There is a university, a
                    lyceum, an anatomical and naval school, a public library, a botanic garden, and
                    a cabinet of natural history. There is likewise a theatre. This place is
                    remarkable in history for the edict which gave freedom to Protestantism, and for
                    the horrible cruelties perpetrated in it during the Revolution, by means of the
                    <hi rend="italic">noyades.</hi> The city contains 87,500 inhabitants. The
                    arrondissement in which it is situated extends over 776 square miles, and is
                    divided into seventeen cantons, and sixty-seven communes, containing 205,627
                    inhabitants. Long. 1. 22. 44. W. Lat. 47. 13. N.</p>
