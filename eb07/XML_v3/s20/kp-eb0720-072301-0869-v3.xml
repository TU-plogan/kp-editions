                <p><label type="entry">STEWART, <hi rend="smallcaps">Matthew</hi></label>, D.D., an
                    eminent mathematician, was in 1717 born at Rothsay in the Isle of Bute, of which
                    parish his father was minister. Being intended for the church, he passed through
                    the usual course of a grammar-school education, and was in 1734 received as a
                    student into the university of Glasgow. There he had the happiness of having for
                    his preceptors in moral science and mathematics the celebrated professors
                    Hutcheson and Simson, by the latter of whom he was instructed in what may not
                    improperly be called the <hi rend="italic">arcana</hi> of the ancient
                    geometry.</p>
                <p>His views making it necessary for him to remove to Edinburgh, he was introduced
                    by Dr Simson to Mr Maclaurin, that his mathematical studies might suffer no
                    interruption; and he attended the lectures of that great master with such
                    advantage as might be expected from eminent abilities, directed by the judgment
                    of him who made the philosophy and geometry of Newton intelligible to ordinary
                    capacities. From his intimacy with Simson he had however acquired such a
                    predilection for the ancient geometry, as the modern analysis, however
                    powerfully recommended, could not lessen; and he kept up a regular
                    correspondence with his old master, giving him an account of his progress and
                    his discoveries in geometry, and receiving in return many curious communications
                    respecting the <hi rend="italic">Loci Plani,</hi> and the porisms of Euclid.</p>
                <p>While the second invention of porisms, to which more genius was perhaps required
                    than to the first discovery of them, employed Dr Simson, his pupil pursued the
                    same subject in a different and new direction. In doing so, he was led to the
                    discovery of those curious and interesting propositions which were published
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">General Theorems</hi> in 1746. They were
                    given without the demonstrations, but did not fail to place their discoverer at
                    once among the geometers of the first rank. They are for the most part porisms,
                    though Mr Stewart, careful not to anticipate the discoveries of his friend, gave
                    them no other name than that of theorems.</p>
                <p>Before this period he had entered the church, and through the patronage of the
                    Duke of Argyle and the Earl of Bute he obtained the living of Roseneath, a
                    retired country parish in the west of Scotland; but in 1747 he was elected to
                    the mathematical chair in the University of Edinburgh, which had become vacant
                    the year before by the death of Mr Maclaurin. The duties of this office gave a
                    turn somewhat different to his pursuits, and led him to think of the most simple
                    and elegant means of explaining those difficult propositions which were hitherto
                    only accessible to men deeply versed in the modern analysis. In doing this, he
                    was pursuing the object which of all others he most ardently wished to attain,
                    namely, the application of geometry to such problems as the algebraic calculus
                    alone had been thought able to resolve. His solution of Kepler’s problem was the
                    first specimen of this kind which he gave to the world; and it was impossible to
                    have produced one more to the credit of the method which he followed, or of the
                    abilities with which he applied it. On this problem the utmost resources of the
                    integral calculus had been employed. But though many excellent solutions had
                    been given, there was none of them at once direct in its method and simple in
                    its principles. Mr Stewart was so happy as to attain both these objects; and his
                    solution appeared in the second volume of the Essays of the Philosophical
                    Society of Edinburgh for the year 1756. In the first volume of the same
                    collection there are some other propositions of Mr Stewart’s, which are an
                    extension of a curious theorem in the fourth book of Pappus. They have a
                    relation to the subject of porisms, and one of them forms the ninety-first of Dr
                    Simson’s Restoration. They are besides very beautiful propositions, and are
                    demonstrated with all the elegance and simplicity of the ancient analysis.</p>
                <p>The prosecution of the plan which he had formed of introducing into the higher
                    parts of mixed mathematics the strict and simple form of ancient demonstration,
                    produced the Tracts Physical and Mathematical, which were published in 1761, and
                    the Essay on the Sun’s Distance, which was published in 1763. In this last work
                    it is acknowledged that he employed geometry on a task which geometry cannot
                    perform; but while it is granted that this determination of the sun’s distance
                    is by no means free from error, we may venture to affirm that it contains a
                    great deal which will always interest geometers, and will always be admired by
                    them. Few errors in science are redeemed by the display of so much ingenuity,
                    and, what is more singular, of so much sound reasoning. The investigation is
                    everywhere elegant, and will probably be long regarded as a specimen of the most
                    arduous inquiry which has been attempted by mere geometry.</p>
                <p>The Sun’s Distance was the last work which Dr Stewart published; and though he
                    lived to see several animadversions on it made public, he declined entering into
                    any controversy. His disposition was far from polemical; and he knew the value
                    of that quiet which a literary man should rarely suffer his antagonists to
                    interrupt. He used to say, that the decision of the point in question was now
                    before the public; that if his investigation was right it would never be
                    overturned, and that if it was wrong it ought not to be defended. A few months
                    before he published the essay just mentioned, he gave to the world another work,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Propositiones Geometrica more Veterum
                    demonstrata.</hi> This title, it is said, was given to it by Dr Simson, who
                    rejoiced in the publication of a work so well calculated to promote the study of
                    the ancient geometry. It consists of a series of geometrical theorems, for the
                    most part new; investigated first by an analysis, and afterwards synthetically
                    demonstrated by the inversion of the same analysis. Dr Stewart’s constant ιιse
                    of the geometrical analysis had put him in possession of many valuable
                    propositions which did not enter into the plan of any of the works that have
                    been enumerated. Of these not a few have found a place in the writings of Dr
                    Simson, where they will for ever remain to mark the friendship of these two
                    mathematicians, and to evince the esteem which Simson entertained for the
                    abilities of his pupil.</p>
                <p>Soon after the publication of the Sun’s Distance, Dr<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=870" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0870-0724"/>
                    Stewart’s health began to decline, and the duties of his office became
                    burdensome to him. In the year 1772 he retired to a small demesne which he
                    possessed in Ayrshire, where he afterwards spent the greater part of his life,
                    and never resumed his labours in the university. But though mathematics had now
                    ceased to be his business, they continued to be his amusement till a very few
                    years before his death, which happened on the 23d of January 1785, at the age of
                    sixty-eight.</p>
                <p>The habits of study, in a man of original genius, are objects of curiosity, and
                    deserve to be remembered. Concerning those of Dr Stewart, his writings have made
                    it necessary to remark, that from his youth he had been accustomed to the most
                    intense and continued application. In consequence of this application, added to
                    the natural vigour of his mind, he retained the memory of his discoveries in a
                    manner that will hardly be believed. He rarely wrote down any of his
                    investigations till it became necessary to do so for the purpose of publication.
                    When he discovered any proposition, he would put down the enunciation with great
                    accuracy, and on the same piece of paper would construct very neatly the figure
                    to which it referred. To these he trusted for recalling to his mind at any
                    future period the demonstration or the analysis, however complicated it might
                    be. Experience had taught him that he might place this confidence in himself
                    without any danger of disappointment; and for this singular power he was
                    probably more indebted to the activity of his invention than the mere
                    tenaciousness of his memory. Though he was extremely studious, he read few
                    books, and verified the observations of Μ. d’Alembert, that of all men of
                    letters, mathematicians read least of the writings of one another. His own
                    investigations occupied him sufficiently; and indeed the world would have had
                    reason to regret the misapplication of his talents, had he employed in the mere
                    acquisition of knowledge that time which he could dedicate to works of
                    invention.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stewart,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dugald,</hi> the illustrious
                    son of the eminent mathematician whose merits are recorded in the preceding
                    article, was born at Edinburgh on the 22d of November 1753. As a pupil in the
                    High School of his native city, he was remarkable for the command of language
                    exhibited in his exercises; and at college his turn for mental science began
                    unequivocally to develop itself. In his nineteenth year he attended at Glasgow a
                    course of lectures delivered by Dr Reid, of whose doctrines he was destined to
                    be the most distinguished amender and expounder. In the course of that winter he
                    composed, and read in a literary association, an essay on Dreaming, which
                    afterwards took its place as an interesting section in his principal work.</p>
                <p>But his youthful talents and acquirements were speedily subjected to a much more
                    decisive test. Soon after the period of his studies in Glasgow, he assumed, on
                    the decline of his father’s health, the sole charge of his classes in the
                    university of Edinburgh, and on the completion of his twenty-first year was
                    appointed to the mathematical professorship, as assistant and successor. His
                    popularity as a teacher in this department was remarkable; but when he was just
                    twenty-five years old, an opportunity was fortunately afforded him of proving
                    his qualifications for communicating knowledge in his favourite branch of
                    philosophy. Dr Ferguson, the professor of moral philosophy, having gone to
                    America on a public mission, Mr Stewart undertook to fill his place during the
                    session of 1778-9: he entered on the duties of the situation within a week after
                    having promised to discharge them; and for six months, besides teaching his two
                    mathematical classes and a new class of astronomy, he delivered a course of
                    lectures on ethics, thinking over every morning the subject of lecture for the
                    day, and addressed his pupils without having written the discourse or made any
                    further preparation. Those who then heard him considered his extemporaneous
                    lectures as possessing an energy and liveliness even exceeding that which
                    distinguished his later addresses. He was soon transferred permanently to the
                    post which he thus had temporarily filled; Dr Ferguson retiring in 1785, and Mr
                    Stewart, then thirty-two years old, being appointed to the chair of moral
                    philosophy in his room. While his fame as a lecturer rapidly spread all over
                    Great Britain, he long abstained from communicating his speculations to the
                    world in any more durable form. His earliest published work, the first volume of
                    his Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind, did not appear till 1792. In
                    1793 he published his Outlines of Moral Philosophy, an unpretending text-book,
                    but which exhibits his powers of generalization in the most favourable point of
                    view. During several subsequent years his only publications were, the life of Dr
                    Smith in 1793, that of Dr Robertson in 1796, and that of Dr Reid in 1802. These
                    lives appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. But, in
                    the mean time, among his pupils he numbered many of those young men whose
                    talents have since illustrated the northern division of the island; and, without
                    naming those who have shone in political or professional life, it is enough to
                    say that his Elements and his Lectures were the spark that first kindled the
                    metaphysical genius of his own successor. As early likewise as 1780, before his
                    first marriage, he had begun to receive into his family a few private pupils of
                    rank; and some years after his second marriage in 1790, he again opened his
                    house for the same purpose, and superintended the education of several who have
                    occupied a prominent place as British statesmen. His ready command over his own
                    mind was shown, not only by the ease with which he discharged the duties
                    involved in these various avocations, but by his adding to his former course of
                    instruction, in 1800, a series of lectures on Political Economy, which however
                    were not continued. Nor is it unimportant to add, that on several occasions when
                    his colleagues were incapacitated from acting, he temporarily gave lectures on
                    natural philosophy, logic, and rhetoric.</p>
                <p>In the winter of 1808-9, Mr Stewart, still in the zenith of his fame, but
                    suffering under ill health, and dejected by the recent loss of his younger son,
                    found himself obliged for a time to discharge the duties of his chair by deputy.
                    In the following session his indisposition was more prolonged; and, strongly
                    attached to private study, and sensitively alive to his reputation as a public
                    teacher, he resolved to retire altogether from active life. In May 1810, Dr
                    Thomas Brown, his late assistant, was in consequence conjoined with him as the
                    acting professor.</p>
                <p>After his retirement he lived constantly, as he had formerly done occasionally,
                    at Kinneill House, situated on the Firth of Forth, about twenty miles west from
                    Edinburgh. In this retreat he finished his volume of Philosophical Essays, which
                    was published in 1810, and attained very extensive popularity. The second volume
                    of his Elements of the Philosophy of the Human Mind appeared in 1813; and in the
                    end of 1815 that Dissertation on the Progress of Metaphysical and Ethical
                    Philosophy, which, originally written for the Supplement to this Encyclopaedia,
                    has now its place as the opening treatise of the present edition. He published
                    nothing further between that time and the year 1822, when he suffered a severe
                    stroke of palsy. But his mind was unshaken and untouched; and his compositions
                    after this time were as vigorous in every respect as those which had preceded.
                    The third volume of the Elements was published in 1827; and in 1828, a few weeks
                    only before his death, his view of the Active and Moral Powers of Man was given
                    to the world, in two volumes octavo. On the 11th of June 1828, he died at
                    Edinburgh, in the seventy-fifth year of his age, and was buried in the Canongate
                    churchyard. A monument to his memory, erected by his friends and admirers, and
