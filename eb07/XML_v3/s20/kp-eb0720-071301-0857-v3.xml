                    born in Dublin about the year 1676. One branch of the family was possessed of a
                    considerable estate in the county of Wexford. His father, a counsellor at law in
                    Dublin, was private secretary to James, Duke of Ormond; but he was of English
                    extraction; and his son, while very young, being carried to London, he put him
                    to school at the Charter-house, whence he was removed to Merton College in
                    Oxford. He left the university without taking any degree, in the full resolution
                    to enter into the army. This step was highly displeasing to his friends; but the
                    ardour of his passion for a military life rendered him deaf to any other
                    proposal. Not being able to procure a better station, he entered as a private
                    gentleman in the horse guards, notwithstanding he thus lust the succession to
                    his Irish estate. However, as he had a flow of good nature, a generous openness
                    and frankness of spirit, and a sparkling vivacity of wit, these qualities
                    rendered him the delight of the soldiery, and procured him an ensign’s
                    commission in the guards. In the mean time, as he had made choice of a
                    profession<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=858" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0858-0714"/> which set him free from all the ordinary
                    restraints in youth, he spared not to indulge his inclinations in the wildest
                    excesses. Yet his gayeties and revels did not pass without some cool hours of
                    reflection; it was in these that he drew up his little treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">The Christian Hero,</hi> with a design, if we may believe himself,
                    to be a check upon his passions. For this purpose it had lain for some time by
                    him, when he printed it in 1701, with a dedication to Lord Cutts, who had not
                    only appointed him his private secretary, but procured for him a company in Lord
                    Lucas’s regiment of fusiliers.</p><p>During the same year he brought out his comedy, called <hi rend="italic">The
                    Funeral, or Grief à la Mode.</hi> This play procured him the notice of King
                    William, who resolved to give him some essential marks of his favour; and
                    though, upon that prince’s death, bis hopes were disappointed, yet, in the
                    beginning of Queen Anne’s reign, he was appointed to the profitable place of
                    gazetteer. This post he owed to the friendship of Lord Halifax and the Earl of
                    Sunderland, to whom be had been recommended by his schoolfellow Mr Addison. That
                    gentleman also lent him a helping hand in promoting the comedy called <hi rend="italic">The Tender Husband,</hi> which was acted in 1704 with great
                    success. But his next play, <hi rend="italic">The Lying Lover,</hi> had a very
                    different fate. Upon this rebuff from the stage, he turned the same humorous
                    current into another channel; and early in the year 1709, he began to publish
                    the Tatler; which admirable paper was undertaken in concert with Dr Swift. His
                    reputation was perfectly established by this work; and, during the course of it,
                    he was made a commissioner of the stamp-duties in 1710. Upon the change of the
                    ministry the same year, he joined the Duke of Marlborough, who had several years
                    entertained a friendship for him; and upon his Grace’s dismission from all
                    employments in 1711, Mr Steele addressed a letter of thanks to him for the
                    services which he had rendered to his country. As, however, he still continued
                    to hold his place in the stampoffice under the new administration, he wisely
                    declined the discussion of political subjects; and, adhering more closely to
                    Addison, he dropped the Tatler, and afterwards, by the assistance chiefly of
                    that steady friend, he carried on the same plan, much improved, under the title
                    of the Spectator. The success of this paper was equal to that of the former;
                    and, before the close of it, he was thus encouraged to proceed upon the same
                    design in the character of the Guardian. This was opened in the beginning of the
                    year 1713, and was laid down in October the same year. But in the course of it
                    his thoughts took a stronger turn to politics: he engaged with great warmth
                    against the ministry; and being determined to prosecute iiis views by procuring
                    a seat in the House of Commons, he immediately removed all the obstacles that
                    stood in his way. For that purpose he took care to prevent a forcible dismission
                    from his post in the stamp-office, by a timely resignation of it to the Earl of
                    Oxford; and at the same time gave up a pension, which had hitherto been paid to
                    him by the Queen as a servant to the late Prince George of Denmark. He now wrote
                    the famous Guardian upon the demolition of Dunkirk. It was published August 7,
                    1613; and the parliament being dissolved next day, the Guardian was soon
                    followed by several other warm political tracts against the administration. Upon
                    the meeting of the new parliament, Steele having been returned a member for the
                    borough of Stockbridge in Hampshire, took his seat accordingly in the House of
                    Commons; but was expelled in the course of a few days, for writing the close of
                    the paper called the <hi rend="italic">Englishman,</hi> and one of his political
                    pieces entitled the <hi rend="italic">Crisis.</hi> Presently after his
                    expulsion, he published proposals for writing the history of the Duke of
                    Marlborough. At the same time he also wrote the <hi rend="italic">Spinster;</hi>
                    and, in opposition to the <hi rend="italic">Examiner,</hi> he set up a paper
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Reader,</hi> and continued publishing several other
                    papers and tracts in the same spirit till the death of the queen. As a reward
                    for these services, he was immediately taken into favour by her successor to the
                    throne, King George</p><p>I.; was appointed surveyor of the royal stables at Hampton Court, and governor of
                    the royal company of comedians was put into the commission of the peace for the
                    county of Middlesex, and in 1715 received the honour of knighthood. In the first
                    parliament of that king, he was chosen member for Boroughbridge in Yorkshire;
                    and, after the suppression of the rebellion in the north, was appointed one of
                    the commissioners of the forfeited estates in Scotland. In 1718, he buried his
                    second wife, who had brought him a handsome fortune with a good estate in Wales;
                    but neither this, nor the ample addition lately made to his income, was
                    sufficient to answer his demands. The thoughtless vivacity of his spirit often
                    reduced him to little shifts of wit for its support; and the project of the
                    fish-pool this year, owed its birth chiefly to the projector’s necessities. This
                    vessel was intended to carry fish alive, and without wasting, to any part of the
                    kingdom; but notwithstanding all bis towering hopes, the scheme proved very
                    ruinous to him; for after he had been at an immense expence in contriving and
                    building his vessel, besides the charge of the patent, which he had procured, it
                    turned out upon trial to be a mere project. His plan was to bring salmon alive
                    from the coast of Ireland; but these fish, though supplied by this contrivance
                    with a continual stream of water while at sea, yet uneasy at their confinement,
                    shattered themselves to pieces against the sides of the pool; so that when they
                    were brought to market they were worth very little.</p><p>The following year he opposed the remarkable peerage bill in the House of
                    Commons; and, during the course of this opposition to the court, his license for
                    acting plays was revoked, and his patent rendered ineffectual at the instance of
                    the Lord Chamberlain. He did his utmost to prevent so great a loss; and finding
                    every direct avenue of approach to his royal master effectually barred against
                    him by his powerful adversary, he had recourse to the method of applying to the
                    public, in hopes that his complaints would reach the ears of his sovereign,
                    though in an indirect course, by that channel. In this spirit he formed the plan
                    of a periodical paper, to be published twice a-week, under the title of the <hi rend="italic">Theatre;</hi> the first number of which appeared on the 2d of
                    January 1719-20. In the mean time, the misfortune of being out of favour at
                    court, like other misfortunes, drew after it a train of more. During the course
                    of this paper, in which he had assumed the feigned name of <hi rend="italic">Sir
                    John Edgar,</hi> he was outrageously attacked by Mr Dennis, the noted critic, in
                    a very abusive pamphlet, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Character and Conduct of
                    Sir John Edgar.</hi> To this insult he made a proper reply in the <hi rend="italic">Theatre.</hi></p><p>While he was struggling with all his might to save himself from ruin, he found
                    time to turn his pen against the mischievous South Sea scheme, which had nearly
                    brought the nation to ruin in 1720; and the next year he was restored to his
                    office and authority in the playhouse in Drury-Lane. Of this it was not long
                    before he made an additional advantage, by bringing his celebrated comedy called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Conscious Lovers</hi> upon that stage, where it was acted
                    with prodigious success; so that the receipt there must have been very
                    considerable, besides the profits accruing by the sale of the copy, and a
                    purse<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=859" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0859-0715"/> of £300 given to him by the king, to whom he
                    dedicated it. Yet notwithstanding these ample supplies, about the year
                    following, being reduced to the utmost extremity, he sold his share in the
                    playhouse; and soon after commenced a lawsuit with the managers, which in 1726,
                    was decided against him. Having now again, for the last time, brought himself by
                    the most heedless profusion into a desperate condition, he was rendered
                    altogether incapable of retrieving the loss, by being seized with a paralytic
                    disorder, which greatly impaired his understanding. In these unhappy
                    circumstances, he retired to his seat at Languanor near Caermarthen in Wales,
                    where he died on the 21st of September 1729, and, according to his own desire,
                    was privately interred in the church of Caermarthen. Among his papers were found
                    the manuscripts of two plays, one called <hi rend="italic">The Gentlemen,</hi>
                    founded upon the Eunuch of Terence, and the other entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    School of Action,</hi> both nearly finished.</p><p>Sir Richard was a man of undissembled and extensive benevolence, a friend to the
                    friendless, and, as far as his circumstances would permit, the father of every
                    orphan. His works are chaste and manly. He was a stranger to the most distant
                    appearance of envy or malevolence; never jealous of any man’s growing
                    reputation; and so far from arrogating any praise to himself from his
                    conjunction with Mr Addison, that he was the first who desired him to
                    distinguish his papers. His great fault was want of economy; and it has been
                    said of him, he was certainly the most agreeable and the most innocent rake that
                    ever trode the rounds of dissipation.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
