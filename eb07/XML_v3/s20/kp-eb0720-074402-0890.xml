                    eminent printer, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1715. His father, who had a
                    small appointment in the customs, gave his son the education which every one of
                    decent rank then received in a country where the avenues to learning were easy,
                    and open to men of the most moderate circumstances. After having passed through
                    the tuition of a grammar-school, he served an apprenticeship to a printer, and
                    when a very young man removed to a wider sphere in that line of business, and
                    went to follow his trade in London. Sober, diligent, and attentive, while his
                    emoluments were for some time very scanty, he contrived to live rather within
                    than beyond his income; and though he married early, and without such a
                    provision as prudence might have looked for in the establishment of a family, he
                    continued to thrive, and to better his circumstances. This he would often
                    mention as an encouragement to early matrimony; and used to say, he never had a
                    child born that Providence did not send some increase of income to provide for
                    the increase of his household. With sufficient vigour of mind, he had that happy
                    flow of animal spirits that is not easily discouraged by unpromising
                    appearances.</p><p>His abilities in his profession, accompanied with perfect integrity and unabating
                    diligence, enabled him, after the first difficulties were overcome, to advance
                    with rapid success. And he was one of the most flourishing men of the trade,
                    when, in the year 1740, he purchased a share of the patent for king’s printer,
                    of Mr Eyre, with whom he maintained the most cordial intimacy during the rest of
                    his life. Beside the emoluments arising from this appointment, as well as from a
                    very extensive private business, he now drew largely from a field which it
                    required some degree of speculative sagacity to cultivate, on account of the
                    great literary property which he acquired by purchasing the copyrights of the
                    most celebrated authors of the time. Here his liberality kept pace with his
                    prudence, and in some cases went perhaps rather beyond it. Never had such
                    rewards been given to the labours of literary men, as were received from him and
                    his associates in their purchases of copyrights.</p><p>Having now attained the first great object of business, wealth, Mr Strahan looked
                    with a very allowable ambition on the stations of political rank and eminence.
                    Politics had long occupied his active mind, and he had for many years pursued
                    them as his favourite amusement, by corresponding on that subject with some of
                    the first characters of the age. Mr Strahan’s queries to Dr Franklin in the year
                    1769, respecting the discontents of the Americans, published in the London
                    Chronicle of 28th July 1778, show the just conception which he entertained of
                    the important consequences of that dispute, and his anxiety as a good subject to
                    investigate, at that early period, the proper means by which their grievances
                    might be removed, and a permanent harmony restored between the two countries. In
                    the year 1775 he was elected a member of parliament for the borough of
                    Malmesbury in Wiltshire, with a very illustrious colleague, Mr Fox; and in the
                    succeeding parliament, for Wooton Basset, in the same county. In this station,
                    applying himself<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=891" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0891-0745"/> with that industry which was natural to him, he
                    was a useful member, and attended the house with a scrupulous punctuality. His
                    talents for business acquired the consideration to which they were entitled, and
                    were not unnoticed by the minister.</p><p>In his political connection, he was constant to the friends to whom he had first
                    been attached. He was a steady supporter of that party who were turned out of
                    administration in spring 1784, and lost his seat in the House of Commonsby the
                    dissolution of parliament with which that change was followed; nor did he show
                    any disposition to resume his place on the return of the new parliament. He had
                    begun to feel some decline in his health, which had rather suffered from the
                    long sittings with which the political warfare had been attended. Without any
                    fixed disease, his strength visibly decayed; and though his spirits survived his
                    strength, yet the vigour and activity of his mind were considerably impaired.
                    Both continued gradually to decline till his death, which happened on the 9th of
                    July 1785, in the seventy-first year of his age.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
