                    generally applied to a particular sect in these countries. It originated with a
                    few Christians in Dublin, about the year 1803, who had their attention strongly
                    directed to the principles of Christian fellowship. Convinced that the authority
                    of the apostolic word was divine and unchangeable, not to be annulled or
                    weakened by the lapse of time, by the customs of nations, or by the laws of
                    earthly legislators, they set out in the attempt to return fully to the course
                    marked out for Christians in the New Testament. There they perceived that all
                    the first Christians in any place were connected together in the closest
                    brotherhood, and that this connection, grounded on the apostolic gospel which
                    they believed, was altogether regulated by the apostolic precepts, the commands
                    of the divinely-commissioned ambassadors of Christ; and they also perceived that
                    the same divine rule which regulated their fellowship in the gospel with each
                    other, forbade them to maintain any religious fellowship with others. From the
                    practice consequent on this, they received the name of <hi rend="italic">Separatists,</hi> a designation since applied to them, by an act of parliament
                    passed in the year 1833, for their relief in the matter of oaths. To give even a
                    concise account of the tenets and practices by which they are distinguished from
                    most other religionists in these countries, would require more space than could
                    be allotted to this article; but among them the following principal may be
                    noted. They hold that the only true God is made known to men exclusively in the
                    gospel of his son Jesus Christ; that those alone who believe the divine
                    testimony there revealed know the true God, whose distinguishing glory is
                    displayed in the fullest harmony of perfect righteousness and perfect mercy, as
                    the Saviour of sinful creatures, and the justifier of the ungodly, through the
                    redemption that is in Christ Jesus, through the propitiation for sin which he
                    made by his obedience unto death, and the divine acceptance of which is proved
                    by his resurrection from the dead. They hold that forgiveness of all sin,
                    acceptance in the sight of God, and eternal life, come to the guiltiest of
                    sinners, as such, and are assured in the divine word to every one, without
                    distinction, who believes the testimony concerning Jesus of Nazareth. They
                    understand by the faith with which justification and eternal life are connected,
                    nothing else but the belief of the things declared to all<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=117" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0117-0103"/>
                    alike in the gospel; and by repentance, nothing but the change of mind which
                    takes place on a sinner’s believing the gospel. Both these they hold to be
                    solely the work of God in his people; the Spirit of God working by his revealed
                    word, in them to will and to do; and they acknowledge God to be the sole author
                    and agent of every thing that is good, and that every thing which comes from the
                    sinner himself, either before his conversion to God, or after it, is essentially
                    evil. As a church they assemble on the first day of the week, as the memorial
                    day of Christ’s resurrection, to show forth his death, the only ground of their
                    hope, by taking bread and wine, as the symbols of his body broken and his blood
                    shed for the remission of sins; to join in the exercises of prayer and praise;
                    to contribute to the necessities of the poor; to express their fraternal
                    affection by saluting each other with an holy kiss; and to attend, as occasion
                    requires, to the discipline appointed by the apostles for removing any evil
                    which may appear among them. For a full account of their doctrines on baptism,
