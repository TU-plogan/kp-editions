                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">STOCKHOLM</label>, the capital of the kingdom of Sweden,
                    stands in the centre of the province of that name. It is built on two
                    peninsulas, and several islands of different dimensions, which are connected by
                    numerous bridges and ferries, and, including the water, is of great extent,
                    being two and a quarter miles in length, and near two miles in breadth. A great
                    part of this enclosure is not covered with houses; and in many parts the rocks
                    are interspersed among patches of land and gardens, so as to give it an
                    appearance very different from that of any other of the European capitals. The
                    whole is divided into ten districts, the most important of which, called the
                    city <hi rend="italic">(Stadt),</hi> is small but interesting, from being the
                    residence of the higher classes of the inhabitants, and the site of the most
                    prominent buildings. In this division the streets are narrow, dark, and badly
                    paved. They run parallel to each other, and are united by cross streets; but in
                    all of them the gutters in the middle are very repulsive to more than one sense.
                    The houses however are large, firmly built, and not destitute of taste. The
                    royal palace is of colossal dimensions, and erected in a noble style of
                    architecture. Being rather elevated, it commands a view of the whole city on one
                    side, and is surrounded with tasteful gardens on the other. Within it is
                    contained the presence-chamber, the royal museum, a library of 30,000 volumes,
                    the collection of the Swedish academies, a square with a monument and figure of
                    Gustavus III., and the German church, with a tower of 120 feet in height. In the
                    same part are also the exchange, the bank, the cabinet of coins and medals, the
                    mint, the college of mining, and the town-hall. The royal stables are in another
                    division. On one of the islands, forming a district, are the naval storehouses,
                    and the hall of the admiralty. On another island, also a district, is a fort
                    with twelve cannon and a lazaretto. On many of these districts, though each has
                    some good buildings, the others are poor wooden houses, without taste or
                    ornament, and destitute of cleanliness. The city is under the government of a
                    stadtholder, with inferior officers; and under the police are organized bodies
                    of watchmen and firemen. Here both the civil and the criminal courts are held.
                    The ecclesiastical affairs are managed by the consistory, with a superintendent
                    as president. Under it are fourteen pastorates of the Lutheran religion; and
                    there are besides places of worship for German and French Calvinists, for
                    Catholics, and for Finnish Lutherans. There are many schools both for elementary
                    and classical learning, and also an academy of sciences, with an astronomical
                    observatory, a society of antiquaries, and other bodies for promoting the
                    different branches of knowledge. There are abundance of benevolent institutions,
                    adapted to alleviate the various calamities to which mankind are subject, but
                    especially hospitals for seamen and widows. Stockholm is the chief manufacturing
                    place of the kingdom, and supplies silk, woollen, and cotton clothing, much
                    linen, and also refined sugar, tobacco and snuff, pottery and china ware, glass,
                    jewellery, brandy, and many smaller articles, but almost exclusively for
                    domestic use. It is also the chief mart of foreign trade, to which the
                    excellence and security of its harbour greatly contributes. About 500 or 600
                    vessels, of different burdens, are yearly despatched. Some of these arrive with
                    cargoes of corn, but many in ballast. They are loaded with the excellent iron of
                    Sweden, with copper, tar, pitch, anchors, nails, cannon, bar-steel, planks,
                    masts, cordage, hides, leather, tiles, and in some years a large quantity of
                    preserved herrings. The city has establishments for recreation in two theatres,
                    several public walks, and a variety of clubs and other social assemblies. The
                    population has been fluctuating. In 1795 it amounted to 74,378, in 1800 to
                    75,511, in 1805 to 72,652, in 1814 to 62,830, in 1818 to 65,474, in 1826 to
                    77,273, in 1832 to 79,526. Long. 17. 59. 30. E. Lat. 59. 19. 15. N.</p>
