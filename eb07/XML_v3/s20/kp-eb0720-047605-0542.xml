                    Lausanne, by a committee appointed to examine a young man who was accustomed to
                    walk in his sleep, the disposition to this singular habit seems to depend on a
                    particular affection of the nerves, which both seizes and quits the patient
                    during<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=543" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0543-0477"/> sleep. Under the influence of this affection, the
                    imagination represents to him the objects which strike him while awake, with as
                    much force as if they really affected his senses; but it does not make him
                    perceive any of those which are actually presented to his senses, except in so
                    far as they are connected with the dreams which engross him at the time.</p><p>If during this state the imagination has no determined purpose, he receives the
                    impression of objects as if he were awake; only, however, when the imagination
                    is excited to lend its attention towards them. The perceptions obtained in this
                    state are very accurate; and when once received, the imagination renews them
                    occasionally with as much force as if they were again acquired by means of the
                    senses. But the impressions received during this state of the senses disappear
                    entirely when the person awakes, and do not return till the return of the same
                    disposition in the nervous system.</p><p>The remarks of this committee were made on a lad named Devaud, who was thirteen
                    years and a half old, and who lived in the town of Vevey. He possessed a robust
                    consti tution; but his nervous system appeared to be organized with peculiar
                    delicacy, and to discover marks of the greatest sensibility and irritability.
                    His senses of smell, taste, and touch, were exquisite: he was subject to fits of
                    immoderate and involuntary laughter; and he sometimes wept without any apparent
                    cause. His sleep was at all times unquiet, but particularly when the fits were
                    about to seize him. During his sleep, motions were observable in every part of
                    his body, with starting and palpitations; he uttered broken words, sometimes sat
                    up in his bed and lay down again. He then began to pronounce words more
                    distinctly, and rising abruptly, acted as he was instigated by the dream which
                    then possessed him.</p><p>From the facts which were brought under the observation of this committee, they
                    inferred that the functions of the somnambulist, while under the influence of
                    this affection, are not suspended, as to what he wishes to see, or the objects
                    about which his imagination is occupied; that he may also be disposed to receive
                    those impressions when his imagination has no other object at the time; that in
                    order to see, he is obliged to open his eyes as much as he can, but when the
                    impression is once made it remains; that objects may strike his sight without
                    striking his imagination, if it is not interested in them; and that he is
                    sometimes inform ed of the presence of objects without either seeing or touching
                    them.</p><p>A great number of similar instances might very easily be accumulated. Such
                    anomalous operations of the mind it is perhaps beyond the power of philosophy to
                    explain; but a very small portion of philosophy, or even common sense, will
                    enable us to dispose of another class of vagaries imput ed to animal magnetism.
                    The magnetisers are a sort of conjurers, who, according to their own account,
                    are able to superinduce a state of sleep, and, while their patients are in that
                    state, to exercise a marvellous influence over their volitions. Deleuze, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Histoire Critique du Magnétisme Animal,</hi> furnishes these
                    very edifying details: “When magnetism produces somnambulism, the being who
                    finds himself in this state acquires a prodigious extension in the sense of
                    feeling. Several of his exterior organs, usually those of sight and hearing, are
                    rendered torpid, and all the sensations which depend on them are internally
                    performed. There is in this state an infinite number of shades and varieties;
                    but in order to form a correct judgment, it must be examined in its greatest
                    remoteness from the state of waking, passing over in silence every thing that
                    experience has not established. The somnambulist has his eyes closed, and does
                    not see by the eyes nor hear by the cars; but he sees and hears better than a
                    waking man. He sees and hears only those with whom he is in relation. He sees
                    only that which he looks at, and he usually looks only at those objects to which
                    his attention is directed. He is subject to the will of his magnetiser for every
                    thing that cannot harm him, and for every thing that is not opposed to his ideas
                    of justice and truth. He feels the will of his magnetiser; he perceives the
                    magnetic fluid; he sees, or rather he feels, the interior of his own body, and
                    those of others; but he usu ally remarks only the parts which are not in the
                    natural state, and which disturb the harmony of the economy; he retraces in his
                    memory the remembrance of things which he had forgotten while awake; he has
                    previsions and presensations, which may be erroneous in several circumstances,
                    and which are limited in their extent; he expresses himself with a surprising
                    facility; he is not exempt from vanity; he improves of himself, for a certain
                    length of time, if he is wisely managed; he spoils if he is ill directed. When
                    he reenters into the natural state, he absolutely loses the recollection of all
                    sensations, and of all ideas which he has had in the state of somnambulism; so
                    that these two states are as unconnected with one another, as if the
                    somnambulist and the waking man were two different beings.” The simple
                    enunciation of such absurdities as these, seems to preclude the necessity of all
                    formal discussion.</p><p>In addition to their other attributes, some of the magnetic somnambulists are
                    endowed with a miraculous skill in physic. “Those patients in crisis,” says
                    Cloquet, “who are named physicians, have a supernatural power, by which, on
                    touching a patient who is presented to them, on carrying the hand even above the
                    clothes, they feel what is the affected organ, the suffering part; they declare
                    it, and mention nearly the suitable remedies. A singularity not less remarkable
                    than all those which I have enumerated is, that those physicians who for several
                    hours have touched pa ticnts, and have reasoned with them, remember nothing,
                    absolutely nothing, when the master pleases to disenchant them, and to restore
                    them to their natural state. The time which has elapsed from their entrance into
                    the crisis to their coming out of it, is, so to speak, annihilated to such a de
                    gree, that if a covered table be presented to these sleeping physicians, they
                    will eat and drink; and if, the table being uncovered, the master restores them
                    to their natural state, they will have no recollection of having done so. The
                    master has the power not only, as I have already said, to make himself be
                    understood by these physicians in crisis, but I have repeatedly seen him present
                    from a distance his finger to one of these physicians, always in crisis, and in
                    a state of spasmodic sleep, make him to follow him where he pleas ed, or send
                    him to a distance from himself, either to his house or to different places,
                    which he mentally indicated without telling him.”</p><p>Another phenomenon, equally worthy of admiration, is the power of reading without
                    the aid of eyes. Pigeaire, a physician of Montpellier, is answerable for the
                    following statement of his daughter’s performances in this new department. “We
                    made her read with her eyes closed by magnetic sleep, or covered with a
                    handkerchief in the form of a bandage; she read with the greatest facility
                    characters printed or written, not only in applying her fingers to the paper,
                    but also with a plate of glass interposed between the book and her fingers. More
                    than forty persons have been witnesses of this experiment, which we took care to
                    perform before only a few persons at a time, in order not to disturb the little
                    somnambulist. This experiment has never failed; once only it has been
                    incomplete. The little girl, in the state of somnambulism, named certain objects
                    en closed in snuffboxes; announced persons previously to their entrance into the
                    room in which she was; and several times mentioned the hour and the minute on a
                    hunting watch which she held in her hand.” Those who are acquainted with the
                    waking performances of Miss Macavoy of Liverpool, will experience no difficulty
                    in understanding the sleeping performances of Miss Pigeaire of Montpellier.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=544" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0544-0478"/></p></div></body></text></TEI>
