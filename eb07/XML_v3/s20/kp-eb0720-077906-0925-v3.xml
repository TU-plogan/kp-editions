                <p><label type="entry">STROMBOLI</label>, the most northern island of the Lipari
                    group, in the Mediterranean, being a part of the kingdom of Naples. It was known
                    to the ancients by the name of Strongyle; a name implying a conical mountain
                    with an irregular base. The mountain is bifurcated, upwards of 2000 feet in
                    height, and about nine miles in circumference, and is evidently a monstrous
                    product of subterraneous fires. The crater of this mountain is on the north-west
                    side, about two thirds of the whole height from the base; it is of a circular
                    form, and about one hundred and seventy yards in diameter, and has a yellow
                    efflorescence adhering to its sides, as to those of Mount Aetna. This crater has
                    burnt without intermission from the earliest periods, and is supposed to be
                    supported by oxygen, pyrites, and sulphur; but there are not any traces of the
                    aid of bitumen. It appears to be not only the vent of all these islands, but
                    likewise to have subterraneous communication with Sicily and Italy; for,
                    previously to a severe earthquake taking place in those parts, Stromboli has
                    been observed to be covered with dense clouds of smoke, and to emit with
                    increased activity unusually ardent flames. The access to the summit, though
                    fatiguing, is not dangerous. When a person approaches the crater, and the smoke
                    clears away, as it does at intervals, he can observe an undulating igneous
                    substance, which at short periods rises and falls with great agitation, and when
                    swollen to the utmost height bursts with a violent explosion and a discharge of
                    red-hot stones in a semi-fluid state, accompanied with showers of ashes, and a
                    strong sulphureous smell. These masses are thrown up to the height of from sixty
                    or seventy to three hundred feet, and some few even to a thousand. In the
                    moderate ejections the stones in their ascent gradually diverge like a grand
                    pyrotechnical exhibition, and fall again into the abyss, except on the side next
                    the sea, where they roll down in quick succession to the water.</p>
                <p>The island contains about 1200 inhabitants. The principal places are St Bartolo
                    and St Vincenzo. The soil is a black mold, very fertile, consisting of
                    argilaceous tufa, scoriae, puzzolana, and sand. Stromboli produces some good
                    wine, with excellent wheat, barley, cotton, rasins, currants, and figs. The
                    church of St Bartolo is in long. 15. 13. 10. E., and lat. 38. 48. 12. N.</p>
