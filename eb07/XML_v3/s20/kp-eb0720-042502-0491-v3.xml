                    writings have conferred distinguished honour upon the literature of his country,
                    was descended from a family of considerable antiquity and opulence in the county
                    of Dunbarton. His grandfather, Sir James Smollett of Bonhill, married a daughter
                    of Sir Aulay Macaulay of Ardincaple, and by that lady had four sons, of whom
                    Archibald, the youngest, was the father of the novelist. Archibald, who had been
                    bred to no profession, died at an early age, leaving his family, consisting of a
                    widow and three children, one of whom was an infant daughter, solely dependent
                    on the bounty of his father. Smollett was born in 1721, in the old mansion-house
                    of Dulquhurn, now a ruin. It is situated near the village of Renton, in the
                    parish of Cardross. He was baptized Tobias George. The<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=492" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0492-0426"/>
                    valley of the Leven, in which Smollett first saw the light, is surpassed by no
                    other spot in our island, either for the grandeur of its scenery, or for the
                    venerable associations with which it is connected. Nor was the ground which had
                    been dignified by the tread of Wallace, Bruce, Napier, and Buchanan, dishonoured
                    by the steps of Smollett.</p><p>From the grammar-school of Dunbarton, in which he had imbibed the rudiments of
                    classical learning, Smollett was transferred to the University of Glasgow, where
                    he prosecuted his more advanced studies with application and success. He was
                    afterwards bound an apprentice to Mr. John Gordon, an eminent medical
                    practitioner in that city. His elder brother James had adopted the profession of
                    arms, an example which he was ambitious of following; but the old knight
                    probably illustrated the advantages of the study of physic by reasoning which it
                    would have been vain to controvert. When the young student had attained his
                    eighteenth year, his grandfather died, without having made any adequate
                    provision for the children of bis youngest son. For this omission, his
                    descendant furnished him with a niche in <hi rend="italic">Roderick Random,</hi>
                    more conspicuous than desirable.</p><p>The term of his apprenticeship having expired in his nineteenth year, and being
                    now thrown upon his own resources, Smollett proceeded to London, where he
                    attracted the notice of Lord Lyttelton. He had carried with him his tragedy of
                    <hi rend="italic">The Regicide,</hi> a juvenile performance of uncommon merit,
                    but indifferently adapted to the purpose of representation. The various efforts
                    which he ineffectually used to bring his play upon the stage, are detailed with
                    indignant prolixity in the preface to that production, which he sent to the
                    press some years afterwards, with a view of heaping confusion upon the lukewarm
                    patronage of Lyttelton, and upon the shuffling evasions of Garrick. The patron
                    and the manager were visited with many other tokens of his displeasure; but he
                    lived to repent of the severe retribution which he had exacted for trivial
                    wrongs, and made honourable mention of both in his History of England.</p><p>Thwarted in his expectations of earning fame and profit as a writer for the
                    stage, Smollett was glad to accept the situation of surgeon’s mate on board the
                    Cumberland. That vessel, an eighty-gun ship, belonged to the armament which was
                    bound to the West Indies, to join the fleet under the command of Admiral Vernon.
                    Of the disastrous expedition against Carthagena, Smollett inserted an animated
                    narrative in <hi rend="italic">Roderick Random,</hi> and afterwards published a
                    more detailed account in the <hi rend="italic">compendium of Voyages.</hi> When
                    the discomfited squadrons returned to Jamaica, he quitted the service in
                    disgust, and fixed his residence on the island. With Miss Lascelles, a
                    fascinating West Indian, he there formed an acquaintance, which afterwards
                    ripened into a matrimonial union. In 1746 he returned to London, which then
                    resounded with acclamations occasioned by the victory at Culloden. With these
                    were mingled some expressions of indignation at the atrocities inflicted by the
                    royal army upon the helpless families of the insurgents. The voice of Smollett
                    swelled the weaker cry, and he produced his pathetic ode, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Tears of Scotland.</hi> During the same year was published, <hi rend="italic">Advice, a Satire.</hi> His next literary effort was <hi rend="italic">Alceste,
                    an Opera,</hi> which he wrote at the suggestion of Mr. Rich of Covent Garden
                    Theatre. In consequence of some dispute with that patentee, the piece was
                    withdrawn, and has never appeared in print. In 1747 he published <hi rend="italic">Reproof,</hi> a second part of his former satirical production.
                    The versification of these poems is sufficiently harmonious, and they abound
                    with impetuous invective; but the rage of the satirist is without dignity, and
                    rabid, without being infectious to readers of the present day. About this period
                    he married Miss Lascelles, who was possessed of a small estate in the island of
                    Jamaica; a precarious species of property, from which her husband appears to
                    have derived little or no ultimate benefit.</p><p>In the year 1748, appeared <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Roderick
                    Random.</hi> Fielding had already evinced himself a noble follower of Cervantes,
                    and Smollett now stood forth, a no less worthy disciple of Le Sage. It must be
                    owned that in this, and in all the other novels of Smollett, humour frequently
                    appears in very loose attire. These scenes, however, like sheet-lightning, are
                    alarming, but perfectly innocuous. The solemn depravity of Rousseau is more
                    dangerous than the ludicrous indecorum of Smollett. In 1749, <hi rend="italic">The Regicide</hi> was published by subscription. During the same year Smollett
                    took the degree of M.D., in what University has not been ascertained. In 1750 he
                    went to Paris, where he is supposed to have occupied himself in composing <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle,</hi> which were published in
                    1751. This admirable novel is disfigured by the introduction of an impertinent
                    episode, in which are detailed, with unrelenting minuteness, the tedious
                    intrigues of Lady Vane; who is said to have rewarded Smollett handsomely for the
                    drudgery of compiling that durable record of her infamy. To compensate for this
                    blemish, and for some rash sallies of humour, <hi rend="italic">Peregrine
                    Pickle</hi> is an absolute mine of character and adventure. The entertainment
                    prepared by the learned physician, in the manner of the ancients, is perhaps the
                    most irresistible piece of pleasantry that was ever devised by a ludicrous
                    fancy. In his heroes and heroines, Smollett is not happy. For Random we have no
                    respect; for Pickle we have no esteem; and Narcissa and Emilia are only the
                    objects of appetite. Since the days of Tom Bowling and the Commodore, we have
                    seen many sailors in print, who display an accurate and profound knowledge of
                    technical <hi rend="italic">minutiae;</hi> but their humour, if they have any,
                    will not pass muster ashore, the medium through which it is conveyed being to
                    uninstructed ears a mere succession of unintelligible gibberish. And these modem
                    tars have all a striking family likeness to each other, with the exception of
                    some sentimental rope-haulers of the American school, who are evidently monsters
                    of the imagination. But each of Smollett’s seamen, though drawn to the life,
                    exhibits the strongest idiosyncrasy of character, and converses in a dialect
                    which can be readily understood by those who have never seen a ship.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The incident of Tom Pipes’s
                    concealing in his shoe his master’s letter to Emilia, it is curious to trace to
                    the following passage in Ovid’s Art of Love; which has not escaped the laborious
                    research of Hugo, <hi rend="italic">De prima Scribendi Origine,</hi> p. 154.</p><lg part="N"><l part="N">Cum possit solea chartas celare ligatae,</l><l part="N">Et vincto blandas sub pede ferre nous.</l></lg></note></p><p>The next production of Smollett’s pen was “An Essay on the External Use of Water,
                    in a letter to Dr.—; with particular remarks upon the present method of using
                    the Mineral Waters at Bath, in Somersetshire; and a plan for rendering them more
                    safe, agreeable, and efficacious.” 1752, 4to. At the period of this publication,
                    Smollett resided at Bath, where he solicited professional employment; but the
                    reputation of the satirist effectually marred the prospects of the physician.
                    Despairing of success in bis profession, Dr. Smollett now hired a house at
                    Chelsea, where he entirely devoted himself to literary pursuits. The first
                    fruits of his retirement were, <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Ferdinand
                    count Fathom,</hi> which appeared in 1753. The author’s object in this
                    production is, to set up the principal character “as a beacon for the benefit of
                    the inexperienced and unwary.” This personage is as much below, as one of
                    Richardson’s heroes is above, the standard of general nature. Few men are so
                    virtuous or depraved as to have much sympathy with either; and it may very
                    reasonably be ques <pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=493" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0493-0427"/>tioned, whether any one was ever allured to virtue by viewing the unattainable
                    perfections of Grandison, or deterred from vice by contemplating the superlative
                    villany of Fathom. Besides, a picture of insipid excellence is at least
                    harmless; but there is a moral insanity about some men, which leads them not
                    only to delight in, but sometimes to emulate the achievements of fictitious
                    desperadoes. The most striking passage in this novel, is the adventure in the
                    forest, which creates terror as strong as the convulsions of laughter which
                    reward the exploits of Trunnion and his myrmidons.</p><p>But although master of the passions of others, Smollett’s own were under very
                    indifferent control. A wretch, called Peter Gordon, whom he had maintained for a
                    series of years, and in support of whose credit he had been prevailed upon to
                    indorse notes, suddenly withdrew into the verge of the court, where, by means of
                    insulting letters and messages, he provoked his benefactor to chastise him in
                    such manner as to furnish grounds for an action of damages. The Hon. Alexander
                    Hume Campbell, who was counsel for the plaintiff, having opened the proceedings
                    with much gratuitous insolence towards the defendant and his witnesses, Smollett
                    addressed a letter to that barrister, couched in very indignant and sarcastic
                    terms, which afterwards found its way into the fifth volume of the European
                    Magazine. This infamous prosecution terminated in the discomfiture of Gordon,
                    but the issue of Smollett’s dispute with Campbell is involved in obscurity. In
                    the beginning of the year 1755, Smollett published his translation of Don
                    Quixote, which was executed amid the anxiety of pecuniary embarrassment, and for
                    which he had been paid by advance. This version is infinitely more spirited and
                    elegant than that of his immediate predecessor Jarvis. But if Smollett has
                    surpassed Motteux in maintaining the solemn fatuity of the knight, he is less
                    happy in rendering the proverbial humour of the squire; for the corresponding
                    phrases in English had already been appropriated, and he was reduced to the
                    necessity of alteration, when there was no room for improvement. After the
                    publication of Don Quixote, Smollett paid a visit to his native country. Upon
                    his return to England, he undertook the superintendence of the Critical Review.
                    The editorship of that journal involved him in a thousand vexatious disputes
                    with persons who were utterly unworthy of being promoted to the rank of his
                    antagonists. A contemptuous critique on the Rosciad, of which he was entirely
                    innocent, provoked the spleen of Churchill, whose brief career was a perpetual
                    crusade against genius and virtue, and whose coarse and rancorous effusions are
                    now consigned to merited oblivion; for posterity has not realized the hopes of
                    an undying name, so confidently expressed by the reverend bard, who proposed to
                    annihilate the reputation of Pope, and who launched his slight javelins at the
                    massy buckler of Johnson.</p><p>In 1757, Smollett published a popular compilation, entitled <hi rend="italic">A
                    Compendium of Authentic and Entertaining Voyages.</hi> 7 vols. 12mo. During the
                    same year was performed and printed <hi rend="italic">The Reprisal,</hi> a
                    comedy in two acts. The characters in this piece are strongly marked, and the
                    dialogue is extremely spirited, but the situations are conceived with little
                    dramatic artifice; a species of knowledge which often enables the humble
                    retainer of a playhouse to concoct a drama, which shall be admirably well
                    adapted for the stage, and yet prove not more entertaining in the closet than a
                    book of arithmetic. In the same year was published the “Complete History of
                    England, deduced from the Descent of Julius Caesar to the Treaty of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, 1748, containing the transactions of one thousand three hundred
                    and three years.” 4 vols. 4to. This surprising effort of industry and genius, is
                    said to have been begun and completed in the course of fourteen months. If not
                    the most accurate and philosophical of historians, Smollett yields to few in the
                    unaffected elegance of his style, and in the graceful animation of his
                    narrative. He had been bred a Whig, and whatever were the motives that led to
                    the political tergiversation which is manifested in this work, it would be
                    uncharitable to suppose that they were those of self-interest; a consideration
                    which does not seem to have influenced any one action of his life.</p><p>In 1759, an article appeared in the Critical Review, animadverting in strong
                    terms upon the conduct of Admiral Knowles, who had written a pamphlet to
                    vindicate himself from the popular odium which attached to his character, in
                    consequence of his share in a secret expedition to the French coast, which was
                    planned and miscarried in 1757.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The offensive words were, “He is an admiral without conduct,
                    an engineer without knowledge, an officer without resolution, and a man without
                    veracity.” Knowles was one of the heroes of Carthagena, at which memorable
                    expedition be commanded the Weymouth, of 60 guns.</p></note> The admiral having
                    commenced a prosecution against the printer, of which the avowed object was to
                    induce the writer to declare himself, and give him satisfaction of another kind,
                    Smollett, in this dilemma, solicited the good offices of his friend Wilkes,
                    whose rhetoric made no impression on the incensed commander. At this juncture,
                    Smollett stepped boldly forth, and proclaimed himself the author of the
                    obnoxious article, offering the aggrieved party any satisfaction that he might
                    desire. Upon this declaration, the magnanimous flag-officer immediately withdrew
                    his action against the printer, and entered a fresh suit against the reviewer.
                    The result of the action was, that Smollett was fined one hundred pounds, and
                    sentenced to three months imprisonment in the King’s Bench.</p><p>To cheer the gloom of his confinement, this indefatigable writer employed himself
                    in composing <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves,</hi>
                    which first appeared in the <hi rend="italic">British Magazine</hi> for 1760 and
                    1761, and was published in a separate form in 1762. The eye of criticism has
                    always looked coldly upon this performance. Although it is one of those works,
                    of which the execution must be admitted to surpass the conception, the story of
                    the modem Don Quixote is no such incredible figment as it has been pronounced.
                    Sir Launcelot Greaves is represented as a person of diseased understanding; and
                    who shall set bounds to the vagaries of insanity? Nor does Captain Crowe appear
                    to act out of character, in becoming a candidate for the honours of chivalry.
                    For that original is in a state of happy ignorance concerning all terrestrial
                    affairs; and the profession of a knight-errant appears to his unsophisticated
                    understanding to be as lawful a calling as that of a tide-waiter; and it is one
                    which is not at all discordant with the headlong courage and extravagant
                    generosity of a British seaman.</p><p>To the modern part of Universal History, which was begun in 1759, and completed
                    in 1764, Smollett contributed the histories of France, Italy, and Germany. In
                    1761 had appeared the first number of his <hi rend="italic">continuation of the
                    History of England,</hi> which he finished in 1765; the narrative comprehending
                    the transactions down to that period.</p><p>Upon the accession of George III., Smollett appeared in the character of a
                    political partisan, and drew his pen in defence of the administration of Lord
                    Bute, in a weekly paper, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Briton.</hi> But being
                    speedily tired of protecting from obloquy a minister who was indifferent to
                    public opinion, he retired from the strife, leaving his antagonist, <hi rend="italic">The North Briton,</hi> master of the field. This contest
                    terminated an intimacy of long standing between Smollett and Wilkes.
                    Notwithstanding his inferiority in talents, that demagogue had some decided
                    advantages over<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=494" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0494-0428"/> his opponent. Wilkes was a cool political
                    pugilist, who gathered courage from the applauses of the mob; while Smollett was
                    greeted with a general burst of popular execration, which worked him into a
                    phrensy that deprived him of his strength.</p><p>Smollett’s name stands in the title-page of a translation of the works of
                    Voltaire, and also in that of a compilation, entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Present State of all Nations.</hi> These works, to which he contributed
                    sparingly, were published in 1763. In that year he sustained an irreparable loss
                    in the death of his only child, a daughter named Elizabeth, who had attained the
                    fifteenth year of her age. This calamity threw an impenetrable gloom over the
                    brief remainder of his life. In the hope of dissipating his own grief and that
                    of his wife, by change of scene, he passed over into France; in which country,
                    and in Italy, he resided for two years. In 1766, he published his <hi rend="italic">Travels through France and Italy.</hi> This production displays
                    his usual acuteness of observation, and felicity of expression, but he appears
                    to have contemplated every object through the distorted medium of disease and
                    lacerated feelings. Sterne, who had met the bereaved father abroad, took an
                    opportunity of exulting over the infirmities of rival genius in his Sentimental
                    Journey.</p><p>In 1766, Smollett visited Scotland for the last time. At this period, he was a
                    martyr to asthma and rheumatic pains, and afflicted with a virulent ulcer on his
                    arm. In the following year, while residing at Bath, he enjoyed a short tatet vol
                    of convalescence, during which he wrote <hi rend="italic">The Adventures of an
                    Atom.</hi> In this political romance, he has blended, with greater dexterity
                    than judgment, the reckless jollity of Rabelais with the withering sarcasm of
                    Swift. With much wit and humour, this production betrays great physical
                    indelicacy, a latent ferocity of sentiment, and an unqualified abhorrence of the
                    lower order of the community, which is far from edifying. It may here be
                    remarked, that the learning which is scattered through the fictitious narratives
                    of Smollett, would, with proper management, make a most imposing show in works
                    of much graver pretensions. Neither does he ever, like Fielding, hover on the
                    verge of pedantry; nor resort to the disingenuous artifice of dazzling
                    unlettered eyes with borrowed erudition, like Sterne, who had cool effrontery
                    enough to express his sovereign contempt of literary larceny, in the
                    unacknowledged words of Burton.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Scott’s Biographical Memoirs of eminent Novelists, vol.
                    i. p. 294.</p></note> ’</p><p>After the publication of this romance, Smollett’s complaints returned with
                    increased violence, and his medical friends declared that his only chance of
                    life lay in a more salubrious climate. To the great he never applied in vain,
                    for he never applied at all. His friends however made some fruitless efforts to
                    interest the ministry in his behalf. But from Smollett was sternly withheld that
                    bounty which has often, before and since, been lavished with a prodigal hand
                    upon the most worthless and foolish of mankind. With a constitution worn to the
                    dregs in the service of iterature, and with a purse which had been emptied in
                    the lap of indigence, Smollett proceeded to Italy in 1770.</p><p>The last, and perhaps the best of all his works, was <hi rend="italic">The
                    Expedition of Humphrey Clinker,</hi> published in 1771. Each character in the
                    galaxy of originals which are there pourtrayed, may submit without apprehension
                    to Ben Jonson’s test of humour:</p><lg part="N"><l part="N">When some one peculiar quality</l><l part="N">Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw</l><l part="N">All his affects, his spirits, and his powers,</l><l part="N">In their confluctions, all to run one way,</l><l part="N">This may be truly said to be a humour.</l></lg><p>Having bequeathed this legacy to the public, Smollett died at Monte Nero, a
                    village in the neighbourhood of Leghorn, on the 21st of October 1771, in the
                    fifty-first year of his age. A monument was erected to his memory by his widow,
                    and a cenotaph on the banks of the Leven by his cousin, Mr. Smollett of
                    Bonhill.</p><p>To a handsome person, and an address at once dignified and engaging, Smollett
                    added colloquial powers of the highest order. His irascible passions were
                    strong, but his social affections were not less so. If it is remembered that his
                    personal and political prejudices were intense, let it not be forgotten that
                    zealous friendship and ardent patriotism were among the number. He was
                    improvident, for bis hand was only closed to the necessities of others when he
                    had nothing to bestow. He was a man of undaunted resolution, and lofty
                    independence of mind. He was vindictive, but not implacable, and melted at the
                    first appearance of contrition in those who had injured him. He was jealous of
                    his fame, his sole possession, but he envied that of no other man, whether
                    deserved or otherwise. Of Smollett, as an author, it may be truly said, that of
                    the many different kinds of composition which he has attempted, there is none to
                    which he has not communicated peculiar graces; nor can we hesitate for a moment
                    in adding his name to the scanty list of those who have extended the limits of
                    intellectual enjoyment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• For more circumstantial details of the life of Smollett, the reader is
