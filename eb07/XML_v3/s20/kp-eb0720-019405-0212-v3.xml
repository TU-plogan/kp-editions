                    political writer, was born at Bideford, in Devonshire, in the year 1709. He
                    received the rudiments of his education at the free grammar-school of Exeter. It
                    has often been observed that the future life of a man may be gathered from his
                    puerile character; and accordingly Shebbeare, while a boy at school, gave the
                    strongest indications of his future eminence in misanthropy and learning, by the
                    extraordinary tenaciousness of his memory and the readiness of his wit, as well
                    as the malignity of his disposition. He was universally regarded as a young man
                    of surprising genius, while at the same time he was despised for his malicious
                    temper.</p><p>About the age of sixteen, Shebbeare was bound apprentice to an eminent surgeon in
                    his native town, under whom he acquired a considerable share of medical
                    knowledge. His talent for lampoon appeared at this early period, and he could
                    not forbear from exercising it on his master; but the chief marks for the arrows
                    of his wit were the gentlemen of the corporation, some of whom laughed at such
                    trifles, while such as were irritable often commenced prosecutions against him,
                    but without success. He was frequently summoned to appear at the sessions, for
                    daring to speak and write disrespectfully of the magistrates; but the laugh was
                    always on the side of Shebbeare.</p><p>When his time was out, he set up for himself, then discovering a taste for
                    chemistry; soon after which he married an amiable young woman with no fortune,
                    but of respectable connections. Failing in business at Bideford, he went to
                    Bristol in 1736, entered into partnership with a chemist, and never afterwards
                    visited his native town.</p><p>He was at Paris in 1752, where he obtained, it is said, the degree of doctor in
                    medicine; a fact, however, which many are disposed to question.</p><p>His most celebrated performances were a series of letters to the People of
                    England, written in a vigorous and energetic style, well calculated to make an
                    impression on common readers. They galled the ministry, who at first were too
                    eager to punish the author. On the 12th of January 1758, Lord Holdernesse signed
                    a general warrant for apprehending the author, printer, and publishers of a
                    wicked, audacious, and treasonable libel, entitled “A Sixth Letter to the People
                    of England, on the progress of National Ruin; in which is shown that the present
                    grandeur of France and calamities of this nation are owing to the influence of
                    Hanover on the councils of England and having found them, to seize and apprehend
                    them, together with their books and papers.</p><p>Government having received information that a seventh letter was in the press,
                    all the copies were seized and suppressed by virtue of another warrant, dated
                    the 23d of January. In Easter term an information was filed against him by the
                    attorney-general, and on the 17th of June the information was tried, when
                    Shebbeare was found guilty; and on the 28th of November he received sentence, by
                    which he was fined L.5, ordered to stand in the pillory on the 5th of December
                    at Charing Cross, to be confined three years, and to give security for his good
                    behaviour for seven years, himself in L.500, and two others in L.250 each.
                    During his confinement, he declared he never received as presents more than
                    twenty guineas from all the world.</p><p>He was detained in prison during the whole time of the sentence, and with some
                    degree of rigour. At the termination of his sentence, a new reign commenced; and
                    shortly afterwards, during Mr Grenville’s administration, a pension of L.200 a
                    year was granted him by the crown, through the influence of Sir John Philips,
                    and he ever after became devoted to the service of government. He was of course
                    abused in almost every periodical work, which he seems in general to have had
                    the good sense to neglect. Dr Smollett introduced him, in no very respectful
                    light, under the name of Ferret, in Sir Launcelot Greaves; and Mr Hogarth made
                    him one of the group in the third election print.</p><p>His publications of a satirical, political, and medical nature amount to
                    thirty-four, besides a novel, called Filial Piety, in which hypocrisy and
                    blustering courage are very properly chastised. He died on the 1st of August
                    1788.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
