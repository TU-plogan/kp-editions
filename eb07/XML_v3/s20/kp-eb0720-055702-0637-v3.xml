                <p><label type="entry">STAFFORDSHIRE</label>, an inland English county of an oblong
                    form. Its greatest length from northeast to southwest is about sixty, and its
                    greatest breadth about thirty eight, miles. It contains 1148 statute square
                    miles, or 734,720 acres. It is bounded on the north by Cheshire, west by
                    Shropshire, south by Worcester and Warwickshire, and east by Derbyshire. The
                    great divisions are five hundreds; but as each of these is subdivided into the
                    north and south portions, there are effectively ten hundreds. These contain one
                    hundred and eighty-one parishes, twenty-three market towns, and one city. The
                    whole of the county, with the exception of two parishes, is within the diocese
                    of Lich field, and comprehended within the archdeaconry of Stafford.</p>
                <p>The population of this county at the four decennial periods of enumeration, was
                    found to be as follow: in 1801, 239,153; in 1811, 295,153; in 1821, 341,040; and
                    in 1831, 410,400.</p>
                <p>In 1831, the occupiers of land employing 1a bourers were 3,781</p>

                <p>In the same year, the number of families, chiefly employ ed in agriculture, was
                    found to be 18,156; of those chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, and
                    handicraft, 43,646; and of those not comprised in either of the preceding
                    classes, 21,789. The number of inhabited houses was 78,049, occupied by 83,593
                    families. The uninhabited houses were 4088, and those building 573. The annual
                    value of the real property of the county, as assessed for the purposes of the
                    property tax in the year 1813, was L.1,150,285.</p>
                <p>The towns and townships within this county, and their population in 1831, were as
                    follows, but some of them may be better described as large villages than
                    towns.</p>

                <p>The middle and southern portions are generally level, but interspersed with
                    gentle eminences. The northern division<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=638" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0638-0558"/>
                    is of an opposite character, the surface being for the most part bleak and
                    hilly. The general elevation of this district above the southern part of the
                    county is about two or three hundred feet; but some points rise to the height of
                    from 1200 to 1500. Of those the most elevated are Bunster and the Weever Hills.
                    In the valleys on the banks of the rivers are some tracks of country equal to
                    the most beautiful parts of the island. Among these, the district betwixt
                    Lichfield and Stone, and the picturesque banks of the Dove, especially at Ham,
                    are very remarkable.</p>
                <p>The soil is various, but the strong clays are the most pre dominant; next in
                    extent is the sandy soil, chiefly to the south of the Trent. There is no chalk,
                    and only a small district is calcareous. The meadows, especially on the banks of
                    the Trent, are most rich and luxuriant; and, though on some spots there is much
                    inert peat, yet, when it is properly drained, it becomes valuable pasture and
                    meadow land. The climate is generally raw and moist: the rain that falls on an
                    average of several years is about thirty-six inches. The quantity of snow, in
                    the winter on the moorlands, is very great, which may contribute to the general
                    coldness of the district.</p>
                <p>The Trent, the third river in England, is the principal stream of the county. It
                    rises at Newpool on the confines of Cheshire, and enters Derbyshire below
                    Burton, after having formed a junction with the Dove. Through the whole of its
                    course in this county, it is a clear and rather rapid stream. The Dove is
                    celebrated for the picturesque scenery through which it flows. In its course it
                    receives the Mani fold and the Hamps, two streams which are lost in
                    subterraneous channels, but again emerge at the distance of some miles, and
                    rejoin it. The smaller rivers are the Tame, the Blythe, the Sow, and the Penk,
                    all of which empty them selves into the Trent. No part of Great Britain is so
                    intersected with navigable canals as Staftbrdshire, and in no county have their
                    beneficial effects been so extensively <hi rend="italic">experienced.</hi> The
                    Grand Trunk was planned and executed by Mr. Brindley, the most eminent engineer
                    that ever exerted talent in this peculiar branch of inland navigation. This
                    canal is about ninety-one miles in length. The fall of water to the north is 326
                    feet, and to the south 316 feet. It is twenty-nine feet wide at the top, and
                    about four feet deep. It unites by navigation the internal trade of the great
                    marts of London, Liverpool, Hull, and Bristol. The branches that extend from it
                    in every direction are very numerous, and serve to connect the great shipping
                    ports with all those districts, in the centre of the kingdom, which produce
                    those heavy commodities of which the weight would make them almost worthless
                    without the means of cheap conveyance to distant markets</p>
                <p>That great work, the railroad from Liverpool to Birmingham, has been completed.
                    In proceeding northward it enters this county about a mile from Birmingham, and
                    continues in it for the distance of forty-five miles, when it enters Cheshire.
                    The whole distance of ninety-seven miles is commonly performed in four hours and
                    a half, including stop pages. The towns which, though not on the immediate line
                    of the road, are in communication with it, and at only a few miles distance,
                    are, in this county, West Bromwick, Walsall, Wolverhampton, Stafford, Stone,
                    Eccleshall, Utto exeter, Newcastle-under-Lyne, Stoke-upon-Trent, and the
                    Potteries. After passing through Cheshire and entering Lancashire, it separates
                    into two branches at Newton, the right proceeding to Manchester, and the left to
                    Liverpool, at the distance of ten miles from each of these towns.</p>
                <p>The chief mineral productions of the county are iron and coal, and these arc so
                    copious that they appear to be almost inexhaustible. Upwards of 50,000 acres
                    have been already ascertained to have beneath them beds of coal; and not
                    withstanding the length of time, and the extent to which they have been worked,
                    it is calculated that not one-tenth of their contents has been yet consumed. The
                    strata of this mineral, in the mines already worked, vary in thick ness from
                    twenty-four to thirty-six feet. Every portion of the coal district abounds in
                    iron ore; and the strata of that mineral are generally found beneath a stratum
                    of coal. Copper and lead are also raised, but not to an extent nearly
                    approaching that of iron. Limestone, freestone, alabaster, marble, ochre,
                    gypsum, and clays of various descriptions, applicable to the purposes of the
                    potteries, are most abundantly extracted from the bowels of the earth. Though
                    salt springs are both copious and richly impregnated with that mineral, no rock
                    salt has yet been discovered; but it is supposed there are some abundant
                    repositories of it be neath the surface.</p>
                <p>The relative proportion of the employment of the several families shows the great
                    preponderance of manufacturing labour in this county. The whole of the southern
                    part is occupied in the different working of metals. Wolverhampton is the chief
                    seat of the manufacture of locks, keys, hinges, bolts, and the heavier kinds of
                    iron ware. Walsall furnishes buckles, bitts, stirrups, spurs, and all the kinds
                    of hardware used by saddlers. Wednesbury supplies guns, iron axle-trees, saws,
                    trowels, hammers, edge tools, and cast iron work of every kind. Almost all the
                    villages in the vicinity of these towns contribute in a greater or less degree
                    to supply part of the work for which the town nearest to them is the great
                    mart.</p>
                <p>The northern part of Staffordshire is celebrated for the excellence of its
                    earthenware, with which it supplies the consumption of the greater portion of
                    the civilized world. The great extension of this manufacture has been owing to
                    the scientific skill and persevering energy of one distinguished individual, the
                    late Mr. Wedgew∞d; whose combinations of the different earths, and study of the
                    arts of design, have given a value to that which before was almost worthless,
                    and increased to a most wonderful extent the wealth of his neighbourhood, and
                    the number and comfort of its inhabitants. By means of the canals, the pipeclay
                    from Dorsetshire and Devonshire, and the flints from Kent, are brought to the
                    spots where the clays and coal abound; and the finished goods, by the same
                    means, are conveyed to the great shipping ports, from whence they are
                    distributed to all parts of the globe. Salt is made from natural springs at
                    Shirleyweck, and of late, at Lord Talbot’s works at Ingestrie, to such an extent
                    as to supply all those parts of the middle of the kingdom which are not in more
                    close connection with the refineries of Northwich or Droitwich. There are some
                    respectable establishments at Cheadle for making brass and copper goods. Shoes
                    are manufactured on an ex tensive scale at Stafford and at Newcastle. At
                    Tamworth are great works for printing calicoes. Burton has ale-breweries of
                    great celebrity, with manufactures of hats, and of several kinds of cotton
                    goods. At Leck there are large and flourishing establishments for ribbons,
                    handkerchiefs, ferrets, galloons, and other kinds of silk goods.</p>
                <p>In order to exhibit the proportion of employment in the several branches of
                    industry, we extract the notices from the returns under the population of 11
                    Geo. IV., cap. 30. “Eastward of West Bromwich, 1000 males are employed in the
                    further preparation of iron for the forges and workshops; 2200 are employed at
                    Tipton, 1200 at Walsall, 740 at Willenhall, 157 at Wednesfield, 444 at
                    Wednesbury, and 200 at Rowley Regis, in making guns and other firearms,
                    gas-tubes, chains, spades, locks and keys, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; and in
                    producing the more various and complex aids of human industry, which are
                    comprehended under the name of machinery. At the villages of Smith wick and
                    Handworth, near to Birmingham, 150 men are similarly occupied. Wolverhampton
                    contains 2000 men, who, in addition to articles before mentioned, are employed
                    in making domestic fire-irons, and turned and japanned iron<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=639" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0639-0559"/>
                    ware. Sedgley contains 500, and Kingswinford 200 manufacturers of the same kinds
                    of goods. At Tettenhall sixty men, and at Brewood 190 men are employed, with 500
                    in villages, in the less refined manufacture of stock-locks; and in most of the
                    places here enumerated, the more domestic manufacture of iron nails, furnishes
                    employment to 2500 men, and to a part of their families.</p>
                <p>“The other great manufacturing branch of the county, the pottery, is spread over
                    the vicinity of Newcastle; in which the town of Burslera contains 900 men and
                    their families; Shelton, a larger number; Longtown and Lane End, nearly 1000;
                    Parkhall, 700; Handley, 360; Fenton Cal vert, 300; and Sneyd, 150; all within
                    the parish of Stoke upon-Trent. In the town of Stafford 800 men are employed in
                    making shoes, and in the district of the potteries is some cotton trade. The
                    working of the coal mines alone, is a great source of occupation for men and
                    machinery.”</p>
                <p>The cultivated lands of this county are nearly all enclosed by good hedges,
                    chiefly of the white thorn, in fields of from twenty to thirty acres. The
                    general rotation of crops in the clayey soil is, 1st, fallow; 2d, wheat; 3d,
                    oats, after which they are laid down with clover, trefoil, and rye-grass, for
                    two or more years. On breaking up an old sward, the usual course is, 1st, oats;
                    2d, fallow; 3d, wheat; 4th, oats; and then the grasses. On the more friable
                    soils the rotation is, 1st, fallow; 2d, wheat; 3d, beans, or pease; 4th, oats,
                    and then the grasses. On the light soil, the Norfolk system of turnips, barley,
                    clover, and then wheat, is most commonly followed.</p>
                <p>The black cattle are generally of the long-horned breed, and of late years have
                    been much improved by the spirited exertions of some distinguished individuals.
                    The sheep are of different races; the new Leicesters are said to be the most
                    predominant. About Cannoch and Sutton Coldfield they have a breed much
                    resembling the South Downs. On the moorland there is a breed with white faces,
                    without horns, and long combing wool. The county is well stocked with timber,
                    especially on the estates of some of the great proprietors. The lands in an
                    unimproved state are still estimated to amount to nearly one-tenth part of the
                    whole county.</p>
                <p>The Roman antiquities are the Watling Street and the Ichnield roads, which pass
                    through the county; and the re mains of ancient stations or encampments. Here
                    the Saxons have left few remains that merit particular attention.</p>
                <p>This county gives titles to the following peers: that of marquis of Stafford, to
                    the eldest son of the duke of Sutherland; those of earls to Ferrers, Talbot,
                    Harrowby, and Lichfield. For parliamentary purposes, the county has been formed
                    into two divisions, distinguished by their position as North and South; each of
                    which elects two members to the House of Commons. The election for the northern
