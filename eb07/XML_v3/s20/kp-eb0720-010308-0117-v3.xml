                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SEPTUAGINT</label>, the name given to a Greek version of the
                    books of the Old Testament, from its being supposed to be the work of
                    seventy-two Jews, who are usually called the seventy interpreters, because
                    seventy is a round number.</p>
                <p>The history of this version has been expressly written by Aristaeas, an officer
                    of the guards to Ptolemy Philadelphus. Ptolemy having erected a noble library at
                    Alexandria, which he took care to fill with the most curious and valuable books
                    from all parts of the world, was informed that the Jews had one containing the
                    laws of Moses, and the history of that people; and being desirous of enriching
                    his library with a Greek translation of it, he applied to the high priest of the
                    Jews, and, to engage him to comply with his request, set at liberty all the Jews
                    whom his father Ptolemy Soter had reduced to slavery. After such a step, he
                    easily obtained what he desired. Eleazar the Jewish high priest sent back his
                    ambassadors with an exact copy of the Mosaical law, written in letters of gold,
                    and six elders of each tribe, in all seventy-two, who were received with marks
                    of respect by the king, and then conducted into the isle of Pharos, where they
                    were lodged in a house prepared for their reception, and supplied with every
                    thing necessary. They set about the translation without loss of time, which they
                    finished in seventy-two days; and the whole being read in presence of the king,
                    he admired the profound wisdom of the laws of Moses, and sent back the deputies
                    laden with presents, for themselves, the high priest, and the temple.</p>
                <p>Aristobulus, who was tutor to Ptolemy Physcon, Philo, who lived in our Saviour’s
                    time, and was contemporary with the apostles, and Josephus, speak of this
                    translation as made by seventy-two interpreters, in the reign of Ptolemy
                    Philadelphus. All the Christian writers during the first fifteen centuries of
                    the Christian era have admitted this account of the Septuagint as an undoubted
                    fact. But since the Reformation, critics have boldly called it in question,
                    because it was attended with circumstances which they think inconsistent, or at
                    least improbable. Dupin has asked, why were seventy-two interpreters employed,
                    since twelve would have been sufficient? Such an objection is trifling. We may
                    as well ask, why did King James I. employ fifty-four translators in rendering
                    the Bible into English, since Dupin thinks twelve would have been
                    sufficient?</p>
                <p>Prideaux objects, that the Septuagint is not written in the Jewish, but in the
                    Alexandrian dialect; and could not therefore be the work of natives of
                    Palestine. But these dialects were at that time probably the same, for both Jews
                    and Alexandrians had received the Greek language from the Macedonians about
                    fifty years before. Prideaux further contends, that all the books of the Old
                    Testament could not be translated at the same time; for they exhibit great
                    difference of style. To this it is sufficient to reply, that they were the work
                    of seventy-two men, each of whom had separate portions assigned him.</p>
                <p>The dean also urges, that Aristaeas, Aristobulus, Philo, and Josephus, all
                    directly tell us, that the law was translated, without mentioning any of the
                    other sacred books. But nothing was more common among writers of the Jewish
                    nation, than to give this name to the Scriptures as a whole. In the New
                    Testament, law is used as synonymous with what we call the Old Testament.
                    Besides, it is expressly said by Aristobulus, in a fragment quoted by Eusebius,
                    that the whole Sacred Scripture was rightly translated through the means of
                    Demetrius Phalereus, and by the command of Philadelphus. Josephus, indeed, says
                    the learned dean, asserts, in the preface to his Antiquities, that the Jewish
                    interpreters did not translate for Ptolemy the whole Scriptures, but the law
                    only. Here the evidence is contradictory, and we have to determine whether
                    Aristobulus or Josephus be most worthy of credit. We do not mean, however, to
                    accuse either of forgery, but only to inquire which had the best opportunities
                    of knowing the truth. Aristobulus was an Alexandrian Jew, tutor to an Egyptian
                    king, and lived within a hundred years after the translation was made, and
                    certainly had access to see it in the royal library. Josephus was a native of
                    Palestine, and lived not until three hundred years or more after the translation
                    was made, and many years after it was burned along with the whole library of
                    Alexandria in the wars of Julius Caesar. Supposing the veracity of these two
                    writers equal, as we have no proof of the contrary, which of them ought we to
                    consider as the best evidence? Aristobulus certainly. Prideaux, indeed, seems
                    doubtful whether there was ever such a man; and Dr Hody supposes that the
                    Commentaries on the five books of Moses, which bear the name of Aristobulus,
                    were a forgery of the second century. To prove the existence of any human being,
                    who lived two thousand years before us, and did not perform such works as no
                    mere man ever performed, is a task which we are not disposed to undertake; and
                    we believe that it would not be less difficult to prove that Philo and Josephus
                    existed, than that such a person as Aristobulus did not exist. If the writings
                    which have passed under his name were a forgery of the second century, it is
                    surprising that they should have imposed upon Clemens Alexandrinus, who lived in
                    the same century, and was a man of abilities, learning, and well acquainted<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=118"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0118-0104"/> with the writings of the ancients. Eusebius, too,
                    quotes the Commentaries of Aristobulus. But, continues the learned dean,
                    “Clemens Alexandrinus is the first author that mentions them. Now, had any such
                    commentaries existed in the time of Philo and Josephus, they would surely have
                    mentioned them.” But is the circumstance of its not being quoted by every
                    succeeding author a sufficient reason to disprove the authenticity of any book?
                    Neither Philo nor Josephus undertook to give a list of preceding authors, and it
                    was by no means the uniform practice of these times always to name the authors
                    from whom they derived their information.</p>
                <p>Prideaux further contends, that the sum which Ptolemy is said to have given to
                    the interpreters is too great to be credible. If his computation were just, it
                    certainly would be so. He makes it L.2,000,000 sterling; but other writers<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Blair’s Lectures on the
                    Canon.</p></note> reduce it to L.85,42l, and some to L.56,947, neither of which
                    is a sum so very extraordinary in so great and magnificent a prince as
                    Philadelphus, who spent, according to Athenaeus, not less than ten thousand
                    talents on the furniture of one tent, which is six times more than what was
                    spent in the whole of the embassy and translation, which amounted only to 1552
                    talents.</p>
                <p>Prideaux says, “that what convicts the whole story of Aristaeas of falsity is,
                    that he makes Demetrius Phalereus to be the chief actor in it, and a great
                    favourite of the king; whereas Philadelphus, as soon as his father was dead,
                    cast him into prison, where he soon after died.” But it may be replied, that
                    Philadelphus reigned two years jointly with his father Lagus, and it is not said
                    by Hermippus that Demetrius was out of favour with Philadelphus during his
                    father’s life. Now, if the Septuagint was translated in the beginning of the
                    reign of Philadelphus, as Eusebius and Jerome think, the difficulty will be
                    removed. Demetrius might have been librarian during the reign of Philadelphus,
                    and yet imprisoned on the death of Lagus. Indeed, as the cause of Philadelphus’s
                    displeasure was the advice which Demetrius gave to his father, to prefer the
                    sons of Arsinoë to the son of Bernice, he could scarcely show it till his
                    father’s death. The Septuagint translation might therefore be begun while
                    Philadelphus reigned jointly with his father, but not be finished till after his
                    father’s death.</p>
                <p>Besides the objections which have been considered, there is only one that
                    deserves notice. The ancient Christians not only differ from one another
                    concerning the time in which Aristobulus lived, but even contradict themselves
                    in different parts of their works. Sometimes they tell us he dedicated his book
                    to Ptolemy Philometer; at other times they say it was addressed to Philadelphus
                    and his father. Sometimes they make him the same person who is mentioned in
                    second Maccabees, and sometimes one of the seventy-two interpreters a hundred
                    and fifty-two years before. It is difficult to explain how authors fall into
                    such inconsistencies, but it is probably occasioned by their quoting from
                    memory. This was certainly the practice of almost all the early Christian
                    writers, and soractimes of the apostles themselves. Mistakes were therefore
                    inevitable. Josephus has varied in the circumstances of the same event, in his
                    Antiquities and Wars of the Jews, probably from the same cause; but we do not
                    hence conclude, that every circumstance of such a relation is entirely false. In
                    the account of the Marquis of Argyll’s death in the reign of Charles II. we have
                    a very remarkable contradiction. Lord Clarendon relates that he was condemned to
                    be hanged, which was performed the same day. On the contrary, Burnet, Wodrow,
                    Heath, and Echard, concur in stating that he was beheaded; and that he was
                    condemned upon the Saturday, and executed upon the Monday.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">* Biographia
                    Britannica.</hi></p></note> But was any reader of English history ever sceptical
                    enough to raise from hence a question, whether the Marquis of Argyll was
                    executed or not? Yet this ought to be left in uncertainty, according to the way
                    of reasoning in which the facts respecting the translation of the Septuagint are
                    attempted to be disproved.</p>
                <p>Such are the objections which Prideaux has raised against the common account of
                    the Septuagint translation, and such are the answers which may be given to them.
                    We have chosen to support that opinion which is sanctioned by historical
                    evidence, in preference to the conjectures of modern critics, however ingenious;
                    being persuaded that there are many things recorded in history, which, though
                    perfectly true, yet, from our imperfect knowledge of the concomitant
                    circumstances, may, at a distant period, seem liable to objections. To those who
                    require positive evidence, it may be stated thus. Aristaeas, Aristobulus, Philo,
                    and Josephus, assure us that the law was translated. Taking the law in the more
                    restricted sense, we have at least sufficient authority to assert that the
                    Pentateuch was rendered into Greek under Ptolemy Philadelphus. Aristobulus
                    affirms, that the whole Scriptures were translated by the seventy-two. Josephus
                    confines their labours to the books of Moses. He therefore who cannot determine
                    to which of the two the greater respect is due, may suspend his opinion. It is
                    certain, however, that many of the other books were translated before the age of
                    our Saviour; for they are quoted both by him and by his apostles; and, perhaps,
                    by a minute examination of ancient authors, in the same way that Dr Lardner has
                    examined the Christian fathers to prove the antiquity of the New Testament, the
                    precise period in which the whole books of the Septuagint were composed might,
                    with considerable accuracy, be ascertained.</p>
                <p>For four hundred years this translation was in high estimation with the Jews. It
                    was read in their synagogues in preference to the Hebrew, not only in those
                    places where Greek was the common language, but in many synagogues of Jerusalem
                    and Judaea. But when they saw that it was equally valued by the Christians, they
                    became jealous of it; and at length, in the second century, Aquila, an apostate
                    Christian, attempted to substitute another Greek translation in its place. In
                    this work he was careful to give the ancient prophecies concerning the Messiah a
                    different turn from the Septuagint, that they might not be applicable to Christ.
                    In the same design he was followed by Symmachus and Theodotion, who also, as St
                    Jerome informs us, wrote out of hatred to Christianity.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the Septuagint, from the ignorance, boldness, and carelessness
                    of transcribers, became full of errors. To correct these, Origen published a new
                    edition in the beginning of the third century, in which he placed the
                    translations of Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion. This edition was called <hi
                    rend="italic">Tetrapla,</hi> the translations being arranged opposite to one
                    another in four columns. He also added one column, containing the Hebrew text in
                    Hebrew letters, and another exhibiting it in Greek. In a second he published two
                    additional Greek versions, one of which was found at Nicoolis, and the other at
                    Jericho. This was called the <hi rend="italic">Hexapla.</hi> By comparing so
                    many translations, Origen endeavoured to form a correct copy of the Scriptures.
                    Where they all agreed, he considered them as right. The passages which he found
                    in the Septuagint, but not in the Hebrew text, he marked with an obelisk; what
                    he found in the Hebrew, but not in the Septuagint, he marked with an asterisk.
                    St Jerome says, that the additions which Origen made to the Septuagint, and
                    marked with an asterisk, were taken from Theodotion. From this valuable work of
                    Origen the version of the Septuagint was transcribed in a separate volume, with
                    the asterisks and obelisks for the use of the churches; and from this
                    circumstance the great work itself was neglected and lost.<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=119" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0119-0105"/>
                    About the year 300, two new editions of the Septuagint were published; the one
                    by Hesychius, an Egyptian bishop, and the other by Lucian, a presbyter of
                    Antioch. But as these authors did not mark with any note of distinction the
                    alterations which they had made, their edition does not possess the advantages
                    of Origen’s.</p>
                <p>The best edition of the Septuagint is that of Dr Grabe, which was published in
                    the beginning of the last century. He had access to two manuscripts nearly of
                    equal antiquity, the one found in the Vatican library at Rome, the other in the
                    royal library at St James’s, which was presented to Charles I. by Cyril,
                    patriarch of Alexandria, and hence is commonly called the Alexandrian
                    Manuscript. Anxious to discover which of these was according to the edition of
                    Origen, Dr Grabe collected the fragments of the Hexapla, and found that they
                    agreed with the Alexandrian Manuscript, but not with the Vatican where it
                    differed with the other. Hence he concluded that the Alexandrian Manuscript was
                    taken from the edition of Origen. By comparing the quotations from Scripture in
                    the works of Athanasius and St Cyril, who were patriarchs of Alexandria at the
                    time St Jerome says Hesychius’s edition of the Septuagint was used there, with
                    the Vatican manuscript, he found they agreed so well that he justly inferred
                    that the manuscript was taken from the edition of Hesychius.</p>
                <p>This version was in use to the time of our blessed Saviour, and is that out of
                    which most of the citations in the New Testament from the Old are taken. It was
                    also the ordinary and canonical translation made use of by the Christian church
                    in the earliest ages; and it still subsists in the churches both of the east and
                    the west.</p>

                    chronology which is formed from the dates and periods of time mentioned in the
                    Septuagint translation of the Old Testament. It reckons 1500 years more from the
                    creation to Abraham than does the Hebrew Bible. Dr Kennico, in the dissertation
                    prefixed to his Hebrew Bible, has shown it to be very probable that the
                    chronology of the Hebrew Scriptures, since the period just mentioned, was
                    corrupted by the Jews between the years 175 and 200, and that the chronology of
                    the Septuagint is more agreeable to the truth. It is a fact, that during the
                    second and third centuries the Hebrew Scriptures were almost entirely in the
                    hands of the Jews, while the Septuagint was confined to the Christians. The Jews
                    had therefore a very favourable opportunity for this corruption. The following
                    is the reason which is given by oriental writers. It being a very ancient
                    tradition that the Messiah was to come in the sixth chiliad, because he was to
                    come in the last days, the contrivance was to shorten the age of the world from
                    about 5500 to 3760, and thence to prove that Jesus could not be the Messiah. Dr
                    Kennico adds, that some Hebrew copies having the larger chronology were extant
                    till the time of Eusebius, and some till the year 700.</p>
