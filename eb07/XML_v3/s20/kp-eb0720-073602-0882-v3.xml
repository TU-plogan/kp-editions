                    have been defined bodies which are insipid, not ductile, nor inflammable, nor
                    soluble in water. For a view of the classification of stones, and of their
                    distribution, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mineralogy</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Geology.</hi></p><p>Some philosophers say that stones are vegetables; that they grow and increase in
                    size like a plant. This theory, we believe, was first offered to the world by Μ.
                    Tournefort, in the year 1702, after returning from his travels in the East. It
                    was founded on a curious fact. In surveying the labyrinth of Crete, he observed
                    that the names which visitors bad engraved upon the rock were not formed of
                    hollow, but of prominent letters, like basso-relievos. He supposes that these
                    letters were at first hollowed out by knives; that the hollows have since been
                    filled up by the growth of the stone; and hence he concludes that stones
                    vegetate. We wish we were fully assured of the fact, that the letters were at
                    first hollowed, before we attempt to account for their prominency. But even
                    allowing the supposition to be true that they were at first hollow, we reply it
                    is only a single fact, and that from a single fact it is altogether
                    unphilosophical to deduce a general system. In the second place, this
                    protuberancy of the characters is very improperly called vegetation, for it is
                    not produced by a process in any respect like the vegetation of a plant.
                    Vegetation supposes vessels containing fluids, and growth by expansion; but who
                    ever heard of vessels in a stone, of fluids moving in them, or of the different
                    parts expanding and swelling like the branch or trunk of a tree? Even the fact
                    which Tournefort mentions proves nothing. He does not pretend to say that the
                    rock itself is increasing, but only that a few small hollows are filled with new
                    stony matter, which rises a little above the surrounding surface of the rock.
                    This matter evidently has been once liquid, and at length has congealed in the
                    channel into which it had run. But is not this easily explained by a common
                    process, the formation of stalactites? When water charged with calcareous matter
                    is exposed to the action of air, the water evaporates, and leaves the calcareous
                    earth behind, which hardens and becomes like a stone.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hocking</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Stone,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Logan,</hi> a stone of a prodigious size, so exactly poised that
                    it would rock or shake with the smallest force. Of these stones the ancients
                    give us some account. Pliny says, that at Harpasa, a town of Asia, there was a
                    rock of such a wonderful nature, that if touched with the finger it would shake,
                    but could not be moved from its place with the whole force of the body. Ptolemy
                    mentions a gygonian stone near the ocean, which was agitated when struck by the
                    stalk of an asphodel, but could not be removed by a great exertion of force. The
                    word <hi rend="italic">gygonius</hi> seems to be Celtic; for <hi rend="italic">gwingog</hi> signifies <hi rend="italic">motitans,</hi> the rocking stone.</p><p>Many rocking stones are to be found in different parts of this island; some
                    natural, others artificial, or placed in their position by human art. In the
                    parish of St Lcven, Cornwall, there is a promontory called <hi rend="italic">Castle Treryn.</hi> On the western side of the middle group, near the top, lies
                    a very large stone, so evenly poised that any hand may move it from one side to
                    another; yet it is so fixed on its base that no lever nor any mechanical force
                    can remove it from its present situation. It is called the <hi rend="italic">Logan-stone,</hi> and is at such a height from the ground that no person can
                    believe that it was raised to its present position by art. But there<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=883" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0883-0737"/> are other rocking stones, which are so shaped and
                    so situated, that there can be no doubt but they were erected by human strength.
                    Of this kind Borlase thinks the great <hi rend="italic">Quoit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Karn-lehau,</hi> in the parish of Ty widnek, to be. It is
                    thirty-nine feet in circumference, and four feet thick at a medium, and stands
                    on a single pedestal. There is also a remarkable stone of the same kind in the
                    island of St Agnes in Scilly. The under rock is ten feet six inches high,
                    forty-seven feet round the middle, and touches the ground with no more than half
                    its base. The upper rock rests on one point only, and is so nicely balanced that
                    two or three men with a pole can move it. It is eight feet six inches high, and
                    forty-seven in circumference. On the top there is a basin hollowed out, three
                    feet eleven inches in diameter at a medium, but wider at the brim, and three
                    feet deep. From the globular shape of this upper stone, it is highly probable
                    that it was rounded by human art, and perhaps even placed on its pedestal by
                    human strength. In Sithney parish, near Helston, in Cornwall, stood the famous
                    logan or rocking stone, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Men Amber,</hi> q. d.
                    <hi rend="italic">Men an Bar,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">top-slone.</hi> It
                    was eleven feet by six, and four high, and so nicely poised on another stone
                    that a little child could move it, and all travellers who came this way desired
                    to see it. But Shrubsall, Cromwell’s governor of Pendennis, with much ado caused
                    it to be undermined, to the great grief of the country. There are some marks of
                    the tool on it, and, from its quadrangular shape, it was probably dedicated to
                    Mercury.</p><p>That the rocking stones are monuments erected by the Druids, has by some writers
                    been taken for granted; but tradition has not informed us for what purpose they
                    were intended. Mr Toland thinks that the Druids made the people believe that
                    they alone could move them, and that by a miracle; and that by this pretended
                    miracle they condemned or acquitted the accused, and brought criminals to
                    confess what could not otherwise be extorted from them. How far this conjecture
                    is right, we shall leave to those who are deeply versed in the knowledge of
                    antiquities to determine.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sonorous</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Stone,</hi> a kind
                    of stone remarkable for emitting an agreeable sound when struck, and much used
                    in China for making musical instruments which they call <hi rend="italic">king.</hi> The various kinds of sonorous stones known in China differ
                    considerably from one another in beauty, and in the strength and duration of
                    their tone; and what is very surprising is, that this difference cannot be
                    discovered either by the different degrees of their hardness, weight, or
                    fineness of grain, or by any other qualities which might be supposed to
                    determine it. Some stones are found remarkably hard, which are very sonorous;
                    and others exceedingly soft, which have an excellent tone; some extremely heavy
                    emit a very sweet sound; and there are others as light as pumice-stone which
                    have also an agreeable sound.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
