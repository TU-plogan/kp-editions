                    It is the first town in the county of Essex, on the road from London, and, being
                    connected with Middlesex by a bridge, said to be the oldest in England, over the
                    river Lea, may be considered a suburb of the metropolis. It is in the hundred of
                    Beacontree, and within the parish of West Ham. The soil is rich, but marshy, and
                    intersected with canals and streams. Like the other suburbs of London, it has
                    much increased in population, as well as industrious pursuits. The East India
                    Docks are within the parish. One of the pursuits in this place is that of
                    practical chemistry, on a large scale, for making magnesia, the volatile salts,
                    Prussian blue, and other preparations. There are, besides, bleachers,
                    calico-printers, brewers, distillers, and millers. The parish of West Ham is
                    divided into four parts, but the division of Stratford is by very far the
                    largest, though not distinguished in the decennial population returns. The
                    number of souls in the parish of West Ham amounted in 1801 to 6485, in 1811 to
                    8136, in 1821 to 9753, and in 1831 to 11,580.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stratford,</hi><hi rend="italic">Fenny,</hi> a market-town
                    in the county of Buckingham, seven miles from Stony Stratford, and forty-six
                    from London. It is in the hundred of Newport, and is a chapelry of the parish of
                    Blechley. Being on the great road from London to the north of England, and to
                    Scotland, as well as to Ireland, this place chiefly depends on the money spent
                    by travellers. It consists of one long street, on a rising ground, with the
                    river Lofield in the bottom. There is a chapel of ease, dedicated to St Martin.
                    The mother-church at Blechley, a mile and a half distant, is an elegant
                    structure. There was formerly some employment in making lace, which has of late
                    declined; but there is some trade by the Grand Junction Canal, and more is
                    expected when the railway from London to Birmingham is completed. The population
                    amounted in 1801 to 469, in 1811 to 481, in 1821 to 521, and in 1831 to 635, but
                    in the whole parish to 1254.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stratford,</hi><hi rend="italic">Stony,</hi> a market-town
                    in the hundred of Newport and county of Buckingham, fifty-two miles from London.
                    It stands on the Ouse, which divides it from Northamptonshire, and is on the
                    Roman or Watling Street road. It is partly in the parish of Calderton, and
                    partly in that of Wolverton, and had a church, or rather a chapel of ease, to
                    each of these parishes, both of which were burnt in 1742; but a new one has been
                    erected, and is a handsome structure, dedicated to St Giles. The town consists
                    of one street, nearly a mile in length, with well-built houses on each side,
                    mostly constructed of freestone. It has a good market on Friday, and but little
                    trade on other days, as may be inferred from the state of its population, which
                    amounted in 1801 to 1653, in 1811 to 1488, in 1821 to 1499, and in 1831 to
                    1619.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stratford-on-Avon,</hi> a town in the hundred of Bar-lichway
                    and county of Warwick, ninety-four miles from London. It stands on the navigable
                    river Avon, over which is a bridge of fourteen arches. It is moderately well
                    built, and has some trade in corn and malt, but no manufactures. It is chiefly
                    remarkable as the birth-place of Shakspeare, whose memory has here been
                    celebrated by splendid pageants. In the guild-hall is a large room, called
                    Shakspeare’s, with a portrait of him and of the celebrated actor Garrick. The
                    inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2418, in 1811 to 2842, in 1821 to 3069, and in
                    1831 to 3488.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
