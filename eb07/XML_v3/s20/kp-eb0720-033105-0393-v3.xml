                <p><label type="entry">SIGNALS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Naval</hi></label>. When we
                    read at our fire-side the account of an engagement, or other interesting
                    operation of an army, our attention is generally so much engaged by the results,
                    that we give but little to the movements which led to them, and produced them;
                    and we seldom form to ourselves any distinct notion of the conduct of the day.
                    But a professional man, or one accustomed to reflection, and who is not
                    satisfied with the mere indulgence of eager curiosity, follows every regiment in
                    its movements, endeavours to see their connection, and the influence which they
                    have had on the fate of the day, and even to form to himself a general notion of
                    the whole scene of action, at its different interesting periods. He looks with
                    the eye of the general, and sees his orders succeed or fad.</p>
                <p>But few trouble themselves farther about the narration. The movement is ordered;
                    it is performed; and the fortune of the day is determined. Few think how all
                    this is brought about; and when they are told that during the whole of the
                    battle of Custrin, Frederick the Great was in the upper room of a country inn,
                    whence he could view the whole field, whilst his aides-de-camp, on horseback,
                    waited his orders in the yard below, they are struck with wonder, and can hardly
                    conceive how it can be done, but, on reflection, they see the possibility of the
                    thing. Their imagination accompanies the messenger from the inn yard to the
                    scene of action; they hear the general’s orders delivered, and they expect its
                    execution.</p>
                <p>But when we think for a moment on the situation of the commander of a fleet,
                    confined on board one ship, and this ship as much, or more closely, engaged,
                    than any other of<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=394"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0394-0332"/> the fleet; and when we reflect that here are no
                    messengers ready to carry his orders to ships of the squadron at the distance of
                    miles from him, and to deliver them with precision and distinctness, and that
                    even if this were possible by sending small ships or boats, the vicissitudes of
                    wind and weather may render the communication so tedious, that the favourable
                    moment may be irretrievably lost before the order can be conveyed. When we think
                    of all these circumstances, our thoughts are bewildered, and we are ready to
                    imagine that a sea battle is nothing but the unconnected struggle of individual
                    ships; and that when the admiral has once “cried havoc, and let slip the dogs of
                    war,” he has done all that his situation empowers him to do, and he must leave
                    the fate of the day to the bravery and skill of his captains and sailors.</p>
                <p>Yet it is in this situation, apparently the most unfavourable, that the orders of
                    the commander can be conveyed, with a dispatch that is not attainable in the
                    operations of a land army. The scene of action is unincumbered, so that the eye
                    of the general can behold the whole without, interruption. The movements which
                    it is possible to execute, are few, and they are precise. A few words are
                    sufficient to order them, and then the mere fighting the ships must always be
                    left to their respective commanders. This simplicity in the duty to be performed
                    has enabled us to frame a language fully adequate to the business in hand, by
                    which a correspondence can be kept up as far as the eye can see. This is the
                    language of <hi rend="italic">signals,</hi> a language by writing, addressed to
                    the eye, and which he that runneth may read. As in common writing certain
                    arbitrary marks are agreed on to express certain sounds used in speech, or
                    rather, as in hieroglyphics, certain arbitrary marks are agreed on to express
                    certain thoughts, or the subjects of these thoughts; so here certain exhibitions
                    are made, which are agreed on to express certain movements to be executed by the
                    commander to whom they are addressed, and all are enjoined to keep their eyes
                    fixed on the ship of the conductor of the fleet, that they may learn his
                    will.</p>
                <p>It is scarcely possible for any number of ships to act in concert, without some
                    such mode of communication between the general and the commanders of private
                    ships. We have no direct information of this circumstance in the naval tactics
                    of the ancient nations, the Greeks and Romans; yet the necessity of the thing is
                    so apparent, that we cannot suppose it to have been omitted by the most
                    ingenious and the most cultivated people who have appeared on the great theatre
                    of the world; and we are persuaded that Themistocles, Conon, and other renowned
                    naval commanders of Athens, had signals by which they directed the movements of
                    their fleets. We read, that when Aegeus sent his son Theseus to Crete, it was
                    agreed on, that if the ship should bring the young prince back in safety, a
                    white flag should be displayed. But those on board, in their joy for revisiting
                    their country after their perilous voyage, forgot to hoist the concerted signal.
                    The anxious father was every day expecting the ship which should bring back his
                    darling son, and had gone to the shore to look out for her. He saw her, but
                    without the signal agreed on; on which the old man threw himself into the sea.
                    We find, too, in the history of the Punic wars by Polybius, frequent allusions
                    to such a mode of communication; and Ammianus Marcellinus speaks of the <hi
                    rend="italic">speculatores</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vexillarii,</hi> who were
                    on board the ships in the Adriatic. The coins both of Greece and Rome exhibit
                    both flags and streamers. In short, we cannot doubt of the ancients having
                    practised this hieroglyphical language. It is somewhat surprising that Lord
                    Dudley, in his <hi rend="italic">Arcano del Mare,</hi> in which he makes an
                    ostentatious display of his knowledge of every thing connected with tire naval
                    service, makes no express mention of this very essential piece of knowledge,
                    although he must, by his long residence in Italy, have known the marine
                    discipline of the</p>
                <p>Venetians and Genoese, the greatest maritime powers then in Europe.</p>
                <p>In the naval occurrences of modern Europe, mention is frequently made of signals.
                    Indeed, as we have already observed, it seems impossible for a number of ships
                    to act in any kind of concert, without some method of communication. Numberless
                    situations must occur, When it would be impossible to convey orders or
                    information by messengers from one ship to another, and coast and alarm signals
                    had long been practised by every nation. The idea, therefore, was familiar. We
                    find, in particular, that Queen Elizabeth, on occasion of the expedition to
                    Cadiz, ordered her secretaries to draw up instructions, which were to be
                    communicated to the admiral, the general, and the five coun-scllors of war, and
                    by them to be copied and transmitted to the several ships of the navy, not to be
                    opened till they should arrive in a certain latitude. It was on this occasion,
                    says our historian Guthrie, “that we meet with the first regular sets of signals
                    and orders to the commanders of the English fleet.” But till the movements of a
                    fleet have attained some sort of uniformity, regulated and connected by some
                    principles of propriety, and agreed on by persons in the habit of directing a
                    number of ships, we may with confidence affirm that signals would be nothing but
                    a parcel of arbitrary marks, appropriated to particular pieces of naval service,
                    such as attacking the enemy, landing the soldiers, and the like; and that they
                    would be considered merely as referring to the final result, but by no means
                    pointing out the mode of execution, or directing the movements which were
                    necessary for performing it.</p>
                <p>It was James II. when Duke of York, who first considered this practice as capable
                    of being reduced into a system, and who saw the importance of such a
                    composition. He, as well as the king his brother, had always showed a great
                    predilection for the naval service; and when appointed admiral of England, he
                    turned his whole attention to its improvement. He had studied the art of war
                    under Turenne, not as a pastime, but as a science, and was a favourite pupil of
                    that most accomplished general. Turenne one day pointed him out, saying, “Behold
                    one who will be one of the first princes and greatest generals of Europe.” When
                    admiral of England, he endeavoured to introduce into the maritime service all
                    those principles of concert and arrangement which made a number of individual
                    regiments and squadrons compose a great army. When he commanded in the Dutch
                    war, he found a fleet to be little better than a collection of ships, on board
                    of each of which the commander and his ship’s company did their best to annoy
                    the enemy, but with very little dependence on each other, or on the orders of
                    the general; and in the different actions which the English fleet had with the
                    Dutch, everything was confusion as soon as the battle began. It is remarkable
                    that the famous pensionary De Witt, who from a statesman became a navigator and
                    a great sea commander in a few weeks, made the same representation to the States
                    General on his return from his first campaign.</p>
                <p>In the memoirs of James II. written by himself, we have the following passage:
                    “1665. On the 15th of March, the Duke of York went to Gunfleet, the general
                    rendezvous of the fleet, and hastened their equipment. He ordered all the flag
                    officers on board with him every morning, to agree on the order of battle and
                    rank. In former battles, no order was kept, and this under the Duke of York, was
                    the first in which fighting in a line and regular form of a battle was
                    observed.” This must be considered as full authority for giving the Duke of York
                    the honour of the invention. For whatever faults may be laid to the charge of
                    this unfortunate prince, his word and honour stand unimpeached. And we are
                    anxious to vindicate his claim to it, because our neighbours the French, as
                    usual, would take the merit of this invention, and of the whole of naval
                    tactics, to them-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=395"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0395-0333"/> selves. True it is, that Colbert, the great and
                    justly celebrated minister of Louis XIV. created a navy tor his ambitious and
                    vain-glorious master, and gave it a constitution which may be a model for other
                    nations to copy. By his encouragement, men of the greatest scientific eminence
                    were engaged to contribute to its improvement; and they gave us the first
                    treatises of naval evolutions. But it must ever be remembered, that our
                    accomplished, though misguided sovereign, was then residing at the court of
                    Louis; that he had formerly acted in concert with the French as a commander and
                    flag officer, and was at this very time aiding them with his knowledge of
                    nautical affairs. In the memorable day at La Hogue, the gallant Russel,
                    observing one of Tourville’s movements, exclaimed, “There, they have got
                    Pepys<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pepys was
                    secretary to the Duke of York.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> amongst
                    them.” This anecdote w∙e give on the authority of a friend, who heard an old and
                    respectable officer, Admiral Clinton, say, that he had it from a gentleman who
                    was in the action, and heard the words spoken; and we trust that our readers
                    will not be displeased at having this matter of general opinion established on
                    some good grounds.</p>
                <p>It was on this occasion, then, that the Duke of York made the movements and
                    evolutions of a fleet the object of his particular study, reduced them to a
                    system, and composed that System of Sailing and Fighting Instructions, which has
                    ever since been considered as the code of discipline for the British navy, and
                    which has been adopted by our rivals and neighbours as the foundation of their
                    naval tactics. It does great honour to its author, although its merit will not
                    appear very eminent to a careless surveyor, on account of the very simplicity
                    which constitutes its chief excellence. It is unquestionably the result of much
                    sagacious reflection add painful combination of innumerable circumstances, all
                    of which have their influence; and it is remarkable, that although succeeding
                    commanders have improved the subject by several subordinate additions, no change
                    has to this day been made in its general principles or maxims of evolution.</p>
                <p>Till some such code be established, it is evident that signals can be nothing but
                    arbitrary and unconnected hieroglyphics, to be learned by rote, and retained by
                    memory, without any exercise of the judgment; and the acquisition of this branch
                    of nautical skill must be a more irksome task than that of learning the Chinese
                    writing. But such a code being once settled, the character in which it may be
                    expressed becomes a matter of rational discussion.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, the sailing and fighting instructions of the Duke of York were
                    accompanied by a set of signals for directing the chief or most frequent
                    movements of the fleet. These also were contrived with so much judgment, and
                    such attention to distinctness, simplicity, and propriety, that there has hardly
                    been any change found necessary; and they are still retained in the Britsh navy
                    as the usual signals in all cases when we are not anxious to conceal Our
                    movements from an enemy.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this acknowledged merit of the Duke of York’s signals, it must be
                    admitted that great improvements have been made on this subject, considered as
                    an art. The art military has, in the course of a century past, become almost an
                    appropriate calling, and has therefore been made the peculiar study of its
                    professors. Our rivals the French were sooner and more formally placed in this
                    situation; and the ministers of Louis XIV. took infinite and most judicious
                    pains to make their military men superior to all others by their academical
                    education. A more scientific turn was given to their education, and the
                    assistance of scientific men was liberally given them; and all the nations of
                    Europe must acknowledge some obligations to them for information on everything
                    connected with the art of war. They have attended very much to this subject,
                    have greatly improved it, and have even introduced a Dew principle into the art;
                    and by this means have reduced it to the most simple form of reference to the
                    code of sailing and fighting instructions, by making the signals immediately
                    expressive, not of orders, but of simple numbers. These numbers being prefixed
                    to the various articles of the code of instructions, the officer who sees a
                    signal thrown out by the admiral, reads the number and reports it to his
                    captain, perhaps without knowing to what it relates. Thus simplicity and
                    secrecy, with an unlimited power of variation, are combined. We believe that M.
                    de la Bourdonnais, a brave and intelligent officer, during the war 1758, was the
                    author of this ingenious thought.</p>
                <p>We do not propose to give a system of British signals. This would evidently be
                    improper. But we shall show our readers the practicability of this curious
                    language, the extent to which it may be carried, and the methods which may be
                    practised in accomplishing this purpose. This may make it an object of attention
                    to scientific men, who can improve it; and the young officer will not only be
                    able to read the orders of the commander-in-chief, but will not be at a loss,
                    should circumstances place him in a situation where he must issue orders to

                <p>They must also be distinguished into, First, Signals of Evolution, addressed to
                    the whole Fleet, or to Squadrons of the fleet, or to Divisions of these
                    squadrons; secondly, Signals of Movements to be made by particular ships; and,
                    thirdly, Signals of Service, which may be either general or particular.</p>
                <p>The great extent of a large fleet, the smoke in time of battle, and the situation
                    of the commander-in-chief, who is commonly In the midst of the greatest
                    confusion and hottest fire, frequently makes it very difficult for the officers
                    of distant ships to perceive his signals with distinctness. Frigates, therefore,
                    are stationed out of the line, to windward or to leeward, whose sole office it
                    is to observe the admiral’s signals, and instantly to repeat them. The eyes of
                    all the signal officers in the private ships of war are directed to the
                    repeating frigates, as well as to the admiral; and the officers of the repeating
                    frigate, having no other duty, observe the admiral incessantly, and, being
                    unembarrassed by the action, can display the signal with deliberation, so that
                    it may be very distinctly seen. Being minutely acquainted with the substitutions
                    which must be made on board the admiral when his masts and rigging are in
                    disorder, his perhaps imperfect signal is exhibited by the repeating frigate in
                    its proper form, so as to be easily understood. And to facilitate this
                    communication, the commanders of the different squadrons repeat the signals of
                    the commander-in-chief, and the commanders of division repeat the signals of the
                    commanders of their squadron.</p>
                <p>Every evolution signal is preceded by a signal of advertisement and preparation,
                    which is general, and frequently by a gun, to call attention; and when all the
                    signals have been made which direct the different parts of that evolution,
                    another signal is made, which marks the close of the complex signal, and divides
                    it from others which may immediately follow it: And as the orders of the
                    commander-in-chief may relate either to the movements of the whole fleet, those
                    of a single division, or those of certain private ships, the Executive Signal,
                    which dictates the particular movement, is accompanied by a Directive Signal, by
                    which these ships are pointed out, to which the order is addressed.</p>
                <p>The commander of a ship to which any signal is addressed, is generally required
                    to signify by a signal, which is ge<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=396" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0396-0334"/>
                    neral, that he has observed it. And if he does not thoroughly understand its
                    meaning, he intimates this by another general signal. And here it is to be
                    observed, that as soon as the signal is answered by the ships to which it is
                    addressed, it is usual to haul it down, to avoid the confusion which might arise
                    from others being hoisted in the same place. The order remains till executed,
                    notwithstanding that the signal is hauled down.</p>
                <p>It may happen that the commander who throws out the signal for any piece of
                    service, sees reasons for altering his plan. He intimates this by a general
                    annulling signal, accompanying the signal already given. This will frequently be
                    more simple than to make the signals for the movements which would be required
                    for re-establishing the ships in their former situation.</p>
                <p>All these things are of very easy comprehension, and require little thought for
                    their contrivance. But when we come to the particular evolutions and movements,
                    and to combine these with the circumstances of situation in which the fleet may
                    be at the time, it is evident that much reflection is necessary for framing a
                    body of signals which may be easily exhibited, distinctly perceived and well
                    understood, with little risk of being mistaken one for another. We shall take
                    notice of the circumstances which chiefly contribute to give them these
                    qualities as we proceed in describing their different classes.</p>
                <p> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Day Signals.</hi></p>
                <p>These are made by means of signals of different colours; but before we proceed to
                    the description of the signals by means of colours, such as flags, banners, or
                    triangular flags, pendants, or vanes, we must take notice of the ostensible
                    distinctions of the various divisions and subdivisions of a fleet, so that we
                    may understand how the same signal may be addressed to a squadron, division, or
                    single ship or ships. We suppose it known that a fleet of ships of war is
                    distributed into three grand divisions, which we shall term squadrons, called
                    the van, centre, and rear. These denominations have not always a relation to the
                    one being more advanced than the other, either towards the enemy or in the
                    direction of their course.</p>
                <p>In a land army, the position of every part is conceived from its reference to the
                    enemy; and the reader, conceiving himself as facing the enemy, easily
                    understands the terms van, centre, and rear, the right and left wing, and so
                    forth. But the movements of a sea army having a necessary dependence on the
                    wind, they cannot be comprehended unless expressed in a language which keeps
                    this circumstance continually in view. The simplest and most easily conceived
                    disposition of a fleet, is that in which it is almost indispensably obliged to
                    form in order to engage an enemy. This is a straight line, each ship directly
                    ahead of its neighbour, and close-hauled. This is therefore called the line of
                    battle. In this position, the two extremities of the fleet correspond to the
                    right and left wings of an army. Suppose this line to be in the direction east
                    and west, the wind blowing from the north-north-west, and therefore the fleet on
                    the starboard tack; the ships’ heads are to the west, and the westermost
                    division is undoubtedly the van of the fleet, and the eastermost division is the
                    rear. And it is in conformity to this arrangement and situation that the list of
                    the fleet is drawn up. But the ships may be on the same east and west line,
                    close-hauled, with their heads to the west, but the wind blowing from the
                    south-south-west. They must therefore be on the larboard tack. The same ships,
                    and the same division, are still, in fact, the van of the fleet. But suppose the
                    ships’ heads to be to the eastward, and that they are close-hauled, having the
                    wind from the south-southeast or the north-north-east, the ships which were the
                    real van on both tacks in the former situation, are now, in fact, the rear on
                    both tacks; yet they retain the denomination of the van squadron of this fleet,
                    and are under the immediate direction of the officer of the second rank, while
                    the other extremity is under the direction of the third officer. This
                    subordination therefore is rather an arrangement of rank and precedence than of
                    evolution. It is, however, considered as the natural order to which the general
                    signals must be accommodated. For this reason, the division which is denominated
                    van in the list of this fleet, is generally made to lead the fleet when in the
                    line of battle on the starboard tack, and to form the weathermost column in the
                    order of sailing in columns; and, in general, it occupies that station from
                    which it can most easily pass into the place of the leading division on the
                    starboard line of battle ahead. Although this is a technical nicety of language,
                    and may frequently puzzle a landsman in reading an account of naval operations,
                    the reflecting and intelligent reader will see the propriety of retaining this
                    mode of conceiving the subordinate arrangement of a fleet, and will comprehend
                    the employment of the signals which are necessary for re-establishing this
                    arrangement, or directing the movements while another arrangement is
                    retained.</p>
                <p>This being understood, it is easy to contrive various methods of distinguishing
                    every ship by the place which she occupies in the fleet, both with respect to
                    the whole line, with respect to the particular squadron, the particular division
                    of that squadron, and the particular place in that division. This may be done by
                    a combination of the position and colour of the pendants and vanes of each ship.
                    Thus the colour of the pendants may indicate the squadron, their position or
                    mast on which they are hoisted may mark the division of that squadron, and a
                    distinguishing vane may mark the place of the private ship in her own division.
                    The advantages attending this method are many. In a large fleet it would hardly
                    be possible for the commander-in-chief to find a sufficient variety of single
                    signals to mark the ship to which an order is addressed, by hoisting it along
                    with the signal appropriated to the intended movement. But by this contrivance
                    one-third part of these signals of address is sufficient. It also enables the
                    commander-in-chief to order a general change of position by a single signal,
                    which otherwise would require several. Thus, suppose that the fore, main, and
                    mizen masts, are appropriated, with the proper modifications, for exhibiting the
                    signals addressed to the van, the centre, and the rear squadrons of the fleet,
                    and that a red, a white, and a blue flag, are chosen for the distinguishing
                    flags of the officers commanding these squadrons; then, if the
                    commander-in-chief shall hoist a red flag at his mizen topgallant mast-head, it
                    must direct the van squadron to take the position then occupied by the rear
                    squadron, the evolution necessary for accomplishing this end being supposed
                    known by the commander of the squadron, who will immediately make the necessary
                    signals to the squadron under his particular direction. In the same manner, the
                    distinguishing signal for the leading ship of a squadron being hoisted along
                    with the signal of address to the whole fleet, and the signal for any particular
                    service, will cause the three or the nine leading ships to execute that
                    order.</p>
                <p>All that has been said hitherto may be considered as so many preparations for the
                    real issuing of orders by the commander-in-chief. The most difficult part of the
                    language remains, viz. to invent a number of signals which shall correspond to
                    that almost infinite variety of movements and services which must be
                    performed.</p>
                <p>Distinctness, simplicity, and propriety, are the three essential qualities of all
                    signals. A signal must be some object easily seen, strongly marked, so that it
                    may be readily understood, with little risk of its being mistaken for another.
                    When made by flags, banners, or pendants, they must be of the fullest colours,
                    and strongest contrasts. The ships are frequently at a very great distance, so
                    that the inter<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=397"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0397-0335"/> vening air occasions a great degradation of
                    colour. They are seen between the eye and a very variable sky; and in this
                    situation, especially in the morning or evening, or a dark day, it is not easy
                    to distinguish one full colour from another, all of them approaching to the
                    appearance of a black. At the distance of a very few miles hardly any full
                    colours can be distinguished but a scarlet and a blue. Red, blue, yellow, and
                    white, are the colours which can be distinguished at greater distances than any
                    others, and are therefore the only colours admitted as signals. Even these are
                    sometimes distinguished with difficulty. A yellow is often confounded with a
                    dirty white, and a blue with a red. All other dark colours are found totally
                    unfit. But as these afford but a small variety, we must combine them in one
                    flag, by making it striped, spotted, or chequered, taking care that the
                    opposition of colour may be as great as possible, and that the pieces of which
                    the flags are made up may not be too minute. Red must never be striped nor
                    spotted with blue; and the stripes, spots, or chequers, should never be less
                    than one-third of the breadth of the flag.</p>
                <p>Difference of shape, as flags, banners, or pendants, is another distinction by
                    which the expression may be varied. And in doing this, we must recollect, that
                    in light winds it may be difficult to distinguish a flag from a banner, as
                    neither are fully displayed for want of wind to detach the fly from the
                    staff.</p>
                <p>Lastly, signals may be varied by their position, which may be on any lofty and
                    well detached part of the masts, yards, or rigging.</p>
                <p>Simplicity is an eminent property in all signals. They are addressed to persons
                    not much accustomed to combinations, and who are probably much occupied by other
                    pressing duties. It were to be wished that every piece of service could be
                    indicated by a single flag. This is peculiarly desirable with respect to the
                    signals used in time of battle. The rapid succession of events on this occasion
                    call for a multitude of orders from the commander-in-chief, and his ship is
                    frequently clad over with flags and pendants, so that it is exceedingly
                    difficult for the signal officer of a private ship to distinguish the different
                    groups, each of which make a particular signal.</p>
                <p>These considerations are the foundation of a certain propriety in signals, which
                    directs us to a choice amongst marks which appear altogether arbitrary. Signals
                    which run any risk of being confounded, on account of some resemblance, or
                    because their position hinders us from immediately perceiving their difference,
                    should be appropriated to pieces of service which are hardly possible to be
                    executed, or can hardly be wanted, in the same situation. No bad consequence
                    could easily result though the signal for coming to closer action should
                    resemble that for unmooring, because the present situation of the ships makes
                    the last operation impossible or absurd, Such considerations direct us to select
                    for battle signals, those which are of easiest exhibition, are the most simple,
                    and have the least dependence on the circumstance of position; so that their
                    signification may not be affected by the damages sustained in the masts or
                    rigging of the flag-ship. Such signals as are less easily seen at a distance,
                    should be appropriated to orders which can occur only in the middle of the
                    fleet. Signals which are made to the admiral by private ships may be the same
                    with signals of command from the flag-ship, which will considerably diminish the
                    number of signals perfectly different from each other.</p>
                <p>With all these attentions and precautions a system of signals is at last made up,
                    fitted to the code of sailing and fighting instructions, It is accompanied by
                    another small set for the duty of convoys. It must be engrossed in two books;
                    one for the officer of the flag-ship, who is to make the signals, and the other
                    is delivered to every private ship. In the first, the evolutions, movements, and
                    other operations of service, are set down in one column, and their corresponding
                    signals in another. The first column is arranged, either alphabetically, by the
                    distinguishing phrase, or systematically, according to the arrangement of the
                    sailing and fighting instructions. The officer whose duty it is to make the
                    signals turns to this column for the order which he is to communicate, and in
                    the other column he finds the appropriated signal.</p>
                <p>In the other book, which is consulted for the interpretation of the signals, they
                    are arranged in the leading column, either by the flags, or by the places of
                    their exhibition. The first is the best method, because the derangement of the
                    flagship’s masts and rigging in time of action may occasion a change in the
                    place of the signal.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tactique Navale</hi> of the Chevalier de Morogues contains
                    a very full and elaborate treatise on signals. We recommend this work to every
                    sea-officer, as full of instruction. The art of signals has been greatly
                    simplified since the publication of this work, but we cannot but ascribe much of
                    the improvements to it. We believe that the author is the inventor of that
                    systematic manner of addressing the order or effective signal to the different
                    squadrons and divisions of the fleet, by which the art of signals is made more
                    concise, the execution of orders is rendered more systematic, and the commanders
                    of private ships are accustomed to consider themselves as parts of an army, with
                    a mutual dependence and connection. We are ready enough to acknowledge the
                    superiority of the French in manoeuvring, but we affect to consider this as an
                    imputation on their courage. Nothing can be more unjust; and dear bought
                    experience should long ere now have taught us the value of this superiority.
                    What avails that courage which we would willingly arrogate to ourselves, if we
                    cannot come to action with our enemy, or must do it in a situation in which it
                    is almost impossible to succeed, and which needlessly throws away the lives of
                    our gallant crews? Yet this must happen, if our admirals do not make evolutions
                    their careful study, and our captains do not habituate themselves, from the
                    first hoisting a pendant, to consider their own ship as connected with the most
                    remote ship in the line. We cannot think that this view of their situation would
                    in the least lessen the character which they have so justly acquired, of
                    fighting their ship with a courage and firmness unequalled by those of any other
                    nation. And we may add, that it is only by such a rational study of their
                    profession, that the gentleman can be distinguished from the mercenary commander
                    of a privateer.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Night Signals.</hi></p>
                <p>It is evident, that the communication of orders by night must be more difficult
                    and more imperfect than by day. We must, in general, content ourselves with such
                    orders as are necessary for keeping the fleet together, by directing the more
                    general movements and evolutions which any change of circumstances may render
                    necessary. And here the division and subordinate arrangement of the fleet is of
                    indispensable necessity, it being hardly possible to particularise every ship by
                    a signal of address, or to see her situation. The orders are therefore addressed
                    to the commanders of the different divisions, each of whom is distinguished by
                    his poop and top-lights, and is in the midst of, and not very remote from, the
                    ships under his more particular charge. Yet even in this unfavourable situation,
                    it is frequently necessary to order the movements of particular ships. Actions
                    during the night are not uncommon. Pursuits and rallyings are still oftener
                    carried on at this time. The common dangers of the sea are as frequent and more
                    disastrous. The system of signals therefore is very incomplete till this part be
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>Night signals must be made by guns, or by lights, or by both combined.<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=398"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0398-0336"/> Gun-signals arc susceptible of variety both in
                    number and in disposition. The only distinct variation which can be made in this
                    disposition, is by means of the time elapsed between the discharges. This will
                    easily admit of three varieties, slow, moderate, and quick. Half-minute guns are
                    as slow as can easily be listened to as appertaining to one signal.
                    Quarter-minute guns are much better, and admit of two very distinct
                    subdivisions. When the gunners, therefore, are well trained to this service,
                    especially since the employment of firelocks for cannon, intervals of fifteen or
                    twelve seconds may be taken for slow firing, eight or ten seconds for moderate,
                    and four or five seconds for quick firing. If these could be reduced to
                    one-half, and made with certainty and. precision, the expression would be
                    incomparably more distinct. A very small number of firings varied in this way
                    will give a considerable number of signals. Thus five guns, with the variety of
                    only quick and moderate, will give twenty very distinguishable signals. The same
                    principle must be attended to here as in the flag-signals. The most simple must
                    be appropriated to the most important ordere, such as occur in the worst
                    weather, or such as are most liable to be mistaken. Quick firing should not make
                    part of a signal to a very distant ship, because the noise of a gun at a great
                    distance is a lengthened sound, and two of them, with a very short interval, are
                    apt to coalesce into one long-continued sound. This mode of varying gun-signals
                    by the time must therefore be employed with great caution, and we must be very
                    certain of the steady performance of the gunners.</p>
                <p>Note, that a preparatory signal or advertisement that an effective signal is to
                    be made, is a very necessary circumstance. It is usual, at least in hard
                    weather, to make this by a double discharge, with an interval of half a second,
                    or at most a second.</p>
                <p>Gun-signals are seldom made alone, except in ordinary situations and moderate
                    weather; because accident may derange them, and inattention may cause them to
                    escape notice, and, once made, they are over, and their repetition would change
                    their meaning. They are also improper on an enemy’s coast, or where an enemy’s
                    cruisers or fleets may be expected.</p>
                <p>Signals by lights are either made with lights simply so called, that is,
                    lanthorns shown in different parts of the ship, or by rockets. Lights may differ
                    by number, and by position, and also by figure. For the flag ship always
                    carrying poop or top-lights, or both, presents an object in the darkest night,
                    so that we can tell whether the additional lights are exhibited about the
                    mainmast, the foremast, the mizen-mast, and the like. And if the lights shown
                    from any of these situations are arranged in certain distinguishable situations
                    in respect to each other, the number of signals may be greatly increased. Thus
                    three lights may be in a verti-tical line, or in a horizontal line, or in a
                    triangle; and the point of this triangle may be up or down, or forward, or aft,
                    and thus may have many significations.</p>
                <p>Lights are also exhibited by false fires or rockets. These can be varied by
                    number, and by such differences of appearance as to make them very
                    distinguishable. Rockets may be with stars, with rain fire, or simple
                    squibs.</p>
                <p>By varying and combining these, a very great number of signals may be produced,
                    fully sufficient to direct every general movement or evolution, or any ordinary
                    and important service. The Chevalier de Morogues has given a specimen of such a
                    system of night signals, into which he has even introduced signals of address or
                    direction to every ship of a large fleet; and has also given signals of number,
                    by which depths of soundings, points of the compass, and other things of this
                    kind, may be expressed both easily and distinctly, He has made the signals by
                    rockets perfectly similar in point of number to those by lanthorns, so that the
                    commander can take either; a choice which may have its use, because the signals
                    by rockets may cause the presence of a fleet to be more extensively known than
                    may be convenient.</p>
                <p>The commander-in-chief will inform the fleet by signal, that guns, or perhaps
                    rockets, are not to be used that night. This signal, at the same time, directs
                    the fleet to close the line or columns, that the light signals may be better
                    observed.</p>
                <p>It is indeed a general rule to show as few lights as possible; and the commander
                    frequently puts out his own poop and top-lights, only showing them from time to
                    time, that his ships may keep around him.</p>
                <p>The signal lanthorns on board the flag ship, and a lanthorn kept in readiness on
                    board of every private ship, to answer or acknowledge signals from the
                    commander-in-chief, are all kept in bags, to conceal their lights till the
                    moment they are fixed in their places, and the preparatory or advertising signal
                    has been made. The commandcr-in-chief sometimes orders by signal every ship to
                    show a light for a minute or two, that he may judge of the position of the
                    fleet; and the admiral’s signal must always be acknowledged by those to whom it
                    is addressed.</p>
                <p>It is of particular importance that the fleet be kept toge-gether. Therefore the
                    leading ships of the fleet, on either tack, are enjoined to acknowledge the
                    signals of the commander-in-chief by a signal peculiar to their station. Thus
                    the commander-in-chief learns the position of the extremities of his fleet.</p>
                <p>In framing a set of night signals, great attention must be given to their
                    position, that they be not obscured by the sails. The nature of the order to be
                    given will frequently determine this. Thus, an order for the rear ships to make
                    more sail, will naturally direct us to exhibit the signal at the mizen peek; and
                    so of other pieces of service. Lanthorns exposed in groups, such as triangles,
                    lozenges, and the like, are commonly suspended at the corners of large frames of
                    laths, at the distance of a fathom at least from each other. Attempts have been
                    made to show lights of different colours; but the risk of mistake or failure in
                    the composition at the laboratory, makes this rather hazardous. Coloured
                    lanthorns are more certain; but when the glasses are made of a colour
                    sufficiently intense, the vivacity of the light, which at no time is very great,
                    is too much diminished. Besides, the very distance changes the colour
                    exceedingly and unaccountably.</p>
                <p>III. Of <hi rend="italic">Signals in a Fog.</hi></p>
                <p>These can be made only by noises, such as the firing of cannon and muskets, the
                    beating of drums and ringing of bells. Fog signals are the most difficult to
                    contrive of any, and are susceptible of the least variety. The commanderin-chief
                    is principally concerned to keep his fleet together; and unless something very
                    urgent requires it, he will make no change in his course or rate of sailing. But
                    a shift of wind or other causes may make this necessary. The changes which he
                    will order, it will be prudent to regulate by some fixed rule, which is in
                    general convenient. Thus, when a fleet is in the order of sailing upon a wind,
                    and a fog comes on, the fleet will hold on the same course. If the wind should
                    come a little more on the beam, the fleet will still keep close to the wind.
                    Certain general rules of this kind being agreed on, no signals are necessary for
                    keeping the fleet together; and the ships can separate or run foul of each other
                    only by difference in their rate of sailing, or by inaccurate steerage. To
                    prevent this, the commander-in-chief fires a gun from time to time, and the
                    ships of the fleet judge of his situation and distance by the sound. The
                    commanders of divisions fire guns, with some distinction from those of the
                    commander-in-chief. This both informs the commander-in-chief of the position of
                    his squadrons, and enables the private ships of each division to keep in the
                    neighbourhood of their own flag ship. On board of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=399" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0399-0337"/>
                    every private ship the drum is beaten, or the bell is chimed every quarter of an
                    hour, according as the ship is on the starboard or larboard tack. By such
                    contrivances, it is never difficult to keep a fleet in very good order when
                    sailing on a wind. The wind is almost always moderate, and the ships keep under
                    a very easy sail. It is much more difficult when going large, and separation can
                    be prevented only by the most unwearied attention. The greatest risk is the
                    falling in with strange ships steering another course. But evolutions and other
                    movements are frequently indispensable. The course must be changed by tacking or
                    wearing, and other services must be performed. None, however, are admitted but
                    the most probable, the most simple, and the most necessary.</p>
                <p>The commander-in-chief first informs the fleet by the preparatory fog signal,
                    that he is about to order an evolution, and that he is to direct it by fog
                    signals. This precaution is indispensable to prevent mistakes. Along with this
                    advertising signal he makes the signal of the movement intended. This not only
                    calls the attention of the fleet, but makes the ships prepare for the precise
                    execution of that movement. The commanders of divisions repeat the advertising
                    signal, which informs their ships of their situation, and the private ships beat
                    their drums or chime their bells. Thus the whole ships of the fleet close a
                    little, and become a little better acquainted with their mutual position. It is
                    now understood that a movement is to be made precisely a quarter of an hour
                    after the advertisement. At the expiration of this time, the effective signal
                    for this movement is made by the commander-in-chief, and must be instantly
                    repeated by the commanders of divisions, and then the movement must be made by
                    each ship, according to the sailing and fighting instructions. This must be done
                    with the utmost attention and precision, because it produces a prodigious change
                    in the relative position of the ships; and even although the good sense of the
                    commander-in-chief will select such movements for accomplishing bis purpose as
                    produce the smallest alterations, and the least risk of separation or running
                    foul of each other; it is still extremely difficult to avoid these misfortunes.
                    To prevent this as much as possible, each ship which has executed the movement,
                    or which has come on a course thwarting that of the fleet, intimates this by a
                    signal properly adapted, often adding the signal of the tack on which it is now
                    standing, and even its particular signal of recognizance. This is particularly
                    incumbent on the flag ships and the leading ships of each division. After a
                    reasonable interval, the commander-in-chief will make proper signals for
                    bringing the fleet to a knowledge of their reunion in this new position.</p>
                <p>This must serve for a general account of the circumstances which must be attended
                    to in framing a code of signals. The arbitrary characters in which the language
                    is written must be left to the sagacity of the gentlemen of the profession. It
                    must be observed, that the stratagems of war make secrecy very’ necessary. It
                    may be of immense hazard if the enemy should understand our signals. In time of
                    battle it might frequently frustrate our attempts to destroy them, and at all
                    times would enable them to escape, or to throw us into disorder. Every commander
                    of a squadron, therefore, issues private signals, suited to his particular
                    destination; and therefore it is necessary that our code of signals be
                    susceptible of endless variations. This is exceedingly easy, with out any
                    increase of their number. The commander needs only intimate that such and such a
                    signal is so and so changed in its meaning during his command.</p>
                <p>We cannot leave this article without returning to an observation which we made
                    almost in the beginning, viz. that the system of signals, or, to speak more
                    properly, the manner of framing this system, has received much improvement from
                    the gentlemen of the French navy, and particularly from the most ingenious
                    thought of M. de la Bourdonnais, of making the signals the immediate expressions
                    of numbers only, which numbers may be afterwards used to indicate any order
                    whatever. We shall present our readers with a scheme or two of the manner in
                    which this may be done for all signals, both day, night, and fog. This alone may
                    be considered as a system of signals, and is equally applicable to every kind of
                    information at a distance. Without detracting in the smallest degree from the
                    praise due to M. de la Bourdonnais, we must observe, that this principle of
                    notation is of much older date. Bishop Wilkins, in his <hi rend="italic">Secret
                    and Swift Messenger,</hi> expressly recommends it, and gives specimens of the
                    manner of execution; so does Dr. Hook in some of his proposals to the Royal
                    Society. Gaspar Schottus also mentions it in his <hi rend="italic">Technica
                    Curiosa;</hi> and Kircher, amongst others of his <hi rend="italic">curious
                    Projects.</hi></p>
                <p>M. de la Bourdonnais’s method is as follows :—He chooses pendants for his
                    effective signals, because they are the most easily displayed in the proper
                    order. Several pendants, making part of one signal, may be hoisted by one
                    halyard, being stopped on it at the distance of four or six feet from each
                    other. If it be found proper to throw out another signal at the same time and
                    place, they are separated by a red pendant without a point. His colours are
                    chosen with judgment, being very distinctly recognised, and not liable to he
                    confounded with the addressing signals appropriated to the different ships of
                    the fleet. They are, for</p>

                <p>Three sets of such pendants will express every number under a thousand, by
                    hoisting one above the other, and reckoning the uppermost hundreds, the next
                    below it tens, and the lowest units. Thus the number 643 will be expressed by a
                    pendant red with blue tail, a yellow pendant below it, and a blue one below the
                    last.</p>
                <p>This method has great advantages. The signals may be hoisted in any place where
                    best seen, and therefore the signification is not affected by the derangement of
                    the flagship’s masts and rigging. And by appropriating the smaller numbers to
                    the battle signals, they are more simple, requiring fewer pendants.</p>
                <p>As this method requires a particular set of colours, it has its inconveniences.
                    An admiral is often obliged to shift his flag, even in time of action. He cannot
                    easily take the colours along with him. It is therefore better to make use of
                    such colours as every private ship is provided with. One set of 11 will do, with
                    the addition of three, or at most of four pendants, of singular make, to mark
                    100, 200, .300, 400. Two of these flags, one above the other, will express any
                    number under 100, by using the 11th as a substitute for any flag that should be
                    repeated. Thus the 11th flag, along with the flag for eight or for six, will
                    express the number 88 or 66. Thus we are able to express every number below 500,
                    and this is sufficient for a very large code of signals.</p>
                <p>And in order to diminish as much as possible the number of these compound
                    signals, it will be proper that a number of single flag signals be preserved,
                    and even varied by circumstances of position, for orders which are of very
                    frequent occurrence, and which can hardly occur in situations where any
                    obstructions are occasioned by loss of masts or otherwise. And farther, to avoid
                    all chance of mistake, a particular signal can be added, intimating that the
                    signals now exhibited are numeracy signals; or, which is still better, all
                    signals may be considered as numerary signals; and those which we have just now
                    called single flat signals may be set down opposite to, or as expressing the
                    largest numbers of the code.<pb break="no"

                    This method requires the signal of advertisement, the annulling signal, the
                    signal of address to the particular ship or division, the signa) of
                    acknowledgment, the signal of indistinctness, of distress, of danger, and one or
                    two more, which in every method must be employed.</p>
                <p>Another method of expressing numbers with fewer colours is as follows: Let the
                    flags be A, B, C, D, E, F, and arrange them as follows:</p>

                <p>The number expressed by any pair of flags is found in the intersection of the
                    horizontal and perpendicular columns. Thus the flag D, hoisted along with and
                    above the flag F, expresses the number 40, &amp;c. In order to express a greater
                    number, (but not exceeding 84), suppose 75, hoist the flag C</p>
                <p>E, which expresses 33, or 75 wanting 42, and above them a flag or signal G, which
                    alone expresses 42.</p>
                <p>This method may be still farther improved by arranging the flags thus:</p>

                <p>In this last method the signification of the signal is totally independent of the
                    position of the flags. In whatever parts of the ship the flags D and E are seen,
                    they express the number 23. This would suit battle signals.</p>
                <p>Another method still may be taken. Flags hoisted anywhere on the foremast may be
                    accounted units, those on the mainmast tens, and those on the mizenmast
                    hundreds. Thus numeral signals may be made by a ship dismasted, or having only
                    poles in their place. Many other ways may be contrived for expressing numbers by
                    colours, and there is great room for exercising the judgment of the contriver.
                    For it must always be remembered, that these signals must be accompanied with a
                    signal by which it is addressed to some particular ship or division of the
                    fleet, and it may be difficult to connect the one with the other, which is
                    perhaps shewn in another place, and along with other executive signals.</p>
                <p>One great advantage of these numeral signals is, that they may be changed in
                    their signification at pleasure. Thus, in the first method, it can be settled,
                    that on Sundays the colours A, B, C, D, &amp;c., express the cyphers 1, 2, 3, 4,
                    &amp;c., but that on Mondays they express the cyphers 0, 1,2, 3, &amp;c., and on
                    Tuesdays the cyphers 9, 0, 1, 2, &amp;c., and so on through all the days of the
                    week. This mean of secrecy is mentioned by Dr. Hooke for the coast and alarm
                    signals, where, by the bye, he shews a method for conveying intelligence over
                    land very similar to what is now practised by the French with their telegraph. </p>
                <p>It is equally easy to express numbers by night signals. Thus M. de la Bourdonnais
                    proposes that one discharge of a great gun shall express 7, and that 1, 2, 3, 4,
                    5. 6, shall be expressed by lights. Therefore to express 24, we must fire three
                    guns, and shew three lights. This is the most perfect of all forms of night and
                    fog signals. For both the manner of firing guns and of exhibiting lights may be
                    va ried to a sufficient extent with very few guns or lights, and with great
                    distinctness.</p>
                <p>Thus, for guns. Let F mark the firing of a single gun at moderate intervals, and
                    <hi rend="italic">ff</hi> a double gun, that is, two discharged at the interval
                    of a second. We may express numbers thus:</p>

                <p>It might be done with fewer guns if the <hi rend="italic">ff</hi> were admitted
                    as the first firing. But it seems better to begin always with the single gun,
                    and thus the double gun beginning a signal distinguishes the tens, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In like manner, a small number of lights will admit of a great variety of very
                    distinct positions, which may serve for all signals to ships not very remote
                    from the commander-in-chief. For orders to be understood at a very great
                    distance, it will be proper to appropriate the numbers which are indicated by
                    signals made with rockets. These can be varied in number and kind to a
                    sufficient extent, so as to be very easily distinguished and understood. It is
                    sufficient to have shewn how the whole, or nearly the whole notation of signals,
                    may be limited to the expression of numbers.</p>
                <p>We have taken little notice of the signals made by private ships to the
                    commander-in-chief. This is a very easy business, because there is little risk
                    of confounding them with other signals. Nor have we spoken of signals from the
                    flag ships whose ultimate interpretation is number, as when ships are directed
                    to change their course so many points. Those also are easily contrived in any of
                    the methods already described; also when a private ship wishes to inform the
                    commander-in-chief that soundings are found at so many fathoms. In like manner,
                    by numbering the points of the compass, the admiral can direct to chace to any
                    one of them, or may be informed of strange ships being seen in any quarter, and
                    what is their number. <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. b. b.)</hi></p>
                <p>Of late years, that is, within this century, a great improvement has taken place
                    in the signal department of the Royal Navy. The following brief memorandum on
                    the subject will give as general an idea on the subject as could be given
                    without the introduction of coloured plates, and more copious explanations than
                    are consistent with the plan of this work.</p>
                <p>There are three volumes of signals in use in the navy; one is called “General
                    Signals,” the other “Night and Fog Signals,” the other “Vocabulary Signals, for
                    the use of her Majesty’s fleet.” The <hi rend="italic">General Signals</hi>
                    consist of a set of numerical references, from 1 to 999, and contain all the
                    most general orders relating to action, sailing, manoeuvring, and every other
                    evolution in use, either at sea or at anchor. All these signals are made by
                    means of a set of numeral flags, from 1 to 9, with the addition of zero; a set
                    of divisional flags, to distinguish the different parts of a fleet; flags to
                    affirm signals, to annul them, and to prepare measures; interrogative,
                    answering, compass, geographical, and horary pendants. These, with the union
                    jack, compose the flags in use when the general signal-book is employed. All
                    these flags and pendants depend upon their form and colour for their
                    distinction, and are hoisted at the most conspicuous places for being seen, but
                    seldom more than three at a time. Besides these, distant signals are made with
                    square and tri-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=401"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0401-0339"/> angular flags and pendants, without any regard to
                    their colour. They are numeral, and each has its signification attached to its
                    number in the general signal-book. The distinctive mark of a distant signal is a
                    ball, which is used as a preparative, a stop, or an answer.</p>
                <p>In the general signal-book are detailed sets of instructions relative to the line
                    of battle and order of sailing, each signal for a specific evolution being
                    accompanied by a plate, explanatory of the measure contemplated.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Night Signals</hi> are made with lanterns, rockets, blue
                    lights, and guns. The numbers are not many, and care is taken to confine the
                    signals to those objects of the most general application in practice, so as not
                    to complicate or confuse; for it may be observed, that night signals are almost
                    always very difficult both to make and to interpret.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vocabulary Signals</hi> are made by means of twenty-one
                    symbols, named A, B, &amp;c., to Y inclusive, (all the alphabet, omitting J, U,
                    W, X, and Z, but retaining I and V). There are no numeral flags used in this
                    code, and no more than three symbols are used at one time. These symbols are
                    made with square and triangular flags, with the occasional use of pendants, to
                    distinguish the alphabetical, the military, and the geographical, parts of the
                    vocabulary from one another. The vocabulary signals, with their significations,
                    are arranged in the following order: words and sentences, alphabet, military
                    phrases and terms, geographical table, and list of the navy. The words and
                    sentences are placed together, the words being arranged in alphabetical order,
                    the sentences immediately following their most prominent words. This book is
                    divided into three parts, but as the number of words required to be used would
                    exceed the power of combination of three symbols, a distinctive pendant is used,
                    to signify which portion of the book is to be referred to, and in this way the
                    same combinations may be used several times over. The military table consists of
                    such technical terms and phrases as are likely to occur on general service. The
                    geographical table contains the names of places, while the body of the volume
                    consists of words and sentences for universal use.</p>
                <p>A code of signals for the use of the mercantile marine was published by Captain
                    Marryat, of the Royal Navy, in 1817; it has, we believe, been in general use
                    ever since, and has run through many editions.</p>
                <p>The flags and pendants used in Captain Marryat’s mercantile code of signals are
                    fifteen, exclusive of the Union Jack, which, by order in Council, when used in
                    the merchant service, is to have a white border all round, such border being
                    one-fifth of the breadth of the Jack itself without the border.</p>
                <p>There are ten numerical flags, which represent the figures in arithmetic, and are
                    used throughout the whole of Captain Marryat’s code of signals.</p>
                <p>The Union Jack, as above distinguished from that used by men of war, which Jack,
                    we may mention, viz. that with the white border, is now used in the navy only as
                    a signal for a pilot.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">first distinguishing pendant</hi> is hoisted over the
                    number, or at some other mast-head, when the number of a merchant ship is shown
                    in part <hi rend="italic">second</hi> of the code.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">rendezvous flag</hi> is hoisted over the number of the port
                    in part <hi rend="italic">third.</hi></p>
                <p>The sentences in part <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> are expressed by the <hi
                    rend="italic">numerical flags</hi> alone.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">second distinguishing pendant</hi> is hoisted over the
                    numbers in the first division of the vocabulary.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">telegraph flag</hi> is hoisted at some other mast-head,
                    when the numbers in the second division of the vocabulary are shown.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">numerical pendant</hi> is hoisted over a number, when
                    merely the figures are intended to be shown.</p>
                <p>The code of signals consists of six parts.</p>
                <p>1st, A list of the names of men-of-war.</p>
                <p>2d, A list of the names of merchant ships, copied from Lloyd’s Register.</p>
                <p>3d, A list of ports, headlands, rocks, reefs, shoals, &amp;c. 4th, A selection of
                    sentences.</p>
                <p>5th. The first division of the vocabulary consists of compass signals, ships’
                    stores, auxiliary verbs, and final terminations, to assist in spelling
                    words.</p>
                <p>6th, The second division of the vocabulary consists of the alphabet, and words
                    most likely to be used in commercial and maritime affairs. The alphabet is
                    introduced for the purpose of spelling words which are not found in the
                    vocabulary.</p>
                <p>It is certainly much to be washed, that every means should be used to induce
                    merchant ships to adopt some code of signals; and we trust the gallant and
                    accomplished author, who is so well known in other walks of literature, will not
                    relax his exertions in this humble but very useful department of writing, but
                    that he will study, by fresh editions, to keep his code always up to the wants
                    of the day.</p>
                <p>For the rest, we are of opinion that the subject of signals, both in the navy and
                    in the merchant service, is one which requires more attention than it has yet
                    met with. It would seem highly desirable, for instance, that a universal code,
                    sanctioned by their respective governments, should be adopted amongst all the
                    trading nations of the world. If the great maritime countries were to promulgate
                    one grand code, it would speedily be adopted by all, and every ship would then
                    be able to communicate with any other at sea, without the necessity of coming
                    within hail, which is always troublesome, and often impossible. We all now use
                    the same or similar charts; we all use the same methods of navigating our ships,
                    by chronometers, lunars, and so forth; the manipulations of our seamanship are
                    all alike; and why should not our means of communicating by signal be the same?
