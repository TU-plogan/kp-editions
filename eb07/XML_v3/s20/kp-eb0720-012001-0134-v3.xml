                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,

                <p><label type="entry">SERINGAPATAM</label>, a celebrated city of Hindustan, in the
                    province of Mysore, of which it is the capital. Its situation is remarkable,
                    being at the upper end of an island four miles in length by one and a half in
                    breadth, formed by the Cavery, which is here a large and rapid river, having a
                    broad channel, that is, however, impeded by rocks and fragments of granite. The
                    proper name of this city is Siri Runge Patan, or the city of Sri Ranga,
                    corrupted in common language into Patana. It has been known as a fortress from a
                    very early period; the fort is situated at the west end of the island; its area
                    is about a mile, and it is an immense mass of building, unfinished, and its
                    defences injudiciously constructed. The fortifications exhibit the long straight
                    walls and square bastions of the Hindus; and the glacis is in many parts so high
                    that it sheltered the assailants. The suburbs occupy the middle and highest part
                    of the island, and are about half a mile square. The streets are, like those of
                    most eastern towns, narrow and confused; nor are there any public buildings
                    which are noted for elegance or splendour in the eyes of Europeans. They have
                    all a mean appearance. Hyder’s palace, named the Lolbang, which was finished in
                    1780, when he was occupied in the wars of the Carnatic, and to which he never
                    returned, is situated at the east end of the island. It is two stories in
                    height, and, according to Lord Valentia, by whom it was visited, it is by no
                    means an inelegant building, though mud is the material of which it is
                    constructed. The ground-floor was very public, and seems to have been occupied
                    by the attendants. Above are excellent apartments, and balconies opening into
                    courts in which the sultan usually sat and gave audience. It was prettily
                    painted, but, owing to the want of windows, was too gloomy for a European
                    habitation, and has accordingly been altered and improved by the British
                    residents. It is situated in a garden, which was beautiful, but was destroyed
                    during the siege of the city. Adjoining to this building is the tomb of Hyder,
                    where now rests all that was royal of this Mussulman dynasty, namely, Hyder, his
                    wife, and Tippoo, under tombs of black marble elevated about eighteen inches
                    from the ground, and covered with rich cloths, which have a canopy over them.
                    The whole building, with its dome, its brilliantly polished black marble
                    columns, and its mosque annexed, has a handsome effect. In the verandah are
                    buried several of the family; and on the outside, upon an elevated platform
                    which goes round the whole building, are the tombs of several faithful servants.
                    The British government allow 2000 pagodas annually to the Moulahs for reading
                    the Koran, and for musicians to perform the nobut. The palace in the city is a
                    very large building, surrounded by a massy and lofty wall of stone and mud, and
                    of a mean appearance. All the buildings arc now converted to very different uses
                    from those for which they were originally intended. Hyder’s palace is the
                    residence of a surgeon; his seraglio is converted into a European hospital; and
                    Tippoo’s seraglio has become a barrack for artillery. His private abode is
                    occupied by the resident, and his public apartments by European troops. There is
                    a palace built by Tippoo near the town, which was the residence of General
                    Wellesley. The upper floor consists of one central room, with four others at the
                    corners, and verandahs below them, all very curiously painted; a verandah below
                    covers each side, on the walls of which is painted the famous battle with
                    Colonel Baillie. Other paintings adorn the walls, in which Hyder and Tippoo are
                    represented as conquerors, and subject princes are painted below.</p>
                <p>In 1610, Seringapatam was taken from the fallen dynasty of Bijanagur by the rajah
                    of Wadeyar, and made the capital of Mysore. The town was increased and the
                    fortifications improved by his successors. But it was Hyder and his son Tippoo
                    who took pleasure in strengthening and embellishing this the capital of their
                    dominions. It was then that it arrived at that degree of splendour and strength
                    which attracted the cupidity and afterwards foiled the attempts of the
                    neighbouring powers. It was afterwards besieged by the Mahrattas and by the
                    nizam’s troops, and was rescued from their attacks by Hyder consenting to pay
                    large sums of money for its security. In 1800, according to a register of the
                    houses, the fort or city contained 4130 houses and 5900 families, and the
                    suburbs 2216 houses and 3336 families. Estimating five persons to each house,
                    the city and suburbs will be found to contain 31,895 persons, independently of a
                    strong garrison and its numerous followers. During the reign of Tippoo, the
                    island of Seringapatam was estimated to contain 150,000 inhabitants. They were
                    greatly diminished during the siege, and after the storming of the place; but
                    many have since been attracted to the rajah’s residence at the city of Mysore,
                    and many Mahommedans who originally came from the Carnatic have returned, after
                    the destruction of Hyder’s dynasty. the manufactures of Seringapatam and its
                    vicinity were never considerable, and principally consisted of military stores
                    and camp equipage. Timber sells here at a high price, being brought principally
                    by land-carriage from the Western Ghauts. Bread is also dear, which compels the
                    Europeans to subsist upon rice. Good vegetables and excellent meat are, however,
                    to be had in abundance. In February 1792, Seringapatam was invested by a
                    formidable British force, amounting to 400,000, including followers of every
                    description. Tippoo had not the means of withstanding this numerous host; and
                    his intrenched camp being stormed with great loss, he was compelled to yield to
                    the humiliating terms imposed upon him by his conquerors, to relinquish half his
                    dominions, and to pay to them the sum of three and a half millions. In 1799, war
                    being again declared by the British against Tippoo, an immense force, under
                    General Harris, advanced against the capital, which was invested by the British
                    and the nizam’s forces on the 14th of April, and was stormed, with a great
                    slaughter of the garrison, in the afternoon of the 4th of May. Tippoo himself
                    was killed under a gateway, by a party, it is supposed, of the twelfth regiment
                    of foot, but by whom is not known, no individual having ever appeared to claim
                    the honour; nor was it discovered who obtained possession of his valuable
                    necklace of pearls. The British have ever since retained possession of the
                    island, which now forms one of the collectorships under the Madras presidency.
                    The travelling distance from Madras is 200 miles, from Hyderabad 406, from
                    Poonah 525, from Bombay 622, from Nagpoor 727, from Calcutta 1170, and from
                    Delhi 1321 miles. Long. 76. 51. E. Lat. 12. 26. N.<pb break="no"
