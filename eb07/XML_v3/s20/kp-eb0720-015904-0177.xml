                    silver coin in use among the ancient Romans, called also simply <hi rend="italic">nummus,</hi> and sometimes <hi rend="italic">nummus
                    sestertius.</hi> The sestertius was the fourth part of the denarius, and
                    originally contained two asses and a half. It was at first denoted by LLS, the
                    two Ls signifying two librte, and the S half. But the librarii, afterwards
                    converting the two Ls into an H, expressed the sestertius by HS. The word <hi rend="italic">sestertius</hi> was first introduced by way of abbreviation for
                    <hi rend="italic">semistertius,</hi> which signifies two and a half of a third,
                    qr, literally, only half a third; for in expressing half a third it was
                    understood that there were two before.</p><p>Some authors make two kinds of sesterces, the less, called <hi rend="italic">sestertius,</hi> in the masculine gender, and the great one, called <hi rend="italic">sestertium,</hi> in the neuter; the former we have already
                    described, the latter containing a thousand of the other. Others maintain that
                    any such distinction of great and little sesterces was unknown to the Romans.
                    <hi rend="italic">Sestertius,</hi> say they, was an adjective, and signified,
                    <hi rend="italic">as sestertius,</hi> or two asses and a half; and when used in
                    the plural, as in <hi rend="italic">quinquaginta sestertium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sestertia,</hi> it was only by way of abbreviation, and there was
                    also understood <hi rend="italic">centena millia,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>This matter has been accurately stated by Mr Raper, in the following manner. The
                    substantive to which sestertius referred is either <hi rend="italic">as or
                    pondus;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sestertius as</hi> is two asses and a half;
                    <hi rend="italic">sestertium pondus,</hi> two pondera and a half, or two hundred
                    and fifty denarii. When the denarius passed for ten asses, the sestertius of two
                    asses and a half was the quarter of it; and the Romans continued to keep their
                    accounts in these sesterces long after the denarius passed for sixteen asses,
                    till, growing rich, they found it more convenient to reckon by quarters of the
                    denarius, which they called <hi rend="italic">nummi,</hi> and used the words <hi rend="italic">nummus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sestertius</hi> indifferently,
                    as synonymous terms, and sometimes both together, as <hi rend="italic">sestertius nummus.</hi> In this case the word <hi rend="italic">sestertius,</hi> having lost its original signification, was used as a
                    substantive; for <hi rend="italic">sestertius nummus</hi> was not two nummi and
                    a half, but a single nummus of four asses. They called any sum under two
                    thousand sesterces so many <hi rend="italic">sestertii</hi> in the masculine
                    gender; two thousand sesterces they called <hi rend="italic">duo</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bina sestertia,</hi> in the neuter, so many quarters making five
                    hundred denarii, which was twice the sestertium; and they said <hi rend="italic">dena, vicena, &amp;c., sestertia,</hi> till the sum amounted to a thousand
                    sestertia, which was a million of sesterces. But, to avoid ambiguity, they did
                    not use the neuter <hi rend="italic">sestertium</hi> in the singular number when
                    the whole sum amounted to no more than a thousand sesterces, or one sestertium.
                    They called a million of sesterces <hi rend="italic">decies nummum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">decies sestertium,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">decies centena
                    millia nummorum, or sestertiorum,</hi> in the masculine gender, omitting <hi rend="italic">centena millia</hi> for the sake of brevity. They likewise called
                    the same sum <hi rend="italic">decies sestertium,</hi> in the neuter gender, for
                    <hi rend="italic">decies centies sestertium,</hi> omitting <hi rend="italic">centies</hi> for the same reason; or simply <hi rend="italic">decies,</hi>
                    omitting <hi rend="italic">centena millia sestertium,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">centies sestertium;</hi> and with the numeral adverbs <hi rend="italic">decies,
                    vicies, centies, millies,</hi> and the like, either <hi rend="italic">centena
                    millia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">centies</hi> was always understood. These were
                    their most usual forms of expression, though for <hi rend="italic">bina, dena,
                    vicena sestertia,</hi> they frequently said <hi rend="italic">bina, dena, vicena
                    millia nummum.</hi> If the consular denarius contained sixty troy grains of fine
                    silver, it was worth something more than eightpence farthing and a half
                    sterling; and the as, of sixteen to the denarius, a little more than a
                    halfpenny. To reduce the ancient sesterces of two asses and a half, when the
                    denarius passed for sixteen, to pounds sterling, multiply the given number by
                    5454, and cut off six figures on the right hand for decimals. To reduce <hi rend="italic">nurnmi sestertii,</hi> or quarters of the denarius, to pounds
                    sterling; if the given sum be consular money, multiply it by 8727, and cut off
                    six figures on the right hand for decimals; but for imperial money diminish the
                    said product by one eighth of itself. To be qualified for a Roman knight, an
                    estate of 400,000 <hi rend="italic">sesterces</hi> was required; and for a
                    senator, one of 800,000.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
