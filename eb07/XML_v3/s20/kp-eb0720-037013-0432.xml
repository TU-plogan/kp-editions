                    the route from Egypt to Fezzan, and the most interesting island of the waste, as
                    being the supposed site of the temple of Jupiter Ammon. It is situated in
                    latitude 29° 12' north, and longitude 26° 5' east. Horneman represents it as
                    fifty miles in circumference; but subsequent travellers have reduced its
                    dimensions to about one half of that. The nearest distance from the river does
                    not exceed 120 miles. Date trees cover a large portion of the soil, which is
                    extremely fertile; but the palm, pomegranate, olive, vine, fig, aprico, plum,
                    and even apple, flourish in the gardens. Tepid saline springs are numerous
                    throughout the district; and shocks of earthquakes are here frequently felt. The
                    town of Siwah is built upon a steep conical rock, and both in external aspect
                    and internal arrangement, presents a striking and singular appearance. The
                    streets are narrow, crooked, and so dark, that artificial light is required at
                    noon-day. Each house has several floors, the upper communicating with the<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=433" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0433-0371"/> lower by galleries and chambers which cover the
                    streets. The houses and walls are for the most part built of natron or mineral
                    soda, and rock salt mixed with sand, coated with a gypseous earth, which
                    preserves the salt from melting. The total population of the town is from 2000
                    to 2500; that of the whole oasis is supposed to amount to 8000 souls.</p><p>The great object of interest connected with this place, is, as we have said, the
                    ruins of what is conjectured to have been the famous temple of Ammon. They are
                    situated a league and a half east of the town, and are called by the natives Om
                    Beydch. The edifice has been built in the Egyptian style of architecture. The
                    vestiges of a triple enclosure, enormous stones lying on the ground, and masses
                    still standing, prove it to have been a monument of the first order. The part
                    which is in tolerable preservation is thirty feet in length, and consists of
                    part of a gateway and two great walls, which are covered with three immense
                    stones, measuring thirty-four feet by twenty-seven. The only apartment which has
                    been distinctly made out is 112 feet in length; the whole area of ruins being a
                    rectangular space about 360 feet by 300. The decorations are observed to bear
                    the closest resemblance to those of the Egyptian monuments; the figures, scenes,
                    and arrangements being entirely the same. Here are seen the identical style,
                    cast of countenance, costumes and sacrifices, as in the monuments of Thebaid.
                    Here is the god with the ram’s head, priests in long procession, multitudes of
                    hieroglyphic tables, and at the entrance is sculptured in full relief the figure
                    of Typhon, or the evil genius, about five feet in height. Nearly a mile from
                    these ruins is situated the fountain of the sun, dedicated of old to the
                    Ammonian deity. It is a small marsh rather than a well, extending about ninety
                    feet in length by sixty in breadth, but is at the same time perfectly
                    transparent. The diurnal change of temperature recorded by the father of history
                    is quite perceptible. A temple stands near this spring, and there are other
                    temples and lakes extending in succession towards the west. Major Rennel has
                    employed much learning to prove that Siwah is the site of the famous temple of
                    Ammon, and with considerable success. See his work, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Geographical System of Herodotus Examined and Explained.</hi> &amp;c. vol. ii.
