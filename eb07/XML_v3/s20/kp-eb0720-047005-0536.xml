                    mentioning the bishop of Man’s diocese. Concerning the origin and application of
                    this word, very different opinions have been formed by the learned. Buchanan
                    (lib. i. cap. 34.) says, that before his time the name of <hi rend="italic">Sailor</hi> was given to a town in the isle of Man. In Gough’s edition of
                    Camden’s Britannia (vol. iii p. 701.) it is said, that after the isle of Man was
                    annexed to the crown of England, this appellation was given to a small island
                    within musket-shot of Man, in which the cathedral stands, called by the
                    Norwegians the <hi rend="italic">Holm,</hi> and by the inhabitants the <hi rend="italic">Peel.</hi> In support of this opinion, a charter is quoted <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 1505, in which Tho mas earl of Derby and lord of Man,
                    confirms to Huan Hesketh, bishop of Sodor, all the lands, &amp;c. anciently
                    belonging to the bishops of Man. “Ecclesiam cathedralem sancti Germani in <hi rend="italic">Holm Sodor vel Pele</hi> vocatam, ecclesiam Sancti Patricii
                    ibidem, et locum praefatum in quo ecclesiae praefatae sitae sunt.” The truth of
                    either, or perhaps of both, these accounts might be allowed; but neither of them
                    is sufficient to account for the constant conjunction of Sodor and Man, in
                    charters, registers, and histories. If Sodor was a small town or island
                    belonging to Man, it cannot be conceived why it is always mentioned before it,
                    or rather why it should be mentioned at all in speaking of a bishop’s diocese.
                    To speak of the bishopric of Sodor and Man in this case, would be as improper as
                    it would be to call the bishopric of Durham the bishopric of Holy Island and
                    Durham, or the bishopric of Darlington and Durham; the former being a small
                    island, and the latter a town belonging to the county and diocese of Durham.
                    Neither of these accounts, therefore, gives a satisfactory explanation of the
                    original conjunction of Sodor and Man.</p><p>The island of Iona was the place where the bishop of the Isles resided, the
                    cathedral church of which, it is said, was dedicated to our Saviour, in Greek
                    <hi rend="italic">Sorer,</hi> hence <hi rend="italic">Sotorenses,</hi> which
                    might be corrupted into <hi rend="italic">Sodorenses,</hi> a name frequently
                    given by Danish writers to the western isles of Scotland. That we may be the
                    more disposed to accede to this Grecian etymology, the advocates for this
                    opinion tell us, that the name <hi rend="italic">Icolumkill,</hi> which is often
                    applied to this island, is also of Greek extraction, being derived from <hi rend="italic">columba,</hi> “a pigeon,” a meaning that exactly corresponds to
                    the Celtic word <hi rend="italic">colum,</hi> and the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">iona.</hi> We must confess, however, that we have very little
                    faith in the conjectures of etymologists, and think, that upon no<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490924&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=537" xml:id="kp-eb0720-0537-0471"/>
                    occasion they alone can establish any fact, though, when concurring with facts,
                    they certainly tend to confirm and explain them. It is only from historical
                    facts that we can know to what the name of Sodor was applied.</p><p>It appears from the history of the Orkneys compiled by an old Islandic writer,
                    translated and enlarged by Torfaeus, that the Aebudae, or Western isles of
                    Scotland, were divided into two clusters, Nordureys and Sudereys. The
                    Nor-dureys, which were separated from the Sudereys by the point of Ardnamurchan,
                    a promontory in Argyleshire, consisted of Muck, Egg, Rum, Canna, Skye, Rasay,
                    Barra, South Uist, North Uist, Benbecula, and Lewis, including Harris, with a
                    great number of small isles. The Sudereys were, Man, Arran, Bute, Cumra, Avon,
                    Gid, Isla, Colonsay, Jura, Scarba, Mull, Iona, Tiree, Coll, Ulva, and other
                    small islands. All these, when joined together, and subject to the same prince,
                    made up the kingdom of Man and the Isles. In the Norwegian language, <hi rend="italic">Suder</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Norder</hi> signify southern and
                    northern, and <hi rend="italic">ey</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ay</hi> an island.
                    When the Hebrides were under one monarch, the seat of empire was fixed in the
                    Sudereys, and the Nordureys were governed by deputies: hence the former are much
                    oftener mentioned in history than the latter; hence, too, the Su-dereys often
                    comprehend the Nordureys, as in our days Scotland is sometimes comprehended
                    under England. Su-dereys, or Suder, when Anglicised, became Sodor; and all the
                    Western isles of Scotland being included in one diocese under the Norwegian
                    princes, the bishop appointed to superintend them was called the bishop of Man
                    and the Isles, or the bishop of Sodor and Man. Since Man was conquered by Edward
                    III. it has been separated from the other isles, and its bishops have exercised
                    no jurisdiction over them. Should it now be asked, why then is the bishop of Man
                    still called the bishop of Sodor and Man? we reply, that we have been able to
                    discover no reason; but suppose the appellation to be continued in the same way,
                    as the title king of France was retained by the kings of Great Britain, for
                    several centuries after the English were entirely expelled from France.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
