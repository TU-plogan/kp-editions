                <p><label type="entry">STRANGE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Robert</hi></label>, an
                    eminent engraver, who carried the art to great perfection in this country, and
                    was distinguished not only us an artist, but highly respected and beloved on
                    account of his private virtues and domestic habits. Modest as he was ingenious,
                    he used to say that the works of an artist should serve for his life and
                    monument. His works no doubt will perpetuate his name while any taste for the
                    fine arts remains. He was born in the island of Pomona, in Orkney, on the 14th
                    of July 1721, being lineally descended from David Strange or Strang, a younger
                    son of the family of the Stranges or Strangs of Balcasky, in the county of Fife,
                    who settled in Orkneyat the time of the Reformation. But as there were no males
                    remaining of the elder branch of the Stranges of Balcasky, Sir Robert became the
                    male representative of it, and was found by a legal investigation to have a
                    right to the armorial bearings and every other mark of honour belonging to that
                    ancient family. He received his classical education in Kirkwall in Orkney, under
                    the care of a learned, worthy, and much respected gentleman, Mr Murdoch
                    Mackenzie, who has rendered very important service to his country by the
                    accurate surveys and charts which he has given of the islands of Orkney, and of
                    the British and Irish coasts.</p>
                <p>Originally intended for the law, Mr Strange soon became tired of that profession,
                    and perceived that his genius decisively led him to the arts of drawing and
                    engraving. For this purpose he was introduced to Mr Richard Cooper of Edinburgh,
                    the only person there who had any taste in that department of the fine arts. He
                    was bound with him as an apprentice for six years; during which time he made
                    such progress in his new profession, that his friends entertained the highest
                    expectation of his success; nor were they disappointed.<pb break="no"

                    In the year 1747 he married Isabella, only daughter of William Lumsden, son of
                    Bishop Lumsden; and soon after his marriage he went to France, where with the
                    most ardent application he prosecuted his studies, chiefly at Paris, under the
                    direction of the celebrated Le Bas, who engraved many excellent prints from the
                    Dutch painters. It was from Le Bas that he had the first hint of the use of the
                    instrument commonly called the <hi rend="italic">dry needle;</hi> but which he
                    afterwards greatly improved by his own genius, and which has added such superior
                    beauties to his engravings.</p>
                <p>In the year 1751 Mr Strange removed with his family from Edinburgh, and settled
                    in London, where he engraved several fine historical prints, which justly
                    acquired to him great reputation. At this period historical engraving had made
                    little progress in Britain, and he may be properly considered as its father. The
                    admiration which he always had for the works of the great Italian painters made
                    him long desire to visit Italy, the seat of the fine arts; and the farther he
                    advanced in life, he became the more persuaded that a journey to that country
                    was essential to an artist who had the laudable ambition to excel in his
                    profession. He therefore undertook this journey in the year 1760. In Italy he
                    made many admirable drawings, several of which he afterwards engraved. In Italy
                    singular marks of attention were everywhere bestowed on Mr Strange, not only by
                    great personages, but by the principal academies of the fine arts in that
                    country. He was chosen a member of the academies of Rome, Florence, and Bologna,
                    and professor in the royal academy at Parma. To show the estimation in which his
                    talents were held at Rome, we cannot but record the following anecdote. The
                    ceiling of the room of the Vatican library, in which the collection of
                    engravings is kept, is elegantly painted by Signor Roffanelli. It represents the
                    progress of engraving; and the portraits of the most eminent artists in that
                    line are there introduced, among which is that of Strange. Under his arm he
                    holds a portfolio, on which his name is inscribed. In France, where he resided
                    many years at different periods, his talents likewise received every mark of
                    attention that could be bestowed on a foreigner. He was chosen a member of the
                    royal academy of painting at Paris. Nor was he undistinguished in his own
                    country. He received the honour of knighthood on the 5th of January 1787.</p>
                <p>Such was Sir Robert Strange as an artist; nor was he less distinguished by his
                    truly amiable moral qualities, which endeared him to all who had the happiness
                    to know him. With regard to his works, he left fifty capital plates, which have
                    been carefully preserved in his family. They are engraved from pictures by the
                    most celebrated painters of the Roman, Florentine, Lombard, Venetian, and other
                    schools. They are historical both sacred and profane, poetical, allegorical.</p>
                <p>From his earliest establishment in life, Sir Robert carefully preserved about
                    eighty copies of the finest and most choice impressions of each plate he
                    engraved; which, from length of time, have acquired a beauty, mellowness, and
                    brilliancy, easier seen than described. He did this with a view of presenting
                    them to the public at a period when age should disable him from adding to their
                    number. These he collected into as many volumes, and arranged them in the order
                    in which they were engraved. To each volume he prefixed two portraits of
                    himself, on the same plate, the one an etching, the other a finished proof, from
                    a drawing by John Baptiste Greuse. This is the last plate which he engraved, and
                    is a proof that neither his eyes nor hand were impaired by age. It likewise
                    shows the use he made both of aquafortis and the graver. Each volume, besides a
                    dedication to the king, contains an introduction on the progress of engraving,
                    and critical remarks on the pictures from which his engravings are taken. These
                    volumes were ready to be given to the public, when Sir Robert’s death delayed
                    this magnificent publication. He died at London, 5th July 1792.</p>
