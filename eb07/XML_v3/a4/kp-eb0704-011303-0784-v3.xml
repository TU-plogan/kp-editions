                    formulary or confession of faith, long supposed to have been drawn up by
                    Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, in the fourth century, to justify himself
                    against the calumnies of his Arian enemies. But it is now generally allowed
                    among the learned not to have been his. Dr Waterland ascribes it to Hilary,
                    bishop of Arles, for the following among other reasons:—!. Because Honoratus of
                    Marseilles, the writer of his life, tells us that he composed an <hi rend="italic">Exposition of the Creed</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a more
                    proper title for the <hi rend="italic">Athanasian</hi> than that of <hi rend="italic">Creed</hi> simply, which it now bears. 2. Hilary was a great
                    admirer and follower of St Austin; and the whole composition of this creed is in
                    a manner upon St Austin’s plan, both with respect to the Trinity and
                    incarnation. 3. It is agreeable to the style of Hilary, as far as we can judge
                    from the little that is left of his works. Upon the whole he concludes, that
                    Hilary, bishop of Arles, about the year 430 composed the <hi rend="italic">Exposition of Faith,</hi> which now bears the name of the <hi rend="italic">Athanasian Creed,</hi> for the use of the Gallican clergy, and particularly
                    those of the diocese of Arles; that, about the year 570, it became famous enough
                    to be commented upon; but that all this while, and for several years longer, it
                    had not yet acquired the name of <hi rend="italic">Athanagian,</hi> but was
                    simply styled <hi rend="italic">The Catholic Faith;</hi> that before 679
                    Athanasius’s admired name came in to recommend and adorn it, being in itself an
                    excellent system of the Athanasian principles of the Trinity and incarnation, in
                    opposition chiefly to the Arians, Macedonians, and Apollinarians. Such is the
                    hypothesis of the learned author of the <hi rend="italic">Critical History of
                    the Athanasian Creed.</hi> As to the reception of this creed in the Christian
                    churches, we find that it obtained in France in the time of Hinemar, or about
                    850; that it was received in Spain about 100 years later than in France, and in
                    Germany much about the same time. As to our own country, we have clear and
                    positive proofs of this creed being sung alternately in our churches in the 10th
                    century. It was in common use in some parts of Italy, particularly in the
                    diocese of Verona, about the year 960, and was received at Rome about the year
                    1014. As to the Greek and oriental churches, it has been questioned whether any
                    of them ever received this creed at all; though some very considerable writers
                    are of a contrary persuasion. It appears, then, that the reception of this creed
                    has been both general and ancient, and it may vie with any, in that respect,
                    except the Nicene or Constantinopolitan, the only general creed common to all
                    the churches. As to its matter, it is given as a summary of the true orthodox
                    'aith, and a condemnation of all heresies ancient and modern. Unhappily,
                    however, it has proved a fruitful source of unprofitable controversy and
                    unchristian animosity.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
