                    north by Egypt, on the south by Abyssinia, on the east by the Red Sea, and on
                    the west by the great Libyan desert. It is difficult to fix the precise limits
                    and extent of this vast region, which will be variously estimated, according as
                    we confine Nubia to the mere valley of the Nile between the first cataract and
                    Meroë, or take into the account, as ought certainly to be done, the adjacent
                    desert. There is, in fact, no principle of unity according to which it can be
                    described as a whole; but, looking rather to the country itself than to any
                    arbitrary definition or limitation, it may be considered as included between the
                    thirteenth and twenty-fourth degrees of north latitude, and the thirty-third and
                    thirty-sixth degrees of east longitude, and consequently as having a superficial
                    area of not less than 360,000 square miles.</p><p>With the exception of the immediate banks of the Nile, which are rendered
                    partially productive by laborious irrigation, Nubia consists almost entirely of
                    rocky and sandy deserts. From the southern boundary of Egypt to Derr, the
                    capital of Lower Nubia, the mountains press so closely upon the river, that
                    there is but little ground upon either side for the purposes of agriculture; and
                    the small portion which is capable of being cultivated appears to be
                    diminishing, from the gradual encroachment of the sands, which the winds of the
                    desert carry towards the stream. The peculiar structure of the valley through
                    which the Nile here forces a passage, renders it obvious that there could not at
                    any period have been a very dense population <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> in
                    this part of Nubia. But farther up the river, beyond the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560674" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0674-0293"/>parallel of
                    Wady Halfa, there is ample space for the powerful nations which are said to have
                    flourished here in ancient times. At the second cataract immense plains stretch
                    out from either margin of the stream, exhibiting, it is said, even in their
                    present neglected condition, unequivocal indications of fertility; and as there
                    seems to be little doubt that, in former ages, the annual inundation extended
                    considerably beyond the limits of modern cultivation, so it may reasonably be
                    presumed that, anciently, the country was much more productive and populous than
                    in modern times, when the decrease of the inundation, and the continual
                    encroachment of the moving sands on the side both of the Nubian and the Libyan
                    deserts, have combined to produce the desolation which now prevails. At present
                    the Nile seldom or never overflows its banks in this part of Nubia; and the
                    portion of the soil cultivated is irrigated by means of <hi rend="italic">sakkeas</hi> or Persian wheels, constructed for raising the water of the river
                    to the level of the adjacent ground. The eastern bank of the Nile is much better
                    adapted for cultivation than the western, being more easily irrigated by
                    artificial means. But it is not a little remarkable, that all the splendid ruins
                    for which this region is distinguished, and which exhibit so great labour,
                    ingenuity, and skill, are found upon the opposite bank; a circumstance which
                    seems to strengthen the presumption that Nubia was formerly much more fertile
                    and populous than in the present day.</p><p>The country on the banks <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Nile is divided into a
                    number of little independent principalities, each governed by its own <hi rend="italic">melek</hi> or chief. But, taken as a whole, it is composed of two
                    parts; Wady Kenous, and Wady Nouba. The former extends from the confines of
                    Egypt on the south to Wady Seboua; and the latter, from which the general name
                    of the country appears to have been derived, stretches as far as the frontier of
                    Dongola. The chief distinction between these two parts consists in the
                    circumstance, that the languages spoken in each are entirely different. The
                    governors of the various districts are described as ferocious and arbitrary in
                    their proceedings; rude in their treatment of strangers, whom they regard with
                    suspicion; and addicted to most of the vices which are common amongst
                    barbarians. They acknowledge a nominal subjection to the viceroy of Egypt, but
                    seldom neglect any opportunity .that offers of setting his authority at nought.
                    Still, under the safeguard of his firman, Europeans may travel as far as Ibrim
                    (the ancient <hi rend="italic">Prim mis')</hi> in perfect safety; but, beyond
                    that point, they must lay their account with being exposed to the vexations and
                    dangers usually incurred in visiting barbarous countries, especially in Africa.
                    In the marauding, slave-hunting expedition of Ismael Pasha in 1821, the
                    treatment which the natives everywhere experienced has had the effect of
                    exasperating and confirming the hostility of all the tribes who inhabit the
                    upper parts of Nubia; nor is it likely that the remembrance of the wanton
                    aggression which was then made upon them will soon be effaced from their
                    memories. Each of the Nubian sheicks pays an annual tribute to the viceroy of
                    Egypt; or rather a certain sum is extorted as an acknowledgment of subjection,
                    and the price of an immunity from a visit by the viceroy’s troops.</p><p>The grain which forms the principal object of Nubian cultivation is dhourra, the
                    <hi rend="italic">holcus arundinaceus</hi> of the botanists. It is raised upon
                    the patches of soil irrigated by means of the sakkeas or Persian wheels, of
                    which there are from six to seven hundred between the first and second
                    cataracts; and, when ground, it is formed into a cake somewhat resembling the
                    Abyssinian <hi rend="italic">teff.</hi> But as the people have no mills of any
                    kind wherewith to grind it, this is usually effected by placing the grain in
                    small quantities upon a large stone, and rubbing a smaller one over it until it
                    is reduced to a sort of flour. If it be intended to produce bread of a superior
                    quality, the dhourra is well washed, and then dried in the sun. But in general
                    the people do not take this trouble; and the meal produced by their rude mode of
                    grinding resembles a paste of the coarsest kind, mixed with chaff, sand, and
                    dirt. It is usually placed in an earthen jar, and there left to ferment during
                    twenty-four or thirty hours, after which time it acquires a subacid taste. No
                    leaven is formed. A portion of the fermented pulp is merely poured upon an iron
                    plate or stone placed over a fire, and in a few minutes it is baked into a cake;
                    and this is repeated till the whole be baked. Cakes are usually brought hot to
                    table, in a wooden bowl, with onion sauce, broth, milk, or butter poured on
                    them; but some of a thinner kind, and well toasted, are prepared for the use of
                    the caravans, and may be kept without being spoiled for several months. After
                    the dhourra, the Nubians raise a crop of barley, French beans, lentils, and
                    sometimes also of water-melons. Tobacco is everywhere cultivated, and
                    constitutes the principal luxury of all classes, being either smoked, or sucked
                    in a peculiar manner between the gums and the lip. Animal food is scarce, and
                    seldom eaten, even by the chiefs or sheicks. The liquors used are palm wine, a
                    spirit distilled from dates, and a sort of beer called <hi rend="italic">bouza,</hi> which is made from dhourra. Excessive indulgence in these liquors
                    is general throughout the whole country. The only fruit trees cultivated in
                    Nubia are palms, but the soil is adapted for several others. Great sameness
                    prevails in the vegetation of the desert, the trees being mostly acacias,
                    tamarix, date, and domm palms.</p><p>The climate of Nubia, though intensely hot in summer, is nevertheless remarkably
                    healthy. This is no doubt a consequence of the extreme dryness of the
                    atmosphere, occasioned by the absence of rain, and the absorbent qualities of
                    the soil. The plague has seldom or never reached Wady Halfa, and beyond the
                    second cataract it is entirely unknown. The small-pox, however, , is a fearful
                    scourge, and, owing to the ignorance and filthiness of the people, occasionally
                    commits dreadful ravages. The houses of the Nubians are constructed of mud or of
                    loose stones. The mud huts are roofed with dhourra stems or palm leaves, which
                    in this climate are found to be a sufficient covering. The houses which are
                    built of stones, being for the accommodation of the better class of inhabitants,
                    commonly consist of two compartments, one for the male and the other for the
                    female members of the family. The utensils of a Nubian household are few and
                    wretched; half a dozen coarse earthen jars, some earthen plates, two stones for
                    grinding dhourra, and a few round sticks, usually constituting their whole
                    stock. From this an idea may be formed of the miserable condition of the
                    inhabitants, as compared with those of any other country, Egypt only
                    excepted.</p><p>Still the Nubians are generally well made, strong, and muscular, and have
                    tolerably good features. The women are not handsome, but perfectly well formed,
                    and in general remarkable for agreeable countenances and pleasing manners. They
                    are also modest and reserved, and strictly observant of their conjugal duties.
                    The domestic employments of the women consist chiefly in weaving coarse woollen
                    mantles, cotton cloth for shirts, and mats of the date leaves; they also make
                    drinking-bowls, and plates for containing the dhourra bread. A linen cap and a
                    woollen cloth or mantle constitute the dress of the rich. The women usually wrap
                    themselves in black woollen gowns; but children of both sexes run about quite
                    naked. In ascending the Nile to Sukkat and Mahas, the dress becomes more and
                    more scanty, and at length almost entirely disappears. The Nubians are seldom
                    seen unarmed; indeed the first purchase made by a boy is that of a short crooked
                    knife, which being fastened at the left elbow, is ready to be drawn on the
                    slightest quarrel. Fire-arms are not common, and ammunition is very scarce. The
                    inhabitants of the two divisions of Nubia, Wady Kenous and Wady Nouba, are
                    almost constantly engaged in sanguinary quarrels; and when <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560687" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0687-0294"/>death ensues,
                    as is not unfrequently the case, the family of the deceased may either demand
                    the price of blood, or retain the right of retaliation, which may be enforced
                    against the brother, son, or first cousin of the murderer, at the option of the
                    avenger. The consequence of this is, that when a death has occurred in any of
                    these quarrels, a whole family is often obliged to leave the country. Great
                    numbers of the Nubians repair to Cairo, where they usually act as porters, and
                    are esteemed for their honesty; but they always return to their native villages
                    with the little property which they have saved in plying their humble vocation.
                    The inhabitants of Derr-el-Mahas and the more southerly districts differ
                    considerably from the other Nubian tribes. Their houses are constructed only of
                    palm leaves, fastened to high poles, the extremities of which rise considerably
                    above the roofs. The countenances of the people are much less expressive of good
                    nature than in the lower parts of the country, and their character corresponds
                    with this difference of expression. In colour they are perfectly black, and
                    their lips are thick like those of the negro, but they have not the same flat
                    nose and high cheek-bones. A number of the men, and even girls who have attained
                    womanhood, go about quite naked. Burckhardt has described the king of the Mahas
                    as a mean vulgar-looking black, attended by some half dozen naked slaves, armed
                    with shields and lances. Mahas is the nearest place in the country of the
                    blacks, from which slave traders proceed to Cairo, a distance of abouta thousand
                    miles.</p><p>There is another part of Nubia which is well deserving of particular notice; we
                    mean the vast tract of country extending from the Nile to the Red Sea, between
                    the parallels of 23° and 15° of north latitude. Modern travellers have
                    penetrated this extensive region only by one line, namely, that which is
                    followed by the Nubian caravans proceeding from Egypt to Sennaar. It is
                    described as throughout a complete desert, without even a single fixed
                    habitation, but interspersed with <hi rend="italic">wadys</hi> or valleys,
                    producing some trees, shrubs, or grass, and usually containing a few wells or
                    rills, which are resorted to by the wandering Arabs, and also by the caravans,
                    for a supply of water. The want of this important article forms the chief danger
                    attending the journey; but if due precautions be taken, and the water-bags be
                    properly filled at the wells, travellers can never be reduced to a state of
                    great suffering, as many days seldom elapse without the means of obtaining a
                    supply. Burckhardt, after having passed through the deserts of Suez and Sinai,
                    did not consider this tract as quite so dreary, although its aspect is much more
                    rugged, being in general hilly. At the southern extremity of this desert,
                    through which roam the Bishareen tribes, is the district of Berber, consisting
                    of four large villages, the inhabitants of which are chiefly employed in
                    carrying on the trade of Egypt and Arabia with the interior of Africa. The
                    people are a very handsome race, of a reddish-brown colour; which, if the mother
                    be a slave from Abyssinia, becomes a light brown, but if from the negro
                    countries, extremely dark, indeed almost black. The men are somewhat taller than
                    the Egyptians, and also better ]imbed, and more muscular. Their features bear no
                    resemblance to those of the negro; the face being oval, the nose often perfectly
                    Grecian, and the cheek-bones by no means prominent. They consider themselves as
                    Arabs, not negroes, and are very careful in maintaining the purity of their
                    race. A free-born Meyrefab never marries a slave, whether Abyssinian or negro,
                    but always an Arab girl belonging· to his own or to some neighbouring tribe. Few
                    men have more than one wife; but every one who can afford it keeps a female
                    slave or mistress, either in his own or in a separate house; and traders passing
                    through Berber usually take a mistress during the period of their stay in the
                    district. Drunkenness is the constant companion of this debauchery; and these
                    dissolute habits produce the most pernicious effects on the morals and conduct
                    of the people, Their character indeed is deformed by every degrading and
                    debasing vice; they are noted for treachery and dishonesty; in the pursuit of
                    gain they are restrained by no principle, breaking without scruple the most
                    solemn engagements; and in transactions amongst themselves they commonly
                    terminate every dispute by the law of the strongest. Quarrels are frequent and
                    violent at drinking parties, and mostly end in bloodshed either with the knife
                    or the sword. The principal scenes of these disorders are the <hi rend="italic">bouza</hi> huts, which are kept by women of infamous character, by whom the
                    liquor is also manufactured. Indeed no one ventures to enter one of these
                    without his sword, and several persons of distinction have been killed in them.
                    In a word, it is marvellous that a people so completely abandoned to the
                    dominion of the most brutal passions have not long since been consumed by their
                    own vices. Another part of this territory is the district of Taka, inhabited by
                    the Bishareen Arabs. It is comparatively populous and fertile, differing in many
                    respects from the other parts of Nubia; and through it passes the road to
                    Souakin, followed by Burckhardt, the first who made us acquainted with Taka.</p><p>The government of Nubia, like that of Egypt, is essentially military. The
                    officers, all of whom are Turks, decide every question connected with the
                    revenues, and frequently interfere, in other affairs, with the decisions of the
                    cadis or civil judges. The system of the government is to extort from the
                    peasant the utmost possible amount in the shape of taxes, leaving him only what
                    is considered a sufficient subsistence, which, as might be expected, isusuallya
                    most miserable one. In some places, indeed, if the peasants did not actually
                    steal from their own fields, they could not exist; and although they bury their
                    grain under ground, and by various other methods deceive their oppressors, yet
                    numbers perish from the want of sufficient sustenance and clothing. A vast
                    proportion of the peasants subsist on food which is more calculated for cattle
                    than human beings; and even of this, bad as it is, they have rarely enough. The
                    pasha has power enough to keep them, in subjection, and by his extortions fills
                    his coffers. He not only imposes enormous taxes on every article of produce, but
                    obliges the people to cultivate whatever he chooses, and to take the price which
                    he offers for the produce. He is the only purchaser of the grain, cotton, and
                    indigo, the gum of Kordofan, ostrich feathers, and other articles. Slaves are
                    almost the only commodity which the merchants are allowed to take in exchange
                    for the manufactures which they carry to Kordofan and Sennaar; and even the wild
                    animals of the desert, as the giraffe, form a government monopoly. The pasha is
                    also the landlord or proprietor of this immense region; and the people are his
                    slaves. His revenues are derived not only from the regular taxes, but likewise
                    from his profits as a merchant, which are enormous, owingtothe low rate at'which
                    he pays the peasants for their produce, compared with the high price at which he
                    afterwards sells it to Europeans. This source of gain, however, is greatly
                    diminished by the roguery of the different officers through whose hands the
                    various commodities pass. From the highest to the lowest there is no exception
                    in this respect; mabmours, nayrs, kiachefs, ’ caimacans, and mallums or Coptic
                    accountants, all concur in diminishing the amount, and sharing the plunder·of
                    the unhappy peasantry. The Copts employed in this department not only cheat the
                    ignorant Turks, who generally cannot read their accounts, but often trade with
                    the money of the treasury, and sometimes incur losses they are unable to make
                    good; on which account numbers of them are always immured in the prisons of the
                    viceroy.</p><p>But the peasants in Upper Nubia are free from these exactions, and therefore
                    comparatively happy. It is no doubt true, that, instead of one dollar· in money,
                    two pieces <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560700" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0700-0295"/>of linen cloth, and a sheep, which was all they
                    paid their ancient meleks, they are now obliged to pay fifteen dollars in cash
                    and five in grain, being in all three hundred piastres, or ten times the amount
                    of their former contributions; and they are likewise obliged to work instead of
                    sleeping during the greater part of the day, as was formerly their custom when
                    under their own chiefs. But the man who is at all industrious may nevertheless
                    earn what is amply sufficient to afford him food, and such dress as he has been
                    accustomed to. Each sakkea or Persian wheel is sufficient to water three
                    quarters of a feddan of land, planted with indigo; and each feddan, when
                    carefully irrigated, produces a hundred cantars of the herb, and sometimes more,
                    being about seventy-five cantars for the extent of land which one wheel will
                    water. The government pay the peasant !2∣ Egyptian piastres for each quintal, or
                    937 piastres for the whole; which, at the current rate of the dollar in this
                    country (fifteen piastres), is equal to 62½ dollars. If from this we deduct
                    twenty dollars for the duty, there remains for the persons to whom the wheel
                    belongs 4&gt;2½ dollars, or 637 piastres; but as the calculation here made is at
                    the lowest rate, two piastres a day may fairly be estimated as the clear gain of
                    the peasantry by each water-wheel. This sum, small as it may appear, is
                    sufficient for the support of one fiunily, provided it contain five persons
                    capable of putting their shoulders to the wheel; if it do not, however, two
                    families must unite to make up this number. The immense expense of the
                    water-wheel forms a great deduction from the gain of the peasant in Egypt; but
                    in Nubia they are so much more simple that they cost only a trifling sum, as
                    oxen may be obtained for thirty piastres each, whilst their “keep” is next to
                    nothing. Two piastres, or sevenpence sterling, may appear a very small sum to a
                    European; but in this country, where every necessary is so cheap, it is amply
                    sufficient for the support of a family, in both divisions of Egypt, where bread
                    is much dearer, and meat and milk are double the price, the fixed remuneration
                    of a labourer amounts to only half a piastre per day, with which he has to
                    sustain himself and perhaps a family. But in Nubia most of the peasants have
                    slips of land watered by the partial inundation of the river, and gain
                    considerably by their date trees, although they pay a tax of a piastre for each.
                    They also rear flocks; cultivate vegetables, particularly bamia-and malakhia;
                    and make linen, spirit, bouza, and other articles. The condition of the peasants
                    of Upper Nubia is therefore happy, compared with that of the Fellaheen of Egypt,
                    the most oppressed and degraded population in the world.</p><p>The Arabs of the desert have still more reason to be satisfied with the
                    government. They pay tribute only for the land they cultivate, which is in
                    general very little, and in many cases none at all; and otherwise they gain a
                    sufficient livelihood by transporting to Egypt on their camels the grain
                    collected as revenue, or purchased by the government, and by aiding the passage
                    of troops and merchants, which is now unintermitted. As far as regards taxes,
                    and the means of subsistence, therefore, the Arabs of the desert in Upper Nubia,
                    as well as the peasants on the Nile, are in a much better condition than the
                    Fellaheen of Egypt. But in all other respects they are equally galled and
                    insulted by their Turkish rulers. In Egypt, the officers only are oppressive,
                    and the soldiers, who mostly belong to the class of Fellaheen, are not insolent.
                    In Nubia, however, it is far otherwise. The comparatively white complexion of
                    the troops, their character as conquerors, and their pride <hi rend="italic                     smallcaps"> ŭs</hi><hi rend="italic">askaria</hi> (soldiers), induce them to
                    despise the natives, and exercise oppressions which the government by no means
                    authorizes. When the chief governor of a province is a man possessed of talent,
                    energy, and firmness of character, the officers and soldiers are prevented from
                    committing many excesses. But when the country has the misfortune to be governed
                    by an individual destitute of the qualities we have mentioned, and too timid to
                    redress the grievances occasioned by the disorderly conduct of the troops, its
                    state may easily be imagined. Every evil is then aggravated by impunity. Men
                    whose ancestors have been meleks or chiefs in the country for ages, are obliged
                    to submit to the insolence and tyranny of a lawless soldiery. Taxes oppressive
                    in themselves are rendered tenfold more so by the mode in which they are levied.
                    Every collection is a species of military execution. No proper notice is almost
                    ever given. “Pay to-morrow, or the bastinado,” is the usual intimation conveyed
                    to the peasant, who, not being allowed sufficient time to raise the money, is
                    subjected to this cruel and degrading punishment, and sometimes nailed by the
                    ear to a board. The revolt of the Mahas, described by Mr Hoskins, was occasioned
                    by this summary mode of collecting some arrears of taxes.</p><p>Nubia, under proper management, might become a far greater source of wealth to
                    the ruler of Egypt than it now is, or seems likely to be, under his sway. His
                    system is one which is not only calculated to defeat its own objects in a fiscal
                    point of view, but to exasperate the natives, whom good policy would try to
                    conciliate, and also to sow the seeds of future anarchy and convulsion. At the
                    same time, notwithstanding the galling conduct of the Egyptian authorities, the
                    natives are sensible of the advantage of a firm and settled government; and the
                    peasants of the Nile, in particular, are glad to be released from the tyranny
                    and spoliation which accompanied the feuds and petty wars by which the country
                    was formerly distracted. “Did the Turks,” says Mr Hoskins, “but treat them as
                    men, and not disgust them by their insulting manners, and by inflicting on them
                    such degrading and infamous punishments; had their rulers but a few ideas of
                    common policy and legislation; the resources [of the country] might be greatly
                    augmented, the revenue increased, and the people the most happy and contented
                    under the sun. The superiority which fire-arms afforded to their haughty
                    conquerors taught them to despise the strength of the Arabs; and, with that
                    insolence which is ever united with ignorance, they do not, in the slightest
                    degree, endeavour to attach them to the government, or, in fact, condescend to
                    treat, otherwise than as a vastly inferior race, the people whom it cost them so
                    much, with all their advantages, to conquer.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hoskins, Travels in Ethiopia, pp. 230,
                    23G.</p></note></p><p>The chief trade of Nubia, as already mentioned, consists in slaves imported from
                    the interior of Africa, and either conveyed northwards to Egypt, or sent across
                    the Red Sea from Souakin to Jidda. The annual import is estimated at about 5000,
                    of whom 2500 are for Arabia, 1500 for Egypt, and 1000 for Dongola and the
                    Bedouins of the mountains. Few of the slaves are above the age of fifteen; but
                    the most valued are those between eleven and fifteen, who, if males, sell for
                    fifteen or sixteen dollars, and if females, for twenty-five or twenty-six. In
                    the East, slaves are chiefly employed as domestics, and people are seldom fond
                    of any who have not been in the family from an early age. These children, as
                    long as they remain within the negro territories, are treated with great
                    indulgence; but when they once enter the desert, and have no longer any chance
                    of escape, this treatment is entirely changed, and the lash unsparingly applied.
                    The health of the slave, however, is always attended to; he is regularly fed,
                    and receives a share of water with his master. Dates, gums, and ostrich feathers
                    are also exported; as are senna leaves, ebony, sandal-wood, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560713" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0713-0296"/>and some other
                    articles, though in small quantities. Gold is found in mines, and amongst the
                    river sands, but not in such abundance as to form any considerable article of
                    exchange.</p><p>One of the most remarkable features of this region consists in the magnificent
                    monumental remains with which it is covered along the line of the stream, and
                    which continue to perpetuate the genius and power of the ancient population of
                    the country situated on the Upper Nile. That Egypt was indebted to Ethiopia
                    (which included Nubia) for the rudiments, and perhaps even for the finished
                    patterns, of architectural skill, is no longer questioned by any writer whose
                    pursuits have qualified him to form a judgment of the subject. Gau, in his
                    splendid work on Nubia, maintains it as a first principle, that this country was
                    the cradle of Egyptian architecture; and its monuments embrace the whole period
                    during which the art flourished in the valley of the Lower Nile. He conceives
                    that all the architecture of Egypt, from the first rude effort to cut a temple
                    in the rock, to the construction of those detached edifices which were
                    afterwards erected in the times of the Greeks and Romans, has its types in the
                    structures of Nubia. Hence, in the architectural history of that country, he
                    distinguishes three great epochs; the first comprehending the temples cut in the
                    sides of the hills or rocks, which are evidently the most ancient; the second,
                    those which are detached from the chambers cut in the rock, but still retain the
                    colossal masses of the primitive type; and the third, the small edifices of
                    Maharraga, Gartaas, and Dondour, with several analogous structures in Egypt.
                    This classification appears to be perfectly natural and well founded, inasmuch
                    as the only test of the relative antiquity of such monuments is a reference to
                    the comparative simplicity of their structure or formation. It is upon this
                    principle, therefore, that we shall now proceed to describe very shortly, some
                    of the principal temples and other edifices in Nubia.</p><p>At Gibel-el-Birkel, Waddington discovered two temples excavated in the solid
                    rock, and having only their exterior chambers formed of masonry; circumstances
                    in which they resemble those of Girshé, Seboua, and Derr. The smaller of the two
                    has six halls or apartments, five of which are cut in the body of the mountain;
                    the larger, constituting the entrance, stands on an artificial foundation of
                    stone, by means of which it is raised as high as the rock in which the other is
                    excavated. Near the adytum there are figures of Ammon and of Horus; and vestiges
                    of hieroglyphics may be discerned in all the chambers. From the plainness of the
                    masonry, the rudeness and decay of the sculptures, and the decomposition of the
                    walls, it has been concluded that this is older than any of the temples of
                    Egypt, or even of Nubia. The temple of Girshé also belongs to the more simple
                    order of structures, and indicates a rude state of the arts connected with
                    architecture. The porticoconsists of five square columns on each side, cut out
                    of the rock, with a row of circular pillars in front, constructed of several
                    blocks, and originally surmounted with an entablature, though only two of them
                    now remain. Before every one of the square columns stands a colossal statue of
                    sandstone, eighteen feet in height, holding a lash or flail in one hand, and the
                    other hanging down; the figure of each is that of a male, with the pointed beard
                    under the chin, the high sphinx-cap on the head, and the shoulders covered with
                    hieroglyphical inscriptions. On both sides of the porticothere is an open alley,
                    which is hewn in the rock. The pronaos, eighteen yards square, is entered from
                    the portico and contains two rows of immense columns without capitals, in front
                    of each of which there is a colossal figure, more than twenty feet in height,
                    with the hands crossed on the breast, and holding the flagellum in one, and the
                    handled cross, or emblem of life, in the other. On the side walls are four
                    recesses or niches, in each of which are three statues of the natural size,
                    representing the different figures, male and female, which are observed upon the
                    walls <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the temples of Egypt. A door leads from the
                    pronaos into the cella, in the middle of which there are two massive pillars,
                    and, upon either side, a small apartment. Very little is now discernible of the
                    sculpture and hieroglyphics with which the walls were covered; but enough
                    remains to show that they were very rudely executed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is the same place which by other
                    travellers is called Guerfch Hassan, or Gwersh Hassan, and is described with
                    much minuteness in several of their works. (See Henniker, Notes, &amp;c. p.
                    154.)</p></note> The ruined structure at Seboua has before it a propylon similar
                    to that of Gournch at Thebés. The pronaos on each of its longest sides has five
                    columns without capitals, and in front of each is a colossal figure, sixteen
                    feet in height, with the arms crossed on the breast, and the usual emblems in
                    the hands. Before the entrance there lies on the ground a huge statue, the head
                    and bust of which are buried in the sand; and in front of the propylon are two
                    statues, ten feet in height, with their faces towards the river, and attached by
                    the backs to stone pillars of equal elevation. An avenue of sphinxes leads from
                    the bank of the Nile to the temple, but the greater part of them are now buried
                    in the sand, four only remaining visible. The whole fabric appears to be of the
                    remotest antiquity, and has been imitated by the more modern architects of
                    Egypt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The propylon and
                    pronaos are found, on a large scale, at Gournch, near Thebes; the two statues in
                    advance of the propylon are the miniatures of those in front of the Memnonium;
                    and the sphinxes are seen are Karnak.</p></note></p><p>But of all the rock temples of Nubia, that of Ebsamboul or Ipsamboul,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name, as spelled by
                    Belzoni, is <hi rend="italic">Ybsambul,</hi> whilst others write it <hi rend="italic">Ebsamboul</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ibsamboul.</hi> But all these
                    forms are probably corruptions of <hi rend="italic">Abou-Sambul,</hi> which
                    appears to be the genuine name.</p></note><hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> about
                    a day and a half’s journey below the second cataract, is incomparably the most
                    remarkable. In the course of centuries the sand of the desert had so completely
                    overwhelmed it, that nothing appeared to the eye of the traveller except the
                    bust of one of the colossal figures which were placed at the front of the
                    entrance. But the dimensions of this statue were so great as to excite the
                    curiosity of all who examined it; and the countenance, when seen at a proper
                    distance, appeared strikingly beautiful. Animated with a desire to explore the
                    buried structure of which this statue formed an exterior ornament, a party,
                    consisting of Mr Belzoni and Captains Irby and Mangles, with some attendants,
                    undertook to remove the sand, so far at least as to ascertain whether there was
                    a door-way, or any other access to the interior. At first they relied upon the
                    assistance of the natives, who readily entered into terms with them; but the
                    increasing fatigue, and an evident disinclination to the work, induced the
                    Nubians to break their engagement, and the travellers had no resource but to
                    complete the labour with their own hands. In the hot season of the year, and
                    with a scanty supply of necessaries, they worked day by day in the sand, from
                    sunrise till night; and at length, after more than three weeks of continued
                    exertion, each performing the labour of about a dozen Nubians, a corner of the
                    door-way became visible; and an entrance having been effected, the interior was
                    explored, probably for the first time during a thousand years.</p><p>The first glance at the interior convinced Belzoni and his associates that it was
                    evidently a very large structure; but their astonishment increased when they
                    found it to be one of the most magnificent of temples, enriched with <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560726" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0726-0297"/>
                    beautiful intaglios, paintings, and colossal figures. The pronaos, fifty-seven
                    feet in length, and fifty in breadth, is supported by two rows of square pillars
                    in a straight line from the front door to that of the sekos; and each pillar has
                    attached to it a figure finely executed, and very little injured by time, the
                    top of the head-dress reaching the ceiling, which is about thirty feet in
                    height. Both the pillars and the walls are covered with representations of
                    battles, storming of castles, triumphs, and sacrifices, in a style, if not
                    superior to, at least bolder than, that of almost any in Egypt, both in regard
                    to the design and the workmanship. The second hall, which is of less dimensions,
                    contains four pillars about four feet square, and the walls are covered with
                    hieroglyphics in tolerable preservation. Beyond this there is a chamber of the
                    same width, but shorter, in which is the entrance to the sanctuary; and at each
                    end is a door leading into smaller apartments in the same direction with the
                    adytum. The sanctuary itself is twenty-three feet in length by twelve in
                    breadth, and contains a pedestal in the centre, with four colossal figures in a
                    sitting posture at the end, all in good order, and uninjured. On the right side
                    of the great hall there are two doors at a short distance from each other, and
                    which lead into two separate apartments of considerable dimensions, at the end
                    of which are several unfinished hieroglyphics, sketched so as to give an idea of
                    the manner of drawing. At the lateral corners of the entrance from the first
                    into the second chamber are doors, each of which leads into a chamber twenty
                    feet by ten; and these again open into other apartments, forty-three feet in
                    length by eleven in breadth. The most remarkable subjects in this temple are a
                    group of captive Ethiopians in the western corner; a hero killing a man with his
                    spear, and another lying dead at his feet; and the storming of a castle, which
                    forms part of the representation. The outside or external front of this temple
                    is truly magnificent, being a hundred and seventeen feet in width, and
                    eighty-six feet in height, whilst the space from the top of the cornice to that
                    of the door is sixty-six feet and a half, and the height of the door itself
                    twenty feet. There are four enormous sitting figures, the largest in Nubia, or
                    even in Egypt, excepting only the great sphinx at the Pyramids, to which they
                    approach in the proportion of nearly two thirds. On the top of the door is a
                    statue of Osiris, twenty feet in height, with a colossal figure on each side
                    looking towards it. The cornice of the temple is adorned with hieroglyphics, and
                    under it are a torus and frize, the one six and the other four feet in breadth.
                    Above the cornice is a row of squatted monkeys, twenty in number, and each eight
                    feet and a half across the shoulders. This temple was nearly two thirds buried
                    in the sand, of which thirty-one feet were removed before reaching the upper
                    part of the door. It is excavated in the solid rock, which here rises about a
                    hundred feet above the Nile, and, excepting one of the tombs at Biban-el-Molouk,
                    is the largest of the kind either in Egypt or Nubia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>"The heat was so great in the interior of the
                    temple,” says Belzoni, “that it scarcely permitted us to take any drawings, as
                    the perspiration from our hands soon rendered the paper quite wet. Accordingly,
                    we left this operation to succeeding travellers, who may set about it with more
                    convenience than we could, as the place will become cooler.” (Narrative, p.
                    214.)</p></note></p><p>At a subsequent period, Mr Bankes visited Ebsamboul, and succeeded in uncovering
                    down to the feet one of the four colossal sitting figures, upon the limbs of
                    which he discovered and copied an inscription in Greek relating to Psammeticus.
                    He next cleared the head of the fourth colossal figure, which had not before
                    emerged above the surface, so as to be able to make a drawing of the whole; and
                    the approach being thus disencumbered, the interior of the temple was lighted up
                    with wax candles fixed on upright poles, to enable Mr Bankes and his assistant
                    draughtsmen to copy all the paintings in detail. It is much to be regretted that
                    the labour in opening this temple has not been attended with any permanent
                    effect; the winds of the desert and the natural lubricity of the sand having
                    soon rendered the approach nearly as difficult as before. In about two years the
                    door-way was again covered up, and by this time the interior must be quite as
                    inaccessible as ever. All travellers agree in the accounts they give of
                    Ebsamboul, which is described as the <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi rend="italic">plus ultra</hi> of Egyptian labour. According to Sir Frederick Henniker, there
                    is no temple at Denderah, Thebes, or Philae, that can be put in comparison with
                    it; and the traveller just named rejoices in “having seen the noblest monument
                    of antiquity that is to be found on the banks of the Nile.” This is not the
                    place to enter into details respecting the hieroglyphical emblems and
                    inscriptions with which different parts of - this wonderful structure are
                    covered. The larger chamber is <hi rend="subscript"> jf</hi> distinguished as
                    the temple of Osiris, and the smaller as that of Isis, to whom it is dedicated.
                    The former is represented in a sitting posture, attended by the hawk-beaded
                    deity; whilst the latter holds in her hand the lotus-headed sceptre, surrounded
                    with numerous inscriptions and emblems. Much interesting sculpture is also
                    lavished upon the second and third apartments; and in a niche at the upper end
                    of the latter is a small statue of Nephthe, thewife of Typhon, seated. In
                    several places of the square border which encircles the front of the temple, and
                    also on the buttresses between the colossal figures, are a number of ovals or
                    rings, containing the name and praenomen of Ramesses the Great, the same Pharaoh
                    whom the Greeks indicate by the name of Sesostris or Sethosis. We may here add,
                    that a striking resemblance has been observed between the rock temples of India,
                    particularly that in the island of Elephanta, and those of Nubia, especially
                    that of Ebsamboul; indeed the similarity is so great as to have suggested the
                    notion of a common origin, as well in regard to the mythology as the
                    architecture of both countries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See is me s Account of the Cave-lemple of l£lephanta, in the

                    twenty-first and twenty-second degree of north latitude, affords a specimen of a
                    more perfect class of structures; intermediate, it would seem, between such
                    excavations as that of Ebsamboul and the magnificent edifices of Karnak and
                    Luxor. It is built of sandstone, and differs in shape from other edifices of a
                    similar kind, though in its plan it somewhat resembles the small chapel at
                    Elephantina in Egypt. The principal building is about thirty-six feet in length
                    and nine in breadth. On either hand there stood originally four small pillars,
                    of which two remain on the one side, and three on the other, all covered with
                    sculptures. The inner walls are adorned with hieroglyphics and mystic
                    representations, amongst which may be mentioned the ship of Osiris; and upon the
                    outer wall Burckhardt’s distinguished figures of Mendes. The sculptures are
                    rather coarsely executed, and the lines dividing the columns of hieroglyphics,
                    some of which have been left unfinished, are not straight. The temple of Dondour
                    or Tangour is likewise deserving of attention, from the peculiarities of its
                    style, having been classed by Gau amongst those structures which belong to the
                    last of the epochs of Nubian art already mentioned. It is in form a
                    parallelogram, having the proportions observed in some Grecian structures; and
                    in the pillars may be recognised the mixed Greek and Egyptian style. Between the
                    second and third cataract, in latitude twenty-one degrees north, is the temple
                    of Soleb or Solib. An elevated stone foundation extends in front of the temple,
                    and the remains of two sphinxes are seen at either side of the approach. The
                    first <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560739" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0739-0298"/>chamber is more than a hundred feet in breadth,
                    and about ninety feet in depth, having round three of its sides a single row of
                    pillars, and on the fourth indications of a double row. They have all been
                    executed from the same model, and are inscribed with hieroglyphics. In the
                    second chamber may be traced a row of pillars, resembling those of the first;
                    but they are all broken, and the fragments scattered about in every direction.
                    The dimensions of the adytum cannot now be ascertained, the side walls having
                    been completely destroyed. The temple of Soleb affords the lightest specimen
                    anywhere to be seen of Ethiopian architecture, and, for elegance of proportion,
                    has been compared to that of Minerva Sunias at Cape Colonna. At Gibel-el-Birkel
                    there are the remains of two temples, partly excavated in the rock, and partly
                    constructed, like those of Girshé and Seboua. The principal temple is of vast
                    dimensions, and contains no less than six chambers. It is supposed to have been
                    the work of different and distant periods; and, even in the construction of
                    those parts which belonged to the original building, many stones were employed
                    which had formed parts of some more ancient edifice. The vicinity of
                    Gibel-el-Birkel is remarkable for pyramids, which, though much inferior to those
                    of Egypt, probably originated in the same views of vanity or superstition, not
                    to say tyranny. For further information on the subject of Nubian rock
                    excavations and architecture, the reader is referred to the works of Burckhardt,
                    Light, Legh, Richardson, Henniker, Caillaud, Waddington, and Hoskins, in which
                    will be found ample descriptions of the remains on either side of the Nile, from
                    Assouan to Meroë, accompanied occasionally with drawings and plans. The reader
                    is also referred to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Ethiopia, Ethiopian
                    Nations,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Meroe.</hi></p><p>On the whole, it appears that, by a more accurate classification of the
                    monuments, and the aid of inscriptions, which to former travellers were
                    altogether unintelligible, we are now enabled to rectify misconceptions, correct
                    mistakes, discard mere conjectures, and, in fact, make a real and valuable
                    addition to the history of civilized Egypt. Between the temples excavated in the
                    rock, such as those of Derr and Ebsamboul, and the buildings of a later date,
                    there was an intermediate stage in the art, which it is important to
                    distinguish. The first architectural attempt in Nubia probably consisted in the
                    improvement of some hole or cave in the rock; or, even if the country possessed
                    no natural caves for imitation by a people possessing the troglodyte habits
                    natural to the inhabitants of a burning climate, the mountains themselves would
                    afford facilities for constructing durable habitations. After having got
                    possession of a hole or cave, the next step of these primitive architects would
                    probably be to extend the excavation, to form several chambers separated by the
                    native rock, and when a compartment of larger dimensions was designed, to have
                    square pillars for the support of the roof. In the course of time the outer
                    front, with the inner walls and pillars, would receive decorations derived from
                    imitations of the natural forms of the country, and subjects connected with the
                    historical remembrances or religious creed of the nation. We see abundant
                    evidence in the rock temples of Nubia to convince us, that the order of
                    progression and improvement here indicated was that actually followed in their
                    gradual enlargement and decoration; yet a prodigious period must have elapsed
                    between the rudest excavation in the rock, such as Derr appears to have been in
                    its primitive state, and the highly-finished sculptures of the great temple of
                    Ebsamboul. In fact, “antiquity appears to have begun” long after these primeval
                    architects had commenced their troglodyte labours. But, in surveying the wonders
                    which crowd the banks of the Nile from Meroë to Memphis, our minds become
                    insensibly impressed with the reflection, that the wealth, power, and genius
                    which produced them have entirely passed away; that, if the new worlds have
                    risen, and new races been discovered, “we have lost old nations and that, in the
                    lapse of ages, empires themselves vanish, like the baseless fabric of a vision,
                    leaving scarcely a wreck or trace behind them. Throughout many parts of this
                    extensive tract, a race little superior to savages pass a rude and precarious
                    life, ignorant of the arts which once flourished in their country, and
                    insensible to the beauty and magnificence of the ruins which they desecrate.
                    They have long ceased to claim any connection with the people who constructed
                    the monuments of Ebsamboul, Karnak, Luxor, and Gournch; and having relapsed into
                    that low condition where curiosity becomes dormant or extinct, they are only
                    moved with wonder when they observe the natives of civilized regions exploring
                    their temples, or taking the dimensions of their obelisks and pyramids. The
                    contrast between what now is, and what once must have been in Ethiopia and in
                    Egypt, is indeed most striking; nor is it easy to pass, even in thought, through
                    the various scenes of conquest and desolation which must have conspired to
                    produce the effects we contemplate. History sheds no light on events and
                    characters which the lapse of three thousand years has covered with impenetrable
                    obscurity; and whilstgrop-ing our way amidst temples dedicated to gods, and
                    structures raised in honour of heroes, whose very names sound like voices from
                    the dead, we content ourselves with the conclusion, which all the monuments
                    impress on us, that, long before the dawn of history, there had existed in that
                    singular region a great people, whose architectural monuments have outlasted
                    their learning, their philosophy, and almost even their very name.</p><p>(See Buckhardt’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in Nubia;</hi> Waddington’s <hi rend="italic">Journal of a Visit to some parts of Ethiopia;</hi> Richardson’s
