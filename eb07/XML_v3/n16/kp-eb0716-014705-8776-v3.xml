                <p><label type="entry">NEW BRUNSWICK</label>, a British province of North America,
                    situated between the parallels of 45. 5. and 48. 4. 30. north latitude, and the
                    meridians of 63. 47. 30. and 67. 53. longitude west of Greenwich. It is bounded
                    on the north by the Bay of Chaleurs and the river Ristigouche, which separate it
                    from Lower Canada; on the south by the Bay of Fundy and Chignecto inlet, which
                    nearly insulate Nova Scotia, the latter being divided on the land side by a
                    short boundary line; on the east by the Gulf of St Lawrence and Northumberland
                    Strait, the latter separating it from Prince Edward Island; and on the west by
                    the United States territory, from which it is separated chiefly by the river St
                    Croix. The whole of New Brunswick contains an area of 27,704 square miles, or
                    17,730,560 acres. The greater part of this vast territory is still in a natural
                    state, covered with dense forests and fine extended prairies, and intersected by
                    numerous rivers and lakes, which afford ample means of inland navigation. Yet,
                    with the exception of a few rocky districts, principally on the coast of the Bay
                    of Fundy, and several not very extensive swampy tracts, the soil of this
                    wilderness is rich and fertile. Its quality here, as elsewhere, may always be
                    determined by the nature of the timber which it produces. Along the countless
                    rivers, there are also innumerable tracts of what is termed here, and in other
                    colonies in this quarter, “intervale land ;” and from its being occasionally
                    overflowed, and thus enjoying the advantage of alluvial deposits, it is also
                    termed alluvial soil. In several parts of the interior, generally along small
                    brooks, there are wild meadows, which owe their origin to the dams constructed
                    by the beaver; which, by arresting portions of the streams, have caused the
                    water to flow over the flat tracts of land. The aspect of New Brunswick is bold
                    and undulating, sometimes swelling into mountains, and again subsiding into
                    vales and low lands. Its geology is but imperfectly known. Limestone, graywacke,
                    clay-slate, and sandstone, occasionally interrupted by gneiss, trap, and
                    granite, seem to prevail on the southern coast, the calcareous rock appearing to
                    predominate. Along the shores which face Chaleur Bay and the Gulf of St
                    Lawrence, gray sandstone and clayslate predominate, with detached rocks of
                    granite, mica, quartz, and ironstone. Specimens of amethyst, carnelian, jasper,
                    and other stones, have been picked up in various places; and marble having fair
                    pretensions to beauty abounds in at least one part of the country. Coal is
                    plentiful in different localities, and iron ore is abundant. The other minerals
                    found are copper, plumbago, and manganese. Salt springs are numerous, and some
                    sulphureous or hepatic springs have lately been discovered.</p>
                <p>“As we procéed from the sea-coast up the rivers of this province,” says Mr M ’
                    Gregor, “the rich fertility of the country claims our admiration. A great flat
                    district may be said to prevail, from the parallel of Long Reach, up the river
                    St John, to the foot of Mars Hill. High hills occasionally rise in ridges in
                    various pjaces, but no part of New Brunswick can be considered as mountainous.
                    The scenery of the rivers, lakes, and cataracts is generally picturesque and
                    beautiful, and often wild and grandly romantic.” The principal rivers are, the
                    St John, the St Croix, the Petit Condiac, the Ristigouche, the Miramichi, and
                    the Nipisighit, besides which there are innumerable inferior streams. The St
                    John, called by the Indians Looshtook, or the Long River, is, next to the St
                    Lawrence, the finest river in British America. From its source near the
                    Chaudière, in Lower Canada, to where it falls into the Bay of Fundy, it has a
                    course of six hundred miles, for about half of which distance it is navigable.
                    It receives innumerable tributaries, and in some parts presents remarkable
                    natural phenomena, which will afterwards be described, along with the other
                    important streams, when we come to treat of the counties in which they are
                    situated. The wild animals in New Brunswick are, bears, mouse-deer, the cariboo
                    fox, loup-cervier, tiger-cat, racoon, porcupine, marten, beaver, otter, mink,
                    musquash, fisher, hare, weasel, and others. Most of the birds and the fishes
                    common to North America are also plentiful here. The climate may be pronounced
                    very salubriqus, and, generally speaking, more healthy than that of England.
                    Consumption and rheumatism are the most prevalent diseases; but agues and
                    intermittent fevers are rare, if not unknown. Sea-fogs frequently envelop the
                    shores of the Bay of Fundy, and render the culture of wheat near the coast
                    uncertain; but they do not appear to occasion any unhealthy tendencies. The
                    temperature of the southern parts is much milder than that of those which border
                    on the Gulf of St Lawrence, the Bay of Chaleur, and Lower Canada. The following
                    is a meteorological return for Frederickton, the capital, situated in latitude
                    45. 57. and longitude 66. 45: Daily average for January, 17; for April, 40; for
                    August, 69∣; for October, 47½; for December, 13½. Mean of the whole, 41f.</p>
                <p>New Brunswick is divided into ten counties, viz. Gloucester, Northumberland,
                    Kent, Westmoreland, St John’s, Charlotte, King’s, Queen’s, Sunbury, and York.
                    The three counties first enumerated were originally comprised in one county,
                    named Northumberland; and their characteristics are nearly the same. They have a
                    sea-board along the Gulf of St Lawrence, the shore of which is low and sandy,
                    covered with trees of a stunted growth, and skirted with extensive marshes,
                    large and deep morasses, and long sand beaches, formed by the conflicting
                    currents of the gulf and the various rivers which penetrate the shore. The coast
                    line of the magnificent Bay of Chaleur has much the same character as the gulf
                    shore. At its mouth, contiguous to New Brunswick, are the islands of Shippi-gan
                    and Miscou. The former is about twenty miles long; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558789" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8789-0148"/>is low and sandy, and
                    produces bent grass, fir and birch trees, shrubs, and a great abundance of
                    cranberries, blueberries, and other wild fruits. The soil is tolerably fertile,
                    and the island is inhabited by Acadian French. Miscou island is about ten miles
                    in circumference; and here the French once had an extensive fishing station, the
                    remains of their buildings still being seen. The great river of the district
                    just described is the Miramichi, which, from its position on the map, appears to
                    be the great drain of the counties of Northumberland and Kent. It falls into the
                    Gulf of St Lawrence in latitude 47. 10. north, and longitude 64. 40. west,
                    forming at its estuary a capacious bay, with several islands, and a ship channel
                    for vessels of seven hundred tons burden, which can navigate for upwards of
                    thirty miles from the sea. The importance attached to Miramichi has arisen
                    within the last twenty-five years, in consequence of the vast quantity of timber
                    exported from it; and this has superseded almost every other pursuit. Upwards of
                    two hundred vessels annually load with timber for Great Britain and other
                    countries. Chatham, the principal seaport town of the district, is situated on
                    the south-eastern bank, about twenty-five miles from the Gulf of St Lawrence;
                    and on the opposite banks are the towns of Douglas and Newcastle. In 1825, this
                    part of the country became the scene of perhaps the most dreadful conflagration
                    recorded in the history of the world. The catastrophe was preceded by a fearful
                    hurricane, which, sweeping through the forest, parched almost to tinder by an
                    unusually hot and long summer, soon wrapped both sides of the river in one
                    tremendous blaze, extending over more than six thousand square miles of country.
                    Several towns, about five hundred human beings, and an inestimable amount of
                    animal life, perished in the flames. Seven miles above Chatham the Miramichi
                    divides into two great branches, and these again are broken into innumerable
                    streams. The sea-coast of this river is low; but inland the country rises in
                    some places, consisting of extensive and rich intervales, and in others, of a
                    rugged, rocky territory. It is as yet but thinly peopled, having scarcely
                    recovered from the desolating effects of the fire in 1825; but the establishment
                    of the New Brunswick Company will no doubt gradually facilitate the settlement
                    of this fine portion of the country.</p>
                <p>Gloucester county, commencing about thirty miles north of the Miramichi,
                    stretches along the shore round the island of Miscou, up the south side of the
                    Bay of Chaleur, and onward to the sources of the Ristigouche. This river is
                    about two hundred and twenty miles long, and forms at its estuary a large and
                    commodious harbour. For upwards of two hundred miles from its embouchure it is
                    above a mile in breadth; and from thence to within forty miles of its source, it
                    is navigable for barges and canoes. The scenery upon this river is exceedingly
                    grand and impressive; much of the territory is rich upland, skirted with large
                    tracts of intervale, and covered with a dense and unviolated growth of mixed
                    wood, in which large groves of pine are very conspicuous. There are several
                    other rivers of considerable size, as the Nipisighit and the Upsalquitch; but
                    the county, notwithstanding its many natural advantages, is but thinly sprinkled
                    with inhabitants, except along the shore from Nipisighit to Ristigouche. St
                    Peter’s or Bathurst, the county town, situated on the eastern side of
                    Nipisighit, is a flourishing little settlement, provided with a commodious
                    haven, where, for several years past, timber of most excellent quality has been
                    shipped. Kent and Westmoreland counties present nothing that requires particular
                    mention. They have both an extensive sea-board, several large rivers, and tracts
                    of excellent soil. Two thirds of Westmoreland has a water frontier; and,
                    forming, as it does, the only land communication between Nova Scotia and New
                    Brunswick, it is a rich and valuable district.</p>
                <p>St John’s county is bounded on the south and south-east by the Bay of Fundy, on
                    the north and north-west by the King’s county, on the east by Westmoreland, and
                    on the west by Charlotte county. The corporate town, or city of St John, is
                    situated on the southern declivity of a peninsula, and on the northern side of
                    the entrance from the Bay of Fundy to the river St John, in latitude 45. 20.
                    north, and longitude 66. 3. west. It is not the metropolis, although the largest
                    town in the province, and the emporium of the greater part of its inland trade.
                    St John’s is a handsome place, but situated on rocky and irregular ground. The
                    government and public buildings, which are numerous and built of stone, if not
                    splendid, are handsome structures. Being an incorporated city, St John’s is
                    governed by a mayor, aldermen, and commonalty, who have an annual revenue at
                    their disposal for the improvement of the city, which has a population of about
                    12,000 inhabitants. There is here a good and thriving bank, places of worship
                    for various persuasions of Christians, some literary institutions and schools,
                    and the society of the place has latterly much improved. The harbour is easy of
                    entrance, capacious, and safe, with a lighthouse on a small island about the
                    centre of the entrance. On the opposite side of the river, and under its
                    municipal government, stands a pretty little town called Carleton. The upper
                    part of St John’s is named Portland, and the whole, including Carleton, is
                    divided into six wards. There are always troops stationed here; and the barracks
                    are spacious, handsome, and commodious. The country in the vicinity is stubborn,
                    but, when subjected to cultivation, it is fertile. An extensive prairie of about
                    3000 acres, and occupying a space which is by some considered as the ancient bed
                    of the river, lies near the town. The soil is remarkably rich and productive.
                    About a mile above the city, the river St John passes through a fissure of solid
                    and overhanging rock, exhibiting every appearance of having been formed by a
                    convulsion of nature. Through this narrow passage of only 1300 feet the immense
                    volume of water collected during a course of many hundred miles is compelled to
                    pass, and occasions what are called the falls of St John, which foam and thunder
                    through with tremendous violence. Navigation is thus rendered impracticable,
                    except for four short diurnal periods. But the tide rises to a great height at
                    St John’s, and when the flood rises twelve feet at the fort, sloops and
                    schooners pass in safety for about twenty minutes, and during the same space of
                    time when the tide ebbs to twelve feet. Above the falls the river widens, and
                    forms a bay of some magnitude, surrounded by high and rugged woodland. Passing
                    up the bay, the country assumes a very grand aspect, high calcareous rocks and
                    vast pine forests stretching up the sides of lofty hills and promontories. Still
                    farther up is Grand Bay, where the same scenery prevails. From this extensive
                    bay Kennebekacis Bay and River trend away to the eastward for nearly forty
                    miles, twenty of which are navigable for large vessels. By another curve of the
                    river a beautiful vista, of eighteen miles in length, called the Long Reach, is
                    formed; and still farther up is Belle Isle Bay, a fine sheet of water, which
                    here branches off for upwards of twenty miles to the westward. The St John then
                    winds to the northward towards Frederickton, receiving the waters of the
                    Washdemoak and Grand Lake from the east, and the Oromucto from the west. No part
                    of America exhibits greater beauty or more luxuriant fertility than the lands
                    upon each side, and the islands here situated. A great proportion of the soil is
                    intervale or alluvial, and coal is found in great plenty, so that it must
                    ultimately become a very rich and populous country. Beyond Frederickton the
                    river St John winds through a fertile and wooded country, and receives several
                    large rivers in its course. One hundred miles distant from Frederickton is Mars
                    Hill, interesting from the circumstance of its being <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194558802" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8802-0149"/>the point fixed on by the
                    British commissioners as the com- ’ mencement of the range of high lands forming
                    the boundary of the United States. The mountain is about three miles in length,
                    with a base of upwards of four miles, and an elevation of 2000 feet above the
                    level of the sea. The prospect from the summit is extensive and grand, embracing
                    an undulating expanse of forest, varying in shade from the funereal green of the
                    fir to the bright verdure of the birch. The next objects of any interest, as we
                    proceed to the source of the St John, are the grand falls, where, for a mile,
                    the river foams and boils through contracting walls of rock and over
                    perpendicular precipices. Farther up there is a straggling colony of Acadian
                    French at Madawaska, some miles above which the St John receives the waters of
                    the Madawaska, which issue from the Lake Tamisquata, a sheet of water about
                    thirty miles in length by two or three miles in width. It is only necessary to
                    state with respect to this rich and fertile part of the country, that it is
                    claimed by the Americans, who do not appear to have the shadow of a right to
                    it.</p>
                <p>York county, which is traversed by the river St John, þ bounded on the north by
                    the river Ristigouche, on the south by Charlotte county, on the east by that of
                    Sunbury, and on the west by the United States. It is of great extent, but thinly
                    settled, and in several parts little known. It is well watered by various rivers
                    and lakes; and although the soil is in some places rocky, there is a large
                    quantity of intervale or alluvial land, which, at the settlement of Madawaska
                    and some other parts, is well cultivated. This county contains Frederickton, the
                    metropolis of New Brunswick. This town is regularly laid out on the right bank
                    of the river St John, which here forms an angle, enclosing the city on two
                    sides; whilst on the land side, in front of it, stretches a chain of hills. The
                    streets are disposed rectangularly, some of them being a mile in length, and for
                    the most part composed of wooden houses. The public buildings consist of the
                    province hall, where the provincial assembly and courts of justice congregate,
                    the court-house, barracks, government-house, library, several churches, and
                    other structures. The trade of Frederickton consists principally in selling
                    British goods to the settlers along the river St John and its streams, and
                    receiving timber and agricultural produce in return. Its situation as a central
                    dépôt for commerce and military purposes is admirable, and it will doubtless
                    increase rapidly with the advancing prosperity of the province. The population
                    may be estimated at about 500.</p>
                <p>The remaining counties of New Brunswick present little requiring special notice.
                    Sunbury county contains some of the most productive tracts in the province, from
                    being annually overflowed by the St John. These parts of the country exhibit a
                    most luxuriant scene during harvest. Sunbury is computed to contain 40,000 acres
                    of pasturage and tillage ground, and upwards of 20,000 of meadow ground.
                    Contiguous to it, but lying on both sides of the river, is Queen’s county, which
                    is extensively fertile, and yields fine timber, in large quantities, for
                    ship-building. The same remarks apply to King’s county, which embraces the whole
                    of Belle Isle Bay, the Long Reach of St John, and the estuary of the
                    Kennebekacis, including Long Island and Kennebekacis. Charlotte county, opposite
                    to St John’s, on the other side of the river, contains the well-laid-out town of
                    St Andrews, which has about 5000 inhabitants. This district abounds with
                    spacious, excellent, and easily accessible harbours. Connected with it are the
                    islands of Campo Bello, Grand Manau, and Deer Island. Campo Bello, about eight
                    miles in length by two in breadth, is in a high state of cultivation. Grand
                    Manau, near the entrance of the Bay of Fundy, is twenty miles in length by about
                    five in average breadth. A great part of it is cultivated; the herring fishery
                    is extensively prosecuted on its shores; and from its situation, commanding the
                    entrance to the Bay of Fundy, it is valuable as a defensive position. Deer
                    Island, lying at the entrance of Passamaquoddy Bay, is studded with numerous
                    islets, some of which are richly wooded. This noble bay has the advantage of
                    being free from ice to a greater extent inland than any other harbour north of
                    New York.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is yet in its infancy, and can scarcely be said to have existed till
                    1825, about which period agricultural and emigrant societies were formed; and
                    since then a desire to bring the soil under culture has been gradually diffusing
                    itself over the province. In the interior all kinds of grain and vegetables
                    arrive at full perfection, and on alluvial lands yield great returns. Heretofore
                    it has been necessary to import grain and flour for home consumption; but this
                    cannot long continue in a country where the necessaries of life may be so
                    readily procured. Of agricultural stock, the number of horses is estimated at
                    12,000, that of horned cattle at 87,000, hogs 65,000, sheep 105,000, whilst the
                    number of acres of land under cultivation is about half a millioij. The staples
                    of the province are timber and fish. The felled trees are cut up into square
                    timber, deals, spars, and staves, for which purpose an immense number of
                    saw-mills are required. In 1833 the number of establishments for sawing deals in
                    New Brunswick was 228, the estimated quantity of lumber sawed at which during
                    the same year amounted to 103,840,000 feet. The amount of shipping employed in
                    the timber trade is necessarily very great; and for this reason the province
                    assumes an importance which it does not seem to possess, considering the number
                    of its inhabitants. In the year 1834 there entered inwards from Great Britain,
                    the colonies, and foreign states, 3102 vessels, of 304,929 tons burden. In the
                    same year there went outwards 2605 vessels, of 316,214 tons burden. A
                    considerable whale fishery has commenced, and several large vessels proceed from
                    New Brunswick to the Pacific and Eastern Oceans for seals, sperm, and black
                    whale oil. In 1833 there were employed in the coasting trade 550 vessels of
                    34,780 tons burden. During the same year there were fishing for bounty
                    thirty-five vessels of 1615 tons burden, and not for bounty twenty-eight
                    vesselsof 1048 tons burden. For the year ending January 1833, the total imports
                    amounted to L.590,488, and the total exports to L.411,572. The trade of this
                    province consists chiefly in exporting square timber, deals, spars, staves, and
                    a few firs, to Great Britain and Ireland, in return for British manufactures;
                    and also in shipping boards, shingles, scantling, and fish to the West Indies,
                    for which rum, sugar, tobacco, and dollars, are brought back. Gypsum and
                    grindstones are shipped on board of American vessels, and flour, meal, bread,
                    and even Indian corn, are received in exchange; a trade which reflects little
                    credit on the industry and enterprise of the New Brunswickers, who possess so
                    much valuable soil capable of producing all kinds of grain.</p>
                <p>The constitution of this province is similar to that of the other North American
                    colonies, except that the lieutenant-governor’s executive council of twelve have
                    also a legislative capacity, which is not the case in the Canadas. The house of
                    assembly consists of twenty-eight members, sent by the different counties. The
                    provincial parliament sits for about two months during the winter at
                    Frederickton. The laws are administered by a supreme court and minor tribunals.
                    The former has a chief justice and three puisne judges. There are also courts of
                    chancery, viceadmiralty, and for granting probates of wills, and for other
                    purposes. The revenue of New Brunswick is chiefly derived from duties levied on
                    the importation of goods at the several ports of the province. The grand total
                    revenue of the province in 1832 was L.68,769. The expenditure was about the half
                    of that sum, the surplus being laid out <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558815"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8815-0150"/>in the construction of roads and bridges, in which
                    the province was greatly deficient, and for the purposes of education. Grammar
                    schools, and those on the Madras system, are established in all the settlements;
                    and a college has been built under the auspices of Sir Howard Douglas, to whom
                    the province is otherwise much indebted. The established church is within the
                    diocese of Nova Scotia, to which persuasion there belong twenty-six churches,
                    each having one clergyman, and the whole being superintended by an archdeacon.
                    The Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Roman Catholics, and others, have also
                    places of worship. There are eight newspapers published; and altogether the
                    social aspect of New Brunswick is as promising as that of any of our North
                    American colonies. The improvement of the province will be greatly accelerated
                    by the New Brunswick Land Company, which was established in London in 1832. This
                    company purchased from the crown 500,000 acres of fertile inland territory, at
                    2s. 6d. per acre, which is in the course of being disposed of by the board of
                    management established in London. The population of New Brunswick in 1824
                    amounted to 74,176; and it may now (1837) be estimated at 90,000. It appears
                    that the legislative assembly has passed a bill for the support of the civil
                    government of the province, in conformity with the terms prescribed by the head
                    of the colonial department in this country; and that the crown has, in
                    consequence, surrendered to the legislature the casual and territorial revenues
                    of the province. The history of this province is comprehended in that of <hi
