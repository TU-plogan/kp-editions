                    significant corrections to the OCR text, predominantly in cases of confusing "c"
                    and "e." Isolates 90 entries that were mistakenly included at the end of prior
                    entries in v1 and v2. Normalizes ordinal numbers. Separates metadata in
                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra
                    space around the <gi>pb</gi> tag. Where a word is hyphenated at a <gi>pb</gi>,
                    the end fragment is now joined to the start fragment, making a machine-readable

                    was born at London on the 1Oth of September, in the year 1713. His parents were
                    descended from ancient and noble families. His father, who had once possessed a
                    considerable patrimony at Hilston,in the county of Monmouth, was of the younger
                    and Catholic branch of the Needham family; whilst the head of the elder and
                    Protestant branch was Lord Kilmory, created viscount in the year 1625. The
                    father of Mr Needham died young, and left but a small fortune to his four
                    children. His eldest son, who is the subject of this article, prosecuted his
                    studies under the secular clergy of the English college at Douay, where he took
                    orders, taught rhetoric for several years, gave eminent proofs of sagacity and
                    genius, and surpassed all the other professors of that seminary in the knowledge
                    of experimental philosophy. In 1740, he was engaged by his superiors in the
                    service of the English mission, and was intrusted with the direction of the
                    school erected at Twyford, near Winchester, for the education of the Roman
                    Catholic youth. In 1744, he was appointed professor of philosophy in the English
                    college at Lisbon, where, on account of his bad health, he remained only fifteen
                    months. After his return, he passed at London and Paris several years, which
                    were principally employed in microscopical observations, and in other branches
                    of experimental philosophy. The results of these observations and experiments
                    were published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London
                    in 1749, and at Paris in 1750 in one volume 12mo; and an account of them was
                    also given by Μ. de Buffon, in the first volumes of his Natural History. An
                    intimate connection existed between the illustrious French naturalist and Mr
                    Needham; they made their experiments and observations together, though the
                    results and systems which they deduced from the same objects and operations were
                    totally different. Mr Needham was admitted as a member of the Royal Society of
                    London in the year 1747, and of the Antiquarian Society some time afterwards.
                    From the year 1751 to 1767 he was chiefly employed in finishing the education of
                    several English and Irish noblemen, by attending them as tutor in their travels
                    through France, Italy, and other countries. He then retired from this wandering
                    life to the English seminary at Paris, and, in 1768, was chosen by the Royal
                    Academy of Sciences in that city a corresponding member.</p>
                <p>When the regency of the Austrian Netherlands, desirous to promote the revival of
                    philosophy and literature in that country, formed the project of an imperial
                    academy, which was preceded by the erection of a small literary society to
                    prepare the way for its execution, Mr Needham was invited to Brussels by the
                    Count de Cobentzel and the president Neny, and was successively appointed chief
                    director of both these foundations. He held this place, together with some
                    ecclesiastical preferments he had obtained in the Low Countries, until his
                    death, which happened on the 30th of December 1781. His piety, temperance, and
                    purity of manners, were eminent; his attachment to the doctrines and duties of
                    Christianity was inviolable. His opposition to modern infidels was
                    indefatigable, and even passionate; but his probity was untainted. He was
                    incapable of every species of duplicity .; his beneficence was universal, and
                    his unsuspecting candour rendered him often the dupe of perfidy.</p>
                <p>The papers of Mr Needham, inserted in the Philosophical Transactions, are
                    contained in vols. xlii. xliv. xlv. and li., and treat, 1. of tubulous
                    concretions; 2. of worms in smutty corn, observed with the microscope; 3. of
                    some electrical experiments made at Paris; 4. of Buffon’s burning mirror; 5. of
                    the generation, composition, and decomposition of animal and vegetable
                    substances; and, 6. of the discovery of asbestos in France. Again, his works
                    printed at Paris in French embrace, 1. New Microscopical Discoveries, 1745; 2.
                    The same enlarged, 1750; 3. Observations on the Generation of Organized Bodies,
                    1769. He had also a considerable share in the well-known controversy respecting
                    the origin of the Chinese, and adopted the opinion of Μ. de Guignes, that that
                    people are descended from the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians. (See the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Hieroglyphics.)</hi> He arrived at this conclusion
                    from comparing the characters upon the breast and forehead of a bust in the
                    museum of Turin, supposed to be of Egyptian origin, with those of a Chinese
                    dictionary in the Vatican, which had been printed at Pekin, and from perceiving
                    a considerable resemblance between the characters on the one and contained in
                    the other. The result of his investigation he published in a pamphlet, entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Inscriptione quadam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aegyptiaca</hi><hi rend="italic">Taurini inventa, et
                    characteribus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Aegyptiis olirn et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sinis communibus exarata,</hi> 1761, in 8vo. Nothing could be fairer or more
                    candid than the manner in which Mr Needham proceeded in comparing the characters
                    on the bust with those in the dictionary; but the theory deduced from this
                    comparison is nevertheless entirely groundless and imaginary. In all forms of
                    hieroglyphical writing, such casual coincidences may easily be detected, because
                    picture-writing is the original basis of each; and hence the existence of such
                    resemblances affords no proof whatever of one nation being descended from, or in
                    any way connected with, another. But there is scarcely any similarity between
                    the Chinese characters and the Egyptian hieroglyphs. The former were originally
                    mere rude delineations of external objects, which, in process of time, came to
                    be variously combined and modified, until they assumed the peculiar forms in
                    which we now find them. The latter, however, were constructed on a far more
                    complex and artificial principle, and of their aggregate number only a small
                    portion can be referred to picture-writing. To seek resemblances, therefore,
                    amongst things so disparate, is rather to indulge the fancy than to prosecute
                    rational inquiry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Needham-Market,</hi> a town of the county of Suffolk, in the
                    parish of Barking, and hundred of Bosmere-cum-Claydon, seventy-four miles from
                    London. It is well built, has a market on Wednesday, and had formerly some
                    manufactures of cloth, which are now abandoned. The population amounted in 1801
                    to 1348, in 1811 to 1301, in 1821 to 1300, and in 1831 to 1466.</p>
