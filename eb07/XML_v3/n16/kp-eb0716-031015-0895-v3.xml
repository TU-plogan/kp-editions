                    following observations and directions were published in the Annual Register
                    (vol. vi. p. 130), as the results of long experience. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560908" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0908-0311"/>child should be laid, the
                    first month, upon a thin mattress, rather longer than itself, which the nurse
                    should keep upon her lap, that the child may always lie straight, and only sit
                    up as the nurse slants the mattress. To set a child quite upright before the end
                    of the first month, would hurt the eyes, by making the white part of the eye
                    appear below the upper eyelid. Afterwards the nurse will begin to set it up and
                    dance it by degrees. The child must be kept as dry as possible.</p>
                <p>The clothing should be very light, and not much longer than the child, that the
                    legs may be got at with ease, in order to have them often rubbed in the day with
                    a warm hand or flannel, and in particular the inside of them.</p>
                <p>Rubbing a child all over takes off scurf, and causes the blood to circulate. The
                    one breast should be rubbed with the hands one way, and the other the other way,
                    night and morning at least.</p>
                <p>The ankle bones and the inside of the knees should be rubbed twice a day; this
                    will strengthen those parts, and make the child stretch its knees and keep them
                    flat, which is the foundation of an erect and graceful person.</p>
                <p>A nurse ought to keep a child as little in her arms as possible, lest the legs
                    should be cramped, and the toes turned inwards. Further, she should always keep
                    the child’s legs loose. The oftener the posture is changed the better. Tossing a
                    child about, and exercising it in the open air in fine weather, is of the
                    greatest service. In cities, children are not to be kept in hot rooms, but to
                    have as much air as possible. Want of exercise is the cause of large heads, weak
                    and knotted joints, a contracted breast, which occasions coughs and stuffed
                    lungs, an ill-shaped person, and waddling gait, besides a numerous train of
                    other ills.</p>
                <p>The child’s flesh is to be kept perfectly clean, by constantly washing its limbs,
                    and likewise its neck and ears, beginning with warm water, till by degrees it
                    will not only bear, but like to be washed with cold water.</p>
                <p>Rising early in the morning is good for all children, provided they awake of
                    themselves, which they generally do; but they are never to be waked out of their
                    sleep, and as soon as possible to be brought to regular sleeps in the day. When
                    laid in bed or in cradle, their legs are always to be laid straight.</p>
                <p>Children, till they are two or three years old, must never be suffered to walk
                    long enough at a time to be weary.</p>
                <p>Girls might easily be trained to the proper management of children, if a premium
                    were given in free schools, workhouses, and other places, to those that brought
                    up the finest child to one year old.</p>
                <p>If the mother cannot suckle the child, get a wholesome cheerful woman with young
                    milk, who has been used to attend young children. After the first six months,
                    small broths, and innocent foods of any kind, may do as well as living wholly
                    upon milk. A principal thing to be always attended to is, to give young children
                    constant exercise, and to keep them in a proper posture.</p>
                <p>With regard to the child’s dress in the day, let it be a shirt, a petticot of
                    fine flannel two or three inches longer than the child’s feet, with a dimity
                    top, commonly called a boddice coat, to tie behind; and over that a surcingle
                    made of fine buckram, two inches broad, covered over with satin or fine ticken,
                    with a ribbon fastened to it to tie it on, which answers every purpose of stays,
                    and has none of their inconveniences. Over this put a robe, or a slip and frock,
                    or whatever you like best, provided it is fastened behind, and not much longer
                    than the child’s feet, that their motions may be strictly observed. Two caps are
                    to be put on the head, till the child has got most of its teeth. The child’s
                    dress for the night may be a shirt, a blanket to tie on, and a thin gown to tie
                    over the blanket.</p>
