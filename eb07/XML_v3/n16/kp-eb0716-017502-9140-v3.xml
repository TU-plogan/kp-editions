                <p><label type="entry">NEWTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Isaac</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished mathematician and natural philosopher, was born at Woolsthorpe, a
                    picturesque hamlet about half a mile to the west of Colster-worth, in
                    Lincolnshire, and some six miles to the south of Grantham. His birth, which was
                    premature, took place on the 25th of December, O. S. 1642. His father, Mr Isaac
                    Newton, was proprietor of Woolsthorpe to the extent of about L.30 per annum, and
                    farmed it with his own hands. His mother was Harriet Ayscough, the daughter of
                    Mr James Ayscough, of Market-Overton, in Rutlandshire. They had been married
                    only a few months when Mr Newton died, leaving his wife in a state of pregnancy.
                    The posthumous child was so small that “they might have put him into a quart
                    mug,” and no expectation was entertained of his continuing to live. “Providence,
                    however,” as his biographer observes, “had otherwise decreed; and that frail
                    tenement, which seemed scarcely able to imprison its immortal mind, was destined
                    to enjoy a vigorous maturity, and to survive even the average term of human
                    existence.” Mrs Newton possessed a small property in Leicestershire, about three
                    miles from Woolsthorpe, which raised her annual income to about L.80.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the marriage of Mrs Newton to the Rev. Mr Smith of North
                    Witham, she left her son Isaac under the charge of her mother. He received his
                    early education at two day schools at Skedington and Stoke; and in his twelfth
                    year he went to the public school at Grantham, taught by Mr Stokes, and was
                    boarded at the house of Mr Clark, an apothecary. Here his attention was less
                    occupied with his studies than with the mechanical amusements, in which he spent
                    all .his ’ leisure hours. Mo <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559153"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9153-0176"/>dels of wind-mills, water-clocks, and self-moving
                    carriages, were executed by him in succession; and he contrived to amuse his
                    schoolfellows with paper kites and paper lanthorns, which he raised to great
                    heights in the air.</p>
                <p>From the play-things of his childhood, Newton made a rapid transition to higher
                    amusements. The daily movements of the sun were traced upon the walls and roofs
                    of the buildings at Woolsthorpe, and by means of pins and lines he indicated the
                    hours and half hours of his rude dials; and though he was now employed in
                    tending the cattle, and going to the market at Grantham, yet he was often found
                    studying mathematics under a hedge, or gleaning fragments of science from old
                    books in Mr Clark’s garret at Grantham. This inattention to the duties of the
                    farm increased with his years, and his mother came to the resolution of giving
                    him an academical education. After the preparation of a few months at Grantham
                    School, he was sent to Cambridge, where he was admitted of Trinity College on
                    the 5th of June 1660, in the eighteenth year of his age. He was admitted a
                    subsizer in 1661, a bachelor of arts in 1665, a junior fellow in 1667, and
                    master of arts in 1668. Young Newton’s attention was first turned to the study
                    of mathematics by a passion for judicial astrology. He considered the
                    propositions in Euclid as self-evident truths; and in the geometry of Descartes,
                    the Miscellanies of Schooten, the <hi rend="italic">Clavis</hi> of Oughtred, and
                    the Arithmetic of Infinites of Wallis, he acquired his first knowledge of the
                    mathematics. Kepler’s Optics and Saunderson’s Logic were amongst the books which
                    he carefully studied, and upon which he wrote comments; and so rapid was his
                    progress in knowledge, that he was considered as being more deeply versed in
                    several branches than his own tutor. In the year 1664 he purchased a prism for
                    the purpose of studying Descartes’ Theory of Colours; but he does not seem to
                    have made any special use of it. In 1666 he purchased another prism; and early
                    in 1668 three additional prisms, which were no doubt those which he used in his
                    experiments. He had in 1666 applied himself to the grinding of “optic glasses of
                    other figures than spherical and finding that there were other causes than the
                    imperfect converging of rays to a focus which rendered refracting telescopes
                    imperfect, he was led to inquire into the cause of the colours produced by
                    lenses and prisms, and to make those splendid discoveries respecting the
                    different refrangibility of the rays of light, the history and nature of which
                    has been given in the article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics.</hi></p>
                <p>Having despaired of improving the refracting telescope, Newton directed his
                    attention to the reflecting one. At this time Gregory’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Optica</hi><hi rend="italic">Promota,</hi> published in 1663, fell into his
                    hands; and, in considering the construction of the Gregorian telescopes there
                    described, “he found the disadvantages of them so great,” “that he altered the
                    design of them, and placed the eye-glass at the side of the tube rather than at
                    the middle.” On this altered principle he executed a reflecting telescope with
                    his own hands in the year 1668. In 1671 he executed a better one, which was
                    shown to the king, and presented to the Royal Society, in whose custody it still
                    remains.</p>
                <p>. Although Newton delivered a course of lectures on optics in Cambridge in 1669,
                    1670, and 1671, containing an account of his discoveries respecting the
                    different refrangibility of the rays of light, yet the Royal Society was not
                    acquainted with them till 1672. On the 23d of December 1671, he was proposed as
                    a member of that body by Dr Seth Ward, bishop of Sarum, and he was elected on
                    the 11.th of January 1672. On the 6th of February he communicated to Mr
                    Oldenburg his discoveries respecting light, which he regarded as “the oddest, if
                    not the most considerable, detection which had hitherto been made in the
                    operations of nature.”</p>
                <p>No sooner was it communicated to the world that <hi rend="italic">white</hi>
                    light consists of seven different colours, having different degrees of
                    refrangibility, than a crowd of obscure individuals assailed, not only his
                    conclusions, but the accuracy of the experiments from which they had been
                    derived. Dr Hooke and Huygens attacked them on different grounds; but Newton, in
                    a letter to Oldenburg, dated the 11th of June 1672, silenced the arguments of
                    his opponents, and established his general doctrine upon an impregnable
                    basis.</p>
                <p>The colours of thin plates, first observed by Boyle, and studied by Hooke, had
                    occupied the special attention of Newton. The results of his inquiries were laid
                    before the Royal Society on the 7th of December 1675, and about twelve years
                    afterwards the theory of fits was completed, and applied to the explanation of
                    the permanent colours of natural bodies. These researches, however, including
                    his experiments on the inflexion of light, which he gives only as an imperfect
                    fragment, were not published till 1704, when his treatise on Optics appeared.
                    For a full account of these discoveries the reader is referred to the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics.</hi></p>
                <p>The first idea of gravity as the cause of the celestial motions occurred to
                    Newton in the year 1666, when sitting alone in the garden of Woolsthorpe.
                    Conjecturing that it might extend as far as the moon, he was led to confirm the
                    conjecture by calculation, and thus to establish the doctrine of universal
                    gravitation, “that every particle of matter is attracted by, or gravitates to,
                    every other particle of matter, with a force inversely proportional to the
                    squares of the distance.” This great discovery, and its application to the
                    movements of the planetary system, as well as to that of the comets, was
                    published in 1686, in his <hi rend="italic">Philosophiae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Naturalis Principia Mathematica,</hi> a work which, to use the words of
                    Newton’s biographer, “is memorable, not only in the annals of one science or one
                    country, but will form an epoch in the history of the world, and will ever be
                    regarded as the brightest page in the records of human reason.” This remarkable
                    production was speedily circulated over Europe; and although the discoveries
                    which it contained were for a while opposed by national as well as personal
                    jealousies, yet the Newtonian philosophy made rapid progress, and finally
                    supplanted the rival systems of Aristotle and Descartes.</p>
                <p>As early as the year 1666, Newton had discovered the binomial theorem and the
                    method of fluxions; and although he had not communicated this discovery to any
                    of his friends, yet he had clearly described the principle, and exhibited the
                    application of his method, in his <hi rend="italic">Analysis per
                    Equationes</hi><hi rend="italic">numero Terminorum infinitas,</hi> a work which
                    he had communicated to Dr Barrow in June 1669, and which was not published till
                    1701, nearly half a century after it was written. Our readers are well aware
                    that the discovery of fluxions was claimed by Leibnitz, and that the controversy
                    which sprung out of this claim is scarcely yet at an end.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A full account of this controversy will be
                    found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Fluxions,</hi> vol. ix. p. G33; and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Leibnitz,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 208.</p></note></p>
                <p>From the year 1669, when Newton was appointed to succeed Dr Barrow as Lucasian
                    professor of mathematics at Cambridge, till 1688, he led a secluded life within
                    the walls of his college; but events now occurred which drew him from
                    retirement, and placed him conspicuously on the stage of public life. James II.,
                    desirous of re-establishing the Catholic faith as the national religion, had
                    begun to assail the privileges of his Protestant subjects. He ordered Father
                    Francis, an ignorant Benedictine monk, to be received at Cambridge as a master
                    of arts, and the oaths of allegiance and supremacy to be dispensed with. The
                    university resisted this illegal mandate, and chose <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559166" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9166-0177"/>nine delegates to defend
                    their independence. Having joined in resisting the wishes of the court, Newton
                    was chosen one of the delegates; and such was their firmness, and the
                    argumentative weight of their representations, that the king was led to abandon
                    his design. Newton’s popularity was extended by the success of the delegates,
                    and he was elected member for the university in 1688, along with Sir Robert
                    Sawyer, having beaten Mr Finch by only five votes. Newton sat in the convention
                    parliament from January 1689 till its dissolution in February 1690.</p>
                <p>In the discharge of his parliamentary duties, he no doubt experienced the
                    unsuitableness of his income to his new position. The limited means of his
                    relations, and his own generous disposition, had exhausted his scanty resources,
                    and he and his friends naturally looked to some patronage on the part of the
                    government which might enable him to pursue his scientific researches,
                    unembarrassed by those physical wants which have ever been the scourge of
                    genius, and especially of that variety of it which is called forth by patient
                    and continuous inquiry. There is ample evidence that unsuccessful applications
                    had been made for this purpose, and the vexation and disappointment which this
                    ingratitude produced, combined with other causes, seem to have thrown Newton
                    into a state of nervous irritability, which threatened to paralyze even his
                    mighty intellect. It is difficult to trace with distinctness the succession of
                    causes which at this time contributed to disturb his serenity; but it appears
                    that, about the end of 1692, or early in 1693, his chemical laboratory had been
                    burned, and a number of manuscripts destroyed; and on another occasion, several
                    valuable manuscripts were consumed by a candle which he had left burning whilst
                    he went to chapel. These losses seem to have affected him deeply, and “he was so
                    troubled thereat, that every one thought he would have run mad, and he was not
                    himself for months after.” Another account of these events, communicated by one
                    Colin or Collins to Huygens,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The following extract from the manuscript of Huygens was
                    first published in Biot’s Life of Newton. “On the 29th of May 1094, Μ. Colin <hi

                    informed me that, eighteen months ago, the illustrious geometer Isaac Newton had
                    become insane, either in consequence of his too intense application to his
                    studies, or from excessive grief at having lost by fire his chemical laboratory,
                    and several manuscripts. When he came to the Archbishop of Cambridge, he made
                    some observations which indicated an alienation of mind. He was immediately
                    taken care of by his friends, who confined him to his home, and applied
                    remedies, by means of which he had now so far recovered his health that he began
                    to understand the <hi rend="italic">Principia."</hi></p><p>The following extract
                    from a manuscript journal kept by Mr Abraham de la Pryme, an ancestor of
                    Professor Pryme, when a student at Cambridge, throws much light on this part of
                    Newton’s life. “1692, Feb. 3. What I heard to-day I must relate. There is one Mr
                    Newton (whom I have very often seen), fellow of Trinity College, that is
                    mightily famous for his learning, being a most excellent mathematician,
                    philosopher, divine, &amp;c. He has been fellow of the Royal Society these many
                    years; and, amongst many other very learned books and tracts, he has written one
                    upon the mathematical principles of philosophy, which has got him a mighty name,
                    he having received, especially from Scotland, abundance of congratulatory
                    letters for the same. But of all the books which he ever wrote, there was one of
                    <hi rend="italic">Colours and Light,</hi> established upon thousands of
                    experiments, which he had been twenty years of making, and which had cost him
                    many hundreds of pounds. This book, which he valued so much, and which was so
                    much talked of, had the ill luck to perish and be utterly lost, just when the
                    learned author was almost at putting a conclusion to the same, after this
                    manner. In a winter’s morning leaving it among his other papers on his study
                    table, whilst he went to chapel, the candle, which he unfortunately left burning
                    there too, catched hold by some means of other papers, and they fired the
                    aforesaid book and utterly consumed it, and several other valuable writings;
                    and, which is most wonderful, did no further mischief. But when Mr Newton came
                    from chapel, and had seen what was done, every one thought he would have run
                    mad; he was so troubled thereat, that he was not himself for a month after.”
                    (Brewster’s Life of Newton, p. 228.)</p></note> represents Newton as having
                    actually become insane, and unable to understand his own writings; and, relying
                    upon the accuracy <hi rend="italic">of</hi> this statement, Μ. Biot and other
                    French philosophers considered his insanity as the reason why Newton had ceased
                    to make scientific discoveries. They even went so far as to ascribe his study of
                    theology to this enfeebled state of mind, and thus to deprive our faith of that
                    support which it derived from having been illustrated and defended by so great
                    an expositor and champion.</p>
                <p>That the mind of Newton was sound and active during the period when it is said to
                    have been seriously disturbed, may be proved by many undoubted facts. In this
                    interval he composed his four celebrated letters to Dr Bentley on the existence
                    of a Deity; letters which evince a power of thought, and a serenity of mind,
                    incompatible even with the slightest obscuration of his faculties. The first of
                    these letters was written on the 10th of December 1692, the second on the 17 th
                    of January 1692-3, the third on the 25th of February, and the fourth on the 11th
                    of February 1693-4. In 1692 we find him also engaged in mathematical researches
                    on the quadrature of curves, and in observations on halos; and in November and
                    December 1693 he was occupied in discussing mathematical questions with his
                    correspondents. On the 1st of September 1694 Newton visited Flamsteed at
                    Greenwich, and he was at that time occupied with the difficult and profound
                    subject of the lunar theory.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>That Newton’s health was affected from the middle of 1692 to the middle of 1693,
                    is quite certain; and that his nervous system .was shaken by loss of sleep and
                    appetite, is mentioned by himself. Exaggerated rumours had reached his friends
                    in London, and Mr Pepys was led to inquire of his friends at Cambridge if these
                    rumours of a discomposure of his mind had any foundation. Mr J. Millington, who,
                    we believe, was tutor of Magdalene College, returned the following answer :— <hi
                    rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">I was,</hi> I must confess, very much
                    surprised at the inquiry you were pleased to make by your nephew about the
                    message that Mr Newton made the ground of his letter to you, for I.was very sure
                    I never either received from you or delivered to him any such; and therefore I
                    went immediately to wait upon him, with a design to discourse with him about the
                    matter; but he was out of town, and since I have not seen him, till, upon the
                    28th, I met him at Huntingdon, where, upon his own accord, and before I had time
                    to ask him any question, he told me that he had writt to you a very odd letter,
                    at which he was much concerned; added, that it was in a distemper that much
                    seized his head, and that kept him awake for about five nights together, which
                    upon occasion he desired I would represent to you, and beg your pardon, he being
                    very much ashamed he should be so rude to a person for whom he hath so great an
                    honour. He is now very well, and though I fear he is under some small degree of
                    melancholy, yet I think there is no reason to suspect it hath at all touched his
                    understanding, and I hope never will; and so I am sure all ought to wish that
                    love learning, or the honour of our nation, <hi rend="italic">which it is a sign
                    hoW7nuchit is looked after,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">when such a person as Mr
                    Newton lyes neglected</hi> BY THOSE IN POWER.”</p>
                <p>In the beginning of the year 1692, Charles Montague, Lord Monmouth, and Mr Locke,
                    were exerting themselves to obtain some appointment for Newton. In his letters
                    to Locke, Newton himself refers, with a considerable degree of feeling, to these
                    exertions. He conceived that Charles Montague, .under the influence of some old
                    grudge, had been false to him, and that there had been a design to sell <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194559179" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9179-0178"/> him an office;
                    and it is to the failure of these attempts that Mr Millington alludes with such
                    just severity in the letter which we have quoted.</p>
                <p>Newton was now in the fifty-third year of his age; and whilst those of his own
                    standing at the university had been appointed to high stations in the church, or
                    to lucrative offices in the state, he still remained without any mark of
                    national gratitude. His fellow-labourers in science in every part of Europe were
                    enjoying the favour and protection of their respective sovereigns, who had even
                    invited foreign philosophers to their capitals to enjoy the liberality which
                    they had extended to their own. Foreigners viewed with astonishment the
                    treatment of Newton by his own sovereign, and the French king had the nobleness
                    of mind to offer him, through Cassini, a liberal pension.</p>
                <p>But this blot upon the English name was at last removed by Charles Montague,
                    when, in the year 1694, he was appointed chancellor of the exchequer. He had
                    previously consulted Mr Newton upon the subject of the recoinage; and when Mr
                    Overton, the warden of the mint, was made a commissioner of customs, he served
                    both his friend and his country by appointing Newton to that important office.
                    “I am very glad,” says he, “that <hi rend="italic">at last</hi> I can give you a
                    good proof of my friendship, and the esteem the king has of your merits. Mr
                    Overton, the warden of the mint, is made one of the commissioners of the
                    customs, and the king has promised me to make Mr Newton warden of the mint. The
                    office is the most proper for you. ’ Tis the chief office in the mint; ’ tis
                    worth five or six hundred pounds per annum, and has not too much business to
                    require more attendance than you can spare.”</p>
                <p>The chemical and mathematical knowledge of Newton proved of great use in carrying
                    on the recoinage, which was completed in about two years; and such was the zeal
                    and devotion with which Newton discharged the laborious duties of this office,
                    that he was appointed, in 1697, to the mastership of the mint, which was worth
                    between twelve and fifteen hundred pounds per annum. In this situation he drew
                    up a table of assays of foreign coins, and composed an official report on the
                    coinage. Having retained his professorship at Cambridge whilst he was warden, he
                    now appointed Mr whiston as his deputy, with all the emoluments of the
                    chair.</p>
                <p>In the same year Newton was elected a foreign associate of the Royal Academy of
                    Sciences at Paris. In 1701 he was elected one of the members of parliament for
                    the University of Cambridge. In 1703 he was raised to the presidency of the
                    Royal Society of London, to which he was annually re-elected during the
                    remaining twenty-five years of his life.</p>
                <p>When Queen Anne and the court visited Cambridge on the 16th of April 1705, she
                    conferred the honour of knighthood on Mr Newton.</p>
                <p>On the dissolution of parliament in 1705, Sir Isaac was again a candidate for the
                    representation of the university; but he was beaten by a great majority. He was
                    supported by all the resident members; but being a whig in politics, and the cry
                    of the church in danger having been raised on that occasion, he became the
                    victim of the ignorance and fanaticism of the non-resident constituency.</p>
                <p>The first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> having been sold off,
                    Dr Bentley and his other friends had, for a considerable time, been urging Sir
                    Isaac to prepare a new edition. The duties of the mint would not permit him to
                    devote much time to such a task; but he willingly complied with the request of
                    his friends, when Mr Roger Cotes, Plumian professor of astronomy at Cambridge,
                    undertook to superintend its publication. Newton promised to send his own
                    revised copy to Mr Cotes in July 1709; but delays took place, and the work was
                    not completed till the spring of 1713. Nearly three hundred letters passed
                    between Sir Isaac and Cotes, in which the various alterations and additions are
                    discussed; and this correspondence, at least the letters of Newton to Cotes, has
                    been carefully preserved in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge.</p>
                <p>When George I. succeeded to the throne of Great Britain, Sir Isaac became an
                    object of interest at court. The Princess of Wales, afterwards queen-consort to
                    George II. took great pleasure in conversing with him, and in corresponding with
                    Leibnitz. Having one day mentioned to her royal highness a new system of
                    chronology which he had composed whilst resident at Cambridge, she requested Sir
                    Isaac, through the Abbé Conti, to give her a copy of it. He accordingly drew up
                    an abstract of it from the loose papers to which it had been committed, and sent
                    it to the princess for her private use alone. He afterwards allowed a copy to be
                    given to the Abbé Conti, on the condition of its not being communicated to any
                    person whatever. The abbé, however, forgetting his obligation, communicated it
                    to Μ. Fréret, a learned antiquary in Paris, who translated it, and endeavoured
                    to refute it. It was printed early in 1725, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abrégé</hi><hi rend="italic">de Chronologic de M. lc Chevalier Newton, fait par
                    lui-meme,</hi><hi rend="italic">et traduit sur le Manuscrit Anglais.</hi> Upon
                    receiving a copy of this work, Sir Isaac Newton printed, in the Philosophical
                    Transactions for 1725, a paper, entitled Remarks on the Observations made on a
                    Chronological Index of Sir Isaac Newton, translated into French by the
                    observator, and published at Paris. In these remarks Sir Isaac charges the abbé
                    with a breach of promise, and gave a triumphant answer to the objections which
                    Fréret had urged against his system. Father Souciet entered the field in defence
                    of Fréret; and, in consequence of this controversy, Sir Isaac was induced to
                    prepare his larger work, which was published in 1728, after his death, and
                    entitled the Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms amended; to which is prefixed, a
                    short Chronicle from the First Memory of Kings in Europe to the conquest of
                    Persia by Alexander the Great.</p>
                <p>There is no part of Sir Isaac Newton’s biography more remarkable than that which
                    relates to his theological studies. From a very early period of his life Newton
                    had seriously embarked in the study of theology. Previously to 1692 he was known
                    by the appellation of an excellent divine, and it is well known that he had
                    begun to study the subject of the prophecies before 1690; whereas, in order to
                    show that his theological writings were the productions of his dotage, and
                    subject to his supposed mental alienation, Μ. Biot has fixed their date between
                    1712 and 1719, between the seventieth and the seventy-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable of Sir Isaac’s theological productions is his
                    Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of the Scripture, in a letter to a
                    friend. This friend was Mr Locke, who received the letter in November 1690. Sir
                    Isaac seems to have been then anxious for its publication; but as the effect of
                    his argument was to deprive the Trinitarians of two passages in favour of the
                    Trinity, he became alarmed at the probable consequences of such a step. He
                    therefore requested Locke, who was then going to Holland, to get it translated
                    into French, and published on the Continent. Being prevented from going to
                    Holland, Locke copied the manuscript, and sent it, without Newton’s name, to Μ.
                    le Clerc, who received it before the 11th of April 1691. On the 20 th of January
                    1692, Le Clerc announced to Locke his intention to publish the pamphlet in
                    Latin; and upon intimating this to Sir Isaac, he entreated him “to stop the
                    translation and impression as soon as he could, for he designed to suppress
                    them.” This was accordingly done; but Le Clerc sent the manuscript to the
                    library of the Remonstrants, and it was afterwards <pb break="no"

                    under the title of Two Letters from Sir Isaac Newton to Μ. le Clerc. This
                    edition is imperfect, and in many places erroneous; and Dr Horsley has published
                    a genuine one, which is in the form of a single letter to a friend, and was
                    taken from a manuscript in Sir Isaac’s own hand, in the possession of the
                    Reverend Dr Ekins, dean of Carlisle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Sir Isaac Newton left behind him in manuscript a work entitled Observations on
                    the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St John, which was published in
                    London in 1733, in one volume 4to; another work entitled <hi rend="italic"

                    sacred cubit of the Jews, which were printed in 1737; and Four Letters addressed
                    to Dr Bentley, containing some arguments in proof of a Deity, which were
                    published by Mr Cumberland, the nephew of Dr Bentley, in 1756.<note

                    composed some other theological manuscripts which have not been published.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton devoted much of his time to the study of chemistry; but the
                    greater number of his experiments still remain in manuscript. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Tabula</hi><hi rend="italic">Quantitatum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Graduum Caloris</hi> contains a comparative scale of
                    temperature from that of melting ice to that of a small kitchen coal fire. He
                    wrote also another chemical paper, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Natura Acidorum,</hi> which has been published by Dr Horsley. Sir Isaac spent
                    much time in the study of the writings of the alchemists; and the Rev. Mr Law
                    informs us, that he had diligently studied the writings of Jacob Behmen, and
                    that there were found amongst Sir Isaac’s manuscripts copious abstracts from
                    them in his own handwriting. He states also, that in the earlier part of his
                    life he and his relation Dr Newton of Grantham had put up furnaces and had
                    wrought for several months in quest of the philosopher’s tincture. These views
                    are rendered more probable by the fact, that in the list of Newton’s manuscripts
                    published by Dr Hutton, and in the possession of the Earl of Portsmouth, there
                    are many sheets in Sir Isaac’s hand, of Flamsteed’s Explication of Hieroglyphic
                    Figures, and in another hand many sheets of William Yworth’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Amongst the inventions of Sir Isaac Newton we must enumerate his reflecting
                    telescope, his reflecting microscope, a sextant similar to Hadley’s, and his
                    prismatic reflector, with plane and convex surfaces. We owe also to him some
                    very interesting views on the decussation of the optic nerves, which were first
                    published in Harris’s Optics; a hypothesis respecting ether as the cause of
                    light and gravity; and some experiments upon the excitation of electricity on
                    glass.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The sale of the second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> having
                    been rapid, a third edition was called for in 1722. Roger Cotes had died in the
                    prime of life, and therefore Newton engaged Dr Pemberton to superintend the new
                    edition, which was published in 1726, with numerous alterations.</p>
                <p>During the last twenty years of Sir Isaac’s life, his beautiful and accomplished
                    niece, Miss Catherine Barton, had managed his domestic concerns. She was the
                    daughter of Mr Robert Barton of Brigstock, and of Hannah Smith, Newton’s half
                    sister. She had been a great favourite of Charles Montague, earl of Halifax,
                    who, at his death in 1715, bequeathed to her a very large portion of his
                    fortune. This lady, who had been educated at Sir Isaac’s expense, married Mr
                    Conduit, and continued to reside with her husband in Sir Isaac’s house until the
                    time of his death.</p>
                <p>In the year 1722, when he was eighty years old, he had been seized with an
                    incontinence of urine, which was ascribed to stone. By great attention to diet
                    and regimen he succeeded in keeping down this dreadful malady; but in 1724 he
                    passed a small stone, and for some months enjoyed a tolerable degree of health.
                    In January 1725 he was seized with a violent cough and inflammation of the
                    lungs, which induced him to reside at Kensington; and in the February of the
                    same year he had a fit of gout both in his feet and hands, which produced a
                    decided improvement in his general health. His duties at the Mint were
                    discharged by Mr Conduit, and he therefore seldom went to London. Feeling
                    himself well, he went to London on the 28th of February 1728, to preside at a
                    meeting of the Royal Society; but the fatigue which attended this duty brought
                    on a violent return of his former complaint, and he returned to Kensington on
                    the 4th of March, when Dr Mead and Dr Chesselden pronounced his disease to be
                    stone. He endured the sufferings of this complaint with wonderful patience and
                    meekness. He seemed a little better on the 15th of March, and on the 18th he
                    read the newspapers and conversed with Dr Mead; but at six o’clock in the
                    evening he became insensible, and continued in that state till Monday the 20th
                    of March, when he expired between one and two o’clock in the morning, in the
                    eighty-fifth year of his age. His body was removed to London, and on Tuesday the
                    28th of March it lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and was thence conveyed
                    to Westminster Abbey, where it was buried near the entrance into the choir, on
                    the left hand. The pall was supported by the Lord Chancellor, the Dukes of
                    Roxburghe and Montrose, and the Earls of Pembroke, Sussex, and Macclesfield, who
                    were fellows of the Royal Society. The Bishop of Rochester performed the funeral
                    service. The relations who inherited his personal estate devoted L.500 to the
                    erection of a monument to his memory. It was finished in 1731, and was erected
                    in the centre of the abbey. The following is the epitaph inscribed upon it:</p>

                    expense of Dr Robert Smith, the author of the Complete System of Optics. The
                    pedestal bears the inscription</p>
                <p>Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit; an assertion which may be justly doubted,
                    even by those who are the greatest admirers of Newton’s genius.</p>

                <p>1he personal estate of Sir Isaac Newton amounted to about L.32,000. It was
                    divided amongst his four nephews and foui nieces of the half blood, the
                    grandchildren of his mother by the Rev. Mr Smith. The family estates of
                    Woolsthorpe and Sustern were bequeathed to John Newton, whose great-grandfather
                    was Sir Isaac’s uncle, by whom they were sold in 1732 to Mr Edmund Turnor of
                    Stoke Rocheford. Sir Isaac bequeathed his estate at Kensington to Catherine, the
                    only daughter of Mr Conduit, who afterwards married Mr Wallop, the eldest son of
                    Lord Lymington, and subsequently Earl of Portsmouth. Sir Isaac was succeeded as
                    warden and master of the mint by his nephew, Mr Conduit, who died in 1737.</p>
                <p>In his social character Sir Isaac Newton was modest, and candid, and affable,
                    accommodating himself to every class of society in which he moved. His humility
                    was that of a philosopher who had experienced both the strength and the weakness
                    of the human mind, and of a Christian who was deeply impressed with the
                    unsatisfying nature of all earthly greatness. “I do not know,” said he, a short
                    time before his death, “what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to
                    have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now
                    and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the
                    great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.” His religious and moral
                    character were equally admirable. He was deeply versed in the knowledge of the
                    Scriptures, and was not equalled in point of theological learning by any of the
                    divines of his age. He was a great friend of religious toleration, and never
                    scrupled to express his abhorrence of even the mildest species of religious
                    persecution.</p>
                <p>Sir Isaac Newton was remarkable for his liberality upon all occasions. His
                    charity was boundless, and he was in the habit of remarking, that those who gave
                    away nothing till they died never gave at all. He wrote to the Provost of
                    Edinburgh in 1724, offering L.20 annually to Mr Maclaurin, provided he became
                    assistant to Mr James Gregory, professor of mathematics in the university. In
                    1719 he gave fifty guineas to the Rev. Mr Pound, who made some astronomical
                    observations for his use; and in 1720 he gave him the like sum. He likewise
                    bestowed large donations on the Ayscoughs, his relations.</p>
                <p>In his personal appearance Sir Isaac was not above the middle size. He had “a
                    comely and gracious aspect, and a very lively and piercing eye.” He was
                    short-sighted, but never wore spectacles, nor lost more than one tooth in his
                    life. Bishop Atterbury asserts, in opposition to this, that the lively and
                    piercing eye did not belong to Sir Isaac during the last twenty years of his
                    life. “Indeed,” says he, “in the whole air of his face and make there was
                    nothing of that penetrating sagacity which appears in his compositions. He had
                    something rather languid in his look and manner, which did not raise any good
                    expectation in those who did not know him.”</p>
                <p>The manor-house of Woolsthorpe, as well as every other memorial of Sir Isaac, has
                    been preserved with religious care. Mr Tumor of Stoke Rocheford, the proprietor,
                    put up, in 1798, a white marble tablet in the room where Sir Isaac was born,
                    recording his birth and death, and bearing the celebrated lines of Pope:</p>
                <p>Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in Night;</p>
                <p>God said, “Let Newton be,” and all was Light.</p>
                <p>The house still contains on its walls the two dials made by Newton himself, but
                    without the styles. His second telescope is preserved in the library of the
                    Royal Society; and his globe, universal ring dial, quadrant, compass, and a
                    reflecting telescope said to have belonged to him, in the library of Trinity
                    College, Cambridge.</p>
                <p>The manuscripts, correspondence, and other papers of Sir Isaac Newton, have been
                    preserved in different collections. But the most important collection is the
                    family one in the possession of the Earl of Portsmouth. They are deposited at
                    Hursbourne Park, his lordship’s seat in Hampshire, and have been very recently
                    (in 1837) examined by H. A. Fellowes, Esq. the accomplished nephew of Lord
                    Portsmouth, and by Sir David Brewster, who has been permitted to make use of
                    them in composing Memoirs of the Life, Writings, and Discoveries of Sir Isaac
                    Newton. In this examination much new and valuable information has been
                    discovered relative to the early life of Sir Isaac, which had been collected by
                    his nephew-in-law Mr Conduit, for the purpose of writing a life of him, which he
                    was prevented from executing by his death in the year 1737. Many letters and
                    papers of Newton are in the possession of the Earl of Macclesfield at Shirburn.
                    They were found amongst the papers of William Jones, the friend of Sir Isaac,
                    and the father of Sir William Jones. These papers have recently been put into
                    the hands of Professor Rigaud of Oxford, who is now preparing them for
                    publication.</p>
                <p>About thirty-four of Newton’s letters to Flamsteed are deposited in the library
                    of Corpus Christi College, Oxford; but a large portion of the correspondence
                    between Newton and Halley has recently been found by Mr Baily in the possession
                    of Mr Giles, a private gentleman in London, and in the Royal Observatory at
                    Greenwich, along with various important documents intimately connected with the
                    scientific history of that period. As the papers found in the observatory had
                    been purchased by the Board of Longitude in 1771, the lords commissioners of the
                    admiralty, on the recommendation of the board of visitors of the Royal
                    Observatory, agreed to print thpm. They have been accordingly printed in a large
                    quarto volume, under the superintendence of Mr Baily.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This volume was not published; the whole
                    impression, which was small, being distributed in presents to scientific
                    institutions, public libraries, and individuals interested in the subjects to
                    which it relates.</p></note></p>
                <p>Doubts have been entertained by some, and openly expressed by others, relative to
                    the propriety of publishing all the papers contained in this collection. Several
                    of the letters of Flamsteed, and various parts of his autobiographical memoir,
                    contain bitter and malignant attacks upon the character and conduct of Sir Isaac
                    Newton, which, if they had been published during his life, or not long after it,
                    might have been refuted on the authority of documentary and other evidence which
                    cannot now be obtained. Fortunately for the memory of Sir Isaac Newton, his
                    generous and noble character, his meek and gentle disposition, and his Christian
                    forbearance and patience, form a secure shield against the reckless and wanton
                    charges of his irritable and violent assailant. If reflections have been cast on
                    the character of Newton by the animadversions of Flamsteed, the conduct of the
                    latter has been exposed to a scrutiny which it may not be able to sustain; and
                    the friends of Newton are reluctantly compelled to collect the opinions which
                    contemporary writers had expressed of Flamsteed, in order to enable the public
                    to form a just estimate of the testimony which he has borne against his
                    fellow-labourer in science.</p>
                <p>Those who wish to know more of the differences between Newton and Flamsteed, may
                    consult the volume above mentioned, which is entitled An Account of the Rev.
                    John Flamsteed, the first Astronomer Royal, compiled from his own manuscripts,
                    and other authentic documents never before published; to which is added, his
                    British Catalogue of Stars, corrected and enlarged, printed by order of the

                    expense, published, in January 1837, a supplement to this work, which, with his
                    usual liberality, he “distributed amongst those persons and institutions only to
                    whom the original work was presented.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(n.</hi> N.N.)</p>

                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">Newtonian philosophy</hi> is applied very differently.
                    Some authors under this denomination include all the corpuscular philosophy,
                    considered as it now stands corrected and reformed by the discoveries and
                    improvements made in several parts of it by Sir Isaac Newton. In this sense it
                    is that ’ sGravesande calls his elements of physics <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introductio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophiam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Newtonianαm</hi>; and in this sense the Newtonian is the same with
                    the new philosophy, standing contradistinguished from the Cartesian, the
                    Peripatetic, and the ancient corpuscular system. By Newtonian philosophy others
                    mean the method or order which Sir Isaac Newton observes in philosophizing, viz.
                    the reasoning and drawing of conclusions directly from phenomena, exclusive of
                    all previous hypotheses; the beginning from simple principles, deducing the
                    first powers and laws of nature from a few select phenomena, and then applying
                    those laws, &amp;c. to account for other things. And in this sense the Newtonian
                    philosophy is the same with the <hi rend="italic">experimental</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">inductive philosophy,</hi> and stands opposed to the ancient
                    corpuscular system. By this philosophy some understand that particular kind in
                    which physical bodies are considered mathematically, and where geometry and
                    mechanics are applied to the solution of the appearances of nature. In this
                    sense the Newtonian is the same with the <hi rend="italic">mechanical</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">mathematical philosophy.</hi> Others, again, by Newtonian
                    philosophy, understand that part of physical knowledge which Sir Isaac Newton
                    has handled, improved, and demonstrated, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia.</hi> Lastly, by it is meant the new principles which Sir Isaac
                    Newton has brought into philosophy, the new system founded thereon, and the new
                    solutions of phenomena thence deduced, or that which characterizes and
                    distinguishes his philosophy from all others; and this is the sense in which it
                    ought to be used.</p>
                <p>As to the history of this philosophy, we have nothing to add to what has been
                    stated in the preceding and in other articles. It was first made public in the
                    year 1687, by the author, then a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge; and in
                    the years 1713 and 1726 republished with considerable improvements. See the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Newton,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> lord bishop of
                    Bristol, and dean of St Paul’s, London, was born on the 1st of January 1704. His
                    father, John Newton, was a considerable brandy and cider merchant, who having,
                    by his industry and integrity, acquired what he thought a competent fortune,
                    left off* trade several years before he died. Young Newton received the first
                    part of his education in the free school of Lichfield, which, the bishop
                    observes with some kind of exultation, had at all times sent forth several
                    persons of note or eminence, from Bishop Smaldridge and Mr Wollaston, to Dr
                    Johnson and Mr Garrick. From Lichfield he was, in 1717, removed to Westminster
                    School, and placed under the care of Dr Freind and Dr Nicol. During the time he
                    remained at Westminster, there were, he observes, more young men who afterwards
                    made a distinguished figure in the world, than perhaps at any other period,
                    either before or since. He particularly mentions Murray, afterwards Earl of
                    Mansfield, with whom he lived upon terms of the greatest friendship to the close
                    of his life. Having passed six years at Westminster School, he went to
                    Cambridge, and entered at Trinity College, where he constantly resided eight
                    months at least in every year, till he took his degrees in arts. Being chosen
                    fellow of his college, he went afterwards to settle in London. As it had been
                    his inclination from childhood, and as he was likewise designed for holy orders,
                    he had sufficient time to prepare himself, and composed some sermons, that he
                    might have a stock in hand when he entered on the ministry. His title for
                    clerical orders was his fellowship; and he was ordained deacon in December 1729,
                    and priest in the February following, by Bishop Gibson. Upon his first setting
                    out in this office, he was curate at St George’s, Hanover Square, and continued
                    for several years assistant preacher to Dr Trebeck. His first preferment was
                    that of reader and afternoon preacher, at Grosvenor Chapel, in South Audley
                    Street; an appointment which introduced him to the family of Lord Tyrconnel, to
                    whose son he became tutor. He continued in this situation for many years, living
                    much at his ease, and on terms of great intimacy and friendship with Lord and
                    Lady Tyrconnel, ‘(without so much,” he tells us, “as an unkind word or a cool
                    look intervening.” In the spring of 1744, he was, through the interest of the
                    Earl of Bath, his great friend and patron, presented to the rectory of St Mary
                    le Bow; so that he was forty years of age before he obtained any living. At the
                    commencement of the year 1745 he took his doctor’s degree. In the spring of 1747
                    he was chosen lecturer of St George’s, Hanover Square, by a most respectable
                    vestry of noblemen and gentlemen of high distinction. In August following he
                    married his first wife, the eldest daughter of Dr Trebeck, an unaffected,
                    modest, decent young woman, with whom he lived happily for nearly seven years.
                    In 1749 he published his edition of Milton’s Paradise Lost, which was well
                    received by the public, and by 1775 had gone through eight editions. After the
                    Paradise Lost, it was judged proper that Dr Newton should likewise publish the
                    Paradise Regained, and other poems of Milton; but these things he thought
                    detained him from other more material studies, though he had the good fortune to
                    gain more by them than Milton did by all his works put together. But his
                    greatest gain consisted in their first introducing him to the friendship and
                    intimacy of two such men as Bishop Warburton and Dr Jortin. In 1754 he lost his
                    father, at the age of eighty-three; and within a few days his wife, at the age
                    of thirty-eight. This was the most severe trial he ever experienced, and it
                    almost overwhelmed him. At that time he was engaged in writing his Dissertations
                    on the Prophecies; and in his affliction he found no better nor more effectual
                    remedy than plunging deeply into study, and fixing his thoughts as intensely as
                    he possibly could upon other subjects. The first volume was published the
                    following winter, but the other did not appear till three years afterwards; and
                    as a reward for his past and an incitement to future labours, he was in the mean
                    time appointed to preach Boyle’s lecture. The bishop himself informs us, that
                    twelve hundred and fifty copies of the Dissertations were taken off' at the
                    first impression, and a thousand at every other edition; and “though,” he adds,
                    “some things have been since published upon the same subjects, yet they still
                    hold up their head above water, and having gone through five editions, are again
                    prepared for another. Abroad, too, their reception has not been unfavourable, if
                    accounts from thence may be depended upon.” They were translated into the German
                    and Danish languages, and received the warmest encomiums from persons <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> learning and rank. In the spring of 1757, he was made
                    prebendary of Westminster, in the room of Dr Green, and promoted to the deanery
                    of Salisbury. In October following, he was made sub-almoner to his majesty, an
                    appointment which he owed to Bishop Gilbert. In September 1761, he married a
                    second wife, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559231"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9231-0182"/>widow of the Rev. Mr Hand, and daughter of
                    Viscount Lisburn; and in the same month he kissed his majesty’s hand for his
                    bishopric. On the death of Dr Stone, the primate of Ireland, in the winter of
                    1764, Mr Grenville sent for Bishop Newton, and in the most obliging manner
                    desired his acceptance of the primacy; but having maturely weighed the matter in
                    his own mind, he declined the offer. In 1768 he was made dean of St Paul’s. His
                    ambition was now fully satisfied, and he firmly resolved never to ask for any
                    thing more. From this time till his death his health was almost constantly
                    infirm; indeed it is wonderful that such a poor, weak, and slender thread as the
                    bishop’s life, should have been spun out to such an amazing length as it really
                    was. In the autumn of 1781, he laboured under repeated illnesses; and on
                    Saturday the 9th of February 1782, his breathing began to be much affected by
                    the frost. His complaints grew worse till the following Thursday, when he got up
                    at five o’clock, and was placed in a chair by the fire, having suffered much in
                    bed. About six o’clock he was left by his apothecary in a quiet sleep; between
                    seven and eight he awoke, and appeared rather more easy, and took a little
                    refreshment. He continued dozing till near nine, when he ordered his servant to
                    come and dress him, and help him down stairs. As soon as he was dressed, he
                    inquired the hour, and bade his servant open the shutter and look at the dial of
                    St Paul’s. The servant answered that the clock was about to strike nine. The
                    bishop made an effort to take out his watch with an intent to set it, but sunk
                    down in his chair, and expired without a sigh or the least visible emotion, his
                    countenance still retaining the same placid appearance which was so peculiar to
                    him when in life.</p>
