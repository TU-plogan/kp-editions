                    away the greater part of his fortune. In 1645 he appears to have acted with the
                    parliament; and by them he was appointed administrator of the admiralty, in
                    conjunction with the Earls of Northumberland, Essex, Warwick, and others. He
                    lived to theaje of eighty-five; passed the latter part of his life in
                    retirement; and wrote a small folio of miscellanies, in prose and verse,
                    entitled a Forest Promiscuous of several Seasons’ Productions, in four parts,

                    in the country, and towards the end of his life entertained himself with books,
                    but, as his numerous issue required, with economy. He wrote a little tract,
                    called Observations and Advices Economical, 12mo. His other works are, 1.

                    John’s College, Cambridge, whence he removed to the Middle Temple. He acquired
                    French, Italian, Spanish, and Dutch, and became not only a good lawyer, but
                    thoroughly conversant with history, mathematics, philosophy, and music. He was
                    afterwards made the king’s solicitor-general, and chosen to represent the
                    borough of Lynn in parliament. He succeeded Sir Heneage Finch in the office of
                    attorney-general; and Lord Chief Justice Vaughan, in that of lord chief justice
                    of the Common Pleas. He was afterwards made keeper of the great seal, and in
                    1683 was created a baron by the title of Lord Guildford. He died at his house at
                    Wroxton in the year 1685. Lord Guildford wrote a philosophical essay on music; a
                    paper on the gravitation of fluids in the bladders of fishes, printed in

                    the Trinity House, president of the Foundling Hospital and of the Asylum, a
                    governor of the Turkey Company and of the Charter House, was born on the 13th of
                    April 1732. On the 20th of May 1756, he married Miss Ann Speke, an heiress of
                    the ancient family of Dillington in Somersetshire, by whom he left two sons and
                    three daughters. His lordship succeeded the celebrated Charles Townsend as
                    manager of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer; and, in 1770,
                    on the resignation of the Duke of Grafton, was made First Lord of the Treasury,
                    in which office he continued until the close of the American war, or rather
                    until the formation of the Rockingham ministry, which began the business of
                    peace with the colonies. He was a man of strong mental faculties, and an orator
                    of very considerable powers, enlivened and recommended by much pleasantry and
                    amenity; but taking the helm at a time when the king’s party were unpopular, and
                    when it was supposed that the Earl of Bute was the great engine by which the
                    cabinet was moved, he continued in a state of great unpopularity until he
                    resigned the seals. During the whole of his premiership, he studiously avoided
                    imposing any taxes which could materially affect ,the lower class of people. The
                    luxuries and not the necessaries of life were repeated objects of his budget. As
                    a financier he stood high, even in the opinion of an opposition forming a
                    combination of all the great talents in the kingdom; but being fatally wedded to
                    the destructive plan of subduing the republican spirit of the Americans, his
                    administration is marked by an immense waste of the public treasure, and a
                    lavish expenditure of blood. The very last time he spoke in the senate, however,
                    he defended that war, and said he was then, as he had formerly been, prepared to
                    meet the minutest investigation as to his conduct in that contest, which nothing
                    but the unforeseen intervention of France could have prevented from being
                    crowned with success. His lordship was one of the firmest and most strenuous
                    supporters of the constitution in church and state. He died on the 5th of August

                    25. E. Lat. 51.25. N.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">North Island,</hi> a small island in the Eastern Seas, near
                    the east entrance of the Straits of Sunda, where those who go ashore for wood or
                    water are in great danger from the treacherous Malays, who surprise and murder
                    them. Lat. 5. 57. S. There are four other islands of this name in the Eastern
                    Seas, namely, one near the west coast of Borneo, longitude 109. 5. east,
                    latitude 1. 22. south; another near the north coast of Celebes, longitude 120.
                    48. east, latitude 5. 38. south; a third, a small island near the south-west
                    coast of the island of Bouton, longitude 122. 50. east, latitudes. 33. south;
                    and a fourth, an island on the north coast of New Holland, near the head of the
                    Gulf of Carpentaria, included by Captain Flinders under the general appellation
                    of Sir Edward Pellew’s Group. Long, <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Pellew Cape, the
                    northern extremity of the island, 137. 2. E. Lat. 16. 30½. S.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">North Point Isles,</hi> several small islands near the
                    northeast coast of New Holland, in latitude 22. S.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">North Point Islet,</hi> a small island on the north coast of
                    New Holland, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, near the island of Groote Eylandt.
                    Long. 136. 45. E. Lat. 13. 37. S.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">North Rocks,</hi> otherwise called St Patrick’s Rocks, from
                    a seat of stone amongst them called St Patrick’s Chair, whence the rocks have
                    taken this second name, are situated in the harbour of Donaghadee, in the county
                    of Down, and province of Ulster, in Ireland. From north to south they are about
                    two thirds of a league, between which is clear good ground. But care must be
                    taken to avoid the south rock, on which many ships have perished; for it is
                    overflowed by every tide, and no crew can save their lives if the wind blows
                    high. This rock stands fully a mile from the shore.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
