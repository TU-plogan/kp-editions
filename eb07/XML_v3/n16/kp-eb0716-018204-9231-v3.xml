                <p><label type="entry">NEW YORK</label>, one of the thirteen original states of the
                    North American confederacy, and the most populous and important in the Union. It
                    is bounded on the north by Upper and Lower Canada; on the east by the states of
                    Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut; on the southeast by the Atlantic Ocean;
                    on the south by New Jersey and Pennsylvania; on the west by Pennsylvania, Lake
                    Erie, and the Niagara River; and on the north-west by Lake Ontario and the river
                    St Lawrence. The territory of New York is situated between latitude 40. 30. and
                    45. north, and between longitude 5. 5. east, and 2. 55. west from the city of
                    Washington. Its extreme length from east to west is about 340 miles, and,
                    including Long Island, 408 miles; and its greatest breadth from north to south
                    is 310 miles, its area being about 46,000 square miles. This estimate includes
                    the whole surface, except the waters of the great lakes.</p>
                <p>New York is an epitome of all configurations of surface, and every variety of
                    lake, mountain, and river scenery. It may be described, generally, as an
                    elevated tract, with indentations in various parts below its usual level. The
                    most striking depressions are the great basins in which aré situated Lakes Erie
                    and Ontario, and the long narrow valley which contains the Hudson River and Lake
                    Champlain. The two latter are united by a valley occupied by the Mohawk River
                    and Lake Oneida. The south-eastern angle of the state, about forty miles above
                    the city of New Tork, is mountainous, being traversed by several ridges from New
                    Jersey, one of which crosses the Hudson in the vicinity of West Point, and forms
                    the high lands of that river. It also constitutes the dividing ridge between the
                    Hudson and the Connecticut, and lies partly in the state of Connecticut. The
                    space south of the Mohawk River and the Ontario Valley, and between the River
                    Hudson and Lake Erie, is occupied by another mountainous district, the western
                    part of which forms a table-land having 2000 feet of mean elevation, and is the
                    source of several large rivers, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559244"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9244-0183"/>particularly the Alleghany, the Susquehannah, and
                    the Genesee. The eastern part, lying between Lake Seneca and the Hudson, is
                    occupied by several parallel mountain ridges, which may be considered as
                    continuations of the Alleghany ridge passing out from Pennsylvania. These ridges
                    run in a north and south direction, and their indentations give rise to several
                    fertile valleys. The highest are the Catskill Mountains, which bound the valley
                    of the Hudson on the west. Round Top, the most elevated summit, is 3804 feet
                    above the level of the tide-water of the Hudson. There is also a narrow
                    table-land in this subdivision. situated a little south of the line of the Erie
                    Canal, and continuing almost uninterruptedly from the Catskill Mountains to the
                    head of Seneca Lake. On this elevation are situated a number of lakes, the
                    height of which above tide-water varies from 380 to 1200 feet. A third mountain
                    district is situated to the north of the Mohawk, between Lake Champlain and the
                    east end of Lake Ontario. This division is traversed by at least five or six
                    parallel ridges, passing in a north-eastern direction, and which are considered
                    as continuations of the Appalachian chain. The highest elevation that has been
                    ascertained with accuracy is a peak belonging to the ridge that passes through
                    Herkimer and Hamilton counties, and the northern part of Essex, near the sources
                    of the Hudson. It is 2686 feet above the level of the sea.</p>
                <p>We have already mentioned the basins in which are situated Lakes Erie and
                    Ontario, and the valley which contains the Hudson River and Lake Champlain. The
                    two former depressions are portions of the vast St Lawrence basin, which
                    embraces the whole of the five great western lakes. Proceeding along the basin
                    of the Ontario, we pass through a series of fertile counties, constituting the
                    slope, watered by numerous rivers, which all finally terminate in the lake. The
                    Genesee, Oswego, and Black are important streams, which rise in the interior of
                    the state. The first-named river is the outlet of the Canesus, Hemlock, and
                    Honeyoe Lakes. The Oswego, and its tributaries the Clyde and Seneca, convey the
                    waters of Canandaigua, Crooked, Seneca, Cayuga, Owasco, Skaneateles, Onondaga,
                    and Oneida Lakes into Lake Ontario. The Mohawk River occupies the eastern
                    termination of this basin; whilst towards the northeast the slope towards the St
                    Lawrence, indicated by the course of the Grass, Racket, Oswegatchie, and St
                    Regis Rivers, shows it to be a continuation of that towards the lakes. The
                    Hudson and Champlain Valley stretches nearly north and south, and is remarkable
                    for its depth below the general surface <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the level of
                    the adjoining country. In the northern part are situated Lakes George and
                    Champlain, which are connected with each other. The southern portion
                    communicates with the valley of the Mohawk, which enters it in a south-easterly
                    direction. The Hudson rises in the northern part of New York, between Lake
                    Champlain and the St Lawrence, and has its whole course in the state. An
                    American writer on geography thus describes this river :—“No fact in the
                    topography of the state of New Fork is more remarkable than the peculiar
                    position of the Hudson and its branches. If we trace the course of any Atlantic
                    river south of it, we shall find the navigation closed by the mountain chain on
                    the west. Not so with the Hudson. It penetrates the high lands, and after
                    passing up some hundred and sixty miles, it is met by a tributary, the sources
                    of which reach nearly to the lakes. Here the happy conformity of the country is
                    such as to permit the establishment of an artificial navigation.” After a course
                    of between three and four hundred miles, the Hudson falls into the Bay of New
                    York, above which it is navigable for ships about one hundred and thirty miles.
                    The Susquehannah rises in this state, and passes into Pennsylvania, as does also
                    the Delaware. The Alleghany of the Ohio collects its head waters in the
                    south-west angle of this state, and passes through its noble pineforests into
                    Pennsylvania. Here are a vast number of lakes and streams besides those named,
                    which would be conspicuous in a state of smaller dimensions, and where the
                    configuration is on a less gigantic scale. But we have preferred presenting
                    general views of the conformation of the face of the country to a dry catalogue
                    of lakes and rivers and mountains, with their courses and terminations. Those
                    which are remarkable for their size or peculiarities will be found more
                    particularly described under their respective designations. Some celebrated
                    mineral springs exist in this state. Those of Saratoga and Ballston are more
                    resorted to than any others in the United States. The Ballston springs are
                    situated in a valley formed by a small creek. There are a great number of them,
                    the strongest and most sparkling waters being those obtained in 1827, by boring
                    227 feet down. The principal efficacy of the water arises from a chemical union
                    of chalybeate and saline ingredients held in solution, and the presence of
                    uncommon quantities of carbonic acid gas. Saratoga springs are several miles
                    distant from those of Ballston, and belong to the same class of mineral waters.
                    A large and compact village has sprung up at this place, in consequence of the
                    immense resort to it from all parts of the United States, Canada, and even the
                    West Indies. Saratoga springs are thirty-two miles north of Albany. To these may
                    be added the tepid springs of New Lebanon, twenty-nine miles east of Albany,
                    which are frequented for bathing, and on account of their cool and elevated
                    position; and the sulphur springs of Avon; to all which places crowds of
                    fashionable people and invalids resort during the summer months.</p>
                <p>Most of the formations discriminated in works of geology exist in this state, and
                    some of them are of a very interesting character, particularly the earth and
                    gypsum found in the western part of the state. Granite, slate, and limestone
                    hills occur; and one species of impure limestone, found in the western and
                    northern parts of New York, has been used with great success in the construction
                    of canals. Marble has been obtained in large quantities, for architectural
                    purposes, from the quarries of Sing Sing. Its purity is said to increase with
                    the depth of the excavations, and several large and beautiful public edifices
                    have been constructed of it. At the head of Lake Onondaga are situated salt
                    springs of the same name, surrounded by the waters of the lake, which still,
                    however, continue perfectly fresh. Plants peculiar to the sea-coast are found
                    here, in particular the <hi rend="italic">salicornia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >salsola.</hi> Underneath the mud or decayed vegetable matter which constitutes
                    the valley of these springs, a stratum of earthy marl is found, containing
                    numerous fossil univalves; and this again appears to be succeeded by a
                    conglomerate. The peculiar nature of the underlying rock, or rather its
                    position, does not seem to be determined. Great quantities of salt are
                    manufactured here by the various processes of boiling and solar evaporation.
                    Gypsum, in its various forms of earthy gypsum, selenite, and even alabaster, is
                    found, particularly in •the counties of Onondaga and Cayuga, and is extensively
                    used for agricultural purposes. Another prominent article -of mineral wealth is
                    iron ore, immense beds of which are found in the counties west of Lake
                    Champlain. The iron ore of Columbia county is likewise highly valued and
                    extensively manufactured. Lead, silver, zinc, titanium, and other metals, have
                    been detected in various parts of the state; and anthracite or bituminous coal
                    is found, but it is questionable whether in sufficient quantities to afford
                    remuneration for the expenses of raining. Petroleum, porcelain clay, and most of
                    the fossils, are found in different places, and some of the organic remains
                    discovered belong to the higher animals. Transition and secondary rocks compose
                    the body of the state; and in the granitic districts, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559257" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9257-0184"/>near New York, and on the
                    borders of Lake Champlain, picturesque and remarkable projections of rock,
                    caverns, and the like, frequently occur. The cataracts and smaller falls of
                    water are numerous in this state; and those of Niagara are the most magnificent
                    in the world. Cohoes is a fine fall on the Mohawk River, having seventy feet of
                    perpendicular descent. The Little Falls on the same river present most beautiful
                    scenery; and amongst the remarkable objects connected with the artificial
                    navigation of New York, may be mentioned the aqueduct at Little Falls, that over
                    the Genesee at Rochester, and the locks at Lockport, at Little Falls, and at the
                    junction of the northern and western canals. Glen’s Falls on the Hudson, and
                    those on the Genesee in the village of Rochester, and at Ithaca, also deserve
                    mention as very striking cascades, but only too near Niagara to be famous. A
                    limestone cavern of vast dimensions, with its falls, columns, and stalactites,
                    exists on the banks of Black River, opposite Waterton. The ridge road, extending
                    from Rochester to Lewiston, is a most remarkable geological formation. As its
                    name implies, it is a natural road of sufficient width for the purposes of
                    travelling, and generally is extremely level. It runs nearly parallel with the
                    shores of Lake Ontario, from which it is distant sometimes several miles. There
                    is a remarkable natural production of carburetted hydrogen in the towns of
                    Fredonia and Portland, Chautauque county. This gas is obtained in such immense
                    quantities that it has been conducted into these villages, and used as a natural
                    gas-light. In the western part of this state are situated the hunting grounds
                    and residences of the famous six Indian nations, who have now submitted to the
                    restraints of civilization; and these are adorned by the productions of industry
                    and refinement, yet still show traces of their former existence in the mounds
                    and other antiquities occasionally observed.</p>
                <p>There are several islands belonging to the state of New York. Long Island, as its
                    name imports, is a long but narrow strip of insular land, extending east from
                    the city of New York one hundred and fifty miles, forming a curve parallel to
                    the mainland shore, and leaving a broad and beautiful sheet of water not unlike
                    a wide river between, called Long Island Sound. It contains three counties, the
                    chief towns being Brooklyn, Jamaica, Sag Harbour, and Flatbush. The south border
                    is a long belt of sand, somewhat barren; but the northern has a fertile soil,
                    and is in a high state of cultivation, producing large quantities of grain,
                    fruits, and hay. Like other insular positions, it has a climate more mild than
                    that of the adjacent continent. Sag Harbour is the principal port. New York is
                    in a great measure supplied with wood from this island, the eastern part of it
                    being remarkably well adapted to its growth. On the west, Long Island is divided
                    from Staten Island by the narrows, and from Manhattan Island by East River. On
                    the latter island is situated the city of New York, which will be afterwards
                    described. Staten Island is above fourteen miles in length by from five to eight
                    in breadth, and is the most southern land belonging to New York.</p>
                <p>In the maritime belt of the state the soil is sandy; in the middle it is a finely
                    undulating and productive country; and in the western and southern divisions it
                    is remarkably level, rich, and inclining to alluvial formation. The state has a
                    great proportion of first-rate land. The country on the Hudson, below the mouth
                    of the Mohawk, has a good medium soil. The counties of Westchester and Dutchess
                    are under very good cultivation. The alluvial flats of Columbia and Rensselaer
                    are very extensive and rich. A considerable district west of Albany consists of
                    sandy plains interspersed with marshes. The alluvial flats upon the Mohawk are
                    large and extremely fertile. The soil of the elevated plain of the western
                    region, being occupied by the small lakes, is a rich mould equally well adapted
                    to grain and grass. The alluvial flats are here extensive; those on the Mohawk
                    comprise about 60,000 acres. With regard to climate, a general view can scarcely
                    be given of a country which stretches over four degrees and a half of latitude.
                    In the northern division, which abuts upon Canada, the climate, as might be
                    expected, is somewhat severe, partaking of the nature of these northern regions.
                    In the south-east, towards the sea, it is temperate, but subject to sudden and
                    great changes. As the eastern boundary of New York passes along the borders of
                    the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont, the climate of these
                    parts resembles that of the states to which they are contiguous. After passing
                    the high lands, and entering into the eastern country beyond Utica, the climate
                    becomes milder than it is to the eastward. In the western parts, contiguous to
                    Lakes Ontario and Erie, the temperature is moderated by these waters, and does
                    not reach the same extremes as in the south-east. The climate of the whole state
                    is in general healthy, and favourable to cultivation. A mass of interesting
                    facts regarding temperature has been obtained, in consequence of the regents
                    requiring annual meteorological reports from the academies under their care.
                    These academies are scattered over every part of the state, and the mean
                    temperature of the whole thus furnishes an approximation towards that of the
                    state generally.</p>
                <p>In 1826, the mean temperature of ten places reporting complete annual tables was
                    49∙38</p>
                <p>In 1827, the mean temperature of 18 places was 46∙48</p>
                <p>In 1828, the mean temperature of 24&gt; places was 49 ’ 50</p>
                <p>In 1829, the mean temperature of 28 places was 46∙45</p>
                <p>In 1830, the mean temperature of 34 places was 48 ’ 15</p>

                <p>The quantity of rain and snow has also been ascertained in <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> similar manner. Thus:</p>
                <p>In 1826, the mean rain and snow of nine places was...36∙34 In 1827, the mean rain
                    and snow of 17 places was...44∙29</p>

                <p>Mean of the five years 38∙22</p>
                <p>The highest degree of temperature noticed in these tables is 104°, at which the
                    thermometer stood in an academy in the county of Orange, on the 20th of July
                    1830. It is situated in lat. 41. 32. north, and long. 74. 10. west. The lowest
                    degree noticed is — 33, at which the thermometer stood in an academy in the
                    county of Lewis, on the 31st of January 1830. It is situated in lat. 43. 47.
                    north, and long. 75. 33. west. The range of the thermometer in New York state is
                    therefore 137 degrees of Fahrenheit. It is rarely lower than — 33; but on the
                    4th of January 1835, it fell forty degrees below zero at New Lebanon. This,
                    however, is an extreme case. The scale of variation in summer may be given at
                    from 35° to 60°, in autumn at from 60° to 73°, in winter at from 70° above to
                    26° below zero, and in spring at from 3° to 75°. The variation is greatest upon
                    the Atlantic coast, along the St Lawrence, and around Lakes Ontario and Erie;
                    the north-cast, east, south-east, and south-west winds being more prevalent upon
                    the coast, and the north-east and south-west upon these lakes and along the St
                    Lawrence. The variations of the weather at all seasons are great and sudden,
                    changing the temperature in a few hours 40° or 50°, rising with the southerly,
                    and diminishing with the northerly winds.</p>
                <p>The staple productions of New York consist principally of wheat and other grain,
                    flour, flax, hemp, provisions, salt, pot and pearl ashes, and lumber. The forest
                    trees, which thrive to the greatest advantage in an alluvial soil, are common in
                    the western divisions of this state, and attain<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559270" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9270-0185"/> a large size. Wheat,
                    however, is considered as the grand staple of New York.</p>
                <p>The great wheat district of the state commences in the valley of the Mohawk,
                    above the primitive spur at Little Falls, in a fertile soil of calcareous
                    alluvion, which overspreads the valley at German Flats. This district,
                    comprehending the central portions of Oneida county, extends westward to the
                    lakes, and is bounded northwards by the north ridge of the valley, by Lake
                    Ontario, and southwards by a line running south-west from Utica to the mouth of
                    Cattaraugus Creek at Lake Erie. This is the garden of the state, including the
                    rich Seneca vale, and the far-famed Genesee county. Some portions of this
                    district are sandy, and in others the rock rises too near the surface, whilst
                    others are not sufficiently watered; but taken as a whole, it is not surpassed
                    by any district of equal extent in the United States. Here artificial manures
                    are rarely used, and indeed rarely needed. In the newly-cleared lands, the
                    richness of the mould and of the sub-soil is all that the farmer requires, being
                    content if, by clearing away the forest, he can only bring it forth. Amongst the
                    obstructions which the stumps of the trees offer, he is compelled to plough as
                    he can, not as his judgment might dictate. In tracts long cleared, deep
                    ploughing, blending the mould and the soil, preserves the former, and turns up
                    the latter to disintegrate, and thus to yield its calcareous matter. Upon such
                    farms some attention is given to rotation in crops, with a view to the
                    preservation of fertility; but it is not uncommon to find the same field sown in
                    wheat for a series of years, without the intervention of other crops. Taking the
                    whole district together, the average product of wheat may be from twenty-five to
                    thirty bushels the acre; but from forty to fifty are frequently obtained.
                    Instances have been known of more than eighty bushels to the acre, and of Indian
                    corn one hundred and twenty-five. The apple, pear, cherry, and quince, all
                    thrive admirably; and the peach in size and flavour is scarcely inferior to that
                    of the Atlantic coast. Grapes also, both foreign and indigenous, richly repay
                    careful cultivation.</p>
                <p>The region south of the line above drawn, and north of the southern boundary of
                    the state, and between Lake Erie and that portion of the Kaatsbergs which runs
                    parallel with the Hudson, may be characterized as a grazing country. Upon its
                    northern border, the limestone, being more abundant than in other parts, renders
                    the soil more or less productive in wheat; and this section, producing grain and
                    grass abundantly, is by many preferred to that which is most fertile in wheat.
                    By far the larger portion of this south-western district is yet covered with
                    forests, and in most places upon its southern borders, the chief business of its
                    inhabitants consists in the cutting and vending of lumber, consequently its
                    agricultural products are inconsiderable compared with its population. There
                    are, however, some well cultivated tracts in all the border counties, and in
                    Chautauque, upon the shores of Lake Erie. One of the most useful improvements
                    introduced into agriculture, and the result partly of experience, partly of the
                    necessity imposed by the opening of the eastern markets to the western region,
                    is the appropriation of soils exclusively to the productions for which they are
                    by nature adapted, and the consequent abandonment of the practice of
                    endeavouring to compel every species to yield crops to which it is not
                    congenial. Under this wise system much of the country upon the North River has
                    ceased to be a grain district. Large portions of it are devoted to horticulture,
                    for supplying culinary vegetables to the greatly increasing population of the
                    cities and numerous villages; and those portions of the district most remote
                    from markets are being rapidly converted into pasturage. Thus the comparatively
                    sterile soil of Long Island and Westchester is profitably devoted to the
                    production of garden and field esculents, fruit, hay, oats, and small meats, for
                    the great market of the city, in the proximity of which the cultivator finds
                    ample compensation for the inferiority of soil, and the consequent greater cost
                    of production, his lands being by this circumstance, and the facility of
                    obtaining manures, rendered more valuable than the naturally rich fields of the
                    west. Thus, too, the high and hilly-grounds of Putnam county have, by the free
                    use of gypsum, been made very productive pastures, in which the plough is
                    comparatively little used, and which maintain large droves of cattle and sheep,
                    but chiefly of the former. The counties of Dutchess, Columbia,. and Washington,
                    especially the two first, comprising considerable portions of limestone soil,
                    alternating with slate, produce profitable crops of wheat. But the eastern and
                    northern portions of Dutchess, and the hilly sections of Columbia, are chiefly
                    laid out in sheep farms, and in Washington the raising of sheep is rapidly
                    becoming the staple business. In Orange county the chief products are those of
                    the dairy, and the butter of this county has long been held in the highest
                    estimation. The raising of sheep also extends rapidly here. Ulster and Greene
                    counties likewise produce large quantities of cattle and sheep, and, of late
                    years, of butter and hay for export. The portions of Albany and Saratoga
                    counties which are not covered with sand, and the portion of the latter not
                    included in the primitive mountains, are under good cultivation. Wheat is not
                    unprofitable, and Albany exports large quantities. Still the best returns are
                    obtained from cattle and sheep. The northern counties of Warren, Essex, and
                    Clinton, can boast but little of their agriculture; yet the primitive virgin
                    mould is scarcely anywhere exhausted, and the forest trees grow thickly and to a
                    large size. The abundance of timber, and the facility of getting it to market,
                    together with the rich mineral deposits, have hitherto chiefly occupied the
                    attention of the inhabitants. The northern portions of Franklin and St Lawrence
                    counties, very partially cleared, and level or gently undulating, are well
                    adapted for cultivation. No parts of the state yield better grass, and the
                    raising of cattle and sheep is found to be the most profitable employment of the
                    soil, although it is well adapted to wheat, Indian corn, and other grains.
                    Jefferson county is very productive of wheat, as are other parts of New York,
                    which, hoavever, do not require to be specially mentioned. Societies have been
                    formed in various parts of the state for the promotion of agriculture and
                    horticulture, and they have already been productive of much good.</p>
                <p>The line of extraordinary works, supposed to have been of a military character,
                    which may be traced from the shores of Lake Ontario as far as the valley of the
                    Mississippi, and thence southward to an indefinite extent, must not be
                    overlooked in our survey of the surface of this state. These works consist of
                    earthen parapets, the sites of which, with a view to defence, appear to have
                    been selected with much judgment, and upon the construction of these greater
                    skill has been exercised than any displayed by the Indian races known to us. The
                    erection of these fortifications has been ascribed to the European nations,
                    French and Spanish, who, at periods immediately subsequent to the discovery of
                    America, visited its shores, and also to a race of inhabitants supposed to have
                    preceded that found there by the Europeans. The works themselves afford no means
                    of tracing their origin, but they display indubitable marks of high antiquity,
                    so that the opinion of their having been constructed by the French or the
                    Spaniards is at once exploded. The forms of these remains are various, being
                    circular, elliptical, triangular, and square; and they are generally placed in
                    situations which command the adjacent country. Near many of the forts are mounds
                    of earth raised for cemeteries, in which human bones in various stages of decay
                    have been discovered. The number of forts and mounds situated in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559283" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9283-0186"/>the western parts of this
                    state much exceeds an hundred. The enclosed areas of the fortifications vary
                    from six acres to one hundred feet in diameter; and the earthen walls which
                    enclose them, in their present abraded condition, are from ten to twelve feet in
                    height, and from six to eight feet in breadth. Some of these breast-works bear
                    or have borne trees, whose age has been estimated at more than two hundred and
                    seventy-five years, and which may have been preceded by others. One fact seems
                    to indicate that the architects were not greatly advanced in civilization. In
                    the remnants of manufactured articles found, there is an absence of any finished
                    works of art in wood or metals, and the fragments of pottery are rude and of a
                    primitive form. They are therefore in all likelihood not the production of the
                    Toltecs or the Aztecs who found their way to Mexicoover the northern parts of
                    the continent, but must be attributed to the Alligewi or some other Indian
                    tribe.</p>
                <p>About twenty-five years ago, this state commenced a system of internal
                    improvement, which has been prosecuted on an extensive scale, and with great
                    success. The enterprise of this nature which was first undertaken is the Erie
                    Canal, one of the greatest and most important works of the kind in the world. It
                    was begun on the 4th of July 1817, and was completed in 1825. The principal
                    canals in New York, with the exception of the Hudson and Delaware Canal, have
                    been constructed by the state, and are now its property. But the railroads have
                    been mostly undertaken by incorporated companies. The railroad first undertaken
                    in the state was the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, which was begun in 1830, and
                    finished in 1833. Since that time several railroads have been completed, more
                    are in progress, and a still greater number are projected. For details as to the
                    extent of inland navigation in the state of New York, see the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Navigation, Inland.</hi></p>

                <p>The New York and Erie Railroad, one of the greatest works of the kind that has
                    ever been projected, extending from the city of New York, through the southern
                    counties of the state, to Portland and Dunkirk on Lake Erie, was commenced in
                    November 1835. The total expense of this vast undertaking is estimated at
                    2,717,518 dollars. Up to the end of 1834 there had been forty other railroad
                    companies incorporated, having a capital of thirty-five millions of dollars; and
                    in the session of 1836 there were no less than forty-two incorporated. One of
                    these, the Utica and Syracuse Railroad, above fifty miles in length, and several
                    others, have either commenced very lately, or are now (1837) about to
                    commence.</p>

                <p>The manufactures of this state being of great importance, a detailed account of
                    some of them is therefore necessary. Leather is a most important article of
                    manufacture, and it is made cheaper in this state than it can be, of equal
                    quality, in any other part of the world. The increase in the making of sole
                    leather is 500 or 600 per cent, since 1817, and 200 or 300 per cent, since 1827.
                    It is estimated that above one third of the whole sole leather used annually in
                    the United States is made in New York. Above 16,000 individuals are employed and
                    sustained by the cotton factories, which are located as follows, viz. in Oncida
                    county twenty mills; in Rensselaer county fifteen mills; in Dutchess county
                    twelve mills; in Otsego county eleven mills; in Columbia county seven mills; and
                    in Westchester, Washington, and Herkimer counties, five each. Several other
                    counties have from one to four mills each. In estimating the value of woollens
                    made in this state, it should be borne in mind, that notwithstanding the
                    numerous fixed establishments for the manufacture of this article, household or
                    family manufactures of wool and cotton are still carried on to a great extent.
                    By the state census <hi rend="italic">of</hi> 1825, the following articles were
                    made in families during the preceding year.</p>

                <p>In 1835, Mr Pitkms reckoned that woollens alone were manufactured in families to
                    the amount of at least 4,500,000 dollars annually. Now, if we allow the
                    manufacture of linen, cotton, and other cloths, to have risen to 1,500,000
                    dollars, which is a fair estimate, this will make the total amount of domestic
                    articles made in families six millions of dollars.</p>
                <p>The following are some of the other manufactures of New York, not included in the
                    general summary, namely, wool and fur hats made and finished in this state,
                    estimated at 3,500,000 dollars annually; boots and shoes, deducting leather,
                    3,000,000 dollars annually; leather, cloth, and fur caps, probably 2,000,000
                    dollars annually. The amount <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ready-made clothing is
                    not estimated, but large establishments exist, particularly in the city of New
                    York, and immense quantities are shipped to the southern states, and to foreign
                    ports. Cabinet ware of every description is manufactured, not only for home
                    consumption, but for shipment in large quantities to southern ports, South
                    America, and the West Indies. Machinery, pianofortes, and carriages, are
                    likewise manufactured on an extensive scale throughout the larger cities of the
                    state. There are, besides, a multitude of smaller manufactures, such as those of
                    gunpowder, fire-arms, chemical compounds, pigments, including white-lead and
                    other paints, pencils, printing types, and tobacco; and others including the
                    construction of ships and boats, chiefly for the navigation of the great lakes.
                    The Onondaga salt-springs are situated in the town of Salina, Onondaga county,
                    and are the property of the state. The salt is manufactured at four different
                    villages, viz. Salina, Syracuse, Geddes, and Liverpool; and in the year 1833 the
                    state of the manufacture was as follows: Number of manufactories, 131; number of
                    kettles, 3309; number of gallons in the kettles, 312,795; and number of bushels
                    manufactured, 1,838,646. Of this quantity about 103,000 bushels were made by
                    solar evaporation. Coarse salt, of equal purity to any in the world, is also
                    manufactured, and sold at a price which nets the manufacturer<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559335" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9335-0190"/> nine cents per statute
                    bushel of fifty-six lbs.; and fine salt is sold at six cents. The trade in salt
                    has been pushed to a considerable extent in competition with the foreign
                    article, particularly since the reduction of the duty in 1834. During that year
                    1,943,252 bushels were manufactured; and in 1835 the quantity made amounted to
                    2,222,694 bushels.</p>

                <p>The number and tonnage of vessels entering and departing from New York have of
                    course increased in proportion to the trade. In 1830 there entered of American
                    tonnage 298,434, and departed 229,341; and of foreign tonnage there entered
                    35,344, and departed 36,574; making a total of American and foreign which
                    entered 333,778, and which departed 265,915 tons. In 1835 there entered of
                    American tonnage 676,173, and of foreign tonnage 357,575, making a total of
                    1,033,748 tons. During the same year there departed, of American tonnage
                    589,855, of foreign 343,078, making a total of 932,933 tons. The value of the
                    merchandise annually loaded and unloaded in the port of New York is estimated at
                    from 100,000,000 to 120,000,000 dollars. The number of vessels in the port in
                    the busy season varies from 500 to 750, exclusively of about fifty
                    steam-packets. The total value of the imports into the United States in the year
                    ending on the 30th of September 1832, was 101,029,266 dollars, of which no less
                    than 53,214,402, or more than one half, were imported into New York. The value
                    of the exports from the same place is estimated at between one third and one
                    fourth of the total exports from the whole of the United States.</p>
                <p>It will be seen from the above table, that the imports into this state greatly
                    exceed the exports. This is accounted for by the fact, that whilst almost all
                    articles of export from the western states are shipped at New Orleans, the
                    greater part of the more valuable articles brought from foreign countries, and·
                    destined for the consumption of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and to some extent even
                    of Kentucky, are principally imported into New York. The customs’ revenue on the
                    goods paying duties imported into the city of New York amounts to about thirteen
                    millions of dollars, which is more than one half of the total customs’ revenue
                    of the entire United States. The imports comprehend an infinite variety of
                    articles. The principal are cottons, woollens, linens, hardware, and cutlery;
                    earthenware, brass and copper manufactures, and other articles, from Great
                    Britain; silk, wine, brandy, and other articles, from France and Spain; sugar
                    and coffee from the Havannah and Brazil, together with tea, spices, cochineal,
                    indigo, dye-woods, and other articles. The nature of the principal articles of
                    native American produce exported from New York will be seen by the following
                    returns for the 1st of January 1833.</p>

                <p>The tonnage of New York is greater than that of any other city in the world, with
                    the single exception of London, and constitutes between one fifth and one sixth
                    of that of all the United States put together. By a return of the 1st of January
                    1834, it amounted to 319,209 tons.</p>
                <p>The following is a return of the amount <hi rend="italic">of</hi> tonnage in the
                    state in 1836. New York, 359,222, with 15,903 of steam navigation; Sag Harbour,
                    12,314; Buffalo Creek, 3740, with 1680 of steam navigation; Sackett’s Harbour,
                    2236, with 280 of steam navigation; Oswego, 2040, with 406 of steam navigation;
                    Oswegatchee, 799, with 417 of steam navigation; Champlain, 616; Genesee, 636;
                    and Cape Vincent, 860. These facts will convey, it is hoped, a sufficient idea
                    of the vast extent of the commerce of New York.</p>
                <p>This state borrowed a considerable sum for the construction of its canals,
                    particularly the Erie and Champlain Canal, which debt is in the course of being
                    redeemed by the annual income of the state, which always greatly exceeds the
                    expenditure. There are several funds belonging to the state, viz. the general,
                    common school, literature, canal, and bank funds: but the general fund consists
                    of bonds and mortgages for lands sold, loans, and other debts due to the state.

                <p>From the large annual receipts obtained from tolls, auctions, sales of lands, and
                    other items, the property of the canals, it is expected that the canal debt will
                    be paid off long before the time fixed on for redeeming the whole of the
                    stock.</p>
                <p>In 1829 an act was passed requiring every bank thereafter to be created or
                    renewed, to contribute annually one half of one per cent, on its capital to a
                    fund intended for the payment of the debts of such banks as may at any time
                    become insolvent. These banks are placed under the supervision of commissioners,
                    to whom they are required to make annual reports of their condition, and are
                    called “safety-fund banks.” In 1830 there were thirty-seven banks in New York
                    state, having a capital of 20,083,353 dollars. In 1836 there were eighty-seven
                    banks, and two branch banks, which stood thus: Specie funds, 670,363 dollars;
                    specie, 7,221,335; capital, 31,881,460; circulation, 16,427,963; and deposits,
                    22,000,000 of dollars. The whole of these banks, with the exception of seven or
                    eight, are safety-fund banks. There are, besides, nine savings banks, having a
                    total capital of 3,855,517 dollars. In the city of New York there are thirteen
                    marine insurance companies, with a capital of 4,550,000 dollars; and
                    twenty-eight fire insurance companies, with a capital of 10,250,000 dollars. In
                    the other parts of the state there are about twenty-two insurance companies,
                    with a total capital of above four millions of dollars. In 1835 there were 1687
                    post-offices in the state of New York, and the amount of postages for the
                    preceding year was 430,426 dollars, of which 192,493 dollars were for the city
                    of New 5ork alone. In 1834, the military establishment (militia) of New York
                    stood thus, viz. horse artillery 1687, cavalry, /080, artillery 11,669;
                    infantry, including riflemen, 164,979; companies of artillery attached
                    permanently, or for inspection, 3032; total number of men, 178,447. There are
                    five vessels of war employed in ordinary at New York.</p>
                <p>The constitution of this state secures toleration of religious worship, so that
                    every denomination is to be found in it. The following is a statement of the
                    number of the clergy of different denominations in 1835: Presbyterians and
                    Congregationalists, 562; Methodists, 492; Baptists, 442; Episcopalians (one
                    bishop), 181; Dutch Reformed, 116; Lutherans, thirty; Associate Reformed,
                    twenty-three; Roman Catholics, one bishop and thirty-five ministers;
                    Universalists, upwards of twenty; Unitarians, eight; New Jerusalemites, five;
                    Shakers, two societies; Jews, three synagogues; the Friends, a considerable
                    number of societies; besides various other denominations not enumerated in this
                    list, as well as a number of licentiates and candidates belonging to those
                    given, particularly to the Presbyterians. The clergy are supported by
                    subscription, contribution, rents of pews, income from funds, and other sources.
                    The salaries in the city of New York vary from 1000 to upwards of 3000 dollars.
                    The average annual salaries of the clergy of this state are estimated as not
                    exceeding 500 dollars each. The state of the theological seminaries in 1836 was
                    as follows :— General theological seminary of the Protestant Episcopal church in
                    the United States, located in New York, instituted in 1819, four professors,
                    eighty students, and 3880 volumes in the library; the Presbyterian theological
                    seminary at Auburn, Cayuga county, instituted in 1821, four professors,
                    fifty-one students, and 4500 volumes in the library; the Hamilton literary and
                    theological seminary (Baptist), at Hamilton, Madison county, instituted in 1829,
                    eight instructors, 124 alumni, eighty-three students, and 1600 volumes in the
                    library; the Hartwich theological seminary (Lutheran), at Hartwich, Otsego
                    county, instituted in 1816, two professors, nine theological and a number of
                    academical students, and 1000 volumes in the library; and the Oneida institute
                    of science and industry (Presbyterian), near Utica, about fifty students and
                    1000 volumes in the library. The Baptist college at Brockport, Monroe county,
                    the Methodist academy, White Plains, Westchester county, and a conference
                    seminary belonging to the same sect at Cazenovia, Oneida county, and the Genesee
                    Wesleyan seminary, Lima, Livingston county, also belong to the list of religious
                    institutions. Amongst these may be included the American Bible Society, which
                    has its seat in the city of New York, where a spacious building has been erected
                    for it; the United Missionary Society, instituted at New York in 1817; the
                    American Home Missionary Society, instituted at the same place in 1826; together
                    with several missionary, tract, Sunday school, and other religious societies,
                    which have various ramifications throughout the state. The benevolent
                    institutions are upon a very extensive scale. There are asylums adapted to
                    almost every case of human deprivation and misery; for the deaf and dumb, the
                    blind, the orphan, the widow, the indigent, the aged, and the stranger. In 1834
                    their number, including religious benevolent societies, was forty-eight, and
                    since then they must, like every thing else, have increased. It may be
                    mentioned, that temperance societies flourish better in New York, and some of
                    the other states, than they seem to do in any other part of the world.</p>
                <p>Since the establishment of the state government, great exertions have been made
                    by the legislature to extend the means of education to all classes of the
                    community. The appropriations made for this purpose, including the capital and
                    income of the common school and literature funds, amount to above six millions
                    of dollars. The common schools are amongst the most important and interesting
                    institutions in the state. Every town is divided into a suitable number of
                    school districts, in each of which a school-house has been erected, and is
                    provided with furniture and fuel at the expense of the district. The following
                    notices are derived from the Annual Report of the superintendent of common
                    schools, made in January 1835.</p>

                <p>The number of children actually receiving education is one in every 3∙95 of the
                    whole population. Complaints are made by the superintendent of these schools, of
                    the incompetency of teachers, from the smallness of the remuneration which they
                    receive. The rate of wages, however, is regularly advancing, and competition
                    will gradually cure the evil which exists in this tv ell-organized system of
                    education. By a report of the regents of the university, made in 1833, there
                    were in the state of New York sixty-five incorporated academies, which had 4856
                    students. The whole state is divided into eight districts, to each of which are
                    apportioned 1250 dollars out of the income of the literature fund, making a
                    total of 10,000 dollars given annually for the support of these institutions.
                    There are also in New York above twenty Protestant and four Roman Catholic free
                    schools, several infant schools, and a number of female and other seminaries of
                    education supported by private individuals, the enumeration of which would form
                    but a dry catalogue of names.</p>
                <p>There are six colleges in this state, including the University of New York. The
                    following is the return for 1836: University of New York, established in the
                    city of that name, founded in 1831, seventeen instructors, and 226 students;
                    Columbia College, New York (Episcopalian), founded in 1754, eleven instructors,
                    1620 alumni, 100 students, 8000 volumes in the college library, and 6000 volumes
                    in the students’ library; Union College, Schenectady, founded in 1795, ten
                    instructors, 1600 ahιmni, 308 ministers, 268 students, 5350 volumes in the
                    college library, and 8920 in the students’ library; Hamilton College, at
                    Clinton, founded in 1812, seven instructors, 270 alumni, sixty-nine ministers,
                    101 students, 2500 volumes in the college library, and 3700 volumes in the
                    students’ library; Geneva College, at Geneva (Episcopalian), founded in 1823,
                    seven instructors, eighteen alumni, nine ministers, twenty-two students, 820
                    volumes in college library, and 1150 in the students’ library. There is, lastly,
                    the Hamilton Literary and Theological College, which we have already noticed in
                    connection with religious institutions. There are four medical schools, viz. the
                    College of Physicians and Surgeons, at New York, having seven professors, and
                    158 students; the College of Pharmacy, of the city of New York; the College of
                    Physicians and Surgeons, at Fairfield, with five professors, and 190 students;
                    and the Geneva Medical College, at Geneva, having six professors, and
                    sixty-eight students. The other medical institutions are, the Medical Society of
                    the State of New York; the New York State Vaccine Institution; the Kappa Alpha
                    Phi Society; the New York Eye Infirmary; the Albany County Medical Society; the
                    Medical Society of the City and County of New York; besides a Lunatic Asylum,
                    the New York Hospital, and two or three other hospitals and asylums. There
                    appear to be no law schools, but there are the New York Law Student’s
                    Association, instituted in 1833 for purposes of mutual discussion on subjects
                    connected with the legal profession; also the New York Law Institute,
                    established in 1828, for much the same purpose as the preceding, and likewise in
                    order to form a large library of law-books. In 1834 there were 2650 physicians
                    and surgeons, and 2052 attorneys and counsellors in this state.</p>
                <p>There are numerous literary and scientific institutions in New York. The
                    principal public libraries, besides those already mentioned, are, in the city of
                    New York, the New York Society Library, 25,000 volumes; New York Mercantile
                    Library, 11,400 volumes; New York Apprentices’ Library, 10,800 volumes; New York
                    Historical Society Library, 10,000 volumes; New York Law Institute Library, 2100
                    volumes; and the Albany Library, 8000 volumes. The principal institutions are,
                    the New York Historical Society, established in 1809, which, besides its
                    library, has a valuable collection of coins and medals; the New York Athenaeum,
                    established in 1824, for the promotion of science and literature; the Lyceum of
                    Natural History, established in 1818, and which possesses a valuable library and
                    museum of natural history; the New York Literary and Philosophical Society; the
                    American Academy of Fine Arts, established in 1808; the American Lyceum, formed
                    in 1831, for the diffusion of useful knowledge; the National Academy of Design,
                    established in 1826; the Clinton Hall Association, established in 1830, for the
                    cultivation and promotion of literature, science, and the arts; and the New York
                    Sacred Music Society, established in 1823. In the city of Albany, besides the
                    library mentioned, there are, the Albany Institute, established in 1829, the
                    museum of which, besides a considerable library, contains above ten thousand
                    specimens in geology, mineralogy, and botany, with coins, engravings, casts, and
                    other articles of vertù; the Athenaeum, established in 1827, in connection with
                    the Albany Library; and the Northern Institute and Academy of Fine Arts,
                    established in 1831. In the county of Rochester, there are the Rochester
                    Athenaeum, established in 1830, for promoting literature, science, and the arts;
                    the Franklin Institute of Rochester, established in 1830, for the same purposes
                    as the preceding; and the New York State Lyceum, formed at Utica in 1831. The
                    other principal institutions are, the New York Chamber of Commerce; the General
                    Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen of the city of New York; the American
                    Institute of the city of New York, for promoting the interests of agriculture,
                    commerce, manufactures, and the arts; the New York Board of Trade; three
                    Horticultural Societies; the Linnaean Botanic Garden, and other gardens; the New
                    York State Society of the Cincinnati; the Merchants’ Exchange Company, two
                    typographical, and some other associations. There is a law journal published
                    once a month at New York. In the same city there are issued, of literary and
                    miscellaneous journals, two quarterly reviews, one every two months, six
                    monthly, one every fortnight, and two weekly periodicals in English, and two in
                    French, together with a republication of the Edinburgh Review and some of the
                    leading journals of Europe. At Albany there is one magazine, and at Schenectady
                    another. Of religious journals there are thirteen published in the state, mostly
                    at New York, and in general monthly. There are also three or four agricultural,
                    horticultural, and temperance publications; the total number of journals
                    published in 1834 being forty. In 1810 there were only sixty-six newspapers
                    published in New York; in 1834 they had increased to 267, of which number
                    twenty-one were daily papers.</p>
                <p>In each county of this state a jail is established by law. Previously to 1824
                    jails were very badly managed, but an examination which took place during that
                    year led to the formation of the Prison Discipline Society, “an institution,”
                    says the American Almanac for 1836, “which has already <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559374" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9374-0193"/>been productive of the most
                    important and beneficial effects with respect both to the condition and
                    character of the prisoners, and the well-being of society.” All the
                    penitentiaries, with the exception of that at Auburn, were so constructed and
                    managed as to render them only schools of vice and crime; but the object of this
                    society is so to improve prisons in construction and discipline as to produce,
                    as far as possible, the reformation of prisoners. The system adopted is that
                    known by the name of the Auburn plan, and its principal features are, solitary
                    confinement at night and during meals, and combined labour at other hours of the
                    day; religious instruction, particularly on Sunday; and absolute silence amongst
                    the prisoners at all times. The cells are so constructed as to answer the
                    various ends which the society had in view. During the hours of labour the
                    prisoners are employed in workshops, or in the prison yard, in parties of a
                    convenient number each. Attention is paid to health, by the complete ventilation
                    of the small cells, where the prisoners sleep and take their meals; and, to
                    secure the well-working of the system, every violation of the rules laid down is
                    punished by solitude, darkness, or such other infliction as may be found
                    necessary to enforce obedience. The eighth report of the society speaks with
                    confidence of the “favourable moral results ;” and observes, on the whole, in
                    regard to the state prisons, that there is great cause for congratulation and
                    thankfulness. By the same report there are stated to be in prison at Auburn 876
                    individuals; and the balance of profits in favour of the prison, arising from
                    the earnings of the prisoners, is stated at between eight and nine thousand
                    dollars. The Mount Pleasant state prison, Westchester county, is likewise an
                    admirable establishment, and in excellent condition; as is also that at Sing
                    Sing. The mode of supporting the poor, which, in America, has been found most
                    economical, and best calculated to discourage pauperism, is that of maintaining
                    them in county poor-houses. The former law of settlement, and the practice of
                    compulsory removals, have been abrogated, and a simple rule of settlement,
                    founded principally on the residence of the party, and a summary mode of
                    settling disputed questions, substituted in their stead. The following is an
                    abstract taken from Williams’s New York Register for 1834: “Reports have been
                    received from all the organized counties in the state, fifty-five in number. All
                    these counties have erected poor-houses, with the exception of six; and
                    thirty-seven counties have abolished the distinction of town and county poor.
                    The practical operation of our present poor-house system demonstrates
                    satisfactorily, that it has a decided advantage on the score of economy over
                    every other existing mode of supporting indigent persons; and that the expense
                    of the system, in proportion to the number of paupers supported, is regularly
                    diminishing.” The annual expense of supporting each pauper is stated at
                    thirty-two dollars twenty-one cents. The total number of paupers in the state
                    relieved or supported during 1832-33 was 35,777, of whom only 2252 were town
                    paupers. The aggregate expense of relieving and supporting the whole number was
                    295,239T5 dollars. There are attached to the poor-houses in the state 5776 acres
                    of land; and the aggregate value of all the establishments amounts to 865,770
                    dollars, of which the New York city establishment has 248 acres of land, valued
                    at 550,000 dollars. The number of paupers permanently in the poor-houses of the
                    state will be found in the census of the population.</p>
                <p>It is scarcely necessary to state, that mails and stages pass between New York
                    and the large towns of the state, and also of the Union generally. Their number
                    is commensurate with the demands of a large mercantile city, and the wants of
                    civilized life. The lines of packets from the port of New York for foreign parts
                    are numerous, including those to Liverpool, London, Belfast, Havre, Jamaica,
                    Carthagena, and Mexico The principal lines of packets between New York and other
                    ports of the United States comprise those to Charleston, Savannah, New Orleans,
                    Mobile, Apalachicoa, Darien, Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, Boston, New
                    Haven, Salem, and the principal ports to the east. There are lines of
                    packetboats on the Erie Canal, and steam-boats without number plying on all the
                    waters of this state. On the river Hudson, where steam-navigation was first
                    tried, it is common for one steam-boat to tow ten other boats laden with
                    goods.</p>
                <p>By the amended constitution of this state, adopted in the year 1821, the
                    legislative power is vested in a senate consisting of thirty-two members, and a
                    house of representatives consisting of 128 members, all of whom receive three
                    dollars per diem for their services. The senators, who must be freeholders, are
                    elected for four years; but the members of assembly are elected annually. To
                    facilitate elections, the state is divided into eight districts, each of which
                    is entitled to four senators, one of the number being annually appointed in each
                    district. The members of the other house are chosen by the several counties
                    amongst whom they are apportioned, according to a rule prescribed in the
                    constitution. The executive power is vested in a governor, who holds his office
                    for two years. A lieutenant-governor is elected at the same time, and holds his
                    office for the same term of years. He is president of the senate, and officiates
                    as governor when that office becomes vacant. The franchise is exercised by every
                    male citizen twenty-one years of age, who has been for one year resident in the
                    state, and for six months an inhabitant of the county in which he votes. The
                    suffrage is thus very extensive, and the number of electors is accordingly very
                    great. In 1832 the total number of votes for governor, exclusive of scattering
                    votes, was 323,082. Sheriffs, coroners, and county clerks, are elected by the
                    people; but the other civil officers are generally appointed either by the
                    governor and senate, the two branches of the legislature, or the governor alone,
                    excepting clerks of courts, district attorneys, and some other officers, who are
                    appointed by the courts.</p>
                <p>The judicial establishment consists of several courts. That for the trial of
                    impeachments and the correction of errors is composed of the president of the
                    senate, the thirty-two senators, the chancellor, and the justices of the supreme
                    court. It is the court of last resort, deciding upon appeals from the court of
                    chancery, and writs of error from the supreme court, but has no original
                    jurisdiction, excepting in cases of impeachments. Its sessions are held at the
                    Capitol in Albany, or at the City Hall in New York. The next is the court of
                    chancery, the powers of which are vested in the chancellor, and in eight
                    vice-chancellors. I he third is the supreme court, consisting of the chief
                    justice and two associate judges. Lastly, there are eight circuit courts, each
                    consisting of a single judge.</p>
                <p>The circuits correspond, both in territory and in name, with the eight senate
                    districts. Each of the circuit judges possesses the powers of a justice of the
                    supreme court at chambers, in the trial of issues joined in the supreme court,
                    and in courts of oyer and terminer, and jail delivery. There must be held in
                    each year at least two circuit courts, and courts of oyer and terminer, in each
                    county in the state; and in the city of New York at least four. I he courts are
                    held during as many days as the judge thinks necessary. Courts of oyer and
                    terminer, having power to try all crimes and misdemeanours, may be held at the
                    time and place at which any circuit court may have been appointed. 1he governor,
                    with the senate, has the power of issuing commissions of oyer and terminer and
                    jail delivery, when occasion shall require.</p>
                <p>Besides the powers exercised in the courts of law by the circuit judges, each
                    circuit judge (except the judge of <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559387"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9387-0194"/>the first circuit) within the limits of his
                    circuit must be a vice-chancellor, and, concurrently with the chancellor, but
                    exclusively of any other circuit judge, must have and exercise all the original
                    jurisdiction and powers now or hereafter vested in the chancellor, in all causes
                    and matters in equity, where the same shall have arisen within his circuit, or
                    where the subject-matter in controversy is situated within such circuit, or
                    where the defendants, or either of them, reside within the same, but subject to
                    the chancellor s appellate jurisdiction. By an act of the legislature, passed in
                    January 1831, the equity powers of the judge of the first circuit were taken
                    away, and a separate vice-chancellor appointed for the first circuit. The
                    superior court of the city of New York consists of a chief justice and two
                    associates. There are courts of common pleas in each and every county of the
                    state, which may be held (except in the county of New York) by the judges of the
                    county courts of each of the counties in this state, or any three of them. Any
                    three of the judges of the county courts of each of the counties (except New
                    York) have the power to hold courts of general sessions to try all crimes
                    excepting those punishable with death or imprisonment for life. The mayor,
                    recorder, and aidermen, or mayor and recorder jointly, or either of them singly,
                    may, with or without the presence of any of the aldermen, hold mayor’s courts in
                    the cities of Albany, Troy, and Hudson.</p>
                <p>Besides the above, there are certain courts of a peculiar and special
                    jurisdiction. Surrogates’ courts have jurisdiction of testamentary cases, held
                    by the surrogate of each county. Courts of special sessions of the peace may be
                    held in and for the county of New York, by any three judges of the court of
                    common pleas of the said county, of whom the first judge of the said court, the
                    mayor, or recorder, shall always be one; and for the several counties of the
                    state, by three justices of the peace, or by two such justices and one judge of
                    the county courts of such county, for the purposes provided by law. The justices
                    of the marine court in the city of New York are authorized to hold a court
                    therein, called the Marine Court of the city of New York. Each of the assistant
                    justices in the city of New York is required to hold a court in the said city
                    within the ward or wards for which he is appointed. The justices of the
                    justices’ court of the cities of Albany and Hudson are authorized to hold courts
                    therein, called respectively the Justices’ Court of the city of Albany, and the
                    Justices’ Court of the city of Hudson. Justices’ courts in each county are held
                    by a justice of the peace.</p>
                <p>1he constitution of this state has been admirably framed, and not only embodies
                    many of those safeguards usually inserted in bills of rights, but has some
                    provisions of a peculiar character, by which public property and public
                    institutions are secured and protected, scruples of conscience in regard’to
                    bearing arms are obviated, and ministers of the gospel or priests are excluded
                    from all civil and military offices. The common law of England, varied from time
                    to time by numerous acts of the colonial and state legislature, forms the basis
                    of the jurisprudence of New York. Since American independence was established,
                    there have been four revisions of the statute laws of state. The last, which
                    took place in 1827-28, was the most important; and the enactment of this body of
                    statute law, which came into full operation on the 1st of January 1830, is
                    perhaps one of the most important events in the history of American
                    jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>The capital of this state is Albany, but by far the largest and most populous
                    cit∙y is New York, the commercial emporium of the United States. It is situated
                    on New York Island, formerly called Manhattan Island, at the confluence of the
                    Hudson or North River with the strait called the East River, which connects Long
                    Island Sound with the Atlantic Ocean. It is less than twenty miles from the
                    western extremity of Long Island Sound on the northeast, and the Atlantic Ocean
                    on the south. The City Hall is in latitude 40. 42. 40. north, and longitude 74.
                    2. 8. west from Greenwich. The city and county are of the same limits,
                    comprising the whole island, which extends from the battery on the south to
                    Kingsbridge on the north, thirteen miles and a half. The average breadth is a
                    mile, but in one part it is two miles and one third across; and the area of the
                    island is about 14,000 acres. It is separated from the continent on the north by
                    Haerlem River, which is crossed by several bridges; from New Jersey on the west
                    by Hudson’s River; from Long Island on the east by East River; and from Staten
                    Island to the south by the bay or harbour. The island of New York is formed on a
                    bed of rocks, generally primitive granite, with some limestone in the northern
                    section, where there are quarries of white marble. The elevation above tidewater
                    is very considerable throughout the whole extent, in some parts 238 feet. The
                    general slope of the island is from west to east, and an elevated range of
                    ground runs in this direction, which slopes towards the northern and southern
                    parts of the island. This physical feature of the island is considered as of
                    great importance, since it enables water reservoirs to be so located as to
                    command the whole city at an elevated head. The harbour or bay, which is
                    twenty-five miles in circumference, is safe and commodious, and the largest
                    vessels may come up to the very wharfs of the city. On the bar the depth of
                    water at high tide is twenty-seven feet, and at low water twenty-one feet; and
                    thence to the city the channel is from thirty-five to fifty feet deep. There is
                    a lighthouse at Sandy Hook, on the New Jersey shore, eighteen miles distant from
                    the city; and vessels frequently anchor in the outer harbour, or Raritan Bay.
                    The entrance to the harbour is called the Narrows, between Staten Island on the
                    west and Long Island on the east, about eight miles from the city. There is a
                    lighthouse on the western part of the latter island, twenty miles north-east of
                    New York. The harbour is rarely obstructed with ice. The principal commercial
                    business is transacted on the east side of the city, the East River being the
                    most safe and convenient part of the harbour. The width of the East River is
                    from one third to one half of a mile to the opposite shore of Brooklyn, on Long
                    Island. The Hudson, or North River, is one mile in width opposite to Jersey
                    city, and a mile and a half at Hoboken, New Jersey. The approach to New York by
                    sea is one of the most splendid sights of the kind which the world can present.
                    The works of nature are here on the grandest scale, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tout ensemble</hi> of islands, rivers, bays, and forests of masts, with spires
                    towering amongst the trees which shade the streets, constitute a scene as varied
                    and interesting as can be beheld.</p>
                <p>The principal fortifications for the defence of the harbour are at the Narrows,
                    about eight miles from the city. But on the Long Island shore are Forts Hamilton
                    and La Fayette; and opposite them, on Staten Island, are Forts Tomkins and
                    Richmond. There are several small islands in the harbour; and upon those called
                    Bedlow’s and Ellis’s Islands, situated on the western side, there are batteries;
                    whilst Governor’s Island, opposite to the battery, and very near the city, is
                    strongly fortified. The Battery is situated at the south-west extremity of the
                    city, and is handsomely laid out, being intersected with gravel walks, and
                    tastefully decorated with shrubs and trees. Castle Garden, connected with the
                    Battery by a bridge, is a fine promenade, and is much frequented during the
                    summer. A telegraph is established on the heights of Staten Island,
                    communicating by signals with one in the city. A panorama of New York presents
                    the compact part of the city occupying the southern part of the island, and
                    stretching along each river about three miles. It is, generally speaking,
                    regularly built, the <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559400"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-9400-0195"/>principal streets running north and south, and
                    being crossed by others extending from the river on the east to that on the
                    west. Great improvements have been made on the compact part of the city within
                    the last ten or twelve years, the clumsy fabrics of the Dutch having given place
                    to the more tasteful and convenient erections of modern times. The style of
                    building with granite and marble fronts to the basements is now almost uniformly
                    adopted in the construction of warehouses. The northern part of the city has
                    been very handsomely laid out in wide streets and spacious avenues; and the
                    style of building for dwelling-houses is neat, and frequently elegant.</p>
                <p>Broadway, the most splendid street in the city, or in the United States, runs
                    through the centre, and extends three miles in length from north to south,
                    terminating at the Battery. It is eighty feet wide, and generally presents
                    massive and noble buildings, including three fine churches, several large
                    hotels, Washington Hall, the Masonic Hall, with a variety of elegant shops. From
                    this street there is a gentle slope east and west to the rivers. The following
                    is a summary of the principal streets in this city, from a work entitled New
                    York as it is in 1833.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    “Greenwich Street is wide and elegant, and runs parallel with Broadway, between
                    that street and Washington Street, which last is a fine avenue, next to West
                    Street, extending along the North River. Pearl Street, between Broadway and the
                    East River, is above a mile in length, and its course is nearly in the form of a
                    crescent, containing numerous spacious warehouses, and is the principal seat of
                    the dry goods and hardware business. Front and Water Streets, between Pearl
                    Street and the East River, are occupied principally by the wholesale grocers,
                    commission merchants, and mechanics connected with the shipping business. South
                    Street, running along the East River, contains the warehouses and offices of
                    most of the principal shipping merchants. Wall Street runs from Broadway to the
                    East River, and is occupied by the banks, insurance companies, merchants’
                    exchange,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This, along
                    with a considerable portion of the city of New York, was consumed by fire on the
                    16th and 17th days of December 1835. The following account of this destructive
                    conflagration is from the American Almanac for 1837 ≈—“Sixteenth. A tremendous
                    fire breaks out in the city of New York, at nine o'clock in the evening, and is
                    not fully suppressed till one o’clock p. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.</hi> on the

                    the greatest mercantile transactions of the city, although comparatively but
                    little inhabited. It was the most destructive fire that has ever taken place in
                    the United States. The loss, according to the official report of the committee,
                    amounted to 17,115,692 dollars. The merchandise destroyed was estimated at
                    13,115,692 dollars; the buildings, the number of which was 529, at 4,000,000
                    dollars. The Merchants’ Exchange, a magnificent edifice of marble, was estimated
                    at 150,000 dollars, and the Garden Street Church at 50,000 dollars.” The places
                    of the destroyed edifices have been supplied with buildings of the same
                    description, with a rapidity quite unparalleled in any other country. In March
                    1836, Congress passed a bill for the relief of the sufferers; but no aid was
                    solicited from abroad.</p></note> newspapers, and brokers’ offices, being the
                    seat of heavier monied transactions than any other place in America. Canal
                    Street, running across Broadway to the Hudson River, near the centre of the
                    city, is a spacious street, principally occupied by retail stores. The Bowery is
                    a wide and extensive street, running directly north and south-east of Broadway.
                    The third avenue, extending from the Bowery to Haerlem, is macadamised, and is
                    the principal avenue to the city from the east. Chatham Street, East Broadway,
                    Nassau Street, Maiden Lane, Broad, Fulton, Cortland, William, Hudson, Division,
                    Grand, and Broome Streets, deserve particular notice, as among the principal
                    streets and avenues. The streets are generally well paved, with stone or brick
                    side walks, and lighted at night.”</p>
                <p>In enumerating the public buildings, the first place belongs to the City Hall,
                    which is the most prominent and important edifice in New York. It is situated in
                    the Park, about half a mile from the Battery, and is 216 feet in length by 105
                    in breadth, and, including the attic story, sixty feet in height. The front and
                    ends are built of white marble, behind it is of free-stone, and it consists of a
                    centre building and two wings, principally of the Ionic and Corinthian orders.
                    The <hi rend="italic">tout ensemble</hi> is elegant, if not splendid, and the
                    edifice reflects great credit on the inhabitants for their munificence and
                    taste. It was commenced in 1803, and finished in 1812, at a cost of 538,734
                    dollars. It consists of the City Hall proper, comprising a large suite of rooms
                    for holding the different courts of law, and which are fitted up in a rich and
                    expensive style; and of the new City Hall, which includes the police office, and
                    a number of offices and rooms adapted to various necessary purposes. Many of the
                    churches are in general large, but there is nothing in their architecture, or
                    that of the steeples, particularly requiring notice. There are above one hundred
                    places of worship in New York, which is about the same proportion to the number
                    of inhabitants that we find in Great Britain. Columbia College, above the City
                    Hall, is advantageously and handsomely situated in a fine square. The edifice
                    and grounds attached are extensive, and it possesses an estate valued at 400,000
                    dollars. The college contains a chapel, lecture rooms, hall, library, museum,
                    and an extensive philosophical and astronomical apparatus. The standard of
                    classical education is supposed to be higher here than in most of the other
                    colleges of the Union. The University of the city of New York is projected on
                    the broad and liberal scale of the universities on the continent of Europe, and
                    promises to be of great advantage to the literature of the country. It is
                    governed by a council of thirty-two members, chosen by the subscribers, together
                    with the mayor and four members of the common council of the city. The New York
                    Institution is a brick building, 260 feet in length by forty-four in breadth,
                    and is appropriated to associations of literature and the fine arts, such as the
                    Literary and Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Fine Arts, and the
                    like. The State-prison and the Lunatic Asylum are large edifices, built of
                    stone. The Alms-house and the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb are also buildings of
                    ample dimensions, built of brick. The Park Theatre is a spacious edifice, eighty
                    feet long, 165 feet deep, and fifty-five feet high, and is calculated to contain
                    2400 persons. The New York Theatre, in the Bowery, displays much architectural
                    beauty, and amongst the modern ornaments of the city stands pre-eminent. It has
                    a front of seventy-five feet, and is 175 feet deep and fifty feet high. Besides
                    these, there are other theatres and places of public amusement in New York. The
                    Medical College is a conspicuous edifice; and the following are spacious
                    buildings: Clinton Hall, the Bible Society’s Depository, the American Tract
                    Society’s buildings, the Arcade and the Arcade Baths, the New York Baths, the
                    Public Marine Bath, the Manhattan Water-works, the Exhibition Room of the
                    National Academy of the Arts of Design, Rutger’s Medical College and Public
                    School, Masonic Hall, Orphan Asylum, Fever Hospital, House of Refuge for
                    Juvenile Delinquents, the City Hotel, the Mansion House, the National Hotel, the
                    Franklin House, Tammany Hotel, and several other hotels. The markets, banks,
                    insurance offices, school-houses, and buildings for public institutions of all
                    kinds, are quite as numerous as in British cities, the difference of population
                    being taken into account. A number of squares have been laid out in the upper
                    part of the city, the principal of which is Washington Square: Hudson’s Square
                    or St John’s <pb break="no" facs="nls:194559413" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9413-0196"
                    />Park is part of the extensive tract of land, in the northwestern part of the
                    city, belonging to Trinity Church. It comprises an area of four acres, and the
                    square is enclosed with costly and valuable private dwellings, having St John’s
                    Church on its western side. Amongst the places of fashionable resort in the city
                    and its vicinity may be mentioned the Battery, which extends somewhat in the
                    form of a crescent along the southern extremity of the city, and covers an area
                    of nearly eleven acres. This favourite promenade was originally a fortification
                    thrown up by the Dutch, and planted with cannon, from which circumstance it
                    derives its name. But it is now divested of its warlike appurtenances, having
                    for many years been used as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> public walk; and being
                    shaded with trees, and constantly fanned by the ocean breezes, there is not a
                    more agreeable or healthful retreat during the summer months. In or near the
                    city there are a number of parks and public gardens, which are also much
                    frequented. With regard to the buildings of New York in general, Mr Stewart
                    observes,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Three Years in
                    North America, by James Stuart, Esq. 1833.</p></note> “The churches, at least
                    many of them, are large, but there is nothing in their architecture, or that of
                    the steeples, particularly requiring notice. There is no building here to bear
                    any thing like a comparison with many of the public buildings in the European
                    capitals, such as St Martin’s Church in London, the front of the Register Office
                    in Edinburgh, or that of the Chamber of Deputies at Paris; but there are
                    churches and public buildings in all those cities quite as deficient in good
                    taste as any of those which I observed here. In short, my notion is, that,
                    though there is no very fine building in the city, there is not much to hurt the
                    eye of the fastidious; and the city is generally composed of clean-looking
                    buildings and streets, and is regularly built.” New York is divided into fifteen
                    wards, each ward electing annually an alderman and an assistant alderman, two
                    assessors, one collector, and two constables, who are formed into <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> common council of two boards. The mayor is elected annually
                    by the joint ballot of both boards. The situation of the city is considered as
                    very favourable to the health of the inhabitants, from the elevation of the
                    island, and the vicinity of the ocean. The climate at most seasons is mild and
                    agreeable, the winters being less severe than in the interior of the state, and
                    the sea-breezes rendering the heat of summer less oppressive.</p>
                <p>The religious, benevolent, and other institutions, the banks, insurance offices,
                    and miscellaneous companies, the state of the press, literature, religion, and
                    education, the manufactures, trade, commerce, lines of packets, and stages, of
                    New York, have been already enumerated in the general account of the state, as
                    fully as our limits will permit. There is no city in the United States, perhaps
                    in the world, which possesses greater advantages of situation than New York,
                    both for internal and external commerce; and these have been immensely increased
                    by art. It is hither that merchants and traders resort from all quarters, from
                    the shores of the Atlantic, the confines of the lakes, and the banks of the
                    great Mississippi, with a certainty that they can dispose of their own produce,
                    and supply themselves with every article which they require. It is at this point
                    that the vast stream of immigration at first collects, as in a reservoir, whence
                    in course of time it distributes its contents over the whole country. Here, too,
                    strangers and travellers congregate as the place of departure to every part of
                    the world, attracted by the ample facilities afforded them at fixed and short
                    intervals. It may serve to give some idea of these to state, that there are
                    opportunities, by regular packets, to sail to Liverpool four times a month, to
                    Havre three times, and to London twice a month. The advantageous situation of
                    this city naturally inclines the inhabitants to commercial pursuits; but of late
                    years large capitals have been invested in manufactures, which are becoming more
                    and more objects of attention. But the probability is, that New York will long
                    remain, in a great degree, a central point for the commerce of the United
                    States. The numerous failures which occurred in America during 1837 have of
                    course affected New York; but this is not the place to speculate on the causes
                    and consequences of these casualties. One thing seems perfectly clear, that the
                    natural resources and advantages of the United States are too vast ever to be
                    permanently affected by the state of trade in any other country, at least for
                    ages to come. The population of New York, and the principal cities in the state,
                    for three periods, are as under.</p>

                <p>Albany, the political metropolis, is situated on the western bank of the Hudson,
                    150 miles from New York, and has a position equally convenient for communication
                    with that city and with a vast interior country. The appearance of Albany from
                    the opposite side of the river is striking and splendid; its situation on the
                    side of a hill is favourable for every part of it being seen, and the Capitol
                    and public edifices are conspicuous objects. It consists of one street of very
                    considerable length, running parallel with the river, from which the rest of the
                    city rises abruptly. The Capitol, built upon the upper portion of Albany, on an
                    elevated site, is 115 feet in length by ninety-eight in breadth. There are ten
                    or twelve other public buildings, some of which are very handsome. This city is
                    very rapidly increasing, as the population returns sufficiently indicate. The
                    other towns enumerated in the foregoing list are also places of considerable and
                    growing trade.</p>
                <p>The history of New York is so closely interwoven with that of the United States
                    generally, and the latter part of it in particular with the war of independence,
                    and the subsequent consolidation of the country as a federal republic, that it
                    is only necessary in this place to give a brief abstract of its early annals.
                    That part of America to which New York belongs was discovered by Sebastian Cabot
                    in the year 1497. He claimed the country for his sovereign, but made no effort
                    to form settlements; nor was an undertaking of this kind attempted by the
                    English until after the Dutch had colonized a portion of the country. It is
                    certain that, in 1609, Henry Hudson, an Englishman, entered the bay of New York,
                    and sailed up the river now called by his name, as far as latitude 43° north;
                    but whether he was employed by the English government in this service, and sold
                    the country which he thus discovered without authority, is a point not so
                    clearly settled. English writers take this view of the case; but the Dutch
                    historians assert that he was at the time in the service of the Dutch East India
                    Company. At all events, the English for some time made no opposition to the
                    settlement of the country by the Dutch, who immediately commenced <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559426" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9426-0197"/>a trade with the natives of
                    the country. The right of the English to the territory, however, was formally
                    recognised, by the Dutch applying for and receiving from James I. in 1620,
                    permission “to build some cottages on Hudson’s River, for the convenience of
                    their vessels engaged in trade with Brazil.” To the colony which they settled
                    under this license they gave the name of the New Netherlands. Buildings were
                    erected in the following year near the junction of the East and North Rivers,
                    and a governor was appointed by the Dutch in 1629. Complaints were made by
                    Charles I. of the encroachments of the Dutch on New England, and the
                    states-general declared, that the settlement of New Netherlands was “only a
                    private undertaking of the West India Company of Amsterdam.” In 1664, Charles
                    II. granted to his brother, James duke of York, “all Mattawacks, now Long
                    Island, all Hudson’s River, and all the lands from the west side of Connecticut
                    River to the east side of Delaware Bay, together with the royalties and rights
                    of government.” James sold that part of the grant which comprehends New Jersey,
                    and retained the remainder, which comprehends the present state of New York, a
                    name bestowed upon it in honour of the proprietor. The states-general guaranteed
                    the possession to him by the treaty of Breda in 1667. Previously to these
                    transactions, however, the parties themselves had been settling the point of
                    possession in the disputed territory itself. In 1664 the New Netherlands was
                    taken by the English; in 1673 it was retaken by the Dutch; and in 1674 it again
                    fell under the power of the English, to which it remained attached until the
                    time of the revolution. The remaining portion of the history of New York belongs
                    to that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">United States. (r. r. r.)</hi></p>
