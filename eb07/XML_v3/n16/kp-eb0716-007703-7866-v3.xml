                    negation. Thus we say negative quantities, negative powers, negative signs, and
                    the like.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Negative Sign.</hi> The use of the negative sign, in
                    algebra, is attended with several consequences which at first are admitted with
                    difficulty, and has sometimes given occasion to notions which appear to have no
                    real foundation. This sign implies, that the real value of the quantity
                    represented by the letter to which it is prefixed is to be subtracted; and it
                    serves, with the positive sign, to keep in view what elements or parts enter
                    into the composition of quantities, and in what manner, whether as increments or
                    decrements, that is, whether by addition or subtraction. It serves therefore to
                    express a quantity of an opposite quality to the positive, as a line in a
                    contrary position, a motion with an opposite direction, or a centrifugal force
                    in opposition to gravity; and thus often saves the trouble of distinguishing and
                    demonstrating separately the various cases of proportions, and preserves in view
                    their analogy. But as the proportions of lines depend on their magnitude only,
                    without regard to their position, and motions and forces are said to be equal or
                    unequal, in any given ratio, without regard to their directions; and, in
                    general, the proportion of quantity relates to their magnitude only, without
                    determining whether they are to be considered as increments or decrements; so
                    there is no ground to imagine any other proportion of — <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    and + <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (or of — 1 and 1) than that of the real magnitude
                    of the quantities represented by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> whether these quantities are, in any particular case, to be added or
                    subtracted. It is the same thing to subtract the decrement as to add an equal
                    increment, or to subtract — <hi rend="italic">b</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi> as to add to it + <hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> And because multiplying a quantity by a negative number
                    implies only a repeated subtraction of it, the multiplying — <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> by — <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is subtracting — <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    as often as there are units in <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and is therefore equivalent to adding + <hi rend="italic">b</hi> so many times,
                    or the same as adding + <hi rend="italic">nb.</hi> But if we infer from this,
                    that 1 is to — <hi rend="italic">n</hi> as — &amp; to <hi rend="italic">nb,</hi>
                    according to the rule, that unit is to one of the factors as the other factor is
                    to the product, there is no ground to imagine that there is any mystery in this,
                    or any other meaning than that the real magnitudes represented by 1, <hi
                    rend="italic">n, b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ηb</hi> are proportional. For
                    that rule relates only to the magnitude of the factors and product, without
                    determining whether any factor, or the product, is to be addpd or subtracted.
                    But this must likewise be determined in algebraic computations; and such is the
                    proper use of the rules concerning the signs, without which the operation could
                    not proceed. Because a quantity to be subtracted is never produced in
                    composition by any repeated addition of a positive, or repeated subtraction of a
                    negative, a negative square number is never produced by composition from the
                    root. Hence √ — 1, or the square root of a negative, implies an imaginary
                    quantity; and, in resolution, it is a mark or character of the impossible cases
                    of a problem, unless it is compensated by another imaginary symbol or
                    supposition, when the whole expression may have a real signification. Thus 1 + √
                    — 1, and 1 — √ — 1, taken separately, are imaginary, buttheir sum is 2; as the
                    conditions that would separately render the solution of a problem impossible, in
                    some cases destroy each other’s effect when conjoined. In the pursuit of general
                    conclusions, and of simple forms representing them, expressions of this kind
                    must sometimes arise where the imaginary symbol is compensated in a manner that
                    is not always so obvious.</p>
                <p>By proper substitutions, however, the expression may be transformed into another,
                    in which each particular term may have a real signification as well as the whole
                    expression. The theorems which are sometimes briefly discovered by the use of
                    this symbol may be demonstrated without it by the inverse operation, or in some
                    other way; and though such symbols are of some use in the computations by the
                    method of fluxions, their evidence cannot be said to depend upon arts of this
                    kind.</p>
