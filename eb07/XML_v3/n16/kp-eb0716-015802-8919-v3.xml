                <p><label type="entry">NEWFOUNDLAND</label>, an island in the North Atlantic Ocean,
                    lying on the north-eastern side of the Gulf of St Lawrence, between the
                    parallels of 46. 40. and 51. 31. north latitude, and the meridians of 52. 44.
                    and 59. 31. longitude west of Greenwich. It is separated on the northwest from
                    Canada by the Gulf of St Lawrence; on the north and north-cast it is divided
                    from the coast of Labrador by the strait of Belleisle, which is about fifty
                    miles long by twelve broad; on the south-west it approaches Cape Breton, so as
                    to form the main entrance from the Atlantic Ocean into the gulf; and along the
                    whole of its eastern side extends the Atlantic Ocean. Its form is somewhat
                    triangular, but without any approach to regularity, being on all sides, at very
                    short intervals, indented by broad and deeps bays, creeks, harbours, caves, and
                    estuaries. In this respect its shores resemble those of Nova Scotia, and the
                    serrated appearance which they have on maps is attributable to the same cause. A
                    vast and uninterrupted body of water impelled by the trade-wind from the coast
                    of Africa to the American continent strikes this part of it with tremendous
                    violence, and working away the softer strata, forms those numerous arms and
                    inlets of the sea which we have mentioned. The same powerful agent, combined
                    with the influence of the Atlantic Ocean, has produced the same effect upon
                    other parts of the coast besides those exposed to its first attack. The coast
                    outline, the only part of Newfoundland which has been satisfactorily explored,
                    is rock, girt all round with abrupt fissures, and having some lofty headlands on
                    the south-west side. Its width, at the broadest part, between Cape Ray and Cape
                    Bonavista, is about 300 miles; its extreme length, measured on a curve from Cape
                    Race to Griquet Bay, is about 419 miles; and, exclusively of the bendings and
                    inferior inflections of the coast, its circumference maybe estimated at about
                    1000 miles, the whole comprehending an area of 36,000 square miles.</p>
                <p>This vast island reposes upon an immense bank, a succession of which has been
                    observed all the way to Nova Scotia. It is apparently a mass of solid rock,
                    having a very wild and rugged appearance from the sea, and being any thing but
                    inviting. On its south-eastern quarter Newfoundland is formed into a peninsula
                    of twenty-six leagues in length by from five to twenty leagues in breadth, the
                    isthmus which unites it with the main land being not more than four miles in
                    breadth. This peninsula is called Avalon. To the north of it, and on the eastern
                    side of the island, lies Trinity Bay, which is separated from that of Bonavista
                    by a narrow neck of land, the point of which is Cape Bonavista. A long neck of
                    land also divides Trinity Bay from Conception Bay on the northern side of
                    Avalon. I his bay ranks as the first district in Newfoundland, as well on
                    account of the spirit and enterprise of the inhabitants who people its shores,
                    as from its natural advantages of large harbours, coves, and the like. The
                    scenery on this part of the coast is majestic, wild, and calculated to strike
                    the beholder with awe. On the eastern side of Conception Bay are several
                    islands, one of which is Bell Isle, so called from the shape of a remarkable
                    rock close to its western side. This island is about six miles in length, and
                    extremely fertile. Seven leagues distant from Cape St Francis, the eastern
                    boundary of Conception, are the bay and harbour of St John’s, the capital of
                    Newfoundland. A succession of bays indent the coast all round the peninsula of
                    Avalon, the principal of which are, Trepas-sey Bay, which has a large secure
                    harbour and excellent anchorage, with a considerable fishery carried on in the
                    coves and creeks; and Placentia Bay, which is about sixty miles deep and
                    forty-five broad, lying between Cape St Mary and Cape Rouge, which are fifteen
                    leagues apart. It is very spacious, with several rugged islands near its head.
                    The port and town of Placentia lie on the eastern side, as well as the chief
                    harbour, which, although it can only be entered by one vessel at a time, affords
                    anchorage for one hundred and fifty. Placentia Bay contains several other
                    harbours. It is separated from Fortune Bay by one of those long and narrow necks
                    of land which are so common in the island. Fortune Bay is from sixty to seventy
                    miles deep, and from twenty to thirty miles broad, receiving many rivers from
                    the island lakes, and containing numerous harbours, the principal of which is
                    Fortune Harbour on the eastern side. St Pierre and Miquelon Islets are situated
                    at the mouth of Fortune Bay. They were ceded to France in the year 1814, and the
                    former contains a harbour which is the rendezvous of the French shipping, and
                    the residence of the governor. From this point, all along the south side of
                    Newfoundland to Cape Ray, which forms the northeast entrance of the Gulf of St
                    Lawrence, there are numerous bays, but none of sufficient size or importance to
                    require particular description. On the western side, formed by Cape Anguille and
                    Cape St George, is the Bay of St <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558932"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8932-0159"/>George, a large and deep inlet of the sea, into
                    which several rivers emerging from lakes in the interior empty themselves.
                    Further to the north is the Bay of Islands, formed by three arms, through which
                    several rivers discharge their waters. One of these, called the Humber, is the
                    most considerable yet discovered, its course having been traced for one hundred
                    and fourteen miles to the north-westward, where it issues from a cape <hi
                    rend="italic">of ten</hi> leagues in length. As its name would indicate, this
                    bay contains a number of islands, but none of any particular consequence. The
                    next large indentation of the sea on the western side of Newfoundland is Bonne
                    Bay, which has also rivers communicating with the lakes inland to Point Rich.
                    The next bay is called Ingornachoix Bay, which contains two harbours; and to the
                    north of it is St John’s Bay, which receives the waters of Castor’s River. Along
                    the straits of Belleisle, which separate Newfoundland from the coast of
                    Labrador, are a few inconsiderable inlets; but beyond Cape Norman, the
                    north-west point of the island, is a large bay called Pistolet Bay, bounded by
                    Cape Barut. On the northern extremity <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Newfoundland are
                    Griquet Bay and Hare Bay, a deep gulf, the bottom of which intersects the island
                    for two thirds of its breadth at this point, branching off into innumerable bays
                    and coves, sheltered by lofty hills. From this haven to White Bay, a very large
                    inlet of the sea, on the eastern side <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the island, and
                    thence to Cape St John, the coast is indented at short distances by commodious
                    and much-frequented harbours. The Bay of Notre Dame and the Bay <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Exploits are of great extent, and contain a vast number of
                    islands, together with a thriving settlement called Twilingate. The river
                    Exploits is about seventy miles long, but its navigation is obstructed by
                    rapids, some of which have a velocity of nearly ten miles an hour. This river
                    connects the Red Indian Lake, a large sheet of water in the interior, with the
                    Atlantic. Gander Bay is much of the same description; and all have important
                    salmon fisheries. From Cape St John to Cape Freels the coast is a continuation
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ledges, shallows, islands, and rocks, but affords
                    excellent fishing grounds. Bonavista Bay contains several islands, and is itself
                    indented by a number of small inlets and harbours. To the south of it is
                    Catalina Bay, containing Ragged Harbour, which concludes the circuit of the
                    island.</p>
                <p>After the exterior aspect of Newfoundland has been described, the interior comes
                    naturally to be noticed. But this has been very imperfectly explored, and
                    therefore is but little known. In 1823, a Mr M‘Cormack succeeded in traversing
                    its breadth from Conception Bay on the east to St George’s Bay on the west; and
                    from his account it appears, that this portion of it at least is much
                    intersected with lakes and rivers, but poorly wooded, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> a rocky and barren soil. In this respect the island differs greatly
                    from the other North American colonies, producing little timber but what is
                    dwarf and stunted, except on the margins of bays and rivers, where spruce,
                    birch, and poplar sometimes grow to a considerable size. Several high hills,
                    supposed to be situated near the centre of the island, can be discerned from the
                    sea; but the inland country is represented as generally level, so that lakes,
                    rocks, marshes, and extensive alluvial savannahs or plains, with occasional
                    elevations, constitute its characteristic features. The geology of Newfoundland
                    is nearly the same as that of the coast of Labrador. The island, it appears,
                    abounds with minerals of various sorts. Coal and lime have been wrought in more
                    than one part with some success; and there is little doubt as to the existence
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> copper, iron, and other mines, but it is not likely
                    that they are very productive. There are excellent gypsum quarries near Cape
                    Ray, and there is also a quantity of the mineral called marcasite, copperas
                    stone, and horse gold, which the early discoverers mistook for the genuine
                    metal. With regard to the productions of the island, Mr Bouchette observes:<note

                    in North America, vol. ii. pp. 187, 188-</p></note><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">At</hi> the heads of the bays, and along the rivérs, there are
                    many tracts of land formed of deposits washed from the hills; the soil of which
                    tracts is of much the same quality as that of the savannahs in the interior of
                    America. These lands might be converted into excellent meadows, and if drained
                    to carry off the water which covers them after the snows dissolve, they would
                    yield excellent barley and oats. The rich pasturage which the island affords
                    adapts it in an eminent degree to the breeding and raising of cattle and sheep,
                    insomuch as to authorize the belief that it might produce a sufficient quantity
                    of beef to supply its fisheries. Firs of various sorts, poplars, birches, and a
                    few maple trees, are found in Newfoundland, with a variety of shrubs. Most of
                    the English common fruits arrive at perfection, and various grasses grow
                    spontaneously in all the plains. The wild animals are nearly the same as those
                    of Prince Edward Island, and indeed of our other American colonies. The
                    Newfoundland dog is an animal whose peculiarities and virtues are too well known
                    to need any detail in this place; it is, however, generally considered that the
                    true original breed exists now only on the coast of Labrador.</p>
                <p>“The climate is severe, and the winter long; but it has generally been
                    represented more unfavourable than strict truth will warrant. The excess of
                    humidity and constant visitation of dense fogs, which have been commonly
                    ascribed to these coasts, is by no means a continual visitation. The sea-winds
                    often bring a considerable quantity of vapour to the southern and eastern
                    coasts; but it is only when the wind blows from the sea that this inconvenience
                    is felt. The range of the thermometer is nearly the same as in Canada, but as
                    the length of the island extends over nearly five degrees of latitude, it will
                    of course vary. The harbours on the Atlantic shore are generally freed from
                    their icy bonds earlier than any other within the Gulf of St Lawrence, and the
                    western shore is seldom visited by fogs. The heat of the summer is sometimes
                    oppressive in the day-time, but the mornings and evenings, as in almost all
                    insular situations, are temperate and agreeable. The breaking up of the winter,
                    when the vast shoals <hi rend="italic">of</hi> ice formed in the northern
                    regions are driven along the coast by the winds, is the most disagreeable time
                    of the year. The inhabitants, however, maintain excellent health, and,
                    notwithstanding the exposure and hardships of a fisherman’s life, frequently
                    attain <hi rend="italic">a</hi> remarkable longevity.”</p>
                <p>The most remarkable feature connected with Newfoundland is the fogs above alluded
                    to. Those of the Gulf of St Lawrence are attributed to the coldness of the
                    gulf-waters, which is supposed to be permanent a few feet below the surface, as
                    well as at great depths. This cold water is brought to the surface by winds,
                    and, reducing the temperature of the air below the dew point, forms vapour. The
                    fogs on the banks of Newfoundland are also, in all likelihood, caused by cold
                    currents of water being brought to the surface. On the great bank the surface of
                    the water is many degrees colder than it is in the neighbouring sea, and much
                    less than that of the gulf-stream, which is within a short distance of it.</p>
                <p>The most valuable vegetable productions <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the island are
                    potatoes and cabbages; and next to these turnips, carrots, parsnips, pease,
                    radishes, and most garden roots, yield the most abundant crops. Besides the
                    great staple of the island, fish, the numerous large and small sheets of water
                    abound in divers kinds of excellent trout and eels of a great size, and
                    lobsters, lance, herrings, mackerel, salmon, are in great abundance; plaice,
                    sole, hallibut, and thornback, are <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558945"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-8945-0160"/>likewise found on the coast. The capelin arrives
                    periodically in such immense shoals as to change the colour of the sea. Herrings
                    likewise arrive during spring and autumn in prodigious numbers. As a product of
                    the coast may be mentioned kelp, which, with other sea-weed, is used as
                    manure.</p>
                <p>The importance of this colony has exclusively arisen from its fisheries. The
                    different settlements amount to between sixty and seventy in number, and are
                    scattered on the shores of the eastern and southern sides of the island, but
                    principally on the former. There are, indeed, some inhabitants on the western
                    shore, near its southern extremity; but they do notextend to the northward of St
                    George’s Bay, although the vicinity of that bay has proved extremely fertile.
                    The settlements are generally formed at the heads of the bays, particularly
                    Conception Bay, thence to St John’s, and southward to Cape Race. The principal
                    are, besides St John’s, the Bay of Bulls, Brigus, Cape Broyle Harbour,
                    Ferryland, Fermore, and Renowes. St John’s, the capital of the island, is a
                    place of considerable strength, situated about seventy miles to the north of
                    Cape Race, and about one hundred and twenty south of Twilingate Island in the
                    Bay of Exploits, which is the most northerly settlement, latitude 47. 35. north,
                    longitude 52. 48. west. The harbour is one of the best in Newfoundland, being
                    formed between two mountains, the eastern points of which leave an entrance,
                    called the Narrows. This is the only assailable part, but it is so well
                    defended, that any vessel attempting to force an entrance would inevitably be
                    destroyed. There are about twelve fathoms of water in the middle of the channel,
                    with tolerably good anchorage ground. The most lofty perpendicular precipices
                    rise to an amazing height upon the north side, and the southern shore appears
                    less striking in its altitude, only from a comparison with the opposite rocks.
                    There is a light shown every night on the left side of the entrance, where there
                    are also a small battery and a signal-post. Other batteries of greater strength
                    appear towering above the rocky eminences towards the north. At about two thirds
                    of the distance between the entrance and what may properly be termed the harbour
                    itself, there is a dangerous shelf called the Pancake, opposite the chain rock,
                    so called from a chain which extends across the strait at that place, to prevent
                    the admission of any hostile fleet. There are other fortifications besides those
                    already noticed, planted upon the heights around the town, so as to render St
                    John’s perfectly secure against any sudden attack. Fort Townshend is situated
                    immediately over the town, and is the usual residence of the governor. Forts
                    Amherst and William are more to the north; and there is also a small battery
                    perched on the top of a single pyramidal mount, called the Crow’s Nest. The town
                    itself forms one long straggling street, extending nearly parallel to the shore
                    on the north side of the port, from which branch out several narrow lines of
                    houses, that can only be called lanes. The houses are chiefly built of wood,
                    although diversified by some of brick and a few of stone; but they are most
                    irregularly placed, in consequence of an act of the British legislature, passed
                    in 1820, after the great fires, which directs, that where the houses are built
                    of stone, the street shall be forty feet in width, and where of wood, fifty; so
                    that all the stone houses project ten feet into the street. The principal
                    feature of the town consists in its multitude of wharfs and fishing stages,
                    which entirely line the shore. The government wharf is a fine broad quay, open
                    to the accommodation of the public. The roadway of the main street is very
                    rugged and irregular, and the general appearance of the town indicates exactly
                    what it is, viz. a fishing station. St John’s has repeatedly and severely
                    suffered from fires. In 1815, a great amount of property was destroyed by a
                    visitation of this sort, which was repeated in November 1817, with increased
                    severity, property to the amount of L.500,000 having been destroyed. Within a
                    few days afterwards, another conflagration consumed nearly all of the town that
                    had been left by the former one; and in August of the same year a fourth
                    calamity nearly completed its destruction. There are places of public worship of
                    various denominations at St John’s, two school-houses, and a book society; and
                    five newspapers are also published. The population of the town is constantly
                    fluctuating. At the height of the fishing season it is perfectly crowded, but
                    the greater part of these are strangers, who return with their vessels to
                    Europe. The resident population may be estimated at 11,000. The society of this
                    town has for some years rapidly advanced in respectability and civilization;
                    partly on account of several merchants deeply engaged in trade having settled
                    here, and many of the industrious inhabitants having raised themselves to
                    comparative opulence; and partly owing to the administration of justice having
                    been placed upon a more permanent footing than formerly. The settlements extend
                    almost continuously along the southern shore, as far as Fortune Bay; and at most
                    of the harbours there are places of public worship. The establishment at St
                    George’s Bay is perhaps more agricultural than any other on the island; but
                    Conception Bay, being the most populous, requires more particular notice.
                    “Harbour Grace is a good port,” says Captain Robinson; “and the town is
                    considerable, and of a respectable appearance. Conception Bay, in which it is
                    situate, is the richest and most populous country district in Newfoundland,
                    containing altogether about 14,600 inhabitants, a large proportion of the 86,000
                    which the most recent census (1820) gave for the whole population of the island.
                    They are distributed in a number of small towns, or fishing and agricultural
                    hamlets; near another of which, Port Grace, a remarkable basin is hollowed out
                    in the cliffs by the action of frost, or the more certain operation of time, in
                    the decaying slate clay of which the rocks are composed. First an arch is
                    entered twenty feet wide by twenty feet high, and beyond is the basin itself,
                    which is about 300 feet in circumference, and surrounded by perpendicular rocks
                    120 feet in height, with a border of dwarf spruce at top. At one corner, a
                    little exit among broken masses of rock carries off the superfluous water; the
                    depth near the centre of the cavity is about fourteen feet.” On leaving the
                    harbour, the same writer observes: “The harbour is good; and though the space
                    between the end of the bar and the north shore is rather narrow, a large ship,
                    well handled, may beat through, or back and fill in and out, with the tide.”</p>
                <p>Near the extremity of Port Grace Harbour are the remains of a supposed ancient
                    colony, which some have attributed to the Danes or Icelanders; a sea-king of the
                    latter people having, according to tradition, been driven by stress of weather
                    upon this part of the coast about the year 1000. The ruins were discovered by a
                    party of settlers, who, proceeding up a river which falls into Conception Bay,
                    observed, at the distance of six or seven miles above the bay, the appearance of
                    stone walls rising just above the surface. “On removing the sand and alluvial
                    earth, they ascertained these to be the remains of ancient buildings, with oak
                    beams, and mill-stones sunk in oaken beds. Enclosures resembling gardens were
                    also traced out, and plants of various kinds were found growing about the place,
                    not indigenous to the island; but the most decisive proof of these ruins being
                    the remains of an ancient European colony, was drawn from the different kinds of
                    coins found about them, some of Dutch gold, which the inhabitants considered to
                    be old Flemish coins; others of copper without inscriptions.” Captain Robinson,
                    however, throws doubt on the antiquity of the buildings, and asserts that they
                    are not older than the settlement of Lord Baltimore in 1623.</p>
                <p>Newfoundland is justly considered as a very important <pb break="no"

                    of the fisheries there established, and also on account of the hardy race of
                    seamen who are trained up in that useful pursuit. In the article <hi

                    early trade of the colony, so that, in order to show its present condition, it
                    may be sufficient to give the returns applicable to a recent period. The
                    following table shows the progress of trade since 1822.</p>

                <p>The total value of the Newfoundland trade may be estimated, in round numbers, at
                    L.2,000,000 sterling per annum, independently of its great importance in a
                    maritime point of view. But besides the trade in fish and oil carried on by
                    Great Britain in the British seas, that of America and France is also of immense
                    extent and importance. To France it averages about 300,000 quintals of fish, and
                    not only are bounties given for this article, and for the vessel so much per
                    ton, but also for those men employed who have never before been at sea. No
                    bounty whatever is paid by our government, so that our fishermen have to compete
                    under the greatest disadvantages. But this is not all. In 1814, the French
                    obtained a right to a large extent of the coast fishery, or rather the right
                    which they had enjoyed previously to 1792 was then restored, and the islands of
                    St Pierre and Miquelon were ceded to them, to serve as a shelter for the French
                    fishermen. This privilege, which was conferred by treaty, they have rendered
                    exclusive, and so late as 1833 drove some English vessels off the coast of
                    Newfoundland, not allowing them to fish upon the shores of their own island. The
                    Americans also take every possible advantage of the privileges granted by us as
                    regards the latitude fixed, fishing close to the land during night; and they
                    likewise injure their neighbours by throwing their offal into the sea. Of the
                    entire quantity of cod-fish which they take, not less than 1,500,000 are
                    reckoned as caught on our own shores. The regular trade of Britain, besides
                    suffering from the causes mentioned, is seriously injured by the extensive
                    smuggling which the foreign fishermen carry on. From 1815, when the French and
                    American vessels were allowed the privilege of fishing in the British seas, till
                    1820, the tonnage of the British vessels employed in the trade fell off about
                    one third. The deep-sea fishery, in particular, is now almost abandoned by the
                    English to the Americans and French. Indeed every thing relating to British
                    interests, in connection with the Newfoundland fisheries, appears to have been
                    grossly mismanaged or neglected.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the island are administered by a house of assembly, consisting of
                    fifteen members chosen by the people, to which is added a legislative and
                    executive council. The laws are in the English language, and are administered by
                    circuit courts. There is no militia in the island, and the police force is
                    small. The revenue is derived from custom-duties, amounting to about L.15,000
                    per annum, and licenses, L.1000. To meet the expenditure, a parliamentary grant
                    of about L.10,000 was for several years given; but this was withdrawn in 1832,
                    and since then the revenue has not covered the expenditure by about that amount,
                    so that its restoration has been found necessary. The moral aspect of
                    Newfoundland is rather encouraging. Considerable unanimity has usually existed
                    amongst the different religious persuasions, consisting of Wesleyans, Roman
                    Catholics, and Congregationalists; the dissenters being generally more numerous
                    than the Episcopalians, over whom there is an archdeacon. The Catholic church is
                    governed by a bishop. There are several newspapers published in the island, and
                    of late years a taste for literature has been diffusing itself. There are
                    between thirty and forty schools, as well for adults as for children. At St
                    John’s there is a commercial society, out of which a chamber of commerce is
                    chosen annually, to watch over and promote the trade and fisheries. There are
                    several benevolent societies and two benefit societies. The population of
                    Newfoundland for several years was as follows:</p>

                <p>To these numbers must be added 2000 individuals distributed over distant parts of
                    the coast, which could not be visited by those who took the census. The
                    population necessarily fluctuates greatly, so that much difficulty is
                    experienced in obtaining correct returns. The resident inhabitants are now
                    (1837) reckoned at about 90,000.</p>
                <p>When Newfoundland was first visited, it was found to contain two distinct races
                    of aborigines; the one termed Red Indians, and the other Esquimaux. Both are now
                    almost extinct; the former, it is supposed, is entirely so, as deadly feuds were
                    waged between them and the early settlers. Besides, the Mic-mac Indians, who
                    were introduced into the island from Cape Breton and Nova Scotia, carried on
                    with the Red Indians an exterminating war, which proved far more fatal to them
                    than the hostilities of the Europeans. A female of this tribe was captured in
                    1818, and from her a vocabulary of their language was obtained.</p>
                <p>Without dwelling upon the tradition which represents Newfoundland as having been
                    settled at a very early period by one Biron, a sea-king or pirate of Iceland, we
                    have authentic evidence of its re-discovery by John Cabot, on the 24th of June
                    1497. Sailing under the commission of Henry VII. in these seas, he descried a
                    headland, which, as a lucky omen, he called Bonavista, a name which it still
                    retains. It was at that time inhabited by native Indians, three of whom he
                    brought home, clothed in skins, and speaking a language which no person
                    understood. It was afterwards visited by navigators from France and Portugal,
                    who reporting favourably of the abundance and excellency of its cod fishery,
                    European fishermen were soon attracted to its coasts. In 1536 an English vessel
                    attempted to winter upon the island, but the crew nearly perished from
                    starvation. Not deterred by this failure, however, nor by that of a former
                    attempt, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, in 1583, landed on the island with two hundred
                    followers, and, under a patent of Queen Elizabeth, took quiet possession of the
                    country. But too desirous of prosecuting his discoveries, his crews became
                    disaffected, and having separated into two parties, one of them returned home.
                    Most of those who followed him were lost in a gale of wind off the Sable Island,
                    and the remainder perished, along with himself, on their voyage homewards.
                    Subsequent attempts were made to explore and settle Newfoundland, but it was not
                    until the year 1623 that the first colony was established under Sir George
                    Calvert, afterwards Lord Baltimore. His son was made governor of the colony,
                    which he named Avalon, and soon afterwards proceeding thither himself, it
                    increased and flourished under his auspices. Ten years subsequently Charles I.
                    issued a regulation for “governing of his majesty’s subjects inhabiting in
                    Newfoundland, or trafficking in bays,” &amp;c.; and about the same time Lord
                    Falkland sent a colony from Ireland. Other individuals obtained grants of land;
                    and about the year 1654, fifteen settlements, comprehending three hundred
                    families, had been made on the island, notwithstanding the constant bickerings
                    between the English and French, the latter having established a colony at
                    Placentia. On the breaking out of the war after the accession of William HL,
                    these assumed a more serious character, and, after various recriminations, St
                    John’s was compelled to surrender to the French in 1696. The captors set fire to
                    the fort and town, and destroyed most of the British settlements. To repair
                    these losses, our government despatched a squadron; but the cowardice of one
                    commander and the ignorance of another frustrated the design. The
                    re-establishment of peace put an end to hostilities for the time; but they were
                    resumed in 1702, during which year most of the French settlements were
                    destroyed, and a great many fishing-boats were burned or captured. In the
                    following year an expedition miscarried, and this circumstance encouraged the
                    French to attempt the conquest of the whole island in 1705. For this purpose
                    five hundred men were despatched from Canada; but being repulsed from Petty
                    Harbour, <pb break="no" facs="nls:194558984" xml:id="kp-eb0716-8984-0163"/>a
                    port within nine miles of St John’s, they extended their ravages over the
                    different settlements as far as Bonavista. In 1706 the French trade received a
                    severe blow from an English commander, who, with only ten vessels, crippled the
                    armed force on the station, and destroyed a number of the enemy’s vessels in the
                    harbours along the coast. These disasters, however, did not deter the French
                    from attempting the permanent expulsion of the English. In the year 1708 they
                    completely demolished the town of St John’s; and shortly afterwards Carbonia,
                    the only settlement of consequence remaining in our hands, was partially
                    destroyed. From this time until the conclusion of the peace of Utrecht the
                    French remained in quiet possession of Newfoundland; but by this treaty the
                    island, with all the adjacent ones, was declared to belong to Great Britain, the
                    French being only allowed the use of the two islets of St Pierre and Miquelon.
                    The final conquest of all the American colonies extinguished any claims which
                    the French might set forth to possession in these seas; and they were glad to
                    receive back at the peace of 1763 the privilege above conferred. The
                    revolutionary war in America occasioned fresh disputes as to the right of
                    fishing upon the banks of Newfoundland. The New Englanders had hitherto enjoyed
                    the right of taking fish, and on this being resisted, they retaliated, by
                    refusing to supply the colony with many articles of provision upon which it
                    depended. This reciprocal annoyance caused the subject to form one of the
                    articles of the treaty of peace, signed at Paris in 1783, by which it was
                    stipulated that the inhabitants of the United States should have liberty to take
                    fish of every kind on such part of the coast of Newfoundland as British
                    fishermen should use, but not to dry or cure their fish upon the island. The
                    question of supplies from America was a long time agitated, but finally
                    authorized by act of parliament in 1822, confining the transit of goods to
                    British bottoms. Newfoundland has had a resident governor ever since the year
                    1728. Civil and justiciary courts were early established; and about the year
                    1750, a superior court was added. But for many years the imperfect
                    administration of justice continued to be a subject of complaint amongst the
                    colonists. Bills have been repeatedly passed for the purpose of placing matters
                    upon a more satisfactory footing; and in 1832 a representative government was
                    granted to Newfoundland, similar to that enjoyed by Nova Scotia. <hi
