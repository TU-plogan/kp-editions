                    <gi>teiHeader</gi> into two separate facets: FAST Topical and FAST Geographical.
                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">NEGRO</label>, Rio, a large river of Patagonia, in South
                    America. The banks of this river, as well as the numerous islands with which it
                    is in many parts studded, are covered with low willows, from which cause it is
                    sometimes called the Rio Sauces. Its Indian name is Cusu-Leubu, signifying Rio
                    Negro, or the Black River, from the dark hue of its waters.<note anchored="true"

                    feature in the geography of that part of South America, has hitherto been laid

                    in this country in the year 1775. In the year 1836', however, the Royal
                    Geographical Society of London published a correct account and map of it, which
                    were derived from a Journal of an Original Voyage of Discovery up the Rio Negro,
                    performed in the years 1782-1783, by Don Basilio Villarino, who had been
                    employed for thb purpose by the Spanish government. To these we have had
                    recourse in drawing up the above article.</p></note> The results of the
                    expedition alluded to in the note were important, although not so completely
                    satisfactory as could have been wished, as the large affluent from the north,
                    supposed to be Diamante, was not examined. But the great point established was,
                    that it is possible to navigate the main stream of the Rio Negro from its mouth,
                    in the Southern Atlantic, to the very foot of the Cordillera of Chili, within
                    fifty miles of Valdivia, upon the shores of the Pacific, a distance of about 525
                    miles without including the windings of the river. From its mouth in south
                    latitude 41 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> 5 <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi>, to
                    the great island of Choleechel or Chuelechel, in latitude 39°, its general
                    course tends to the north-north-west, although in some parts it is exceedingly
                    tortuous. As far as this point, the bottom of the river is sand, and the country
                    is described as an arid sandy level, destitute of vegetation, excepting some
                    insulated patches along the shore, which being from time to time flooded, are
                    covered with good pasturage. The island of Choleechel, which constitutes so
                    conspicuous a feature in the map of the river, is twenty-seven miles in length
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557905" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7905-0080"/>and nine in
                    width; but appears to produce nothing except pasturage. From this island to
                    Diamante, a distance of 156 miles, the course of the river is nearly due west;
                    its bottom is gravelly, with many pebbles, and the aspect of the country is for
                    the most part desolate from want of vegetation. The Diamante, at its confluence
                    with the Rio Negro, is nearly as large as the latter river; and as it appears to
                    be the drainage of numerous streams which descend from the eastern side of the
                    Cordillera, between the latitudes of 32° and 36°, its periodical floods must be
                    formidable, and much greater than those of the Rio Negro. It is much intersected
                    by small islands overgrown with stunted willows. The low lands along the shore
                    are sterile, and all beyond a range of steep red cliffs, by which these are
                    bounded, the country appeared totally destitute of herbage, not a tree being
                    visible. From about the confluence of these two rivers, the Rio Negro takes a
                    southsouth-western direction, running between high precipitous banks, where in
                    some parts the river was not more than five hundred yards across. After these
                    are passed, the country becomes more level, and the stream widens. Another
                    considerable tributary, called the Pichi Epicuntu, which descends from some of
                    the snowy peaks of the Cordillera, flows into the Negro in lat. 39° 35' S.
                    Farther onwards the river becomes intersected by innumerable islands, extremely
                    shallow in some parts; and the bottom is strewed with rounded stones and
                    boulders, which increase in size as the range of the Cordillera is approached.
                    The windings of the river also become very large, and, from flowing in a main
                    current nearly due south, it takes a westerly direction, and then bends to the
                    north. The farthest point reached by Villarino was in lat. 39 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi> 40'; and here, within fifty miles of Valdivia, his
                    course was checked by the Indians, who appear to have been apprehensive that his
                    expedition had for its main object the stoppage of a great pass near Choleechel,
                    by which they were in the habit of making predatory excursions into the province
                    of Buenos Ayres. He, in fact, points out how these marauders might be
                    effectually kept in check by establishing a fort at the point above mentioned;
                    and, after a lapse of fifty years, this suggestion has been carried into effect
                    by the authorities of Buenos Ayres. In 1833 a military post was formed at the
                    Choleechel, which will not only secure the southern parts of the republic from
                    the hostile inroads of the Indians, but will no doubt ultimately lead to our
                    obtaining much new and interesting information respecting a vast tract of
                    country as yet unknown to us. The depth of the Rio Negro varies much, as well as
                    the current, depending in some measure on the breadth of the bed of the river;
                    and it is liable to great changes in the time of the floods, which are
                    periodical, and twice in the year, from the rains in the winter, and the melting
                    of the snows in summer. With regard to its breadth, nothing satisfactory can be
                    stated, as it varies exceedingly at all times, and widens and contracts at
                    different seasons of the year.</p>
