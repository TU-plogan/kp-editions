                    regius professor of physics in the College of Navarre, and member of the Academy
                    of Sciences at Paris, of the Royal Society of London, of the Institution of
                    Bologna, and of the Academy of Sciences of Erfurt, was born at Pimbré, in the
                    diocese of Noyon, on the 17th of November 1700. He was the son of respectable
                    but not wealthy parents, who, to make up for the want of riches, determined to
                    give their son a good education. They sent him to the College of Clermont in
                    Beauvoisin, and afterwards to Beauvais, there to finish his introductory
                    studies. The progress which he made in the different classes decided them to
                    send him to study philosophy at Paris; and having intended him for the clerical
                    order, they considered the strictness and purity of his morals, together with
                    his unwearied application to study, as sufficient proofs of his vocation. The
                    young Nollet yielded without reluctance to the wishes of his parents. As soon as
                    he was capable of showing an inclination for any thing, he had discovered a
                    taste for physics; but this had not become his ruling passion; and he therefore
                    sacrificed it to the study of scholastic divinity, to which he wholly dedicated
                    himself during the time of his probation in 1728. No sooner had he been invested
                    with the deaconship, than he solicited and obtained a license to preach. This
                    new occupation, however, did not make him entirely lose sight of those studies
                    which had first engaged his attention, and insensibly began to occupy a greater
                    portion of his time, which was now more equally divided between theology and the
                    sciences. The latter, however, prevailed; and thenceforth he entered upon the
                    study of physics with an ardour which was only increased by that kind of
                    privation to which he had been long subject. He was received into the Society of
                    Arts established at Paris under the patronage of the Count de Clermont. In 1730,
                    the Abbé Nollet was engaged in a work in conjunction with Reaumur and Dufay of
                    the Academy of Sciences. In 1734 he went to London in company with MM. Dufay,
                    Duhamel, and Jussieu; and his merit procured him a place in the Royal Society
                    without any solicitation. Two years afterwards, he went to Holland, where he
                    formed an intimate connection with Desaguliers, s’Gravesande, and
                    Musschenbroeck. On his return to Paris, he resumed the course of experimental
                    physics which he had begun in 1735, and which he continued till 1760. These
                    courses of physics first suggested the idea of giving particular courses in
                    other branches of science, such as in chemistry, anatomy, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194559985" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9985-0240"/>natural history. In 1738, the
                    Count de Maurepas prevailed on Cardinal Fleury to establish a public class for
                    experimental physics; and the Abbé Nollet was appointed the first professor. In
                    the beginning of the year 1739, he was admitted a member of the Royal Academy of
                    Sciences; and in the month of April following, the king of Sardinia, intending
                    to establish a professorship of physics at Turin, invited the Abbé Nollet to
                    visit his dominions. In 1744, he was honoured with an invitation to Versailles,
                    to instruct the dauphin in experimental philosophy; and the king and royal
                    family were often present at his lectures. The young prince, until the period of
                    his death, showed marks of the strongest attachment to this ingenious
                    philosopher; and even prevailed upon him to go and pay court to a man in power
                    whose patronage might be of service to him. The Abbé Nollet accordingly waited
                    upon the placeman, and made him a present of his works. “I never read any works
                    of that kind,” said the patron coldly, at the same time casting a look at the
                    volumes before him. “Sir,” replied the Abbé, “will you allow them to remain in
                    your antichamber? <hi rend="italic">There,</hi> perhaps, there may be found men
                    of genius who will read them with pleasure.” In the month of April 1749, he made
                    a tour in Italy, having been sent thither for the purpose of making
                    observations. At Turin, Venice, and Bologna, the Abbé Nollet appeared as a
                    deputy from the philosophers of the rest of Europe. During his short stay in
                    Italy, the wonders of electricity were not the only object of his researches;
                    every part of physics, the arts, and agriculture, came equally under his notice.
                    Upon his return through Turin, the king of Sardinia, sensible of his merit,
                    offered him the order of St Maurice, which, however, he did not think proper to
                    accept without his sovereign’s permission. In 1753 the king instituted a class
                    of experimental philosophy in the Royal College of Navarre, and appointed the
                    Abbé Nollet prof essor. In 1757 he received from the king a brevet appointing
                    him preceptor in physics and natural history to the <hi rend="italic">Enfans de
                    la France.</hi> In the month of August the same year he was appointed professor
                    of experimental philosophy in the school of artillery, which was at that time
                    established at La Fère. In the month of November following, he was admitted as a
                    pensionary of the Royal Academy of Sciences. Μ. de Cremillo, director-general of
                    artillery and fortification, having founded a class of experimental philosophy
                    at Mezieres in 1761, the Abbé Nollet was appointed professor. This celebrated
                    and laborious philosopher, who rendered the most important services to physics
                    by the discoveries with which he has enriched every branch of this science, but
                    particularly electricity, died at Paris on the 25th of April 1770, aged seventy.
                    His works are, 1. Several Papers inserted in the Memoirs of the Academy of
                    Sciences, amongst which one on the Hearing of Fishes is particularly valuable;
                    2. Leçons de Physique Expérimentale, in six vols. 12mo; 3. Recueil de Lettres
                    sur l’Electricité, three vols. !2mo, 1753; 4. Essai sur l’Electricité des Corps,
                    one vol. 12mo; 5. Recherches sur les Causes particulières des Phénomènes
                    Electriques, one vol. 12mo’; 6. L’An des Expériences, three vols. 12mo,
                    1770.</p>
