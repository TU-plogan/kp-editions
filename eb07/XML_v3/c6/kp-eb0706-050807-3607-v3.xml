                <p><label type="entry">CHESHIRE</label> is divided from Lancashire by the rivers
                    Mersey and Tame; from Derbyshire and Staffordshire by the rivers Goyt and Dane,
                    and a range of hills; and from Flintshire and Denbighshire in a great measure by
                    the river Dee and its estuary, a small portion of the hundred of Broxton lying
                    to the west of this general boundary. The form of this county is singular, being
                    distinguished by two points projecting, the one into the Irish Sea, between the
                    Mersey and the Dee, which constitutes the hundred of Wirral; and the other
                    running up towards Yorkshire, between Lancashire and Derbyshire, forming the
                    extremity of the Macclesfield hundred. If these points were cut off, the figure
                    of Cheshire would approach nearly to that of an oval. The greatest breadth of
                    this county from north to south is about thirty miles; its greatest length, from
                    the extremity of the hundred of Wirral, at Kiddington Green, to Britland Edge,
                    on the borders of Yorkshire, is fifty-eight miles; across the middle part of <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193353620" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3620-0509"/> the county,
                    however, the length is not forty milcs. The projection between the Dce and
                    Mersey is about twenty miles long and six broad; and that towards Yorkshire
                    about fifteen miles long, and seldom above three miles broad.</p>
                <p>Cheshire contains one city, which is also the county town, Chester; seven
                    hundreds; thirteen market-towns, including Chester, namely, Stockport,
                    Knutsford, Altringham, Conglcton, Frodsham, Macclesfield, Malpos, Middlewich,
                    Nantwich, Ncston, Northwich, Sandbach, and Tar-porley; and eighty-six parishes.
                    As, however, many of these parishes are of great extent, and comprise numerous
                    townships, and more than one chapelry having the privilege of baptism and
                    sepulture, the number of parishes and places assessed to the poor’s rates, and
                    other county and parochial rates, is about 500. This county is in the province
                    of Canterbury, and diocese of Chester; within which diocese are comprehended
                    Cheshire, Lancashire, and part of Yorkshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire,
                    Westmoreland, and Cumberland. It is a county palatine, and is not included in
                    any of the circuits, having a chief justice of its own.</p>
                <p>The area of Cheshire comprises about 1200 square miles, or 676,600 acres, of
                    which a much larger proportion is in cultivation than in most other English
                    counties; there being only 28,600 acres of waste land, commons, and woods,
                    18,000 in peat bogs and mosses, and 10,000 in sea-sands, between the estuaries
                    of the Dee and Mersey: the remainder, 620,000’acres, is in cultivation. The
                    general character of the surface is flatness; the principal hills are on the
                    borders of Derbyshire, which are connected with those of that county and of
                    Staffordshire, and stretch along the eastern side of the parishes of Astbury,
                    Prestbury, and Motbram, about twenty-five miles. Near Frodsham there is a bold
                    promontory overlooking the Mersey, which is the first of an interrupted ridge of
                    hills that crosses the county from north to south on its western side as far as
                    Malpos. This high ground, after crossing the elevated district of Delamere
                    Forest, appears again in the insulated rock of Beeston, which is nearly three
                    hundred and eighty-six feet in height. The last link on this chain of hills is
                    that of Broxton. The ground near Macclesfield is also elevated. With these
                    exceptions, and that of a low chain of hills stretching from north to south
                    through the hundred of Wirral, Cheshire is more uniformly flat than any other
                    county in this part of England.</p>
                <p>There is not much variety of soil: sand and clay, with the one or the other
                    predominating in various proportions, constitute the soil of nearly the whole of
                    Cheshire. That part of the county which stretches towards Yorkshire consists
                    principally of peat-moss, a soil which also prevails to a less considerable
                    extent near Coppenhall and Warmincham, and in some parts of the Forest of
                    Delamere; the greater part of the forest, however, consists of sterile white
                    sand or gravel. The most prevalent subsoils are marl, clay, and rcdgrit rock, or
                    sandstone.</p>
                <p>Cheshire, viewed from a height, appears covered with wood; but this appearance
                    arises from the smallness of the enclosures, and the great number of large trees
                    in the hedge-rows; otherwise it is not a well-wooded county. Its forests, which
                    were formerly extensive, consisted of those of Delamere, Macclesfield, and
                    Wirral; and the first contained ten thousand acres, two thousand of which have
                    been inclosed. The quantity of timber in the hedge-rows and coppices exceeds the
                    general average of the kingdom; the best, as well as the most common, is oak. In
                    Dunham Park, near Altringham, the scat of the Earl of Warrington, there are some
                    remarkably large old oaks. Alderlcy Park is equally celebrated for its beech
                    trees.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers are the Dee, the Weaver, the Dane, and the Tame; the Mersey,
                    though frequently ' described as a Cheshire river, seems to us more properly to
                    belong to Lancashire. The Dee, which rises in Wales, enters this county near
                    Aldford; from Bangor Bridge it is navigable for barges; at Chester Bridge it
                    meets the tide; at Chester a ledge of rocks runs across the bed of the river;
                    from this place to the sea its natural course forms a broad sandy cstuary; but
                    an artificial channel has been formed at great expense on the south side of the
                    river, nearly half way to the sea, which is navigable for ships of six hundred
                    tons burden. It falls into the Irish Sea, about fourteen miles north-west of
                    Chester. At the time when the artificial channel was made, much land was gained
                    from the tide by embankments, and much has been subsequently recovered. The
                    Weaver rises in Cheshire, on Bulklcy Heath, and flows entirely through the
                    county, till it joins the Mersey at Wyton; from Frodsham Bridge to Winsford
                    Bridge, a distance of twenty miles, it is rendered navigable by means of locks
                    and wears; the fall is forty-five feet ten inches, and there are ten locks; the
                    course of this river is about thirty-three miles. The Dane rises in Macclesfield
                    Forest. During the first part of its course it divides Staffordshire and
                    Cheshire; at Congleton it enters the latter, and falls into the Weaver at
                    Northwich. Its course is about twenty-two miles. The character of these rivers
                    differs much. The Weaver is narrow, deep, and slow; the Dane is broad, shallow,
                    and swift. The Tame rises in Yorkshire. During the greater part of its course,
                    which is only ten miles, it forms the boundary between Cheshire and Lancashire,
                    and falls into the Mersey near Stockport.</p>
                <p>Cheshire is intersected by the Duke of Bridgewater’s Canal, the Grand Trunk, the
                    Ellesmere, the Chester and Nantwich, and the Peake Forest. The first runs
                    through about twenty miles of the county, entering it to the east of Ashton, and
                    joining the Mersey at Runcorn. The Grand Trunk Canal communicates with the Duke
                    of Bridgewater’s at Preston Brook, and passing by Northŵich and Middlewich,
                    enters Staffordshire near Lawton. There arc four tunnels in the course of this
                    canal through Cheshire, one of which, near Preston-on-the-Hill, is twelve
                    hundred and forty-one yards in length, seventeen fleet four inches in height,
                    and thirteen feet six inches in width. The Ellesmere Canal joins the Mersey at
                    "Whitby, and after passing the east end of the hundred of Wirral, and the
                    southeast of Broxton, it connects with the Dee and Chester Canal at Chester.
                    Another branch forms ajunction with the Chester Canal at Hurleston. The Chester
                    Canal begins at the Dee on the north of Chester, and passing through
                    Christleton, Warriton, Hargrave, and to the north of Beeston Castle, terminates
                    at Nantwich. The Peake Forest Canal joins the Ashton and Oldham Canal at
                    Ashton-under-Line; it crosses the Tame near Duckinfield, and passing through
                    Hydc, Marple, and Disley, enters Derbyshire near Whaley Bridge. Near Marple it
                    is carried over the Mersey by an aqueduct of three arches, and a hundred feet in
                    height. In the northern parts of Cheshire there are several small lakes called
                    <hi rend="italic">meres.</hi></p>
                <p>The mineral productions of this county are coal, copper, lead, cobalt, and
                    rock-salt. Coal abounds in the northeastern parts, in a district of about ten
                    miles from north to south. There are also some collieries in the hundred of
                    Wirral, one of which extends a mile and three fourths from high-water mark under
                    the river Dee. Copper, lead, and cobalt, are found at Alderby Edge, and copper
                    in the Peckforton Hills; but none of these ores arc by any means abundant.</p>
                <p>As the rock-salt and the brine-springs of Cheshire are naturally connected, and
                    are found in the same districts, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353633"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-3633-0510"/>we shall consider them together. The brine-springs
                    are principally met with in the valley through which the Weaver and the Wheelock
                    flow; and those from which salt is at present manufactured are at Lawton,
                    Wheelock, Roughwood, in the townships of Anderton, Bechton, Leftwich,
                    Middlewich, and in the neighbourhood of Northwich and Winsford. The
                    brine-springs at Wheelock are at the depth of sixty yards. The brine is rich,
                    but varies in strength; the strongest brine-springs are those of Anderton, while
                    those at Leftwich are the weakest.</p>
                <p>The brine-springs of Cheshire were probably known to the ancient Britons. It is
                    certain that salt made from them was one of the principal articles of the
                    commerce of this county before the Norman conquest. The discovery of the
                    rock-salt, on the other hand, is very recent, not having been made till 1670,
                    during a search for coal near Northwich. Since that period it has been found
                    abundantly in the townships of Witton, Wincham, and Marston. The rock-salt is
                    met with at various depths bclow the surface, from twenty-eight to forty-eight
                    yards; some of the strata are only four feet thick, and others forty yards. In
                    the mines near Northwich there are only two beds of rock-salt; but in other
                    parts three beds have been found. These beds are divided from one another by
                    strata of indurated clay or hard flag-stone, in which there are frequently found
                    pieces of rock-salt. The muriate of soda, in the great body of the rock-salt, is
                    mixed with a considerable portion of clay, oxide of iron, and sulphate of limei
                    In the lower strata the rock-salt is a purer muriate of soda. The rock-salt is
                    extremely hard, and in many cases requires to be blasted with gunpowder. The
                    largest mine at present worked is that of Wilton; its depth is 330 feet, and its
                    area nearly two acres; the ceiling, which is about twenty feet high, is
                    supported by pillars fifteen feet thick, each containing 294 solid yards of
                    rock-salt. Fifty or sixty thousand tons of rock-salt are obtained annually from
                    the pits in the neighbourhood of Northwich, which is the great seat of the salt
                    trade in this county. One third of the rock-salC is dissolved in water, and
                    crystallized by evaporation; and.two thirds are exported in its native
                    state.</p>
                <p>By the report of the committee of the House of Commons on the use of rock-salt in
                    the fisheries, printed May 1817, it appears that the capital embarked in the
                    salt trade of Lancashire and Cheshire is about L.600,000; that on an average of
                    five years previously to the 5th of April 1817, 240,000 tons of white salt had
                    been made annually in these counties; that from 300 to 330 flats and barges arc
                    employed in conveying the salt; that 267 people are employed in the salt mines;
                    that 6500 are employed in the manufacture of salt; and that 400 tons of iron are
                    consumed annually in this manufactory.</p>
                <p>Quarries of excellent freestone are found at Rumcorn, Manley, and Great
                    Bebington; limestone occurs only at Newbold Astbury, millstones at Mowcop Hill,
                    and sandstone fit for glass near Macclesfield. Marl abounds in almost every part
                    of the county.</p>
                <p>Landed property is in general very little divided in this county, there being,
                    according to Mr Holland, fifty noblemen and gentlemen who possess in it property
                    of the annual value of from L.3000 to L.10,000 a year, and at least as many
                    others with estates of from L.1Q00 to L.3000 a year.</p>
                <p>With respect to agriculture, Cheshire is almost entirely a dairy county; and its
                    arable husbandry is neither extensive nor of superior character. The principal
                    dairies are about Nantwich, and in the district between the Dane and the Weaver;
                    they are found, however, in every part of the county where the soil consists of
                    clay. The number of cows kept for the dairy is about 32,000, and the quantity of
                    cheese annually made is about 11,500 tons. The average quantity of cheese from
                    each cow annually is estimated at 300 lbs.; eight quarts of milk, the average
                    daily quantity yielded by each cow, producing one pound of cheese. In Lyme Park
                    there is a herd of cattle of the same wild breed as those at Chillingham, in
                    Northumberland.</p>
                <p>The ground in the vicinity of Frodsham and Altringham produces abundant crops of
                    excellent potatoes; and in the latter parish, where sea mud is used, 100,000
                    bushels are generally grown annually.</p>
                <p>The cotton manufactures of Lancashire have extended into the contiguous parts of
                    Cheshire, particularly at Stockport. Silk is manufactured at Macclesfield and
                    Congleton, where there are large silk-mills; hats are made at Stockport, white
                    and red lead at Chester, and gunpowder at Tholwall. Tanneries are very numerous,
                    and on a large scale, in the middle and north of the county.</p>
                <p>In 1803 the poor-rates levied amounted to L.84,99l. In 1815,434 parishes and
                    places paid the sum of L.125,630. There were no returns from fifty-seven places.
                    In 1829 the poor-rates levied amounted to L.137,886. 19s. The following is a
                    table of the population, &amp;c. for 1811, 1821, and 183Í.</p>
