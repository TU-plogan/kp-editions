                    >Peruvian</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesuits’ Bark.</hi> According to some,
                    the Peruvians learned the use of this bark by observing certain animals affected
                    with •intermittents instinctively led to it; whilst others say, that a Peruvian
                    having an ague, was cured by happening to drink of a pool which, from some trees
                    having fallen into it, tasted of cinchona; and its use in gangrene is said to
                    have originated from its curing one in an aguish patient. About the year 1640,
                    the lady of the Spanish viceroy, the Countess del Cinchon, was cured by the
                    bark, which has therefore been called <hi rend="italic">Cortex or</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pulvis</hi><hi rend="italic">Comitissae Cinchonoe, Chinachina</hi>

                    Quinaguina</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Quinquina;</hi> and from the interest which
                    the Cardinal de Lugo and the Jesuit fathers took in its distribution, it has
                    been called <hi rend="italic">Cortex</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pulvis
                    Cardinalis</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Lugo, Jesuiticus,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Patrum.</hi></p>
                <p>On its first introduction into Europe it was reprobated by many eminent
                    physicians, and at different periods long afterwards, it was considered as a
                    dangerous remedy; but its character, in process of time, became universally
                    established. For a number of years the bark, which was rolled up in short thick
                    quills, with a rough coat, and a bright cinnamon colour in the inside, which
                    broke brittle, and had an aromatic flavour, a bitterish astringent taste, with a
                    degree of aromatic warmth, was esteemed the best; though some considered the
                    large pieces as of equal quality. In the year 1779, the Hussar frigate took a
                    Spanish ship, loaded principally with Peruvian bark, which was much larger,
                    thicker, and of a deeper reddish colour, than that in common use. Soon after it
                    was brought to London, it was tried in St Bartholomew’s hospital, and in other
                    hospitals about town, and was said to be more efficacious than the quill bark.
                    This put practitioners upon examining into the history of the bark, making
                    experiments with it, and instituting comparative trials of its effects with
                    those of the bark in common use on patients labouring under intermittent
                    complaints. In July 1782, Dr William Saunders published an account of this red
                    bark, in which he says that the small quill bark used in England is either the
                    bark of the young trees, or of the twigs or branches of the old ones, and that
                    the large bark, called the red bark from the deep colour, is the bark of the
                    trunk of the old trees; and he mentions a Mr Arnot, who had himself gathered the
                    bark from the trees in Peru, and Μ. Condamine, who gives an account of the tree
                    in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences at Paris for the year 1738; both of
                    whom say, that, taking the bark from an old tree effectually kills it, but that
                    most of the young trees which are barked recover, and continue healthy; and
                    that, for these reasons, the Spaniards now barked the younger trees for foreign
                    markets, though they still imported into Spain some of the bark of the old
                    trees, which they esteemed as much more efficacious than that which was obtained
                    from the young. From these accounts Dr Saunders concludes, that the large red
                    bark brought to London in the year 1779 was of the same kind as that used by
                    Sydenham and Morton; as it answers to the description of the bark used in their
                    time, which is given by Dale and other writers on the materia medica, who were
                    their contemporaries. Dr Saunders says, that it is not only stronger and more
                    resinous, but likewise more efficacious and certain in its effect, than the
                    common bark, and that it had cured many agues after the other had failed.</p>
                <p>A species of cinchona has also been discovered in the West India islands,
                    particularly in Jamaica. It is accurately described by Dr Wright, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">CincnO' na Jamaicensis,</hi> in a paper published in
                    the Philosophical Transactions. In Jamaica it is called the sea-side beech, and
                    grows from twenty to forty feet in height. The white, furrowed, thick outer bark
                    is not used; but the darkbrown inner bark has the common flavour, with a mixed
                    kind of a taste, at first of horse-radish and ginger, but becoming at last
                    bitter and astringent. It seems to give out more extractive matter than the <hi
                    rend="italic">cinchona officinalis.</hi> Some of it was imported from St Lucie
                    in consequence of its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356090"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6090-0699"/>having been used with advantage in the army and
                    navy during war; and it has been treated of at considerable length by Dr
                    Kentish, under the title of St Lucia Bark. The fresh bark is found to be
                    considerably emetic and cathartic, which properties it is said to lose on
                    drying.</p>
                <p>The pale and the red are chiefly used in Britain. The pale is brought to us in
                    pieces of different sizes, either flat or quilled, and the powder is of rather a
                    lighter colour than that of cinnamon. The red is generally in much larger,
                    thicker, flattish pieces, but sometimes also in the form of quills, and its
                    powder is reddish, like that of Armenian bole. As already observed, it is much
                    more resinous, and possesses the sensible qualities of the cinchona in a much
                    higher degree, than the other kinds; and the more nearly these kinds resemble
                    the red bark, the better they are now considered. The red bark is heavy, firm,
                    sound, dry, and friable between the teeth; it does not separate into fibres, and
                    breaks, not shivery, but short, close, and smooth. It has three layers; the
                    outer is thin, rugged, of a reddish-brown colour, but frequently covered with
                    mossy matter; the middle is thicker, more compact, darker-coloured, very
                    resinous, brittle, and yields readily to the pestle; the inmost is more woody,
                    fibrous, and of a brighter red.</p>
                <p>Practitioners have differed much with regard to the mode of operation of the
                    Peruvian bark. Some have ascribed its virtues entirely to a stimulant power. But
                    while the strongest and most permanent stimuli have by no means the same effect
                    with bark in the cure of diseases, the bark itself shows hardly any stimulant
                    power, either from its action on the stomach, or on other sensible parts to
                    which it is applied. From its action on dead animal fibres, there can be no
                    doubt of its being a powerful astringent; and from its good effects in certain
                    cases of disease, there is reason to presume that it is a still more powerful
                    tonic. To this tonic power some think that its action as an antiseptic is to be
                    entirely attributed; but that, independently of this, it has a very powerful
                    effect in resisting the septic process to which animal substances are naturally
                    subjected, appears beyond all dispute, from its effects in resisting
                    putrefaction, not only in dead animal solids, but even in animal fluids when
                    entirely detached from the living body.</p>
                <p>But although it be admitted that the Peruvian bark acts powerfully as an
                    astringent, as a tonic, and as an antiseptic, yet these principles will by no
                    means explain all the effects derived from it in the cure of diseases.
                    Accordingly, from no artificial combination in which these powers are combined,
                    or in which they exist even in a high degree, can the good consequences
                    resulting from Peruvian bark be obtained. Many practitioners, therefore, are
                    disposed to view it as a specific. If by a specific, however, we mean an
                    infallible remedy, it cannot indeed be considered as entitled to that
                    appellation; yet in as far as it is a very powerful remedy, of the operation of
                    which no satisfactory explanation has yet been given, it may with great
                    propriety be denominated a specific. But whatever its mode of operation may be,
                    there can be no doubt that it is daily employed with success in a great variety
                    of diseases. The remedial value of quinine, particularly in the form of a
                    sulphat, is known to every one, and will be fully explained in the proper
                    place.</p>
                <p>This bark was first introduced for the cure of intermittent fevers; and in these,
                    when properly exhibited, it rarely fails of success. Practitioners, however,
                    have differed with regard to the best mode of exhibition; some prefer giving it
                    just before the fit, some during the fit, others immediately after it. Some,
                    again, order it in the quantity of an ounce between the fits, the dose being the
                    more frequent and larger according to the frequency of the fits; and this mode
                    of exhibition, although it may perhaps sometimes lead to the employment of more
                    bark than is necessary, is considered as upon the whole preferable, from being
                    best suited to most stomachs. The requisite quantity is very different in
                    different cases; and in jnany vernal intermittents it seems even hardly
                    necessary.</p>
