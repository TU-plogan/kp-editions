                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> primitive sense of this well-known word, derived
                    from the French <hi rend="italic">chevalier,</hi> signifies merely cavalry, or a
                    body of soldiers serving on horseback, and has been used in that general
                    acceptation by the best of our poets, ancient and modern, from Milton to Thomas
                    Campbell.</p>
                <p>But the present article respects the peculiar meaning given to the word in modern
                    Europe, as applied to the order of knighthood, established in almost all her
                    kingdoms during the middle ages, and the laws, rules, and customs, by which it
                    was governed. These laws and customs have long been antiquated, but their
                    effects may still be traced in European manners; and, excepting only the change
                    which flowed from the introduction of the Christian religion, we know no cause
                    which has produced such general and permanent difference betwixt the ancients
                    and moderns as that which has arisen out of the institution of chivalry. In
                    attempting to treat this curious and important subject, rather as philosophers
                    than as antiquaries, we cannot, however, avoid going at some length into the
                    history and origin of the institution.</p>
                <p>From the time that cavalry became used in war, the horseman who furnished and
                    supported a charger rose, in all countries, into a person of superior importance
                    to the mere foot soldier. The apparent difficulty of the art of training and
                    managing in the field of battle an animal so spirited and active, gave the <hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">∙~ποl&gt;ομος 'Exroξ,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Domitor equi,</hi> in rude ages, a character of superior
                    gallantry, while the necessary expense attending this mode of service attested
                    his superior wealth. In various military nations, therefore, we find that
                    horsemen were distinguished as an order in the state; and we need only appeal to
                    the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi> of ancient Rome as a body interposed betwixt
                    the senate and the people; or to the laws of the conquerors of New Spain, which
                    assigned a double portion of spoil to the soldier who fought on horseback, in
                    support of a proposition in itself very obvious. But in the middle ages the
                    distinction ascribed, to soldiers serving on horseback assumed a very peculiar
                    and imposing character. They were not merely respected on account of their
                    wealth or military skill, but were bound together by an union of a very peculiar
                    character, which monarchs were ambitious to share with the poorest of their
                    subjects, and governed by laws directed to enhance into enthusiasm the military
                    spirit, and the sense of personal honour associated with it. The aspirants to
                    this dignity were not permitted to assume the sacred character of knighthood
                    until after a long and severe probation, during which they practised, as
                    acolytes, the virtues necessary to the order of chivalry. Knighthood was the
                    goal to which the ambition of every noble youth turned; .and to support its
                    honours, which, in theory at least, could only be conferred on the gallant, the
                    modest, and the virtuous, it was necessary he should spend a certain time in a
                    subordinate situation, attendant upon some knight of eminence, observing the
                    conduct of his master, as what in future must be the model of his own, and
                    practising the virtues of humility, modesty, and temperance, until called upon
                    to display those of a higher order.</p>
                <p>The general practice of assigning some precise period when youths should be
                    admitted into the society of the manhood of their tribe, and considered as
                    entitled to use the privileges of that more mature class, is common to many
                    primitive nations. The custom also of marking the transition from the one state
                    to the other by some peculiar formality and personal ceremonial, seems so very
                    natural, that it is quite unnecessary to multiply instances, or crowd our pages
                    with the barbarous names of the nations by whom it has been adopted. In the
                    general and abstract definition of chivalry, whether as comprising a body of men
                    whose military service was on horseback, and who were invested with peculiar
                    honours and privileges, or with reference to the mode and period in which these
                    distinctions and privileges were conferred, there is nothing either original or
                    exclusively proper to our Gothic ancestors. It was in the singular tenets of
                    chivalry,—in the exalted, enthusiastic, and almost sanctimonious ideas connected
                    with its duties,—in the singular balance which its institutions offered against
                    the evils of the rude ages in which it arose,—that we are to seek those
                    peculiarities which render it so worthy of attention.</p>
                <p>The original institution of chivalry has often been traced to the custom of the
                    German tribes recorded by Tacitus. “All business,” says the historian, “whether
                    public or private, is transacted by the citizens under arms; but it is not the
                    custom that any one shall assume the military dress or weapons without the
                    approbation of the state. For this purpose, one of the chief leaders, or the
                    father or nearest relation of the youthful candidate, introduces him into the
                    assembly, and confers on him publicly a buckler and javelin. These arms form the
                    dress proper to manhood, and are the first honour conferred on youth. Before lie
                    receives them the young man is but a member of his own family, but after this
                    ceremony he becomes a part of the state itself.” (Taciti <hi rend="italic"
                    >Germania.)</hi> The records of the northern nations, though we cannot rely upon
                    their authenticity with the same unlimited confidence, because we conceive most
                    of the legends relating to them have been written at a much later period than
                    the times in which the scene is laid, may be referred to in confirmation of the
                    Roman historians. The Scandinavian legends and <hi rend="italic">Sagas</hi> are
                    full of the deeds of those warriors whom they termed heroes orchampions, and who
                    appear to have been formed into an order somewhat resembling that of chivalry,
                    and certainly followed the principal and most characteristic employment of its
                    profession,—wandering from court to court and from shore to shore, bound on <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193354712" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4712-0593"/> high adventure,
                    and seeking with equal readiness their fortunes in love and in war. It would not
                    be difficult to deduce from this very early period some of those peculiar habits
                    and customs, which, brought by the Gothic conquerors into the provinces of the
                    divided empire of Rome, subsisted and became ingrafted upon the institutions of
                    chivalry. Tacitus, for example, informs us, that among the Germans, and
                    especially among the Catti, every youthful champion permitted his beard and hair
                    to grow, and did not shave them until he had performed some signal feat of arms.
                    In the like manner, as the general reader may have learned from that
                    irrefragable authority, Don Quixote de la Mancha, a knight who received his
                    order was obliged to wear white armour, and a shield without a device, until, by
                    some daring and distinguished achievement, he had acquired title to an
                    honourable badge of distinction. If this correspondence of customs shall be
                    thought too far fetched and too general, the next, which we also derive from
                    Tacitus, is too close to be disputed. The German warriors who piqued themselves
                    upon this bravery, used, at the commencement of a war, to assume an iron ring,
                    after the fashion of a shackle, upon their arm, which they did not remove until
                    they had slain an enemy. The reader may be pleased to peruse the following
                    instance of a similar custom from the French romance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jehan</hi><hi rend="italic">de Saintre,</hi> written in the year 1459, and
                    supposed to be founded, in a great measure, upon real incidents.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We may here observe, once for
                    all, that we have no hesitation in quoting the romances of chivalry as good
                    evidence of the lawsand customs of knighthood. The authors, like the painters of
                    the period, invented nothing, but, copying the manners of the age in which they
                    lived, transferred them without doubt or scruple to the period and personages of
                    whom they treated. But the romance of <hi rend="italic">Jehan de Saintré</hi> is
                    still more authentic evidence, as it is supposed to contain no small measure of
                    fact, though disguised and distorted. Probably the achievement of the Polish
                    knights may have been a real incident.</p></note> The hero, with nine companions
                    at arms, four of whom were knights, and five squires, vowed to carry a helmet of
                    a particular shape, that of the knights having a visor of gold, and that of the
                    squires a visor of silver. Thus armed, they were to travel from court to court
                    for the space of three years, defying the like number of knights and squires,
                    wherever they came, to support the beauty of their mistresses with sword and
                    lance. The emblems of their enterprise were chained to their left shoulders, nor
                    could they be delivered of them until their vow was honourably accomplished.
                    Their release took place at the court of the emperor of Germany, after a solemn
                    tournament, and was celebrated with much triumph. In like manner, in the same
                    romance, a Polish knight, called the Seigneur de Loiselench, is described as
                    appearing at the court of Paris wearing a light gold chain attached to his wrist
                    and ankle in token of a vow; which emblem of bondage he had sworn to wear for
                    five years, until he should find some knight or squire without reproach, by
                    encountering with whom he might be <hi rend="italic">delivered</hi> (such was
                    the phrase) of his vow and enterprise. Lord Herbert of Cherbury mentions, in his
                    memoirs, that when he was made knight of the bath, a tassel of silken cordage
                    was attached to the mantle of the order, which doubtless had originally the same
                    signification as the shackle worn by the German champion. The rule was, however,
                    so far relaxed, that the knot was unloosed so soon as a lady of rank gaged her
                    word that the new knight of the bath would do honour to the order; and Lord
                    Herbert, whose punctilious temper set great store by the niceties of chivalrous
                    ceremony, fails not to record, with becoming gratitude, the name of the
                    honourable dame who became his security on this important occasion.</p>
                <p>Other instances might be pointed out, in which the ancient customs of the Gothic
                    tribes may be traced in the history of chivalry; but the above arc enough to
                    prove that the seeds of that singular institution existed in the German forests,
                    though they did not come to maturity Until the destruction of the Roman empire,
                    and the establishment of the modern states of Europe upon its ruins.</p>
                <p>Having thus given a general view of the origin of chivalry, we will, 1. Briefly
                    notice the causes from which it drew its peculiar characters, and the
                    circumstances in which it differs so widely from the martial character as it
                    existed, either among the ancient Greeks and Romans, or in other countries and
                    nations. II. We will attempt a general abstract of its institutions. III. The
                    rise and progress of chivalry, its effects upon the political state of Europe,
                    and its decay and extinction, will close the article.</p>
                <p>I. Agreeably to this general division, the general nature and spirit of the
                    institution of chivalry falls first under our consideration.</p>
                <p>In every age and country valour is held in esteem, and the more rude the period
                    and the place, the greater respect is paid to boldness of enterprise and success
                    in battle; but it was peculiar to the institution of chivalry to blend military
                    valour with the strongest passions which actuate the human mind—the feelings of
                    devotion and those of love. The Greeks and Romans fought for liberty or for
                    conquest, and the knights of the middle ages for God and lor their ladies.
                    Loyalty to their sovereigns was a duty also incumbent upon these warriors; but
                    although a powerful motive, and by which they often appear to have been strongly
                    actuated, it entered less warmly into the composition of the chivalrous
                    principle than the two preceding causes. Of patriotism, considered as a distinct
                    predilection to the interests of one kingdom, we find comparatively few traces
                    in the institutions of knighthood. But the love of personal freedom, and the
                    obligation to maintain and defend it in the persons of others as in their own,
                    was a duty particularly incumbent on those who attained the honour of chivalry.
                    Generosity, gallantry, and an unblemished reputation, were no less necessary
                    ingredients in the character of a perfect knight. He was not called upon simply
                    to practise these virtues when opportunity offered, but to be sedulous and
                    unwearied in searching for the means of exercising them, and to push them
                    without hesitation to the brink of extravagance, or even beyond it. Founded on
                    principles so pure, the order of chivalry could not, in the abstract at least,
                    but occasion a pleasing, though a romantic development of the energies of human
                    nature; butas, in actual practice, every institution becomes deteriorated and
                    degraded, we have too much occasion to remark, that the devotion of the knights
                    often degenerated into superstition,—their love into licentiousness,—their
                    spirit of loyalty or of freedom into tyranny and turmoil,—their generosity and
                    gallantry into hairbrained madness and absurdity.</p>
                <p>We have mentioned devotion as a principal feature in the character of chivalry.
                    At what remote period the forms of chivalry were first blended with those of the
                    Christian religion, would be a long and difficult inquiry. The religion which
                    breathes nothing but love to our neighbour and forgiveness of injuries, was not,
                    in its primitive purity, easily transferable into the warlike and military
                    institutions of the Goths, the Franks, and the Saxons. At its first infusion, it
                    appeared to soften the character of the people among whom it was introduced so
                    much, as to render<pb break="no" facs="nls:193354725"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4725-0594"/> them less warlike than their heathen neighbours.
                    Thus the pagan Danes ravaged England when inhabited by the Christian Saxons,—the

                    turned. As the necessity of military talefit and courage became evident, the
                    Christian* relí^ión wăá used by its ministers (justly and wisely, so far as
                    respected self-defence) as an additional spur to the temper^of The valiant. <hi

                    themselves in battle again⅛t the infidels. And who shall blame the preachers who
                    held buch language, when it is remembered that the Saracens had at one time
                    nearly possessed themselves of Aquitaine, and that,'but for the successful
                    valour of Charles Martel, Pepin, and Charlemagne, the crescent might have
                    dispossessed the cross of the fairest portion of Europe. The fervent sentiments
                    of devotion which direct men’s eyes toward heaven, were then justly invoked, to
                    unite with thofee which are most valuable on earth—-the' love of our country and
                    its liberties. &lt;∙</p>
                <p>But the Rómish clergy,’who have in all ages possessed the wisdom of serpents, if
                    they sometimes have fallen short of the simplicity of doves, saw the advantage
                    of converting this temporary zeal, which'animated the warriors of their creed
                    against the invading infidels, into a permanent union of principles, which
                    should blend the ceremonies of religious worship with the military establishment
                    of the ancient Goths and Germans. The admission of the noble youth to the
                    practice of arms was no longer a mere military ceremony, where the sword or
                    javelin was delivered to him in presence of the prince or elders of his tribe;
                    it became a religious rite, sanctified by the· forms of the church, which he was
                    in future to defend. The novice had to watch his arms in a church or chapel, or
                    at least on hallowed ground, the night before he had received the honour of
                    knighthood. He was made to assume a white dress, in imitation of the Neophytes
                    of the church. Fast and confession were added to vigils, and the purification of
                    the bath was imposéd on the military acolyte, in imitation of the initiatory
                    rite of Christianity; and he was attended by godfathers, who became security for
                    his performing his military vows, as sponsors had formerly appeared for him at
                    baptism. In all points of ceremonial, the investiture of chivalry was brought to
                    resemble, as nearly as possible, the administration of the sacraments of the
                    church. The ceremony itself was performed, where circumstances would admit, in a
                    church or cathedral; and the weapons with which the young warrior was invested
                    were previously blessed by the priest. The oath of chivalry bound the knight to
                    defend the rights of the holy church, to respect religious persons and
                    institutions, and to obey the precepts of the gospel. Nay more, so intimate was
                    the union betwixt chivalry and religion supposed to be, that the several
                    gradations of the former were seriously considered as parallel to those of the
                    church, and the knight was supposed to resemble the bishop in rank, duties, and
                    privileges. At what period this complete infusion of religious ceremonial into
                    an order purely military first commenced, and when it became complete and
                    perfect, would be a curious but a difficult subject of investigation. Down to
                    the reign of Charlemagne, and somewhat lower, the investiture was of a nature
                    purely civil; but long before the time of the crusades, it had assumed the
                    religious character we have described.</p>
                <p>The effect which this union of religious and military zeal was like to produce in
                    every other case save that of defensive war, could not but be unfavourable to
                    the purity of the former. The knight, whose profession was war, being solemnly
                    enlisted in the service of the gospel of peace, regarded infidels and heretics
                    of every description as the enemies whom, as God’s own soldier, he was called
                    upon to attack and slay wherever he could meet with them, without demanding or
                    waiting for any other cause of quarrel than the difference of religious faith.
                    The duties of morality were indeed formally imposed on him by the oath of-his
                    order, as well as that of defending the church and extirpating heresy and
                    misbelief. But in all ages it has been usual for men to compound with their
                    consciences for breaches of the moral code of religion, by a double proportion
                    of zeal for its abstract doctrines. In the middle ages, this course might be
                    pursued on system; for the church allowed an exploit done on the infidels as a
                    merit which might obliterate the guilt of the most atrocious crimes.</p>
                <p>The genius alike of the age and of the order tended to render the zeal of the
                    professors of chivalry fierce, burning, and intolerant. If an infidel, says a
                    great authority, impugn the doctrines of the Christian faith before a churchman,
                    he should reply to him by argument; but a knight should render no other reason
                    to the infidel than six inches of his falchion thrust into his accursed bowels.
                    Even courtesy, and the respect due to ladies of high degree, gave way when they
                    chanced to be infidels. The renowned Sir Bevis of Hamptoun, being invited by the
                    fair Princess Josiane to come to her bower, replies to the pay minis who brought
                    the message,</p>
                <p>I will ne gou one foot on ground</p>
                <p>For to speke with an heathen hound; Unchristen houndes, 1 rede ye flee, Or I your
                    hearte’s bloode wiìl see.</p>
                <p>This intemperate zeal for religion the knights were expected to maintain at every
                    risk, however imminent. Like the early Christians, they were prohibited from
                    acquiescing, even by silence, in the rites of idolatry, although death should be
                    the consequence of their interrupting them. In the fine romance of <hi
                    rend="italic">liuon of Bourdeaux,</hi> that champion is represented as having
                    failed in duty to God and his faith, because he had professed himself a Saracen,
                    for the temporary purpose of obtaining entrance into the palace of the Amial
                    Gaudifer. “And when Sir Huon passed the third gate, he remembered him of the lie
                    he had spoken to obtain entrance into the first. Alas! said the knight, what but
                    destruction can betide one who has so foully falsified and denied his faith
                    towards him who has done so much for me !” His mode of repentance was truly
                    chivalrous. When he came to the gate of the last interior inclosure of the
                    castle, he said to the warder, “Pagan, accursed be thou of God, open the gate.”
                    When he entered the hall where the Pagan monarch was seated in full state, he
                    struck off, without ceremony, the head of the Pagan lord who sat next in rank to
                    him, exclaiming at the same time, with a loud voice, “God, thou hast given me
                    grace well to commence my emprize; may our Redeemer grant me to bring it to an
                    honourable conclusion.” Many such passages might be quoted, to show the nature
                    of the zeal which was supposed to actuate a Christian knight; but it is needless
                    to ransack works of fiction for this purpose. The real history of the crusades,
                    founded on the spirit of chivalry, and on the restless and intolerant zeal which
                    was blended by the churchmen with this military establishment, are an authentic
                    and fatal proof of the same facts. The hairbrained and adventurous character of
                    these enterprises, not less than the promised pardons, indulgences, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193354738" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4738-0595"/> and remissions of
                    the church, rendered them dear to the warriors of the middle ages; the idea of
                    re-establishing the Christian religion in the Holy Land, and wresting the tomb
                    of Christ from the infidels, made kings, princes, and nobles, blind to its
                    hazards; and they rushed, army after army, to Palestine, in the true spirit of
                    chivalry, whose faithful professors felt themselves the rather called upon to
                    undertake an adventure, from the peculiar dangers which surrounded it, and the
                    numbers who had fallen in previous attempts.</p>
                <p>It was after the conquest of the Holy Land that the union between temporal and
                    spiritual chivalry (for such was the term sometimes given to monastic
                    institutions) became perfect, by the institution of the two celebrated military
                    orders of monks, the knights templars and knights of St John of Jerusalem, who,
                    renouncing (at least in terms) the pomp, power, and pleasures of the world, and
                    taking upon themselves the monastic vows of celibacy, purity, and obedience, did
                    not cease to remain soldiers, and directed their whole energy against the
                    Saracens. The history of these orders will be found in its proper place in this
                    work; but their existence is here noticed, as illustrating our general
                    proposition concerning the union of devotion and chivalry. A few general remarks
                    will close this part of the subject.</p>
                <p>The obvious danger of teaching a military body to consider themselves as
                    missionaries of religion, and bound to spread its doctrines, is, that they are
                    sure to employ in its service their swords and lances. The end is held to
                    sanctify the means, and the slaughter of thousands of infidels is regarded as an
                    indifferent, or rather as a meritorious action, providing it may occasion the
                    conversion of the remnant, or the peopling of their land with professors of a
                    purer faith. The wars of Charlemagne in Saxony, the massacres of the Albigenses
                    in the south of France, the long-continued wars of Palestine, all served
                    toillustrate the dangers resulting from the doctrine which inculcated religion,
                    not as a check upon the horrors and crimes of war, but as itself its most proper
                    and legitimate cause. The evil may be said to have survived the decay of
                    chivalry, to have extended itself to the new world, and to have occasioned those
                    horrors with which it was devastated for ages after its first discovery. The
                    Spanish conquerors of South America were not, indeed, knights-errant; but the
                    nature of their enterprises, as well as the mode in which they were conducted,
                    partook deeply of the spirit of chivalry. In no country of Europe had this
                    spirit sunk so deeply and spread so wide as in Spain. The extravagant positions
                    respecting the point of honour, and the romantic summons which chivalry
                    proclaimed to deeds of danger and glory, suited the ardent and somewhat oriental
                    character of the Spaniards, a people more remarkable for force of imagination
                    and depth of feeling than for wit and understanding. Chivalry, in Spain, was
                    embittered by a double proportion of intolerant bigotry, owing to their constant
                    and inveterate wars with the Moorish invaders. The strain of sentiment,
                    therefore, which chivalry inspired, continued for a long time to mark the
                    manners of Spain, after the decay of its positive institutions, as the beams of
                    the sun tinge the horizon after the setting of his orb. The warriors whom she
                    sent to the new world sought and found marvels which resembled those of romance;
                    they achieved deeds of valour against such odds of numbers as are only recorded
                    in the annals of knight-errantry; and, alas! they followed their prototypes in
                    that indifference for human life, which is the usual companion of intolerant
                    zeal. Avarice, indeed, brought her more sordid shades to complete the gloomy
                    picture; and avarice was unknown to the institutions of chivalry. The intolerant
                    zeal, however, which overthrew the altars of the Indians by violence, instead of
                    assailing their errors by reason, and which imputed to them as crimes their
                    ignorance of a religion which had never been preached to them, and their
                    rejection of speculative doctrines of faith, propounded by persons whose
                    practice was so ill calculated to “recommend them,-r—all these may be traced to
                    the spirit of chivalry, and the military devotion of its professors.</p>
                <p>The religion of the knights, like that of the times, was debased by superstition.
                    Each champion had his favourite saint, to whom he addressed himself upon special
                    occasions of danger, and to whom, after the influence of his lady’s eyes, he was
                    wont to ascribe the. honour of his conquests. St Michael, the leader of banded
                    Seraphim, and the personal antagonist of Satan,—St George, St James, and St
                    Martin, all of .whom∣ popular faith had .invested with the honours of
                    chivalry,—were, frequently selected as the appropriate champions of the militant
                    adventurers yet on earth. The knights used their names adjected to their own as
                    their insignia, watchword, or signal for battle. Edward III. fighting valiantly
                    in a night-skirmish before the gates of Calais, was heard ,to accompany each
                    blow he struck with the invocation of his tutelar saints, Ha I Saint Edward! ha!
                    Saint George! But the-Virgin Mary, to whom their superstition ascribed the
                    qualities <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> of youth, beauty, and sweetness, which
                    they prized in their terrestrial mistresses, was an especial object of, the
                    devotion of the followers of chivalry, as of all other good Catholics.
                    Tournaments were undertaken,, and, feats of arms performed, in her honour, as in
                    that of an earthly mistress; and the veneration with which she was regarded
                    seems occasionally to have-partaken of the character of romantic affection. She
                    was often held to return this love by singular marks of her favour and
                    protection.&lt; <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> During an expedition of the
                    Christians to the coast of Africa, Froissart informs us that a large black dog
                    was-frequently seen in their camp, which barked furiously whenever the infidels
                    approached it by night, and rendered such service to the Christian adventurers
                    by its vigilance, that with one consent they -named it.“the dog of our lady.”
                    <hi rend="italic">∙u .</hi></p>
                <p>But although, as is incidental to human institutions, the mixture of devotion in
                    the military character of the knight degenerated into brutal intolérance and
                    superstition in its practical effects, nothing could be -more beautiful and
                    praiseworthy than the theory on which it was grounded. That the soldier drawing
                    the sword in defence of his country and its liberties, or of the oppressed
                    innocence of damsels, widows, and orphans, or in support of religious-rights,
                    for which those to whom they belonged were disqualified by their profession to
                    combat in person,—that he should blend with all the feelings which these offices
                    inspired, a deep sense of devotion, exalting him above the advantage and even
                    the fame which he himself might derive from victory, and gaving dignity to
                    defeat itself, as a lesson of divine chastisement and humiliation,—that the
                    knight on whose valour his countrymen were to rely in danger, should set them an
                    example in observing the duties and precepts of religion,—are circumstances so
                    well qualified to soften, to dignify, and to grace the profession of arms, that
                    we cannot but regret their tendency to degenerate into a ferocious propensity to
                    bigotry, persecution, and intolerance. Such, however, is the tendency of all
                    human institutions, which, however fairly framed in theory, are in practice
                    corrupted by our evil passions, until the results which flow from them become
                    the very reverse of what was to have been expected and desired.</p>
                <p>The next ingredient in the spirit of chivalry, second in force only to the
                    religious zeal of its professors, and frequently predominating over it, was a
                    devotion to the female sex, and particularly to her whom each knight selected as
                    the chief object of his affection, of a nature so extravagant<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354751" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4751-0596"/> and unbounded as to approach
                    to a sort of idolatry.</p>
                <p>The original source of this sentiment is to be found, like that of chivalry
                    itself, in the customs and habits of the northern tribes, who possessed, even in
                    their rudest state, so many honourable and manly distinctions over all the other
                    nations in the same stage of society. The chaste and temperate habits of these
                    youth, and the opinion that it was dishonourable to hold sexual intercourse
                    until the twentieth year was attained, was in the highest degree favourable, not
                    only to the morals and health of the ancient Germans, but must have contributed
                    greatly to place the females in that dignified and respectable rank which they
                    held in society. Nothing tends so much to blunt the feelings, to harden the
                    heart, and to destroy the imagination, as the worship of the Vaga Venus in early
                    youth. Wherever women have been considered as the early, willing, and
                    accommodating slaves of the voluptuousness of the other sex, their character has
                    become degraded, and they have sunk into domestic drudges and bondswomen among
                    the poor,—the slaves of a haram among the more wealthy. On the other hand, the
                    men, easily and early sated with indulgences, which soon lose their poignancy
                    when the senses only are interested, become first indifferent, then harsh and
                    brutal, to the unfortunate slaves of their pleasures. The sated lover,—and
                    perhaps it is the most brutal part of humanity,—is soon converted into the
                    capricious tyrant, like the successful seducer of the modern poet.</p>
                <p>Hard! with their fears and terrors to behold The cause of all, the faithless
                    lover cold, Impatient grown at every wish denied, And barely civil, soothed and
                    gratified.</p>

                    and all its brutalizing consequences, which were happily unknown to our Gothic
                    ancestors. The virtuous and manly restraints imposed on their youth were highly
                    calculated to exalt the character of both sexes, and especially to raise the
                    females in their own eyes and those of their lovers. They were led to regard
                    themselves, not as the passive slaves of pleasure, but as the objects of a
                    prolonged and respectful affection, which could only be finally gratified when
                    their lovers had attained the age of mature reason, and were capable to govern
                    and to defend the family which should arise around them. With the young man
                    imagination and sentiment combined to heighten his ideas of a pleasure which
                    nature instructed him to seek, and which the wise laws of his country prevented
                    him from prematurely aspiring to share. To a youth so situated, the maiden on
                    whom he placed bis affections became an object of awe as well as of affection;
                    the passion which he indulged for her was of a nature as timid and pure as
                    engrossing and powerful; the minds of the parties became united before the
                    joining of their hands, and a moral union preceded the mere intercourse of the
                    sexes.</p>
                <p>The marriages formed under these happy auspices were in general happy and
                    affectionate. Adultery was unfrequent, and punished with the utmost rigour. Nor
                    could she who had undergone the penalty of such a crime find a second husband,
                    however distinguished by beauty, birth, or wealth. (Taciti <hi rend="italic"
                    >Germania.)</hi> The awe and devotion with which the lover had regarded his
                    destined bride during the years in which the German youth were enjoined
                    celibacy, became regard and affection in the husband towards the sharer of his
                    labours and the mistress of his household. The matron maintained that rank in
                    society which love had assigned to the maiden. No one, then, says the Roman
                    historian, dared to ridicule the sacred union of marriage, or to term an
                    infringement of its laws a compliance with the manners of the age. The German
                    wife, once married, seldom endeavoured to form a second union, but continued, in
                    honoured widowhood, to direct and manage the family of her deceased husband.
                    This habitual subjection of sensuality to sentiment, these plain, simple,
                    virtuous, and temperate manners of the German females, placed the females in
                    that high rank of society which the sex occupies when its conduct is estimable,
                    and from which it as certainly declines in ages or climates prone to luxurious
                    indulgence. The superintendence of the domestic affairs was assigned to the
                    German women, a duty in which the men seldom interfered, unless when rendered by
                    age or wounds incapable of warfare. They were capable of exercising the supreme
                    authority in their tribe, and of holding the honours of the priesthood. But the
                    influence of the women in a German tribe, as well as their duties in war, will
                    be best understood from the words of Tacitus. “It is the principal incitement to
                    the courage of the Germans, that in battle their separate troops or columns are
                    not arranged promiscuously as chance directs, but consist each of a united
                    family or clan with its relatives. Their dearest pledges are placed in the
                    vicinity, whence may be heard the cries of their females, the wailings of their
                    infants, whom each accounts the most sacred witnesses and the dearest eulogists
                    of his valour. The wounded repair to their mothers and spouses, who hesitate not
                    to number their wounds, and to suck the blood that flows from them. The females
                    carry refreshment to those engaged in the contest, and encourage them by their
                    exhortations. It is related that armies, when disordered and about to give way,
                    have renewed the contest at the instance of the women, moved by the earnestness
                    of their entreaties, their exposed besoms, and the danger of approaching
                    captivity; a doom which they dread more on account of their females than even on
                    their own, insomuch that these German states are most effectually bound to
                    obedience, among the number of whose hostages there are a number of noble
                    damsels as well as men. They deem, indeed, that there resides in the female sex
                    something sacred and capable of presaging the future; nor do they scorn their
                    advice or neglect their responses. In the time of Vespasian we have seen Velleda
                    long hold the rank of a deity in most of the German states; and, in former
                    times, they venerated Aurinia and other females; not, however, from mere
                    flattery, nor yet in the character of actual goddesses.” The tales and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sagas of</hi> the north, in which females often act the most
                    distinguished part, might also be quoted as proofs of the rank which they held
                    in society. We find them separating the most desperate frays by their presence,
                    their commands, or their mantles, which they threw over the levelled weapons of
                    the combatants. Nor were their rights less extensive than their authority. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Eyrbiggia Saga</hi> we are informed that Thordisa, the
                    mother of the celebrated Pontiff Snorro, and wife of Biarko of Stelgafels,
                    received a blow from her hushand. The provocation was strong; for the matron
                    had, in her husband’s house and at his table, attempted to stab his guest Eyalf
                    Graie, on account of his having slain one of her relations. Yet so little did
                    this provocation justify the offence, that, in the presence of the comitia, or
                    public assembly of the tribe, Thordisa invoked witnesses to bear testimony that
                    she divorced her husband on account of his having raised his hand against her
                    person. And such were the rights of a northern <hi rend="italic"
                    >mater-familias,</hi> that the divorce and a division of goods immediately took
                    place between the husband and wife, although the violence of which Thordisa
                    complained was occasioned by her own attempt to murder a guest.</p>
                <p>We have traced the ideas of the Gothic tribes on this <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354764" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4764-0597"/>important point the more at
                    length, because they show that the character of veneration, sanetity, and
                    inviolability attached to the female character, together with the important part
                    assigned to them in society, were brought with them from their native forests,
                    and had existence long before the chivalrous institutions in which they made so
                    remarkable a feature. They easily became amalgamated in a system so well fitted
                    to adopt whatever was romantic and enthusiastic in manners or sentiment. Amid
                    the various duties of knighthood, that of protecting the female sex, respecting
                    their persons, and redressing their wrongs, becoming the champion of their
                    cause, and the chastiser of those by whom they were injured, was presented as
                    one of the principal objects of the institution. Their oath bound the new-made
                    knights to defend the cause of all women without exception; and the most
                    pressing way of conjuring them to grant a boon was to implore it in the name of
                    God and the ladies. The cause of a distressed lady was, in many instances,
                    preferable to that even of the country to which the knight belonged. Thus, the
                    Captal de Buche, though an English subject, did not hesitate to unite his troops
                    with those of the Compte de Foix, to relieve the ladies in a town where they
                    were besieged and threatened with violence by the insurgent peasantry. The
                    looks, the words, the sign of a lady, were accounted to make knights at time of
                    need to perform double their usual deeds of strength and valour. At tournaments
                    and in combats the voices of the ladies were heard, like those of the German
                    females in former battles, calling on the knights’ to remember their fame, and
                    exert themselves to the uttermost. “Think, gentle knights,” was their cry, “upon
                    the wool of your breasts, the nerve of your arms, the love you cherish in your
                    hearts, and do valiantly, for ladies behold you.” The corresponding shouts of
                    the combatants were, “Love of ladies! Death of warriors! On, valiant knights,
                    for you fight under fair eyes.”</p>
                <p>Where the honour or love of a lady was at stake, the fairest prize was held out
                    to the victorious knight, and champions from every quarter were sure to hasten
                    to combat in a cause so popular. Chaucer, when he describes the assembly of the
                    knights who came with Areita and Palemon to fight for the love of the fair
                    Emilie, describes the manners of his age in the following lines:</p>
                <p>For every knight that loved chivalry, And would his thankes have a passant name,
                    Hath pray’d that he might ben of that game, And well was him that thereto chusen
                    was; For if there fell to-morrow such a case, Ye knowen well that every lusty
                    knight That loveth par amour, and hath his might, Were it in Engellonde, or
                    elleswhere, They wold hir thankes willen to be there. To fight for a lady! Ah!
                    Benedicite, It were a lusty sight for to see.</p>
                <p>It is needless to multiply quotations on a subject so trite and well known. The
                    defence of the female sex in general, the regard due to their honour, the
                    subservience paid to their commands, the reverend awe and courtesy which, in
                    their presence, forbear all unseemly words and actions, were so blended with the
                    institution of chivalry, as to form its very essence.</p>
                <p>But it was not enough that the “very perfect, gentle knight,” should reverence
                    the fair sex in general. It was essential to his character that he should
                    select, as his proper choice, “a lady and a love,” to be the polar star of his
                    thoughts, the mistress of his affections, and the directress of his actions. In
                    her service, he was to observe the duties of loyalty, faith, secrecy, and
                    reverence. Without such an empress of his heart, a knight, in the phrase of the
                    times, was a ship without a rudder, a horse without a bridle, a sword without a
                    hilt; a being, in short, devoid of that ruling guidance and intelligence, which
                    ought to inspire bis bravery and direct his actions.</p>
                <p>The Dame des Belles Cousines, having cast her eyes upon the little Jean de
                    Saintré, then a page of honour at court, demanded of him the name of his
                    mistress and his love, on whom his affections were fixed. The poor boy, thus
                    pressed, replied, that the first object of his love was the lady liis mother,
                    and the next his sister Jacqueline. “Jouvencel,” replied the inquisitive lady,
                    who had her own reasons for not being contented with this simple answer, “we do
                    not now talk of the affection due to your mother and sister; I desire to know
                    the name of the lady whom you <hi rend="italic">love par amours.”</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—“</hi> In faith, madam,” said the poor page, to whom the
                    mysteries of chivalry, as well as of love, were yet unknown, “I love no one <hi
                    rend="italic">par amours”^-“</hi> Ah, false gentleman, and traitor to the laws
                    of chivalry,” returned the lady, “dare you say that you love no lady? well may
                    we perceive your falsehood and eraven spirit by such an avowal. Whence were
                    derived the great valour and the high achievements of Lancelot of Gawain, of
                    Tris-trem, of Giron the Courteous, and of other heroes of the Round
                    Table,—whence those of Panthus, and of so many other valiant knights and squires
                    of this realm, whose names I could enumerate had I time,—whence the exaltation
                    of many whom I myself have known to arise to high dignity and renown, except
                    from their animating desire to maintain themselves in the grace and favour of
                    their ladies, without which mainspring to exertion and valour they must have
                    remained unknown and insignificant. And do you, coward page, now dare to aver
                    that you have no lady, and desire to have none? Hence, false heart that thou
                    art.” To avoid these bitter reproaches, the simple page named as his lady and
                    <hi rend="italic">love par amours</hi> Matheline de Coucy,a child of ten years
                    old. The answer of the Dame des Belles Cousines, after she had indulged in the
                    mirth which his answer prompted, instructed him how to place his affections more
                    advantageously; and as the former part of the quotation may show the reader how
                    essential it was to the profession of chivalry, that everyone of its professors
                    should elect a lady of his affections, that which follows explains the
                    principles on which his choice should be regulated. “Matheline,” said the lady,
                    “is indeed a pretty girl, and of high rank, and better lineage than appertains
                    to you. But what good, what profit, what honour, what advantage, what comfort,
                    what aid, what council for advancing you in the ranks of chivalry, can you
                    derive from such a choice? Sir, you ought to choose a lady of high and noble
                    blood, who has the talent and means to counsel and aid you at your need; and her
                    you ought to serve so truly, and love so loyally, that she must be compelled to
                    acknowledge the true and honourable affection which you bear to her. For believe
                    there is no lady, however cruel and haughty, but through length of faithful
                    service will be brought to acknowledge and reward loyal affection with some
                    portion of pity, compassion, or mercy. In this manner you will attain the praise
                    of a worthy knight; and till you follow such a course, I would not give an apple
                    for you or your achievements.” The lady then proceeds to lecture the acolyte of
                    chivalry at considerable length on the seven mortal sins, and the way in which
                    the true amorous knight may eschew commission of them. Still, however, the
                    saving grace inculcated in her sermon was fidelity and seerecy in the service of
                    the mistress whom he should love <hi rend="italic">par amours.</hi> She proves,
                    by the aid of quotations from the Scripture, the fathers of the church, and the
                    ancient philosophers, that the true and faithful lover can never fall into the
                    crimes of Pride, Anger, Envy, Sloth, or Gluttony. From each of these his true
                    faith is held to warrant and defend him. Nay, so pure was the nature of the
                    flame which she recommended, that she maintained it <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354777" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4777-0598"/>to be inconsistent even with
                    the seventh sin of Chambering and Wantonness, to which it might seem too nearly
                    allied. The least dishonest thought or action was, according to her doctrine,
                    sufficient to forfeit the chivalrous lover the favour of his lady. It seems,
                    however, that the greater part of her charge concerning incontinence is levelled
                    against such as haunted the receptacles of open vice; and that she reserved an
                    exception (of which, in the course of the history, she made liberal use) in
                    favour of the intercourse which, in all love, honour, and secrecy, might take
                    place when the favoured and faithful knight had obtained, by long service, the
                    boon of amorous mercy from the lady whom he loved <hi rend="italic">par
                    amours.</hi> The last encouragement which the Dame des Belles Cousines held out
                    to Saintré, in order to excite his ambition, and induce him to fix his passion
                    upon a lady of elevated birth, rank, and sentiment, is also worthy of being
                    quoted, since it shows that it was the prerogative of chivalry to abrogate the
                    distinctions of rank, and elevate the hopes of the knight, whose sole patrimony
                    was his arms and valour, to the high-born and princely dame, before whom he
                    carved as a sewer.</p>
                <p>“How is it possible for me,” replied poor Saintré, after having heard out the
                    unmercifully long lecture of the Dame des Belles Cousines, “to find a lady, such
                    as you describe, who will accept of my service, and requite the affection of
                    such a one as I am ?”—“And why should you not find her?” answered the lady
                    preceptress. “Are you not gently born? Are you not a fair and proper youth? Have
                    you not eyes to look on her—ears to hear her—a tongue to plead your cause to
                    her—hands to serve her— feet to move at her bidding—body and heart to accomplish
                    loyally her commands? And, having all these, can you doubt to adventure yourself
                    in the service of any lady whatsoever?”</p>
                <p>In these extracts are painted the actual manners of the age of chivalry. The
                    necessity of the perfect knight having a mistress, whom he loved <hi
                    rend="italic">par amours,</hi> the duty of dedicating his time to obey her
                    commands, however capricious, and his strength to execute extravagant feats of
                    valour, which might redound to her praise,—for all that was done for her sake,
                    and under her auspices, was counted her merit, as the victories of their
                    generals were ascribed to the Roman emperors,—was not a whit less necessary to
                    complete the character of a good knight than the Dame des 13elles Cousines
                    represented it.</p>
                <p>It was the especial pride of each distinguished champion, to maintain against all
                    others the superior worth, beauty, and accomplishments of his lady; to bear her
                    picture from court to court, and support with lance and sword her superiority to
                    all other dames, abroad or at home. To break a spear for the love of their
                    ladies, was a challenge courteously given, and gently accepted, among all true
                    followers of chivalry; and history and romance are alike filled with the tilts
                    and tournaments which took place upon this argument, which was ever ready and
                    ever acceptable. Indeed, whatever the subject of the tournament had been, the
                    lists were never closed until a solemn course had been made in honour of the
                    ladies.</p>
                <p>There were knights yet more adventurous, who sought to distinguish themselves by
                    singular and uncommon feats of arms in honour of their mistresses, and such was
                    usually the cause of the whimsical and extravagant vows of arms which we have
                    subsequently to notice. To combat against extravagant odds, to fight amid the
                    press of armed knights without some essential part of their armour, to do some
                    deed of audacious valour in face of friend and foe, were the services by which
                    the knights strove to recommend themselves, or which their mistresses (very
                    justly so called) imposed on them as proofs of their affection.</p>
                <p>On such occasions the favoured knight, as he wore the colours and badge of the
                    lady of his affections, usually exerted his ingenuity in inventing some device
                    or cognisance which might express their affection, either openly, as boasting of
                    it in the eye of the world, or in such mysterious mode of education as should
                    only be understood by the beloved person, if circumstances did not permit an
                    avowal of his passion. Among the earliest instances of the use of the English
                    language at the court of the Norman monarchs, is the distich painted in the
                    shield of Edward III. under the figure of a white swan, being the device which
                    that warlike monarch wore at a tourney at Windsor.</p>
                <p>Ha! ha! the white swan,</p>
                <p>By God his soul, I am thy man.</p>
                <p>The choice of these devices was a very serious matter; and the usurpation of such
                    as any knight had previously used and adopted was often the foundation of a
                    regular quarrel, of which many instances occur in Froissart and other
                    writers.</p>
                <p>The ladies, bound as they were in honour to requite the passion of their knights,
                    were wont on such occasions to dignify them by the present of a scarf, ribbon,
                    or glove, which was to be worn in the press of battle and tournament. These
                    marks of favour they displayed on their helmets, and they were accounted the
                    best incentives to deeds of valour. The custom appears to have prevailed in
                    France to a late period, though polluted with the grossness so often mixed with
                    the affected refinement and gallantry of that nation. In the attack made by the
                    Duke of Buckingham upon the Isle of Rhé, favours were found on the persons of
                    many of the French soldiers who fell at the skirmish on the landing; but for the
                    manner in which they were disposed we are compelled to refer to Howel and
                    Wilson.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the ladies, in conferring these tokens of their favour, elogged them
                    with the most extravagant and severe conditions. But the lover had this
                    advantage in such cases, that if he ventured to encounter the hazard imposed,
                    and chanced to survive it, he had, according to the fashion of the age, the
                    right of exacting from the lady favours corresponding in importance. The annals
                    of chivalry abound with stories of cruel and cold fair ones who subjected their
                    lovers to extremes of danger, in hopes that they might get rid of their
                    addresses, but were, upon their unexpected success, caught in their own snare,
                    and, as ladies who would not have their name made the theme of reproach by every
                    minstrel, compelled to recompense the deeds which their champion had achieved in
                    their name. There are instances in which the lover used his right of reprisals
                    with some rigour, as in the well-known <hi rend="italic">fabliau</hi> of the
                    three knights and the shift, in which a lady proposes to her three lovers
                    successively the task of entering unarmed into the melee of a tournament,
                    arrayed only in one of her shifts. The perilous proposal is declined by two of
                    the knights, and accepted by the third, who thrusts himself, in the unprotected
                    state required, into all the hazards of the tournament, sustains many wounds,
                    and carries off the prize of the day. On the next day the husband of the lady
                    (for she was married) was to give a superb banquet to the knights and nobles who
                    had attended the tourney. The wounded victor sends the shift back to its owner,
                    with his request that she would wear it over her rich dress on this solemn
                    occasion, soiled and torn as it was, and stained all over with the blood of its
                    late wearer. The lady did not hesitate to comply, declaring that she regarded
                    this shift, stained with the blood of her “fair friend, as more precious than if
                    it were of the most costly materials.” Jaques de Basin, the minstrel, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193354790" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4790-0599"/> who relates this
                    curious tale, is at a loss to say whether ' the palm of true love should be
                    given to the knight or to the lady on this remarkable occasion. The husband, he
                    assures us, had the good sense to seem to perceive nothing uncommon in the
                    singular vestment with which his lady was attired, and the rest of the good
                    company highly admired her courageous requital of the knight’s gallantry.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the patience of the lover was worn out by the cold-hearted vanity which
                    thrust him on such perilous enterprises. At the court of one of the German
                    emperors, while some ladies and gallants of the court were looking into a den
                    where two lions were confined, one of them purposely let her glove fall within
                    the palisade which inclosed the animals, and commanded her lover, as a true
                    knight, to fetch it out to her. He did not hesitate to obey; jumped over the
                    inclosure; threw his mantle towards the animals as they sprung at him; snatched
                    up the glove, and regained the outside of the palisade. But when in safety, he
                    proclaimed aloud, that what he had achieved was done for the sake of his own
                    reputation, and not for that of a false lady, who could for her sport and
                    cold-blooded vanity face a brave man on a duel so desperate; and, with the
                    applause of all that were present, he renounced her love for ever.</p>
                <p>This, however, was an uncommon circumstance. In general, the lady was supposed to
                    have her lover’s character as much at heart as her own, and to mean, by pushing
                    him upon enterprises of hazard, only to give him an opportunity of meriting her
                    good graces, which she could not with honour confer upon one undistinguished by
                    deeds of chivalry. An affecting instance is given by Godscroft.</p>
                <p>At the time when the Scotch were struggling to recover from the usurpation of
                    Edward I., the castle of Douglas was repeatedly garrisoned by the English, and
                    these garrisons were as frequently surprised and cut to pieces by the good Lord
                    James of Douglas, who, lying in the mountainous wilds of Cairntable, and
                    favoured by the intelligence which he maintained among his vassals, took
                    opportunity of the slightest relaxation of vigilance to surprise the fortress.
                    At length a fair dame of England announced to the numerous suitors who sought
                    her hand, that she would confer it on the man who should keep the perilous
                    castle of Douglas (so it was called) for a year and a day. The knight who
                    undertook this dangerous task at her request discharged his duty like a careful
                    soldier for several months, and the lady relenting at the prospect of his
                    continued absence, sent a letter to recal him, declaring she held his probation
                    as accomplished. In the meantime, however, he had received a defiance from
                    Douglas, threatening him, that, let him use his utmost vigilance, he would
                    recover from him his father’s castle before Palm-Sunday. The English knight
                    deemed that he could not in honour leave the castle till this day was past; and
                    on the very eve of Palm-Sunday was surprised and slain with the lady’s letter in
                    his pocket, the perusal whereof greatly grieved the good Lord James of
                    Douglas.</p>
                <p>We are left much to our own conjectures on the appearance and manners of these
                    haughty beauties, who were wooed with sword and lance, whose favours were bought
                    at the expense of such dear and desperate perils, and who were worshipped, like
                    heathen deities, with human sacrifices. The character of the ladies of the ages
                    of chivalry was probably determined by that of the men, to whom it sometimes
                    approached. Most of these heroines were educated to understand the treatment of
                    wounds, not only of the heart, but of the sword; and, in romance at least, the
                    quality of leech-craft (practised by the Lady Bountifuls of the last generation)
                    was essential to the character of an accomplished princess. They sometimes
                    trespassed on the province of their lovers, and actually took up arms. The
                    Countess de Montfort in Bretagne is cele- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> brated
                    by Froissart for the gallantry with which she de- ’ fended her castle when
                    besieged by the English; and the old prior of Lochleven in Scotland is equally
                    diffuse in the praise of Black Agnes, countess of March, who, in the reign of
                    Edward III. held out the castle <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Dunbar against the
                    English. She appeared on the battlements with a white handkerchief in her hands,
                    and wiped the walls in derision where they had been struck by stones from the
                    English engines. When Montague, earl of Salisbury, brought up to the walls a
                    military engine, like the Roman <hi rend="italic">estudo,</hi> called a sow, she
                    exclaimed in rhime,</p>
                <p>Beware Montagou, For farrow shall thy sow.</p>
                <p>A huge rock discharged from the battlements dashed the sow to pieces, and the
                    English soldiers who escaped from its ruins were called by the countess, in
                    derision, Montague’s pigs.</p>
                <p>The nature of the conferences between these high-minded heroines and their lovers
                    was somewhat peculiar. Their delectations were in tales of warlike exploits, and
                    in discourse of hunting and hawking. But when these topics were exhausted, they
                    found in metaphysical discussions of nice questions concerning the passion of
                    love, an endless source of interesting disquisition. The idea and definition of
                    a true and pure passion, illustrated by an hundred imaginary cases devised on
                    purpose, were managed in the same manner in which the schoolmen of the day
                    agitated their points of metaphysical theology. The Scotists and the Thomists,
                    whose useless and nonsensical debates cumbered the world with so many volumes of
                    absurd disquisition upon the most extravagant points of polemical divinity, saw
                    their theological labours rivalled in the courts of love, where the most
                    abstract reasoning was employed in discussing subtile questions upon the
                    exaggerated hopes, fears, doubts, and suspicions of lovers, the circumstances of
                    whose supposed cases were often ridiculous, sometimes criminal, sometimes
                    licentious, and almost always puerile and extravagant. These particulars will
                    fall to be more fully illustrated under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Troubadour.</hi> In the meanwhile, it is sufficient to state, that the
                    discussions in the courts of love regarded such important and interesting
                    questions as, Whether his love be most meritorious who has formed his passion
                    entirely on hearing, or his who has actually seen his mistress? with others of a
                    tendency equally edifying.</p>
                <p>Extremes of every kind border on each other; and as the devotion of the knights
                    of chivalry degenerated into superstition, the Platonic refinements and
                    subtilties of amorous passion which they professed were sometimes compatible
                    with very coarse and gross debauchery. W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> e have
                    seen that they derived from the Gothic tribes that high and reverential devotion
                    to the female sex which forms the strongest tint in the manners of chivalry. But
                    with the simplicity of these ancient times they lost their innocence; and woman,
                    though still worshipped with enthusiasm, as in the German forests, did not
                    continue to be (in all cases at least) the same pure object of worship. 'The
                    marriage-tie ceased to be respected; and as the youthful knights had seldom the
                    means or inclination to encumber themselves with wives and families, their
                    ladylove was often chosen among the married ladies of the court. It is true,
                    that such a connection was supposed to be consistent with all respect and
                    honour, and was regarded by the world, and sometimes by the husband, as a high
                    strain of Platonic sentiment, through which the character of its object in no
                    respect suffered. But nature vindicated herself for the violence offered to her;
                    and while the metaphysical students and pleaders in the courts of love professed
                    to aspire but to the lip or hand of their ladies, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354803" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4803-0600"/>and to make a merit of
                    renouncing all farther intrusion on their bounties, they privately indulged
                    themselves in loves which had very little either of delicacy or sentiment. In
                    the romance of the <hi rend="italic">Petit</hi><hi rend="italic">Jehan</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Saintré,</hi> that self-same Lady des Belles Cousines, who
                    lectures so learnedly upon the seven mortal sins, not only confers on her
                    deserving lover “le don d’amoureux merci,” but enters into a very unworthy and
                    disgraceful intrigue with a stout broad-shouldered abbot, into which no
                    sentiment whatever can be supposed to enter. The romance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tirante</hi><hi rend="italic">the White,</hi> praised by Cervantes as a
                    faithful picture of the knights and ladies of his age, seems to have been
                    written in an actual brothel, and, contrasted with others, may lead us to
                    suspect that their purity is that of romance, its profligacy that of reality.
                    This license was greatly increased by the crusades, from which the survivors of
                    these wild expeditions brought back the corrupted morals of the East, to avenge
                    the injuries they had inflicted on its inhabitants. Joinville has informed us of
                    the complaints which Saint Louis made to him in confidence, of the debaucheries
                    practised in his own royal tent, by his attendants, in this holy expedition. And
                    the ignominious punishment to which he subjected a knight, detected in such
                    excesses, shows what severe remedies he judged necessary to stem the increase of
                    libertinism.</p>
                <p>Indeed, the gross license which was practised during the middle ages may be well
                    estimated by the vulgar and obscene language that was currently used in talcs
                    and fictions addressed to the young and noblc of both sexes. In the romance of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Round Table,</hi> as Ascham sternly states, little was to
                    be learned but examples of homicide and adultery, although he had himself seen
                    it admitted to the antichamber of princes, when it was held a crime but to be
                    possessed of the word of God. In the romance of <hi rend="italic">Amadis de
                    Gaul,</hi> and many others, the heroines, without censure or imputation, confer
                    on their lovers the rights of a husband before the ceremony of the church gave
                    them a title to the name. These are serious narrations, in which decorum, at
                    least, is rarely violated; but the comic tales are of a grosser cast.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Canterbury Tales</hi> of Chaucer contain many narratives,
                    of which not only the diction, but the whole turn of the narrative, is extremely
                    gross. Yet it does not seem to have occurred to the author, a man of rank and
                    fashion, that they were improper to be recited, either in the presence of the
                    prioress· and her votaries, or in that of the noble knight who of his port was
                    meek as is a maid,</p>
                <p>And never yet no villany he said.</p>
                <p>And he makes but a light apology for including the disasters of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Millar of Trompington,</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">Absalom the
                    Gentle Clerk,</hi> in the same series of narrations with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Knight’s Tale.</hi> Many of Bandcllo’s most profligate novels are expressly
                    dedicated to females of rank and consideration; and, to conclude, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fabliaux,</hi> published by Barbazan and Lc Grand, are frequently
                    as revolting, from their naked grossness, as interesting from the lively
                    pictures which they present of life and manncrs. Yet these were the chosen
                    literary pastimes of the fair and the gay, during the times of chivalry,
                    listened to, we cannot but suppose, with an interest considerably superior to
                    that exhibited by the yawning audience who heard the theses of the courts of
                    love attacked and supported in logical form, and with metaphysical subtilty.</p>
                <p>Should the manners of the times appear inconsistent in these respects which we
                    have noticed, we must remember that we are ourselves variable and inconsistent
                    animals, and that, perhaps, the surest mode of introducing and encouraging any
                    particular vice, is to rank the corresponding virtue at a pitch unnatural in
                    itself, and beyond the ordinary attainment of humanity. The vows of celibacy
                    introduced profligacy among the Catholic clergy, as the high-flown and
                    overstrained Platonism of the professors of chivalry favoured the increase of
                    license and debauchery.</p>
                <p>After the love of God and of his lady, the <hi rend="italic">preux</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">chevalier</hi> was to be guided by that of glory and renown. He
                    was bound by his vow to seek out adventures of risk and peril, and never to
                    abstain from the quest which he might undertake, for any unexpected odds of
                    opposition which he might encounter. It was not indeed the sober and regulated
                    exercise of valour, but its fanaticism, which the genius of chivalry demanded of
                    its followers. Enterprises the most extravagant in conception, the most
                    difficult in execution, the most useless when achieved, were those by which an
                    adventurous knight chose to distinguish himself. There were solemn occasions
                    also on which these displays of chivalrous enthusiasm were specially expected
                    and called for. It is only sufficient to name the tournaments, single combats,
                    and solemn banquets, at which vows of chivalry were usually formed and
                    proclaimed.</p>
                <p>The tournaments were uniformly performed and frequented by the choicest and
                    noblest youth in Europe, until the fatal accident of Henry II. after which they
                    fell gradually into disuse. It was in vain that, from the various accidents to
                    which they gave rise, these dangerous amusements were prohibited by the heads of
                    the Christian church. The popes, infallible as they were deemed, might direct,
                    but could not curb, the military spirit of chivalry; they could excite crusades,
                    but they could not abolish tournaments. Their laws, customs, and regulations,
                    will fall properly under <hi rend="italic">a</hi> separate article. It is here
                    sufficient to observe, that these military games were of two kinds. In the most
                    ancient, meaning “nothing in hate, but all in honour,” the adventurous knights
                    fought with sharp swords and lances as in the day of battle. Even then, however,
                    the number of blows was usually regulated, or, in case of a general combat, some
                    rules were laid down to prevent too much slaughter. The regulations of Duke
                    Theseus for the tournament in Athens, as narrated by Chaucer in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Knight’s Tale,</hi> may give a good example of these restrictions.
                    When the combatants fought on foot, it was prohibited to strike otherwise than
                    at the head or body; the number of strokes to be dealt with the sword and
                    battle-axe were carefully numbered and limited, as well as the careers to be run
                    with the lance. In these circumstances alone, the combats at <hi rend="italic"
                    >outrance,</hi> as they were called, differed from encounters in actual war.</p>
                <p>In process of time, the dangers of the solemn justs, held under the authority of
                    princes, were modified by the introduction of arms of courtesy, as they were
                    termed, lances, namely, without heads, and with round braces of wood at the
                    extremity called <hi rend="italic">rockets,</hi> and swords without points, and
                    with blunted edges. But the risk continued great from bruises, falls, and the
                    closeness of the defensive armour of the times, in which the wearers were often
                    smothered. The weapons at <hi rend="italic">outrance</hi> were afterwards
                    chiefly used when knights of different and hostile countries engaged by
                    appointment, or when some adventurous gallants took upon them the execution of
                    an enterprise of arms <hi rend="italic">(pas clarrnes),</hi> in which they, as
                    challengers, undertook, for a certain time, and under certain conditions, to
                    support the honour of their country or their mistress against all comers. These
                    enterprises often ended fatally, but the knights who undertook them were
                    received in the foreign countries which they visited in accomplishment of their
                    challenge, with the highest deference and honour; their arrival was considered
                    as affording a sub<pb break="no" facs="nls:193354816"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4816-0601"/>ject of sport and jubilee to all ranks; and when
                    any mischance befel them, such as that of De Lindsay, who, in a tournament at
                    Berwick, had his helmet nailed to his skull, by the truncheon of a lance which
                    penetrated both, and died after devoutly confessing himself in the casque from
                    which they could not disengage him, the knights who looked on prayed that God
                    would vouchsafe them in his mercy a death so fair and so honourable. Stories of
                    such challenges, with the minute details of the events of the combat, form
                    frequent features in the histories of the age.</p>
                <p>The contests of the tournament and the pas d’armes were undertaken merely in
                    sport, and for thirst of honour. But the laws of the period afforded the
                    adventurous knight other and more serious combats, in which he might exercise
                    his valour. The custom of trying all doubtful cases by the body of a man, or, as
                    it was otherwise expressed, by the judgment of God—in plain words, by referring
                    the decision to the issue of a duel, prevailed universally among the Gothic
                    tribes, from the highest antiquity. A <hi rend="italic">salvo</hi> was devised
                    for the obvious absurdity of calling upon the weak to encounter the strong, a
                    churchman to oppose a soldier, or age to meet in the lists with activity and
                    youth. It was held that either party might appear personally, or by his
                    champion. This sage regulation gave exercise for the valour of the knights, who
                    were bound by their oaths to maintain the cause of those who had no other
                    protector. And, indeed, there is good reason to think that the inconveniences
                    and injustice of a law so absurd in itself as that of judicial combat, were
                    evaded and mitigated by the institutions of chivalry, since, among the number of
                    knights who were eagerly hunting after opportunities of military distinction, a
                    party incapable of supporting his own cause by combat could have little
                    difficulty in finding a formidable substitute; so that no one, however bold and
                    confident, could prosecute an unjust cause to the uttermost, without the risk of
                    encountering some champion of the innocent party from among the number of hardy
                    knights who traversed every, country seeking ostensible cause of battle.</p>
                <p>Besides these formal combats, it was usual for the adventurous knight to display
                    his courage by stationing himself at some pass in a forest, on a bridge, or
                    elsewhere, compelling all passengers to avouch the superiority of his own
                    valour, and the beauty of his mistress, or otherwise to engage with him in
                    single combat. When Alexius Comnenus received the homage of the crusaders,
                    seated upon his throne, previous to their crossing the Hellespont, during the
                    first crusade, a French baron seated himself by the side of the emperor of the
                    East. He was reproved by Baldwin, and answered in his native language, “what
                    ill-taught clown is this, who dares to keep bis seat when the flower of the
                    European nobility are standing around him !” The emperor, dissembling his
                    indignation, desired to know the birth and condition of the audacious Frank. “1
                    am,” replied the baron, “of the noblest race of France. For the rest, 1 only
                    know that there is near my castle a spot where four roads meet, and near it a
                    church where men, desirous of single combat, spend their time in prayer till
                    some one shall accept their challenge. Often have I frequented that chapel, but
                    never met I one who durst accept my defiance.” Thus the bridge of Rodomont, in
                    the Orlando Furioso, and the valiant defiance which the knight of La Mancha
                    hurled against the merchants of Toledo, who were bound to the fairs of Murcia,
                    were neither fictions of Ariosto nor Cervantes, but had their prototypes in real
                    story. The chivalrous custom of defying all and sundry to mortal combat
                    subsisted in the borders until the days of Queen Elizabeth, when the worthy
                    Bernard Gilpin found in his church of Houghton le Spring a glove hung over the
                    altar, which he was informed indicated a challenge to all who should take it
                    down. The remnants of the judicial combats, and the enterprises of arms, may be
                    found in the duels of the present day. In former days they still more resembled
                    each other; for, in the seventeenth century, not only the seconds on each side
                    regularly engaged, but it was usual to have more seconds, even to the number of
                    five or six; a custom pleasantly ridiculed by Lord Chesterfield in one of the
                    papers of <hi rend="italic">The World.</hi> It is obvious that an usage at once
                    so ridiculous and so detrimental to the peace and happiness of society must give
                    way, in proportion to the progress of common sense. The custom is in general
                    upon the wane, even as far as respects single combat between men who have
                    actually given or taken offence at each other. The general rules of
                    good-breeding prevent causes of such disagreement from arising in the
                    intercourse of society; and the forward duellist, who is solicitous in seeking
                    them out, is generally accounted a vulgar and ferocious, as well as a dangerous
                    character. At the same time, the habits derived from the days of chivalry still
                    retain a striking effect on our manners, and have fully established a graceful
                    as well as useful punctilio, which tends on the whole to the improvement of
                    society. Every man is under the impression, that neither his strength, his
                    wealth, his station, nor his wit, will excuse him from answering, at the risk of
                    his life, any unbecoming encroachment on the civility due to the weakest, the
                    poorest, the least important, or the most modest member of the society in which
                    he mingles. All too in the rank and station of gentlemen are forcibly called
                    upon to remember that they must resent the imputation of a voluntary falsehood
                    as the most gross injury; that the rights of the weaker sex demand protection
                    from every one who would hold a good character in society. In short, from the
                    wild and overstrained courtesies of chivalry has been derived our present system
                    of manners. It is not certainly faultless, and it is guarded by penalties which
                    we must often regret as disproportionably severe. Yet it has a grace and dignity
                    unknown to classic times, when women were slaves, and men coarse and vulgar, or
                    overbearing and brutal, as suited their own humour, without respect to that of
                    the rest of society.</p>
                <p>II. Such being the tone and spirit of chivalry, derived from love, devotion, and
                    valour, we have next to notice the special forms and laws of the order, which
                    will be found to correspond in every respect to the spirit which they were
                    designed to foster.</p>
                <p>The education of the future knight began at an early period. .The care of the
                    mother, after the first years of early youth were past, was deemed too tender,
                    and the indulgences of the paternal roof too effeminate, for the future aspirant
                    to the honours of chivalry. “Do you not bless God,” said the Lady Mabel to her
                    husband, the noble Duke Guerin of Montglaive, as on a solemn feast they looked
                    on their four hopeful sons, “do you not bless God, that has given you such a
                    promising issue ?” “Dame,” replied Guerin, in the true spirit of the age, “so
                    help me God and Saint Martin! nothing can do me greater despite than to look on
                    these four great lurdanes, who, arrived at such an age, yet do nothing but eat
                    the fat, and drink the sweet, and spend their time in idle amusement.”<note

                <p>The young and noble stripling, generally about his twelfth year, was transferred
                    from his father’s house to that of some baron or noble knight, sedulously chosen
                    by the anxious parent as that which had the best reputation for good order and
                    discipline. The children of the first nobles and high crown vassals were
                    educated by the royal court. And, however the reins of discipline might be in
                    particular cases relaxed, or become corrupted in latter days, the theory was
                    uniformly excellent. The youth, who was to learn modesty, obedience, and address
                    in arms and horsemanship, was daily exercised in the use of arms, beginning with
                    such as were suited to his strength. He was instructed how to manage a horse
                    with grace and dexterity; how to use the bow and the sword; how to manage the
                    lance, an art which was taught by making him ride a career against a wooden
                    figure holding a buckler, called a quintaine. This quintaine turned on an axis;
                    and as there was a wooden sword in the other hand of the supposed opponent, the
                    young cavalier, if he did not manage his horse and weapon with address, was
                    liable to receive a blow when the shock of his charge made the quintaine spin
                    round.</p>
                <p>Besides these exercises, the noble youth was required to do the work which, in
                    some respects, belonged to a menial, but not as a menial. He attended his lord
                    during the chase, the rules of which, as an image of war, and as held the
                    principal occupation of a gentleman during peace, were carefully inculcated. He
                    was taught the principal blasts or notes of <hi rend="italic">vénerie,</hi> to
                    be sounded when the hounds were uncoupled, when the prey was on foot, when he
                    was brought to bay, and when he fell. This art did not tend solely to amusement.
                    The “gentle damosel,” to use the language of the times, learned to bear the
                    fatigue, the hunger and thirst, which huntsmen are exposed to. By the necessity
                    of encountering and dispatching a stag, a boar, or a wolf, at bay, he learned
                    promptitude and courage in the use of his weapons. The accuracy with which he
                    was required to study the attacks of the hunted animal’s course gave him habits
                    of attention and reflection. In the days and nights spent in the chase, amid
                    wide and pathless forests, he acquired the art, so necessary to a soldier, of
                    remarking and studying the face of the country. When benighted, he was taught to
                    steer his course by the stars, if they were visible; if not, to make his couch
                    with patience on the withered leaves, or in a tree. Had he lost his way by
                    day-time, he distinguished the points of the compass by remarking which side of
                    the trees were most covered with moss, and from which they threw their branches
                    most freely; circumstances which, compared with the known course of the
                    prevailing wind, afforded him the necessary information.</p>
                <p>The ceremonial of the chase was to be acquired, as well as its arts. To brittle
                    or break the deer (in French <hi rend="italic">faire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >la</hi><hi rend="italic">curée'),</hi> in plain terms, to flay and disembowel
                    the stag, a matter in which much precision was required, and the rules of which
                    were ascribed to the celebrated Sir Tristram of Lionesse, was an indispensable
                    requisite of the page’s education. Nor did his concern with the venison end
                    here; he placed it on the table, waited during the banquet, and carved the
                    ponderous dishes when required or permitted to do so. Much grace and delicacy,
                    it was supposed, might be displayed on these occasions; and in one romance we
                    read of the high birth and breeding of a page being ascertained, by his
                    scrupulously declining to use a towel to wipe his hands, when washed, before he
                    began to carve, and contenting himself with waving them in the air till they
                    dried of themselves. It is perhaps difficult to estimate the force of this
                    delicacy, unless by supposing that he had not a towel or napkin appropriated to
                    his own separate use.</p>
                <p>Amidst these various instructions the page was often required to wait upon the
                    ladies, rather as attending a sort of superior beings, to whom adoration and
                    obsequious service were due, than as ministering to the convenience of human
                    creatures like himself. The most modest demeanour, the most profound respect,
                    was to be observed in the presence of these fair idols. Thus the veneration due
                    to the female character was taught to the acolyte of chivalry, by his being
                    placed so near female beauty, yet prohibited the familiarity which might
                    discover female weakness. Love frequently mingled with this early devotion, and
                    the connection betwixt some lady of distinction and her gallant knight is often,
                    in romantic fiction, supposed to have originated from some early affection. In a
                    romance called <hi rend="italic">The Golden Thread</hi> (of which we have only
                    seen a modern edition in German, but which has many features of originality),
                    when the daughter of the count bestows her annual gifts on her father’s
                    household, she gives the page Leofried, in derision, a single thread of gold
                    tissue. To show the value which he places upon the most minute memorial, coming
                    from such a hand, the youth opens a wound in his bosom, and deposits the
                    precious thread in the neighbourhood of his heart. The Dame des Belles Cousines,
                    whom we have already mentioned, was assuredly not the only lady of high rank who
                    was tempted to give a handsome young page the benefit of her experience in
                    completing his education. This led the way to abuse; and the custom of breeding
                    up youths as pages in the houses of the great, although it survived the decay of
                    chivalry, was often rather the introduction to indolence, mischief, and
                    debauchery, than to useful knowledge and the practice of arms. The proper
                    purposes of this preliminary part of chivalrous education are well given by one
                    of the characters in Ben Jonson’s <hi rend="italic">New Inn;</hi> and he is
                    answered by another, who alleges, with satire resembling that of Juvenal, the
                    modern corruptions of the order of pages. Lord Lovel has requested mine host to
                    give him his son for a page. The host answers, by declaring he would’rather hang
                    his child with his own hand</p>
                <p>Than damn him to that desperate course of life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lονel.</hi> Call you that desperate which, by a line</p>
                <p>Of institution from our ancestors,</p>
                <p>Hath been derived down to us, and received</p>
                <p>In a succession, for the noblest way</p>
                <p>Of breeding up our youth in letters, arms, Fair mein, discourses, civil
                    exercises, And all the blazon of a gentleman?</p>
                <p>Where can he learn to vault, to ride, to fence,</p>
                <p>To mar his body gracefully, to speak His language purer, or to turn his mind Or
                    manners more to the harmony of nature, Than in those nurseries of nobility?</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ll&lt;,st.</hi> Aye, that was when the nursery’s self was
                    noble, And only virtue made it not the market.</p>
                <p>And he replies by enumerating instances of the decay of honour among the nobles,
                    and of the debauchery of their household pages. In La Noue’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Political and Military P&gt;iscozcrses</hi> is a similar complaint of the
                    hazards to which the morals of young gentlemen were exposed while acting in this
                    domestic capacity. Nevertheless the custom of having young gentlemen thus bred,
                    continued in a certain degree down to the last century, although those destined
                    to such employments became by degrees of a lower quality. In some few instances
                    the institution was maintained in its purity; and the page, when leaving the
                    family in which he was educated, usually obtained a commission. The last
                    instance we know was that of a gentleman bred a page in the family of the
                    Duchess of Buccleuch and Monmouth, who died, during the reign of George III. a
                    general officer in his majesty’s service.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354842" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4842-0603"/>
                <p>When advancing age and experience in the use of arms had qualified the page for
                    the hardships and dangers of actual war, he was removed from the lowest to the
                    second gradation of chivalry, and became an <hi rend="italic">Escuyer</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> Esquire, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Squire.</hi>
                    The derivation of this phrase has been much contested. It has been generally
                    supposed to be derived from its becoming the official duty of the esquire to
                    carry the shield <hi rend="italic">(escu) of</hi> the knight his master, until
                    he was about to engage the enemy. Others have fetched the epithet (more remotely
                    certainly) from <hi rend="italic">scuria,</hi> a stable, the charger of the
                    knight being under the especial care of the squire. Others again ascribe the
                    derivation of the word to the right which the squire himself had to carry a
                    shield, and to blazon it with armorial bearings. This, in later times, became
                    almost the exclusive meaning attached to the appellative esquire; and,
                    accordingly, if the phrase now means anything, it means a gentleman having right
                    to carry arms. There is reason, however, to think that this is a secondary
                    meaning of the word, for we do not find the word escuyer applied as a title of
                    rank, until so late as the Ordonnance of Blois, in 1579.</p>
                <p>The candidate for the honours of chivalry, now an immediate attendant on the
                    knight or nobleman, was withdrawn from the private apartments of the ladies, and
                    only saw them upon occasions of stated ceremony. In great establishments there
                    were squires of different ranks, and destined for different services; but we
                    shall confine ourselves to those general duties which properly belonged to the
                    office. The squire assisted his master in the offices at once of a modern valet
                    dc chambre and groom—he attended to dress and to undress him, trained his horses
                    to the menage, and kept his arms bright and burnished. He did the honours of the
                    household to the strangers who visited it; and the,reputation of the prince or
                    great lord whom he served was much exalted by the manner in which these
                    courteous offices were discharged. In the words of Chaucer, describing the
                    character of the squire,</p>
                <p>Curteis he was, lowly and servisable, And carf before his fader at the table.</p>
                <p>The squire was also expected to perfect himself in the accomplishments of the
                    period, and not only to be a master of the ceremonial of the feast, but to be
                    capable of enlivening it by his powers of conversation. He was expected to
                    understand chess, draughts, and other domestic games. Poetry and music, if he
                    had any turn for these beautiful arts, and whatever other accomplishments could
                    improve the mind or the person, were accounted to grace his station. And
                    accordingly Chaucer’s squire, besides that he was “singing or fluting all the
                    day,”</p>
                <p>—Could songs make, and well indite,</p>
                <p>Just, and eke dance, and well pourtray and write.</p>
                <p>Unquestionably few possessed all these attributes; but the poet, with his usual
                    precision and vivacity, has given us the picture of a perfect esquire.</p>
                <p>To understand the squires’ mode of life more particularly, it is necessary to
                    consider that which was led in the courts and castles of the middle ages.
                    Froissart has given us a very striking account of the mode of house-keeping in
                    the family of Gaston, earl of Foix, a prince whose court was considered as a
                    first-rate nursery for the noble youth; and, from his lively description, we may
                    in some measure conceive the mode in which the esquires spent their time.
                    Froissart abode in his house above twelve weeks, much recommended to the
                    favourable notice of the earl, by his having brought with him a book containing
                    all the songs, ballads, and virilays, which Wencislaus of Bohemia, the gentle
                    Duke of Brabant, had made, and the historian himself had compiled or
                    transcribed. “Every night after supper,” says Froissart, “I read thereon to him,
                    and while I read there was none durst speak any thing to interrupt me, so much
                    did the earl delight in listening.” The quotation necessary to describe the Earl
                    of Foix, and the economy of his household, must necessarily be a long one, but
                    it is a picture by the hand of an inimitable artist, of a school of chivalry
                    when chivalry was at its highest pitch, and we are unwilling to destroy the
                    likeness by abridging it.</p>
                <p>“This erle Gascone of Foix, with whom I was, at that tyme, he was of a fyftie
                    yere of age and nyne: and, I say, I have in my tyme sene many knights, kynges,
                    princes, and others, but I neuer saw none like him of personage, nor of so fayre
                    forme, nor so well made; his vysage fayre, sanguyne, and smylyng, his eyen gray
                    and amorous, wher as he lyst to set his regarde; in euery thyng he was so
                    parfite that he can not be praised to moche; he loued that ought to be beloued,
                    and hated that ought to be hated: he was a wyse knyght, of highe enterprise, and
                    of good counsayle; he neuer had myscreant with hym; he sayd many orisons every
                    day, a nocturn of the psalter, matyns of our Lady, of the Holy Goost, and of the
                    crosse, and dirige euery day; he gaue fyue florins, in small monies, at his gate
                    to poor folkes for the loue of God; he was large and courtesse in gyftes; he
                    could ryght well take where it par-teyned to hym, and to delyuer agayne wher as

                    two monethes, two of them shulde serue for his receyte; for, at the two monethes
                    end, he wolde change and put other two into that offiyce; and one that he
                    trusted best shulde be his comptroller, and to hym all other shulde accompt, and
                    the comptroller shulde accōpt to hym by rolles and bokes written, and the
                    comptes to remayne still with therle: he had certeyne cofers in his chambre, out
                    of the whiche oftetymes he wolde take money to gyve to lordes, knightes, and
                    squyers, suche as came to hym, for none shulde departe from him without some
                    gift, and yet dayly he multiplyed his treasure, to re-syst the aduētures and
                    fortunes that he douted; he was of good and easy acquayntance with every man,
                    and amorously wolde speke to the; he was short in counsayle, and answers; he had
                    four secretaries, and at his rising they must ever be redy at his hande, without
                    any callynge; and whan any letter were delyuered him, and that he had reed it,
                    than he wolde calle them to write agayne, or els for some other thynge. In this
                    estate therle of Foix liued. And at mydnight, whan he came out of his chambre
                    into the hall to supper, he had ever before him xii. torches brennyng, borne by
                    xii. varlettes standying before his table all supper; they gaue a gret light,
                    and the hall ever full of knightes and squyers, and many other tables dressed to
                    suppe who wolde; ther was none should spcke to hym at his table, but if he were
                    called; his meate was lightlye wyldc foule, the legges and wynges alonely, and

                <p>While the courage of the young aspirant to the honours of knighthood was
                    animated, and his emulation excited, by the society in which he was placed, and
                    the conversation to which he listened,—while everything was done which the times
                    admitted to refine his manners, and, in a certain degree, to cultivate his
                    understanding,—the personal exercises to which he had been trained while a page
                    were now to be pursued with increasing assiduity, proportional to the increase
                    of his strength. “He was taught,” says a historian, speaking of Boucicaut, while
                    a squire, “to spring upon a horse, while armed at all points; to exercise
                    himself in running; to strike for a length of time with the axe or club; to
                    dance and throw somersets, entirely armed, excepting the helmet; to mount on
                    horseback behind one of his comrades, by barely laying his hands on his sleeve;
                    to raise himself betwixt two partition walls to any height, by placing his back
                    against the one, and his knees and hands against the other; to mount a ladder,
                    placed against a tower, upon the reverse or under side, solely by the aid of his
                    hands, and without touching the rounds with his feet; to throw the javelin, to
                    pitch'the bar ;” to do all, in short, which could exercise the body to feats of
                    strength and agility, in order to qualify him for the exploits of war. For this
                    purpose also, the esquires had their tourneys separate and distinct from those
                    of the knights. They were usually solemnized on the eve of the more formal and
                    splendid tournaments, in which the knights themselves displayed their valour;
                    and lighter weapons than those of the knights, though of the same kind, were
                    employed by the esquires. But, as we shall presently notice, the most
                    distinguished among the esquires were (notwithstanding the high authority of the
                    knight of La Mancha to the contrary) frequently admitted to the honours and
                    dangers of the more solemn encounter.</p>
                <p>In actual war the page was not expected to render much service, but that of the
                    squire was important and indispensable. Upon a march, he bore the helmet and
                    shield of the knight, and led his horse of battle, a tall heavy animal, fit to
                    bear the weight of a man in armour, but which was led in hand upon a march,
                    while the knight rode an ambling hackney. The squire was also qualified to
                    perform the part of an armourer, not only lacing his master’s heb met and
                    buckling his cuirass, but also closing with a hammer the rivets by which the
                    various pieces were united to each other. This was a point of the utmost
                    consequence; and many instances occur of mischances happening to celebrated
                    warriors when the duty was negligently performed. In the actual shock of battle
                    the esquire attended closely on the banner of his master, or on his person, if
                    he were only a knight bachelor, kept pace with him during the melée, and was at
                    hand to remount him when his steed was slain, or relieve him when oppressed by
                    numbers. If the knight made prisoners, they were the charge of the esquire; if
                    the esquire himself fortuned to make one, the ransom belonged to his master.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the knights who received these important services from their
                    esquires were expected to display towards them that courteous liberality which
                    made so distinguished a point of the chivalrous character. Lord Audley led the
                    van of the Black Prince’s army at the battle of Poitiers, attended by four
                    squires, who had promised not to fail him. They distinguished themselves in the
                    front of that bloody day, leaving such as they overcame to be made prisoners by
                    others, and ever pressing forwards where resistance was offered. Thus they
                    fought in the chief of the battle, until Lord James Audley was sorely wounded,
                    and his breath failed him. At the last, when the battle was gained, the four
                    faithful esquires bore him out of the press, disarmed him, and staunched and
                    dressed his wounds as they could. As the Black Prince called for the man to whom
                    the victory was in some measure owing, Lord Audley was borne before him in a
                    litter, when the prince, after having awarded to him the praise and renown above
                    all others who fought on that day, bestowed on him five hundred marks of yearly
                    revenue, to be assigned out of his heritage in England. Lord Audley accepted of
                    the gift with due demonstration of gratitude; but no sooner was he brought to
                    his lodging, than he called before him the four esquires by whom he had been so
                    gallantly seconded, and the nobles of his lineage, and informed his kinsmen,
                    “Sirs, it has pleased my lord the prince to bestow on me five hundred marks of
                    heritage, of which I am unworthy; for I have done him but small service. Behold,
                    Sirs, these four squires, which have always served me truly, and specially this
                    day; the honour that I have is by their valour. Therefore, I resign to them and
                    their heirs for ever, in like manner as it was given to me, the noble gift which
                    the prince hath assigned me.” The lords beheld each other, and agreed it was a
                    proof of great chivalry to bestow so royal a gift, and gladly undertook to bear
                    witness to the transfer. When Edward heard these tidings, he sent for Lord
                    Audley, and desired to know why he had bestowed on others the gift he had
                    assigned him, and whether it had not been acceptable to him: “Sir,” said Lord
                    Audley, “these four squires have followed me well and truly in several severe
                    actions, and at this battle they served me so well, that had they done nothing
                    else, I had been bound to reward them. I am myself but a single man; but, by aid
                    of their united strength and valour, I was enabled to execute the vow which I
                    had made to give the onset in the first battle in which the king of England or
                    his sons should be present; and had it not been for them, I must have been left
                    dead on the field. This is the reason I have transferred your highnesses bounty,
                    as ro those by whom it was best deserved.” The Black Prince not only approved of
                    and confirmed Lord Audley’s grant, but conferred upon him, not to be outdone in
                    generosity, a yearly revenue of six hundred marks more, for his own use.<note

                    rend="italic">History of Edward 1II∙</hi></p></note> The names of the esquires
                    who thus distinguished themselves, and experienced such liberality at the hands
                    of their leader, were Delves of Doddington, Dutton of Dutton, Fowlishurst of
                    Crewe, and Hawkestone of Wreyne-hill, all Cheshire families. This memorable
                    instance may suffice to show the extent of gratitude which the knights
                    entertained for the faithful service of their squires; but it also leads us to
                    consider some other circumstances relating to the order of esquire.</p>
                <p>Although, in its primitive and proper sense, the state of esquire was merely
                    preparatory to that of knighthood, yet it is certain that many men of birth and
                    property rested content with attaining that first step, and, though greatly
                    distinguished by their feats of arms, never rose, nor apparently sought to rise,
                    above the rank which it conferred. It does not appear that any of the esquires
                    of Lord Audley were knighted after the battle of Poitiers, although there can be
                    no doubt that their rank, as well as their exploits, entitled them to expect
                    that honour. The truth seems to be, that it may frequently have been more
                    convenient, and scarcely less honourable, to remain in the unenvied and
                    unpretendingrank of esquire, than to aspire to that of knighthood, without a
                    considerable fortune to supply the expenses of that dignity. No doubt, in
                    theory, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354868" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4868-0605"/>the
                    simplest knight-bachelor was a companion, and in some degree equal with princes.
                    But, in truth, we shall presently see, that, where unsupported by some sort of
                    income to procure suitable equipment and retainers, that dignity was sometimes
                    exposed to ridicule. Many gallant gentlemen, therefore, remained esquires,
                    either attached to the service of some prince or eminent nobleman, or frequently
                    in a state of absolute independence, bringing their own vassals to the field,
                    whom, in such cases, they were entitled to muster under a <hi rend="italic"
                    >penoneele,</hi> or small triangular streamer, somewhat like the naval pendant
                    of the present day. The reader of history is not, therefore, to suppose, that
                    where he meets with an esquire of distinguished name, he is therefore
                    necessarily to consider him as a youthful candidate for the honour of
                    knighthood, and attending upon some knight or noble. This is, indeed, the
                    primitive, but not the uniform meaning of the title. So many men of rank and
                    gallantry appear to have remained esquires, that, by degrees, many of the
                    leading distinctions between them and the knights were relaxed or abandoned. In
                    Froissart’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicles</hi> we find that esquires frequently
                    led independent bodies of men, and, as we have before hinted, mingled with the
                    knights in the games of chivalry; the difference chiefly consisting in title,
                    precedence, the shape of the flag under which they arrayed their followers, and
                    the fashion of their armour. The esquires were permitted to bear a shield,
                    emblazoned, as we have already seen, with armorial bearings. There seems to have
                    been some difference in the shape of the helmet; and the French esquire was not
                    permitted to wear the complete hauberk, but only the shirt of mail, without hood
                    or sleeves. But the principal distinction between the independent esquire
                    (terming him such who was attached to no knight’s service) and the knight, was
                    the spurs, which the esquire might wear of silver, but by no means gilded.</p>
                <p>To return to the esquires most properly so termed, their dress was, during their
                    period of probation, simple and modest, and ought regularly to have been made of
                    brown, or some other uniform and simple colour. This was not, however,
                    essential. The garment of Chaucer’s squire was embroidered like a meadow. The
                    petit Jehan de Saintré was supplied with money by his mistress to purchase a
                    silken doublet and embroidered hose. There is also a very diverting account, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Bertrand de Guesclin,</hi> of the manner in
                    which he prevailed on his uncle, a covetous old churchman, to assign him money
                    for his equipment on some occasion of splendour. We may therefore hold, that the
                    sumptuary laws of squirehood were not particularly attended to, or strictly
                    enforced.</p>
                <p>A youth usually ceased to be a page at fourteen, or a little earlier, and could
                    not regularly receive the honour of knighthood until he was one and twenty. But
                    if their distinguished valour anticipated their years, the period of probation
                    was shortened. Princes of the blood-royal, also, and other persons of very high
                    eminence, had this term abridged, and sometimes so much so as to throw a
                    ridicule upon the order of knighthood, by admitting within “the temple of
                    honour,” as it was the fashion of the times to call it, children who could
                    neither understand nor discharge the duties of the office to which they were
                    thus prematurely called.</p>
                <p>The third and highest rank of fchivalry was that of knighthood. In considering
                    this last dignity, we shall first inquire how it was conferred; secondly, the
                    general privileges and duties of the order; thirdly, the peculiar ranks into
                    which it was finally divided, and the difference betwixt them.</p>
                <p>• KnΓghthood was, in its origin, an order of a republican, or at least an
                    oligarchic nature; arising, as has been shown, from the customs of the free
                    tribes of Germany, and, in its essence, not requiring the sanction of a monarch.
                    On the contrary, each knight could confer the order of knighthood upon
                    whomsoever preparatory noviciate and probation had fitted to receive it. The
                    highest potentate sought the <hi rend="italic">accolade,</hi> or stroke which
                    conferred the honour, at the hands of the worthiest knight whose achievements
                    had dignified the period. Thus Francis I. requested the celebrated Bayard, <hi
                    rend="italic">the Good Knight without reproach or fear,</hi> to make him; an
                    honour which Bayard valued so highly, that, on sheathing his sword, he vowed
                    never more to use that blade, except against Turks, Moors, and Saracens. The
                    same principle was carried to extravagance in a romance, where the hero is
                    knighted by the hand of Sir Lancelot of the Lake, when dead. A sword was put
                    into the hand of the skeleton, which was so guided as to let it drop on the neck
                    of the aspirant. In the time of Francis I. it had already become customary to
                    desire this honour at the hands of greatness rather than valour, so that the
                    king’s request was considered as an appeal to the first principles of chivalry.
                    In theory, however, the power of creating knights was supposed to be inherent in
                    every one who had reached that dignity. But it was natural that the soldier
                    should desire to receive the highest military honour from the general under
                    whose eye he was to combat, or from the prince or noble at whose court he passed
                    as page and squire through the gradations of his noviciate. It was equally
                    desirable, on the other hand, that the prince or noble should desire to be the
                    immediate source of a privilege so important. And thus, though no positive
                    regulation took place on the subject, ambition on the part of the aspirant, and
                    pride and policy on that of the sovereign princes and nobles of high rank,
                    gradually limited to the latter the power of conferring knighthood, or drew at
                    least an unfavourable distinction between the knights dubbed by private
                    individuals, and those who, with more state and solemnity, received the honoured
                    title at the hand of one of high rank. Indeed, the change which took place
                    respecting the character and consequences of the ceremony, naturally led to a
                    limitation in the right of conferring it. While the order of knighthood merely
                    implied a right to wear arms of a certain description, and to bear a certain
                    title, there could be little harm in intrusting, to any one who had already
                    received the honour, the power of conferring it on others. But when this highest
                    order of chivalry conferred not only personal dignity, but the right of
                    assembling under the banner, or pennon, a certain number of soldiers,—when
                    knighthood implied not merely personal privileges, but military rank,—it was
                    natural that sovereigns should use every effort to concentrate the right of
                    conferring such distinction in themselves, or their immediate delegates. And
                    latterly it was held, that the rank of knight only conferred those privileges on
                    such as were dubbed by sovereign princes.</p>
                <p>The times and place usually chosen for the creation of knights were favourable to
                    the claim of the sovereigns to be the proper fountain of chivalry. Knights were
                    usually made either on the eve of battle, or when the victory had been obtained;
                    or they were created during the pomp of some solemn warning or grand festival.
                    In the former case, the right of creation was naturally referred to the general
                    or prince who led the host; and in the latter, to the sovereign of the court
                    where the festival was held. The forms in these cases were very different.</p>
                <p>When knights were made in the actual field of battle, little solemnity was
                    observed, and the form was probably the same with which private individuals had,
                    in earlier times, conferred the honour on each other. The novice, armed at all
                    points, but without helmet, sword, and spurs, came before the prince or general
                    at whose hands he was to receive knighthood, and kneeled down, while two
                    persons<pb break="no" facs="nls:193354881" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4881-0606"/> of
                    distinction, who acted as his godfathers, and were supposed to become pledges
                    for his being worthy of the honour to which he aspired, buckled on his gilded
                    spurs, and belted him with his sword. He then received the accolade, a slight
                    blow on the neck, with the flat of the sword, from the person who dubbed him,
                    who, at the same time, pronounced a formula to this effect; “I dub thee knight,
                    in the name of God and St Michael (or in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy
                    Ghost). Be faithful, bold, and fortunate.” The new-made knight had then only to
                    take his place in the ranks of war, and endeavour to distinguish himself by his
                    forward gallantry in the approaching action, when he was said to win his spurs.
                    It is well known that, at the battle of Cressy, Edward 111. refused to send
                    succours to the Black Prince, until he should hear that he was wounded or
                    dismounted, being determined he should, on that memorable day, have full
                    opportunity to <hi rend="italic">τvin his spurs.</hi> It may be easily imagined,
                    that on such occasions the courage of the young knights was wound up to the
                    highest pitch; and, as many were usually made at the same time, their gallantry
                    could not fail to have influence on the fortune of the day. At the siege of
                    Tholouse (1159), Henry II. of England made thirty knights at once, one of whom
                    was Malcolm IV. king of Scotland. Even on these occasions the power of making
                    knights was not understood to be limited to the commander-in-chief. At the fatal
                    battle of Homildown, in 1401, Sir John Swinton, a warrior of distinguished
                    talents, observing the slaughter made by the English archery, exhorted the Scots
                    to rush on to a closer engagement. Adam Gordon, between whose family and that of
                    Swinton a deadly feud existed, hearing this sage counsel, knelt down before
                    Swinton, and prayed him to confer on him the honour of knighthood, which he
                    desired to receive from the wisest and boldest knight in the host. Swinton
                    conferred the order; and they both rushed down upon the English host, followed
                    only by a few cavalry. If they had been supported, the attack might have turned
                    the fate of the day. But none followed their gallant example, and both champions
                    fell. It need hardly be added, that the commander, whether a sovereign prince or
                    not, equally exercised the privilege of conferring knighthood. In the old ballad
                    of the battle of Otterburn, Douglas boasts that, since he had entered England,
                    he had</p>
                <p>With brand dubb’d many a knight.</p>
                <p>But it was not in camps and armies alone that the honours of knighthood were
                    conferred. At the <hi rend="italic">Cour</hi><hi rend="italic">Plénière,</hi> a
                    high court to which sovereigns summoned their crown vassals at the solemn
                    festivals of the church, at the various occasions of solemnity which occurred in
                    the royal family, from marriage, birth, baptism, and the like, the monarch was
                    wont to confer on novices in chivalry its highest honour, and the ceremonies
                    used on such investiture added to the dignity of the occasion. It was then that
                    the full ritual was observed which, on the eve of battle, was necessarily
                    abridged or omitted. The candidates watched their arms all night in a church or
                    chapel, and prepared for the honour to be conferred on them, by vigil, fast, and
                    prayer. They were solemnly divested of the brown frock, which was the
                    appropriate dress of the squire; and having been bathed, as a symbol of
                    purification of heart, they were attired in the richer garb appropriate to
                    knighthood. They were then solemnly invested with the appropriate arms of a
                    knight; and it was not unusual to call the attention of the novice to a mystical
                    or allegorical explanation of each piece of armour as it was put on. These
                    exhortations consisted in strange and extravagant parallels betwixt the temporal
                    and spiritual state of warfare, in which the metaphor was hunted down in every
                    possible shape. The under dress of the knight was a close jacket of chamois
                    leather, over which was put the mail shirt, composed of rings of steel
                    artificially fitted into each other, as is still the fashion in some parts of
                    Asia. A suit of plate armour was put on over the mail shirt, and the legs and
                    arms were defended in the same manner. Even this accumulation of defensive
                    armour was by some thought insufficient. In the combat of the Infantes of
                    Carrion with the champions of the Cid, one of the former was yet more completely
                    defended, and to little purpose.</p>

                <p>The novice being accoutred in his knightly armour, but without helmet, sword, and
                    spurs, a rich mantle was flung over him, and he was conducted in solemn
                    procession to the church or chapel in which the ceremony was to be performed,
                    supported by his godfathers, and attended.with as much pomp as circumstances
                    admitted. High mass was then said, and the novice, advancing to the altar,
                    received from the sovereign the accolade. The churchman present, of highest
                    dignity, often belted on his sword, which, for that purpose, had been previously
                    deposited on the altar; and the spurs were sometimes fastened on by ladies of
                    quality. The oath of chivalry was then taken, to be loyal to God, the king, and
                    the ladies. Such were the outlines of the ceremony, which, however, was varied
                    according to circumstances. A king of Portugal knighted his son in presence of
                    the dead body of the Marquis of Marialva, slain in that day’s action, and
                    impressively conjured the young prince to do his duty in life and death, like
                    the good knight who lay dead before him. Alms to the poor, largesses to the
                    heralds and minstrels, a liberal gift to the church, were necessary
                    accompaniments to the investiture of a person of rank. The new-made knight was
                    conducted from the church with music and acclamations, and usually mounted his
                    horse and executed some curvets in presence of the multitude, couching his
                    lance, and brandishing it as if impatient to open his knightly career. It was at
                    such times also that the most splendid tournaments were executed, it being
                    expected that the young knights would display the utmost efforts to distinguish
                    themselves. Such being the solemnities with which knighthood was conferred, it
                    was no wonder that the power of conferring it should, in peace as well as in
                    war, be almost confined to sovereign princes, or nobles who nearly equalled them
                    in rank and independence. By degrees these restrictions were drawn more and more
                    close, and at length it was held that none buta sovereign, or a
                    commander-in-chief displaying the royal banner, and vested with plenary and
                    vice-regal authority, could confer the degree of knighthood. ∣ Queen Elizabeth
                    was particularly jealous of this part of her prerogative; and nothing more
                    excited her displeasure and indignation against her favourite Essex, than the
                    profuseness with which be distributed the honour at Cadiz, and afterwards in
                    Ireland. These anecdotes, however, belong to the decay of chivalry.</p>
                <p>The knight had several privileges of dignity and importance. He was associated
                    into a rank wherein kings and princes were in one sense only his equals. He took
                    precedence in war and in counsel, and was addressed by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354894" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4894-0607"/>the respectful title of <hi

                    and his wife by that of Madame and Dame. A knight was also, in point of military
                    rank, qualified to command any body of men under a thousand. His own service was
                    performed on horseback, and in complete armour of many various fashions,
                    according to the taste of the warriors and the fashion of the age. Chaucer has
                    enumerated some of these varieties.</p>

                <p>The weapons of offence, however, most appropriate to knighthood were the lance
                    and sword. They had frequently a battle-axe or mace at their saddle -bow, a
                    formidable weapon even to men sheathed in iron like themselves. The knight had
                    also a dagger, which he used when at close quarters. It was called the dagger of
                    mercy, probably because, when unsheathed, it behoved the antagonist to crave
                    mercy or to die. The management of the lance and of the horse was the principal
                    requisite of knighthood. To strike the foeman either on the helmet or full upon
                    the breast with the point of the lance, and at full speed, was accounted perfect
                    practice; to miss him, or to break a lance across, z. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi>
                    athwart the body of the antagonist, without striking him with the point, was
                    accounted an awkward failure; to strike his horse, or to hurt his person under
                    the girdle, was conceived a foul or felon action, and could only be excused by
                    the hurry of a general encounter. When the knights, from the nature of the
                    ground, or other circumstances, alighted to fight on foot, they used to cut some
                    part from the length of their spears, in order to render them more manageable,
                    like the pikes used by infantry. But their most formidable onset was when
                    mounted and “in host.” They seem then to have formed squadrons not unlike the
                    present disposition of cavalry in the field,—their squires forming the rear
                    rank, and performing the part of serrefiles. As the horses were trained in the
                    tourneys and exercises to run upon each other without flinching, the shock of
                    two such bodies of heavy-armed cavalry was dreadful, and the event usually
                    decided the battle; for, until the Swiss showed the superior steadiness which
                    could be exhibited by infantry, all great actions were decided by the
                    men-at-arms. The yeomanry of England, indeed, formed a singular exception; and,
                    from the dexterous use of the long bow, to which they were trained from infancy,
                    were capable of withstanding and destroying the mail-clad chivalry both of
                    France and Scotland. Their shafts, according to the exaggerating eloquence of a
                    monkish historian, Thomas of 'Walsingham, penetrated steel coats from side to
                    side, transfixed helmets, and even splintered lances and pierced through swords!
                    But against every other pedestrian adversary, the knights, squires, and
                    men-at-arms had the most decided advantage, from their impenetrable armour, the
                    strength of their horses, and the fury of their onset. To render success yet
                    more certain, and attack less hazardous, the horse, on the safety of which the
                    rider so much depended, was armed <hi rend="italic">en barbe,</hi> as it was
                    called, like himself. A masque made of iron covered the animal’s face and ears;
                    it had a breastplate, and armour for the croupe. The strongest horses were
                    selected for this service; they were generally stallions, and to ride a mare was
                    reckoned base and unknightly.</p>
                <p>To distinguish him in battle, as his face was hid by the helmet, the knight wore
                    above his armour a surcoat, as it was called, like a herald’s coat, on which his
                    arms were emblazoned. Others had them painted on the shield, a small triangular
                    buckler of light wood, covered with leather, and sometimes plated with steel,
                    which, as best suited him, the knight could either wield on his left arm, or
                    suffer to hang down from his neck, as an additional defence to his breast, when
                    the left hand was required for the management of the horse. The shape of these
                    shields is preserved, being that on which heraldric coats are most frequently
                    blazoned. But it is something remarkable, that no one of those <hi rend="italic"
                    >heater</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So called
                    because resembling in shape the heater of a smoothing-iron.</p></note> shields
                    has been preserved in the Tower, or, so far as we know, in any English
                    collection. The helmet was surmounted by a crest, which the knight adopted after
                    his own fancy. There was deadly offence taken if one knight, without right,
                    assumed the armorial bearings of another; and history is full of disputes on
                    that head, some of which terminated fatally. The heralds were the persons
                    appealed to on these occasions, when the dispute was carried on in peace; and
                    hence flowed the science, as it was called, of heraldry, with all its fantastic
                    niceties. By degrees the crest and device became also hereditary, as well as the
                    bearings on the shield. In addition to his armorial bearings, the knight
                    distinguished himself in battle by shouting out his war-cry, which was echoed by
                    his followers. It was usually the name of some favourite saint, united with that
                    of his own family. If the knight had followers under his command, they re-echoed
                    his war-cry, and rallied round his pennon or flag at the sound. The pennon
                    differed from the penoncel, or triangular streamer which the squire was entitled
                    to display, being double the breadth, and indented at the end like the tail of a
                    swallow. It presented the appearance of two penoncels united at the end next the
                    staff, a consideration which was not perhaps out of view in determining its
                    shape. Of course, the reader will understand that those knights only display ed
                    a pennon who had retainers to support and defend it, the mounting this ensign
                    being a matter of privilege, not of obligation.</p>
                <p>Froissart’s heart never fails to overflow when he describes the encounter of a
                    body of men-at-arms, arrayed in the manner we have described; he dwells with
                    enthusiasm on the leading circumstances. The waving of banners and pennons, the
                    dashing of spurs into the sides of chargers, and their springing forward to
                    battle; the glittering of armour, the glancing of plumes, the headlong shock and
                    splintering of the lances, the swords flashing through the dust over the heads
                    of the combatants, the thunder of the horses’ feet and the clash of armour,
                    mingled with the war-cry of the combatants and the groans of the dying, form the
                    mingled scene of tumult, strife, and death, which the canon has so frequently
                    transferred to his chivalrous pages.</p>
                <p>It was not in war alone that the adventurous knight was to acquire fame. It was
                    his duty, as we have seen, to seek adventures throughout the world, whereby to
                    exalt his own fame and the beauty of his mistress, which inspired such deeds. In
                    our remarks upon the general spirit of the institution, we have already noticed
                    the frantic enterprises which were seriously undertaken and punctually executed
                    by knights desirous of a name. On these occasions, the undertaker of so rash an
                    enterprise often owed his life to the sympathy of his foes, who had great
                    respect for any one engaged in the discharge of a vow of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354907" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4907-0608"/>chivalry. When Sir Robert
                    Knowles passed near Paris, at the head of an English army, in the reign of
                    Edward III. the following remarkable incident took place:</p>
                <p>“Now it happened, one Tuesday morning, when the English began to decamp, and had
                    set fire to all the villages wherein they were lodged, so that the fires were
                    distinctly seen from Paris, a knight of their army, who had made a vow the
                    preceding day, that be would advance as far as the barriers and strike them with
                    his lance, did not break his oath, but set off with his lance in his hand, his
                    target on his neck, and completely armed except his helmet, and, spurring his
                    steed, was followed by his squire on another courser, carrying the helmet. When
                    he approached Paris, he put on the helmet, which his squire laced behind. He
                    then galloped away, sticking spurs into his horse, and advanced prancing to
                    strike the barriers. They were then open, and the lords and barons within
                    imagined he intended to enter the town; but he did not so mean, for having
                    struck the gates according to his vow, he checked his horse and turned about.
                    The French knights who saw him thus retreat, cried out to him, ‘ Get away! get
                    away! thou hast well acquitted thyself.’ As for the name of this knight I am
                    ignorant of it, nor do I know from what country he came; but he bore for his
                    arms gules à deux fousses noir, with one bordure noir non endentée.</p>
                <p>“However, an adventure befel him, from which he had not so fortunate an escape.
                    On his return he met a butcher on the pavement in the suburbs, a very strong
                    man, who had noticed him as he had passed him, and who had in his hand a very
                    sharp and heavy hatchet with a long handle. As the knight was returning alone,
                    and in a careless manner, the valiant butcher came on one side of him, and gave
                    him such a blow between the shoulders, that he fell on his horse’s neck: he
                    recovered himself, but the butcher repeated the blow on his head, so that the
                    axe entered it. The knight, through excess of pain, fell to the earth, and the
                    horse galloped away to the squire, who was waiting for his master in the fields
                    at the extremity of the suburbs. ∙ The squire caught the courser, but wondered
                    what was become of his master; for he had seen him gallop to the barriers,
                    strike them, and then turn about to come back. He therefore set out to look for
                    him; but he had not gone many paces before he saw him in the hands of four
                    fellows, who were beating him as if they were hammering on an anvil. This so
                    much frightened the squire, that he dared not advance further, for he saw he
                    could .not give him any effectual assistance: he therefore returned as speedily
                    as he could.</p>
                <p>“Thus was this knight slain; and those lords who were posted at the barriers had
                    him buried in holy ground. The squire returned to the army, and related the
                    misfortune which had befallen his master. All his brother warriors were greatly
                    displeased thereat.” (Johnes’s <hi rend="italic">Froissart,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    63.)</p>
                <p>An equally singular undertaking was that of Galeazzo of Mantua, as rehearsed by
                    the venerable Doctor Paris de Puteo, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De
                    Duello</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Pe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Militari,</hi> and by Brantome in his <hi rend="italic">Essay on Duels.</hi>
                    Queen Joan of Naples, at a magnificent feast given in her castle of Gaeta, had
                    given her hand to Galeazzo for the purpose of opening the ball. The dance being
                    finished, the gallant knight kneeled down before bis royal partner, and, in
                    order to make fitting acknowledgment of the high honour done him, took a solemn
                    vow to wander through the world where-ever deeds of arms should be exercised,
                    and not to rest until he had subdued two valiant knights, and had presented them
                    prisoners at her royal footstool, to be disposed of at her pleasure.
                    Accordingly, after a year spent in visiting various scenes of action in
                    Brittany, England,</p>
                <p>France, Burgundy, and elsewhere, he returned like a falcon with his prey in his
                    clutch, and presented two prisoners of knightly rank to Queen Joan. The queen
                    received the gift very graciously; and, declining to avail herself of the right
                    she had to impose rigorous conditions on the captives, she gave them liberty
                    without ransom, and bestowed on them, over and above, several marks of
                    liberality. For this she.is highly extolled by Brantome and Dr Paris, who take
                    the opportunity of censuring the very opposite conduct of the canons of St
                    Peter’s Church at Rome, upon whom a certain knight had bestowed a prisoner taken
                    in single combat. These ungracious churchmen received the gift as if it had been
                    that of a wild beast for a menagerie, permitting the poor captive the freedom of
                    the church indeed, but prohibiting him to go one step beyond the gate. In which
                    condition, worse than death, they detained the vanquished knight for some time,
                    and were justly blamed, as neither understanding Christian charity nor
                    gentleman-like courtesy.</p>
                <p>We return to consider the duties of a knight. His natural and proper element was
                    war; but in time of peace, when there was no scope for the fiery spirit of
                    chivalry, the knights attended the tourneys proclaimed by different princes, or,
                    if these amusements did not occur, they themselves undertook feats of arms, to
                    which they challenged all competitors. The nature of these challenges will be
                    best understood from an abridged account of the <hi rend="italic">pαs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d’armes,</hi> called the <hi rend="italic">Justs</hi> of Saint
                    Inglebert, or Sandyng Fields. This emprize was sustained by three gallant
                    knights of France, Boucicaut, Reynold de Roy, and Saint Py or Saimpi. Their
                    articles bound them to abide thirty days at Saint Inglebert, in the marches of
                    Calais, there to undertake the encounter of all knights and squires, Frenchmen,
                    or strangers who should come hither, for the breaking of five spears, sharp, or
                    with rockets, at their pleasure On their lodgings they hung two shields called
                    of peace and war, with their armorial blazons on each. The stranger desiring to
                    just was invited to come or send, and touch which shield he would. The weapons
                    of courtesy were to be employed if he chose the shield of peace, if that of war,
                    the defenders were to give him the desired encounter with sharp weapons. The
                    stranger knights were invited to bring some nobleman with them, to assist in
                    judging the field; and the proclamation concludes with an entreaty to knights
                    and squires strangers, that they will not hold this offer as made for any pride,
                    hatred, or ill-will, but only that the challengers do it to have their
                    honourable company and acquaintance, which with their whole heart they desire.
                    They were assured of a fair field, without fraud or advantage; and it was
                    provided that the shields used should not be covered with iron or steel. The
                    French king was highly joyful of this gallant challenge (although some of his
                    council doubted the wisdom of permitting it to go forth), and exhorted the
                    challengers to regard the honour of their prince and realm, and spare no cost at
                    the solemnity, for which he was willing to contribute ten thousand francs. A
                    number of knights and squires came from England to Calais to accept this gallant
                    invitation; and at the entrance of the “fresh and joly month of May,” the
                    challengers pitched three green pavilions in a fair plain between Calais and the
                    Abbey of Saint Inglebert. Two shields hung before each pavilion, with the arms
                    of the owner.</p>
                <p>“On the 21st of the month of May, as it had been proclaimed, the three knights
                    were properly armed, and their horses properly saddled, according to the law’s
                    of the tournament. On the same day those knights who were in Calais sallied
                    forth, either as spectators or tilters, and, being arrived at the spot, drew up
                    on one side. The place of the tournament was smooth, and green with grass.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354920" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4920-0609"/>
                <p>“Sir John Holland was the first who sent his squire to touch the war-target of
                    Sir Boucicaut, who instantly issued from his pavilion completely armed. Having
                    mounted his horse, and grasped his spear, which was stiff and well steeled, they
                    took their distances. When the two knights had for a short time eyed each other,
                    they spurred their horses, and met full gallop with such a force that Sir
                    Boucicaut pierced the shield of the Earl of Huntingdon, and the point of his
                    lance slipped along his arm, but without wounding him. The two knights, having
                    passed, continued their gallop to the end of the list. This course was much
                    praised. At the second course, they hit each other slightly, but no harm was
                    done; and their horses refused to complete the third.</p>
                <p>“The Earl of Huntingdon, who wished to continue the tilt, and was heated,
                    returned to his place, expecting that Sir Boucicaut would call for his lance;
                    but he did not, and showed plainly he would not that day tilt more with the
                    earl. Sir John Holland, seeing this, sent his squire to touch the war-target of
                    the Lord de Saimpi. This knight, who was waiting for the combat, sallied out
                    from his pavilion, and took his lance and shield. When the earl saw he was
                    ready, he violently spurred his horse, as did the Lord de Saimpi. They couched
                    their lances, and pointed them at each other. At the onset, their horses
                    crossed; notwithstanding which, they met; but by this crossing, which was
                    blamed, the earl was unhelmed. He returned to his people,who soon re-helmed him;
                    and having resumed their lances, they met full gallop, and hit each other with
                    such a force in the middle of their shields, that they would have been unhorsed
                    had they not kept tight seats by the pressure of their legs against their
                    horses’ sides. They went to the proper places, where they refreshed themselves,
                    and took breath.</p>
                <p>“Sir John Holland, who had a great desire to shine at this tournament, had his
                    helmet braced, and re-grasped his spear; when the Lord de Saimpι, seeing him
                    advance on the gallop, did not decline meeting, but, spurring his horse on
                    instantly, they gave blows on their helmets, that were luckily of well-tempered
                    steel, which made sparks of firc fly from them. At this course, the Lord de
                    Saimpi lost his helmet; but the two knights continued their career, and returned
                    to their places.</p>
                <p>“This tilt was much praised, and the English and French said, that the Earl of
                    Huntingdon, Sir Boucicaut, and the Lord dc Saimpi, had excellently well justed,
                    without sparing or doing themselves any damage. The earl wished to break another
                    lance in honour of his lady, but it was refused him. He then quitted the lists
                    to make room for others, for he had run his six lances with such ability and
                    courage as gained him praise from all sides.” (Johnes’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Froissart,</hi> vol. iv. p. 143.)</p>
                <p>The other justs were accomplished with similar spirit. Sir Peter Courtney, Sir
                    John Russell, Sir Peter Sherburn, Sir William Clifton, and other English
                    knights, sustaining thehonourof their country against the French, who behaved
                    with the greatest gallantry; and the whole was regarded as one of the most
                    gallant enterprises which had been fulfilled for some time.</p>
                <p>Besides these dangerous amusements, the unsettled and misruled state of things
                    during the feudal times found a gentle knight anxious to support the oppressed
                    and to put down injustice, and, agreeably to his knightly vow, frequent
                    opportunities to exercise himself in the use of arms. There was everywhere to be
                    found oppressors to be chastised, and evil customs to be abolished; and the
                    knight’s occupation not only permitted, but actually bound him to'volunteer his
                    services in such cases. We shall err greatly if we suppose that the adventures
                    told in romance are as fictitious as its magic, its dragons, and its fairies.
                    The machinery was indeed imaginary, or rather, like that of Homer, it was
                    grounded on the popular belief of the times. But the turn of incidents
                    resembled, in substance, those which passed almost daily under the eye of the
                    narrator. Even the stupendous feats of prowess displayed by the heroes of these
                    tales, against the most overwhelming odds, were not without parallel in the
                    history of the times, When men fought hand to hand, the desperate exertions of a
                    single champion, well mounted and armed in proof were sometimes sufficient to
                    turn the fate of a disputed day: and the war-cry of a well-known knight struck
                    terror farther than his arms. The advantage possessed by such an invulnerable
                    champion over the half-naked infantry of the period, whom he might pursue and
                    cut down at his pleasure, was so great, that in the insurrection of the peasants
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Jacquerie,</hi> the Earl of Foix and the Captai de
                    Buche, their forces not being nearly as one to ten, hesitated not to charge
                    these disorderly insurgents with their men-at-arms, and were supposed to have
                    slain nearly seven thousand, following the execution of the fugitives with as
                    little mercy as the peasants had showed during the brief success of their
                    rebellion.</p>
                <p>The right which crown vassals claimed and exercised, of imposing exorbitant tolls
                    and taxes within their domains, was often resisted by the knights-errant of the
                    day, whose adventures in fact approached much nearer to Don Quixote than perhaps
                    our readers are aware of. For although the knight of La Mancha was perhaps two
                    centuries too late in exercising his office of redresser of wrongs, and although
                    his heated imagination confounded ordinary objects with such as were immediately
                    connected with the exercise of chivalry, yet, at no great distance from the date
                    of the inimitable romance of Cervantes, real circumstances occurred of a nature
                    nearly as romantic as the achievements which Don Quixote aspired to execute. In
                    the more ancient times, the wandering knight could not go far without finding
                    some gentleman oppressed by a powerful neighbour, some captive immured in a
                    feudal dungeon, some orphan deprived of his heritage, some traveller pillaged,
                    some convent or church violated, some lady in need of a champion, or some prince
                    engaged in a war with a powerful adversary; all of which incidents furnished fit
                    occasion for the exercise of his valour. By degrees, as order became more
                    generally established, and the law of each state began to be strong enough for
                    the protection of the subject, the interference of these selfauthorized and
                    self-dependent champions, who, besides, were in all probability neither the most
                    judicious nor moderate, supposing them to be equitable, mediators, became a
                    nuisance rather than an assistance to civil society; and undoubtedly this tended
                    to produce those distinctions in the order of knighthood which we are now to
                    notice.</p>
                <p>The most ancient, and originally the sole order of knighthood, was that of the
                    knight-bachelor. This was the proper degree conferred by one knight on another,
                    without the interference either of prince, noble, or churchman; and its
                    privileges and duties approached nearly to those of the knight-errant. Were it
                    possible for human nature to have acted up to the pitch of merit required by the
                    statutes of chivalry, this order might have proved for a length of time a
                    substitute for imperfect policy, a remedy against feudal tyranny, a resource for
                    the weak when oppressed by the strong. Unquestionably, in many individual
                    instances, knights were all that we have described them. But the laws of
                    chivalry, like those of the ascetic orders, while announcing a high tone of
                    virtue and self-denial, unfortunately afforded the strongest temptations to
                    those who professed its vows, to abuse the character which they assumed. The
                    degree of knighthood was easily attained, and did not Subject the warrior on
                    whom it was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354933" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4933-0610"
                    />granted to any particular tribunal in case of his abusing the powers which it
                    conferred. Thus the knight became, in many instances, a wandering and licentious
                    soldier, carrying, from castle to castle, and from court to court, the offer of
                    his mercenary sword, and frequently abusing his character, to oppress those whom
                    his oath bound him to protect. The license and foreign vices imported by those
                    who had returned from the crusades, the poverty also to which noble families
                    were reduced by these fatal expeditions, all aided to throw the quality of
                    knight-bachelor lower in the scale of honour, when unsupported by birth, wealth,
                    or the command of followers.</p>
                <p>The poorest knight-bachelor, however, long continued to exercise the privileges
                    of the order. Their title of bachelor (or <hi rend="italic">bas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">chevalier,</hi> according to the best derivation) marked that they
                    were early held in inferior estimation to those more fortunate knights who had
                    extensive lands and numerous vassals. They either attached themselves to the
                    service of some prince or rich noble, and were supported at their expense, or
                    they led the life of mere adventurers. There were many knights who, like Sir
                    Gaudwin in the romance of <hi rend="italic">Partenopex de JBlois,</hi> subsisted
                    by passing from one court, camp, and tournament, to another, and contrived even,
                    by various means open to persons of that profession, to maintain, at least for a
                    time, a fair and goodly appearance.</p>
                <p>So riding, they o’ertake an errant knight</p>
                <p>Well horsed, and large of limb, Sir Gaudwin bight;</p>
                <p>He nor of castle nor of land was lord,</p>
                <p>Houseless he reap’d the harvest of the sword: And now, not more on fame than
                    profit bent, Rode with blythe heart unto the tournament, For cowardice he held
                    it deadly sin, And sure his mind and bearing were akin. The face an index to the
                    soul within, It seem’d that he, such pomp his train bewray’d, Had shap’d a
                    goodly fortune by his blade;</p>
                <p>His knaves were, point device, in livery dight, <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi></p>
                <p>With sumpter-nags, and tents for shelter in the night.</p>
                <p>These bachelor-knights, as Mr Rose has well described Sir Gaudwin, set their
                    principal store by valour in battle; and perhaps it was the only quality of
                    chivalry which they at all times equally prized and possessed. Their boast was
                    to be the children of war and battle, living in no other atmosphere but what was
                    mingled with the dust of conflict and the hot breath of charging steeds. A
                    “gentle bachelor” is so described in one of the <hi rend="italic">Fabliaux</hi>
                    translated by Mr Way:</p>
                <p>What gentle bachelor is he, Sword-begot in fighting field, Rock’d and cradled in
                    a shield, Whose infant food a helm.did yield.</p>
                <p>His restless gallantry in tournament and battle—the rapidity with which he
                    traversed land and sea, from England to Switzerland, to be présentât each
                    remarkable occasion of action—with his hardihood in enduring every sort of
                    privation—and his generosity in rewarding minstrels and heralds—his life of
                    battle and turmoil—and his deeds of strength and fame—are all enumerated. But we
                    hear nothing of his redressing wrongs, or of his protecting the oppressed. The
                    knight-bachelor, according to this picture, was a valiant prize-fighter, and
                    lived by the exercise of his weapons.</p>
                <p>In war, the knight-bachelor had an opportunity of maintaining, and even of
                    enriching himself, if fortunate, by the ransom of such prisoners as he happened
                    to make in battle. If in this way he accumulated wealth, he frequently employed
                    it in levying followers, whose assistance, with his own, he hired out to such
                    sovereigns as were willing to set a sufficient price on his services. In time of
                    peace, the tournaments afforded, as we have already observed, a certain means of
                    income to these adventurous champions. The horses and arms of the knights who
                    succumbed on such occasions were forfeited to the victors, and these the wealthy
                    were always willing to reclaim by a payment in money. At some of the
                    achievements in arms the victors had the right, by the conditions of the
                    encounter, to impose severe terms on the vanquished, besides the usual
                    forfeiture of horse and armour. Sometimes the unsuccessful combatant ransomed
                    himself from imprisonment, or other hard conditions, by a sum of money; a
                    transaction in which the knight-bachelors, such as we have described them,
                    readily engaged. These adventurers used to call the sword which they used in
                    tourneys their <hi rend="italic">gagne-pain,</hi> or bread-winner, as itinerant
                    fiddlers of our days denominate their instruments.</p>
                <p>Dont i est gagne-pain nommée Car par li est gagnies li pains.</p>
                <p>Pèlerinage du Monde, par Guigneville.</p>
                <p>Men of such roving and military habits, subsisting by means so precarious, and
                    lying under little or no restraint from laws, or from the social system, were
                    frequently dangerous and turbulent members of the commonwealth. Every usurper,
                    tyrant, or rebel, found knights-bachelors to espouse his cause, in numbers
                    proportioned to his means of expenditure. They were precisely the “landless
                    resolutes,” whom any adventurer of military fame or known enterprise could
                    easily collect</p>
                <p>For food and diet to some enterprise That hath a stomach in’t.</p>
                <p>Sometimes knights were found who placed themselves directly in opposition to all
                    law and good order, headed independent bands of depredators, or, to speak
                    plainly, of robbers, seized upon some castle as a place of temporary retreat,
                    and laid waste the country at their pleasure. In the disorderly reigns of
                    Stephen and of King John, many such leaders of banditti were found in England.
                    And France, in the reign of John and his successors, was almost destroyed by
                    them. Many of these leaders were knights or squires, and almost all pretended
                    that in their lawless license they only exercised the rights of chivalry, which
                    permitted, and even enjoined, its votaries to make war without any authority but
                    their own, whenever a fair cause of quarrel occurs.</p>
                <p>These circumstances brought the profession of knightbachelor into suspicion, as
                    in other cases the poverty of those who held the honour exposed it to contempt
                    in their person. The sword did not always reap a good harvest; an enterprise was
                    unfortunate, or a knight was discomfited. In such circumstances he was obliged
                    to sell his armsand horse, and endure all the scorn which is attached to
                    poverty. In the beautiful lay of Lanval, and in the corresponding tale of
                    Gruelan, the story opens with the picture of the hero reduced to indigence,
                    dunned by his landlord, and exposed to contempt by his beggarly equipment. And
                    when John de Vienne and his French men-at-arms returned from Scotland, disgusted
                    with the poverty and ferocity of their allies, without having had any
                    opportunity to become wealthy at the expense of the English, and compelled
                    before their departure to give satisfaction for the insolencies -which they
                    committed towards the inhabitants, “divers knights and squires had passage and
                    so returned, some into Flanders, and as wind and weather would drive them,
                    without horse and harness, right poor and feeble, cursing the day that ever they
                    came into Scotland, saying that never man had so hard a voyage.” (Berner’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Froissart,</hi> vol. ii. (reprint) p. 32.) The frequent
                    prohibition of tournaments, both by the church and by the more peaceful
                    sovereigns, had also its necessary effect in impoverishing the
                    knights-bachelors, to whom, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354946"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4946-0611"/>as we have seen, these exhibitions afforded one
                    principal means of subsistence. This is touched upon in one of the French <hi
                    rend="italic">fabliaux,</hi> as partly the cause of the poverty of a chevalier,
                    whose distresses are thus enumerated:</p>
                <p>Listen, gentles, while I tell</p>
                <p>How this knight in fortune fell: Lands nor vineyards had he none, Justs and war
                    his living won; Well on horseback could he prance, Boldly could he break a
                    lance, Well he knew each warlike use; But there came a time of truce, Peaceful
                    was the land around, Nowhere heard a trumpet sound, Rust the shield and
                    faulchion hid, Just and tourney were forbid, All his means of living gone,
                    Ermine mantle had he none, And in pawn had long been laid Cap and mantle of
                    brocade, Harness rich and charger stout, All were eat and drunken out.<note

                <p>As the circumstances which we have mentioned tended to bring the order of
                    knight-bachelor in many instances into contempt, the great and powerful
                    attempted to entrench themselves within a circle which should be inaccessible to
                    the needy adventurers whom we have described. Hence the institution of
                    knights-banneret was generally received.</p>
                <p>The distinction betwixt the knight-banneret and the knight-bachelor was merely in
                    military rank and precedence, and the former may rather be accounted an
                    institution of policy than of chivalry. The bachelor displayed, or was entitled
                    to display, a pennon or forked ensign. The knight-banneret had the right of
                    raising a proper <hi rend="italic">ban-ner,</hi> from which his appellation was
                    derived. He held a middle rank beneath the barons or great feudatories of the
                    crown, and above the knights-bachelors. The banner from which he took his title
                    was a flag squared at the end, which, however, in strictness, was oblong, and
                    not an exact square on all. the sides, which was the proper emblem of a baron.
                    Du Tillet reports, that the Count de Laval challenged Sir Raoul de Couequens’
                    right to raise a square banner, being a banneret, and not a baron; and adds,
                    that he was generally ridiculed for this presumption, and called the knight with
                    the square ensign. The circumstance of the encroachment plainly shows, that the
                    distinction was not absolutely settled; nor have we found the ensign of the
                    bannerets anywhere described, except as being generally a square standard.
                    Indeed, it was only the pennon of the knight a little altered; for he who
                    aspired to be a banneret received no higher gradation in chivalry, as attached
                    to his person, and was inducted into his new privileges merely by the
                    commander-in-chief, upon the eve of battle, cutting off the swallów-tail or
                    forked termination of the pennon.</p>
                <p>In the appendix to Joinville’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> there is an essay
                    on the subject of the bannerets, in which the following account of them is
                    quoted from the ancient book of Ceremonies :—</p>
                <p>“Comme un bachelier peut lever bannière, et devenir banneret.</p>
                <p>“Quant un bachelier a grandement servi et suivy la guerre, et que il a assez
                    terre, et que ’il puisse avoir gentilshommes, ses hommes, et pour accompagner sa
                    bannière, il peut licitement lever bannière, et non autrement. Car nul homme ne
                    doit porter ne lever bannière en bataille, s’il n’a du moins cinquante hommes
                    d’armes, tous ses hommes et les archiers et arbalestriers qui y appartiennent.
                    Et s'il les a ’il doit à la première bataille, ou il se trouvera, apporter un
                    pennon de ses armes, et doit venir au connest-able, ou aux marisehaux, ou à
                    celui qui sera lieutenant de l’ost pour le prince, requirer qu’il porte
                    bannière; et s’il lui octroient, doit sommer les heraux pour tesmoignage, et
                    doivent couper la queue du pennon, et alors le doit porter et lever avant les
                    autres bannières, au dessoubs des autres, barons.</p>
                <p>There is this same ceremonial, in a chapter respecting the banneret, in these
                    terms :—</p>
                <p>“Comme se doit maintenir un banneret en bataille.</p>
                <p>“Le banneret doit avoir cinquante lances, et les gens de trait qui y
                    appartiennent: c’est à savoir les xxv. pour lui, et sa bannière garder. Et doit
                    estre sa bannière dessoubs des barons. Et s’il y a autres bannière, ils doivent
                    mettre leurs bannières à honneur, chacun selon son endroit, et pareillement tout
                    homme qui porte bannière.”</p>
                <p>Froissart, always our best and most amusing authority, gives an account of the
                    manner in which the celebrated Sir John Chandos was made banneret by the Black
                    Prince, before the battle of Navarete. The whole scene forms a striking picture
                    of an army of the middle ages moving to battle. Upon the pennons of the knights,
                    penoneels of the squires, and banners of the barons and bannerets, the army
                    formed, or, in modern phrase, dressed its line. The usual word for the attack
                    was, “Advance banners, in the name of God and Saint George.”</p>
                <p>“When the sun was risen, it was a beautiful sight to view these battalions, with
                    their brilliant armour glittering with its beams. In this manner they nearly
                    approached to each other. The prince, with a few attendants, mounted a small
                    hill, and saw very clearly the enemy marching straight towards them. Upon
                    descending this hill, he extended his line of battle in the plain, and then
                    halted.</p>
                <p>“The Spaniards, seeing the English had halted, did the same, in order of battle;
                    then each man tightened his armour, and made ready as for instant combat.</p>
                <p>“Sir John Chandos advanced in front of the battalions, with his banner uncased in
                    his hand. He presented it to the prince, saying, ‘ My Lord, here is my banner; I
                    present it to you, that I may display it in whatever manner shall be most
                    agreeable to you; for, thanks to God, I have now sufficient lands that will
                    enable me so to do, and maintain the rank which it ought to hold.’</p>
                <p>“The prince, Don Pedro being present, took the banner in his hands, which was
                    blazoned with a sharp stake gules, on a fixed argent; after having cut off the
                    tail to make it square, he displayed it, and returning it to him by the handle,
                    said, ‘ Sir John, I return you your banner; God give you strength and honour to
                    preserve it.’</p>
                <p>“Upon this, Sir John left the prince, went back to his men, with the banner in
                    his hand,—‘ Gentlemen, behold my banner and yours; you will therefore guard it
                    as it becomes you.’ His companions, taking the banner, replied with much
                    cheerfulness, that ‘ if it pleased God and St George, they would defend it well,
                    and act worthily of it, to the utmost of their abilities.’</p>
                <p>“The banner was put into the hands of a worthy English squire, called William
                    Allestry, who bore it with honour that day, and loyally acquitted himself in the
                    service. The English and Gascons soon after dismounted on the heath, and
                    assembled very orderly together, each lord under his banner or pennon, in the
                    same battle-array as when they passed the mountains. It was delightful to see
                    and examine these banners and pennons, with the noble army that was under
                    them.”</p>
                <p>It should not be forgotten, that Sir John Chandos exerted himself so much to
                    maintain his new honour, that, advancing too far among the Spaniards, he was
                    unhorsed, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354959" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4959-0612"/>and
                    having grappled with a warrior of great strength, called Martin Ferrand, he fell
                    undermost, and must have been slain, had he not bethought him of his dagger,
                    with which he stabbed his gigantic antagonist. (Johncs’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Froissart,</hi> vol. i. p. 731.)</p>
                <p>A banneret was expected to bring into the field at least thirty men-at-arms, that
                    is, knights or squires mounted, and in complete order, at his own expense. Each
                    man-at-arms, besides his attendants on foot, ought to have a mounted
                    crossbow-man, and a' horseman armed with a bow and axe. Therefore the number of
                    horsemen alone who assembled under a banner was at least three hundred, and,
                    including followers on foot, might amount to a thousand men. The banneret might
                    indeed have arrayed the same force under a pennon; but his accepting a banner
                    bound him to bring out that number at least. There is no room, however, to
                    believe that these regulations were very strictly observed.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Charles VII. the nobles of France made a remonstrance to the
                    king, setting forth that their estates were so much wasted by the long and fatal
                    wars with England, that they could no longer support the number of men attached
                    to the dignity of banneret. The companies of men-at-arms, which had hitherto
                    been led by knights of that rank, and the distinction between knights-bannerets
                    and knights-bachelors, were altogether disused from that period.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the works of Pasquieŗ, Du
                    Tillet, Le Gendre, and other French antiquaries.</p></note> In England the title
                    survived, but in a different sense. Those who received knighthood in a field of
                    battle, where the royal standard was displayed, were called knights-banneret.
                    Thus King Edward VI. notices in his <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> that after
                    the battle of Pinkie, “Mr Brian Sadler and Vane were made bannerets.”</p>
                <p>The distinction of banneret was not the only subdivision of knighthood. The
                    special privileged fraternities, orders, or associations of knights, using a
                    particular device, or embodied for a particular purpose, require also to be
                    noticed. These might in part be founded upon the union which knights were wont
                    to enter into with each other as “companions in arms,” than which nothing was
                    esteemed more sacred. The partners were united for weal and woe, and no crime
                    was accounted more infamous than to desert or betray a companion at arms. They
                    had the same friends and the same foes; and as it was the genius of chivalry to
                    carry every virtuous and noble sentiment to the most fantastic extremity, the
                    most extravagant proofs of fidelity to this engagement were often exacted or
                    bestowed. The beautiful romance of <hi rend="italic">Ames and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Amelien,</hi> in which a knight slays his own child to make a
                    salve with its blood, to cure the leprosy of his brother in arms, turns entirely
                    on this extravagant pitch of sentiment.</p>
                <p>To this fraternity only two persons could, with propriety, bind themselves. But
                    the various orders, which had in view particular objects of war, or were
                    associated under the authority of particular sovereigns, were also understood to
                    form a bond of alliance and brotherhood amongst themselves.</p>
                <p>The great orders of the Templars and Knights-Hospitallers of Saint John of
                    Jerusalem, as well as that of the Teutonic Knights, were ∙military associations,
                    formed, the former for defence of the Holy Land, and the latter for conversion
                    (by the edge of the sword, of course) of the Pagans in the north of Europe. They
                    were managed by commanders or superintendents, and by a grand master, forming a
                    sort of military republic, the individuals of which were understood to have no
                    distinct property or interest from the order in general. But the system and
                    history of these associations will be found under the proper heads.</p>
                <p>It is here only necessary to notice them as subdivisions of the knighthood or
                    chivalry of Europe.</p>
                <p>Other subdivisions arose from the various associations, also called orders,
                    formed by the different sovereigns of Europe, not only for the natural purpose
                    of drawing around their persons the flower of knighthood, but often with
                    political views of much deeper import. The romances which were the favourite
                    reading of the time, or which, at least, like the servant in the comedy, the
                    nobles “had read to them,” and which were on all occasions quoted gravely, as
                    the authentic and authoritative records of chivalry, afforded the most
                    respectable precedents for the formation of such fraternities under the auspices
                    of sovereign princes; the Round Table of King Arthur, and the Paladins of
                    Charlemagne, forming cases strictly in point. Edward III., whose policy was
                    equal to his love of chivalry, failed not to avail himself of these precedents,
                    not only for the exaltation of military honour and exercise of warlike feats,
                    but questionless that he might draw around him, and attach to his person, the
                    most valiant knights from all quarters of Europe. For this purpose, in the year
                    1344, he proclaimed, as well in Scotland, France, Germany, Hainault, Spain, and
                    other foreign countries, as in England, that he designed to revive the Round
                    Table of King Arthur, offering free conduct and courteous reception to all who
                    might be disposed to attend the splendid justs to be held upon that occasion at
                    Windsor Castle. This solemn festival, which Edward proposed to render annual,
                    excited the jealousy of Philip de Valois, king of France, w ho not only
                    prohibited his subjects to attend the Round Table at Windsor, but proclaimed an
                    opposite Round Table to be held by himself at Paris. In consequence of this
                    interference the festival of Edward lost some part of its celebrity, and was
                    diminished in splendour and frequency of attendance. This induced King Edward to
                    establish the memorable Order of the Garter. Twenty-six of the most noble
                    knights of England and Gascony were admitted into this highly honourable
                    association, the well-known motto of which <hi rend="italic">(Horn</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">soit qui mal y pense)</hi> seems to apply to the
                    misrepresentations which the French monarch might throw out respecting the Order
                    of the Garter, as he had already done concerning the festival of the Round
                    Table. There was so much dignity, as well as such obvious policy, in selecting
                    from the whole body of chivalry a select number of champions, to form an
                    especial fraternity under the immediate patronage of the sovereign,—it held out
                    such a powerful stimulus to courage and exertion to all whose eyes were fixed on
                    so dignified a reward of ambition,—that various orders were speedily formed in
                    the different courts of Europe, each having its own peculiar badges, emblems,
                    and statutes. To enumerate these is the task of the herald, not of the
                    historian, who is only called upon to notice their existence and character. The
                    first effect of these institutions on the spirit of chivalry in general was
                    doubtless favourable, as holding forth to the knighthood a high and honourable
                    prize of emulation. But when every court in Europe, however petty, bad its own
                    peculiar order and ceremonial, while the great potentates established several,
                    these dignities became so common as to throw into the shade the order of
                    knights-bachelors, the parent and proper degree of chivalry, in comparison to
                    which the others were mere innovations. The last distinction introduced, when
                    the spirit of chivalry was almost totally extinguished, was the degree of
                    knight-baronet.</p>
                <p>The degree of baronet, or hereditary knighthood, might: have been with greater
                    propriety termed an inferior rank of noblesse than an order of chivalry. Nothing
                    can be more <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354972" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4972-0613"
                    />alien from the original idea of chivalry than that knighthood could be
                    bestowed on an infant, who could not have deserved the honour, or be capable of
                    discharging its duties. But the way had been already opened for this anomaly by
                    the manner in which the orders of foreign knighthood had been conferred upon
                    children and infants in nonage. Some of these honours were also held by right of
                    blood, the Dauphin of France, for example, being held to be born a knight of the
                    Holy Ghost withoutereation; and men had already long lost sight of the proper
                    use and purpose of knighthood, which was now regarded and valued only as an
                    honorary distinction of rank, that imposed no duties, and required no
                    qualifications, or period of preliminary noviciate. Thecreation of this new
                    dignity, as is well known, was a device of James I. to fill those coffers which
                    his folly and profusion had emptied; and although the pretext of a Nova Scotia
                    or of an Ulster settlement was used as the apology for the creation of the
                    order, yet it was perfectly understood that the real value given was the payment
                    of a certain sum of money. The cynical Osborne describes this practice of the
                    sale of honours, which, in their origin, were designed as the reward and pledge
                    of chivalrous merit, with satirical emphasis.</p>
                <p>“At this time the honour of knighthood, which antiquity reserved sacred as the
                    cheapest and readiest jewel to present virtue with, was promiscuously laid on
                    any head belonging to the yeomandry (made addle through pride and a contempt of
                    their ancestor’s pedigree), that had but a court friend, or money to purchase
                    the favour of the meanest able to bring him into an outward roome, when the
                    king, the fountaine of honour, came downe, and was uninterrupted by other
                    businesse; in which ease it was then usuall for him to grant a commission for
                    the chamberlaine or some other lord to do it.”</p>
                <p>Having noticed the mode in which knighthood was conferred, and the various
                    subdivisions of the order in general, it is proper to notice the mode in which a
                    knight might be degraded from his rank. This forfeiture might take place from
                    crimes either actually committed, or presumed by the law of arms. The list of
                    crimes for which a knight was actually liable to degradation corresponded to his
                    duties. As devotion, the honour due to ladies, valour, truth, and loyalty, were
                    the proper attributes of chivalry, so heresy, insults or oppression of females,
                    cowardice, falsehood, or treason, caused his degradation. And heraldry, an art
                    which might be said to bear the shield of chivalry, assigned to such degraded
                    knights and their descendants peculiar bearings, called in blazonry abatements,
                    though it may be doubted if these were often worn or displayed.</p>
                <p>The most common case of a knight’s degradation occurred in the appeal to the
                    judgment of God by the single combat in the lists. In the appeal to this awful
                    criterion, the combatants, whether personally concerned or appearing as
                    champions, were understood, in martial law, to take on themselves the full risk
                    of all consequences; and as the defendant or his champion, in ease of being
                    overcome, was subjected to the punishment proper to the crime of which he was
                    accused, so the appellant, if vanquished, was, whether a principal or
                    substitute, condemned to the same doom to which his success would have exposed
                    the accused. Whichever combatant was vanquished, he was liable to the penalty of
                    degradation; and if he survived the combat, the disgrace to which he was
                    subjected was worse than death. His spurs were cut off close to his heels with a
                    cook’s cleaver; his arms were bafted and reversed by the common hangman; his
                    belt was cut to pieces, and his sword broken. Even his horse showed his
                    disgrace, the animal’s tail being cut off close to the rump, and thrown on a
                    dunghill. The death-bell tolled, and the funeral service was said, for a knight
                    thus degraded, as for one dead to knightly honour. And if he fell in the appeal
                    to the judgment of God, the same dishonour was done to his senseless corpse. If
                    alive, he was only rescued from death to be confined in the cloister. Sueh at
                    least were the strict rules of chivalry, though the courtesy of the victor, or
                    the clemency of the prince, might remit them in favourable eases.</p>
                <p>Knights might also be degraded without combat, when convicted of a heinous crime.
                    In Stowe’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    we find the following minute account of the degradation of Sir Andrew Harclay,
                    created Earl of Harclay by Edward IL, but afterwards accused of traitorous
                    correspondence with Robert the Bruce, and tried before Sir Anthony Luey.</p>
                <p>“He was ledde to the barre as an carle morthily apparelled, with his sword girt
                    about him, horsed, booted, and spurred, and unto whom Sir Anthony spake in this
                    manner. Sir Andrew (quoth he), the king, for thy valiant service, hath done thee
                    great honour, and made thee Earle of Carlile; since which tyme, thou, as a
                    traytor to thy lord the king, leddest his people, that shoulde have holpe him at

                    there of the Scottes, through thy treason and falsenesse; whereas, if thou
                    haddest come betimes, he hadde had the vietorie: and this treason thou

                    that thou receivedst of James Dow-glasse, a Scot, the king’s enemy. Our lord the
                    king will, therefore, that the order of knighthood, by the which thou receivedst
                    all thine honour and worship uppon thy bodie, be brought to nought, and thy
                    state undone, that other knights, of lower degree, may after thee beware, and
                    take example truely to serve.</p>
                <p>“Then commanded he to hesne his spurres from his heeles, then to break his sword
                    over his head, which the king had given him to keepe and defend his land
                    therewith, when he made him carle. After this, he let unelothe him of his furred
                    tabard, and of his hoode, of his coate of armes, and also of his girdle; and
                    when this was done, Sir Anthony sayde unto him, Andrewe (quoth he), now art thou
                    no knight, but a knave; and, for thy treason, the king will that thou shalt be

                    sayde, so was it done in all things, on the last daie of October.”</p>
                <p>III. We are arrived at the third point proposed in our arrangement, the causes,
                    namely, of the decay and extinction of chivalry.</p>
                <p>The spirit of chivalry sunk gradually under a combination of physical and moral
                    causes; the first arising from the change gradually introduced into the art of
                    war, and the last from the equally great alteration produced by time in the
                    habits and modes of thinking in modern Europe. Chivalry began to dawn in the end
                    of the tenth and beginning of the eleventh century. It blazed forth with high
                    vigour during the crusades, which indeed may be considered as exploits of
                    national knight-errantry, or general wars, undertaken on the very principles
                    which actuated the conduct of individual knights adventurers. But its most
                    brilliant period was during the wars between France and England; and it was
                    unquestionably in those kingdoms that the habit of constant and honourable
                    opposition, unembittered by rancour or personal hatred, gave the fairest<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193354985" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4985-0614"/> opportunity for
                    the exercise of the virtues required from him whom Chaucer terms a very perfect
                    gentle knight. Froissart frequently makes allusions to the generosity exercised
                    by the French and English to their prisoners, and contrasts it with the dungeons
                    to which captives taken in war were consigned, both in Spain and Germany. Yet
                    both these countries, and indeed every kingdom in Europe, partook of the spirit
                    of chivalry in a greater or less degree; and even the Moors of Spain caught the
                    emulation, and had their orders of knighthood as well as the Christians. But,
                    even during this splendid period, various causes were silently operating the
                    future extinction of the flame, which blazed thus wide and brightly.</p>
                <p>An important discovery, the invention of gunpowder, had taken place, and was
                    beginning to be used in war, even when chivalry was in its highest glory. It is
                    said Edward III. had field-pieces at the battle of Cressy, and the use of guns
                    is mentioned even earlier. But the force of gunpowder was long known and used
                    ere it made any material change in the art of war. The long-bow continued to be
                    the favourite, and it would seem the more formidable missile weapon, for well
                    nigh two centuries after guns had been used in war. Still every successive
                    improvement was gradually rendering the invention of fire-arms more perfect, and
                    their use more decisive of the fate of battle. In proportion as they came into
                    general use, the suits of defensive armour began to be lessgenerally worn. It
                    was (bund, that these cumbrous defences, however efficient against lances,
                    swords, and arrows, afforded no effectual protection against these more forcible
                    missiles. The armour of the knight was gradually curtailed to a light
                    head-piece, a cuirass, and the usual defences of men-at-arms. Complete harness
                    was only worn by generals and persons of high rank, and that rather, it would
                    seem, as a point of dignity than for real utility. The young nobility of France,
                    especially, tired of the unwieldy steel coats in which their ancestors sheathed
                    themselves, adopted the slender and light armour of the German Reiters or
                    mercenary cavalry. They also discontinued the use of the lance; in both cases
                    contrary to the injunctions of Henry IV. and the opinion of Sully. At length,
                    the arms of the cavalry were changed almost in every particular from those which
                    were proper for chivalry; and as, in such cases, much depends upon outward show
                    and circumstance, the light-armed cavalier, who did not carry the weapons or
                    practise the exercises of knighthood, laid aside, at the same time, the habits
                    and sentiments peculiar to the order.</p>
                <p>Another change of vital importance arose from the institution of the bands of
                    gens-d’armes or men-at-arms in France, constituted, as we have observed,
                    expressly as a sort of standing army, to supply the place of bannerets,
                    bachelors, squires, and other militia of early times. It was in the year 1445
                    that Charles VII. sclccted, from the numerous chivalry of France, fifteen
                    companies of men-at-arms, called Les Compagnies d’Ordonnance, to remain in
                    perpetual pay and subordination, and to enable the sovereign to dispense with
                    the services of the tumultuary forces of chivalry which, arriving and departing
                    from the host at pleasure, collecting their subsistence by oppressing the
                    country, and engaging in frequent brawls with each other, rather weakened than
                    aided the cause they professed to support. The regulated companies, which were
                    substituted for these desultory bands, were of a more permanent and manageable
                    description. Each company contained a hundred men-at-arms, and each man-at-arms
                    was to be what was termed a <hi rend="italic">lance</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >garnie,</hi> that is, a mounted spearman, with his proper attendants, being
                    four archers, and a varlet, called a <hi rend="italic">coustillier.</hi> Thus,
                    each company consisted of six hundred horse, and the fifteen bands amounted to
                    fifteen thousand cavalry. The charge of national defence was thus transferred
                    from <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> the chivalry of France, whose bold and
                    desperate valour was sometimes rendered useless by their independent wilfulness
                    and want of discipline, to a sort of regular forces, whose officers (a captain,
                    lieutenant, and an ensign in each company) held command, not in virtue of their
                    knighthood or banner right, but being direct commissions from the crown, as in
                    modern times. At first, indeed, these bands of regulated gens-d’armes were
                    formed of the same materials as formerly, though acting under a new system. The
                    officers wcrc men of the highest rank; the archers, and even the varlets, were
                    men of honourable birth. When the Emperor Maximilian proposed that the French
                    gens-d’armes should attempt to storm Padua, supported by the German
                    lance-knechts, or infantry, he was informed by Bayard, that if the French
                    men-at-arms were employed, they must be supported by those of the Germans, and
                    not by the lance-knechts, because, in the French companies of ordonnance, every
                    soldier was a gentleman. But, in the reign of Charles IX., we find the change
                    natural to such a new order of things was in complete operation. The king was
                    content to seek, as qualifications for his men-at-arms, personal bravery,
                    strength, and address in the use of weapons, without respect to rank or birth;
                    and, probably, in many instances, men of inferior birth were preferred to fill
                    up the ranks of these regulated bands. Monluc informs us in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> that he made his first campaign, as an archer,
                    in the Marechai de Foix’s company of gens-d’armes: “A situation much esteemed in
                    these days, when many nobles served in that capacity. At present, the rank is
                    greatly degenerated.” The complaints of the old noblesse, says Mezerai, were not
                    without reason. Mean carabineers, they said, valets, and lacqueys, were
                    recruited in companies, which were put on the same footing with the ancient
                    corps of gens-d’armes, whose officers were all barons of high rank, and almost
                    every man-at-arms a gentleman by birth. These complaints, joined with the charge
                    against Catharine of Medicis, that she had, by the creation of twenty-five new
                    members of the order of St Michael, rendered its honours as common as the
                    cockle-shells on the sea-shore, serve to show how early the first rude attempt
                    at establishing a standing and professional army operated to the subversion of
                    the ideas and privileges of chivalry. According to La Noue, it would seem that,
                    in his time, the practice still prevailed of sending youths of good birth to
                    serve as pages in the gens-d’armes; but, from the sort of society with whom they
                    mixed in service of that sort, their natural spirit was rather debased, and
                    rendered vulgar and brutal, than trained to honour and gallantry.</p>
                <p>A more fatal cause had, however, been for some time∣ operating in England as well
                    as France, for the destrue-i tion of the system we are treating of. The wars of
                    York <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> and Lancaster in England, and those of the
                    Huguenots' and of the League, were of a nature so bitter and rancorous, as was
                    utterly inconsistent with the courtesy, fair play, and gentleness, proper to
                    chivalry. Where∙different nations are at strife together, their war may be
                    carried on with a certain degree of moderation. “During the foreign wars between
                    France and Spain, especially in Piedmont,” says La Noue, “we might often see a
                    body of spears pass a village, where the peasants only interrupted their village
                    dance to offer them refreshments; and, in a little after, a hostile troop
                    receive, from the unoffending and unoffended inhabitants, the same courtesy. The
                    two bodies would meet and fight gallantly, and the wounded of both parties would
                    be transferred to the same village, lodged in the same places of accommodation,
                    receive the same attention, and rest peaceably on each other’s good faith till
                    again able to take the field.” He contrasts this <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193354998" xml:id="kp-eb0706-4998-0615"/>generosity with the miserable
                    oppression of the civil wars, carried on by murdering, burning, and plundering
                    friend and foe, armed and unarmed; alleging, all the while, the specious
                    watchwords of God’s honour, the king’s service, the Catholic religion, the
                    gospel, our country. In the end, he justly observes, “the soldiers become
                    ravenous beasts, the country is rendered desert, wealth is wasted, the crimes of
                    the great become a curse to themselves, and God is displeased.” The bloody wars
                    of the Rose in England, the execution of prisoners on each side, the fury and
                    animosity which allowed no plea of mercy or courtesy, were scarce less
                    destructive to the finer parts of the spirit of chivalry in England than those
                    of the Huguenots in France.</p>
                <p>But the civil wars not only operated in debasing the spirit of chivalry, but in
                    exhausting and destroying the particular class of society from which its
                    votaries were drawn. To be of noble birth was not indeed absolutely essential to
                    receiving the honour of knighthood, for men of low descent frequently attained
                    it; but it required a distinguished display of personal merit to raise them out
                    of the class where they were born; and the honours of chivalry were, generally
                    speaking, appropriated to those of fair and gentle parentage. The noble
                    families, therefore, were the source from which chivalry drew recruits; and it
                    was upon the nobles that the losses, proscriptions, and forfeitures of the civil
                    wars chiefly fell. We have seen that in France their poverty occasioned their
                    yielding up the privilege of military command to the disposal of the crown. In
                    England it was fortunately not so much the crown as the commons who rose on the
                    ruins of feudal chivalry; but it is well known that the civil wars had so
                    exhausted the English nobility, as to enable Henry VII. to pass his celebrated
                    statutes against those hosts of retainers, which struck, in fact, at the very
                    root of their power. And thus Providence, whose ways bring good out of evil,
                    laid the foundation of the future freedom of England in the destruction of what
                    had long been its most constitutional ground of defence, and in the subjugation
                    of that system of chivalry which, having softened the ferocity of a barbarous
                    age, was now to fall into disuse, as too extravagant for an enlightened one.</p>
                <p>In fact, it was not merely the changes which had taken place in the constitution
                    of armies and fashion of the fight, nor the degraded and weak state of the
                    nobles, but also, and in a great degree, the more enlightened manners of the
                    times, and the different channels into which enthusiasm and energy were
                    directed, which gradually abolished the sentiments of chivalry. We have seen
                    that the abstract principles of chivalry were, in the highest degree, virtuous
                    and noble, nay, that they failed by carrying to an absurd, exaggerated, and
                    impracticable point, the honourable duties which they inculcated. Such
                    doctrines, when they fail to excite enthusiasm, become exploded as ridiculous.
                    Men’s minds were now awakened to other and more important and complicated
                    exercises of the understanding, and were no longer responsive to the subjects
                    which so deeply interested their ancestors of the middle ages. Sciences of
                    various kinds had been rekindled in the course of the sixteenth century; the
                    arts had been awakened in a style of perfection unknown even to classical ages.
                    Above all, religion had become the interesting study of thousands; and the
                    innovating doctrines of the reformers, while hailed with ecstacy by their
                    followers, rejected as abominations by the Catholics, and debated fiercely by
                    both parties, involved the'nobility of Europe in speculations very different
                    from the <hi rend="italic">arrets</hi> of the court of love, and demanded their
                    active service in fields more bloody than those of tilt and tournament. When the
                    historians or disputants on either side allude to the maxims of chivalry, it is
                    in terms of censure and ridicule; yet, if we judge by the most distinguished
                    authorities on either side, the reformers rejected as sinful what the Catholics
                    were’ contented to brand as absurd. It is with no small advantage to the
                    Huguenots,—to that distinguished party which produced Sully, D’Aubigné, Coligni,
                    Duplessis-Mornay, and La Noue, that we contrast the moral severity with which
                    they pass censure on the books of chivalry, with the licentious flippancy of
                    Brantome, who ridicules the same works on account of the very virtues which they
                    inculcate. From the books of <hi rend="italic">Amadis de Gaul,</hi> refining, as
                    he informs us, upon the ancient vanities of Perceforest, Tristan, Giron,
                    &amp;c., La Noue contends, the age in which he lived derived the recommendation
                    and practice of incontinence, of the poison of revenge, of neglect of sober and
                    rational duty, desperate blood-thirstiness, under disguise of search after
                    honour, and confusion of public order. “They are instructions,” he says, “of
                    Apollyon, who, being a murtherer from the beginning, delighteth wholly in
                    promoting murther.” “Of the tournaments,” he observes that “such spectacles,
                    rendering habitual the sight of blows and blood, had made the court of France
                    pitiless and cruel.” “Let those,” he exclaims, “who desire to feed their eyes,
                    with blood, imitate the manner of England, where-they exercise their cruelty on
                    brute beasts, bringing in bulls and bears to fight with dogs, a practice beyond
                    comparison far more lawful than the justs of chivalry.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>It is curious to contrast the opinions of La Noue, a stern and moral reformer,
                    and a skilful and brave soldier as France ever produced, although condemning all
                    war that did not spring out of absolute necessity, with those of Brantome, a
                    licentious courtier, who mixed the popish superstitions, which stood him instead
                    of religion, with a leaven of infidelity and blasphemy. From the opinions he has
                    expressed, and from what he has too faithfully handed down as the manners of his
                    court and age, it is plain that all which was valuable in the spirit of chivalry
                    had been long renounced by the French noblesse. To mark this declension, it is
                    only necessary to run over the various requisites already pointed out as
                    necessary to form the chivalrous character, and contrast them with the opinions
                    held in the end of the sixteenth century, in the court of the descendants of
                    Saint Louis.</p>
                <p>The spirit of devotion which the rules of chivalry inculcated was so openly
                    disavowed, that it was assigned as a reason for preferring the character of Sir
                    Tristram to that of Sir Lancelot, that the former is described in romance as
                    relying, like Mezentius, upon his own arm alone, whereas Lancelot, on engaging
                    in fight, never failed to commend himself to God and the saints, which, in the
                    more modern opinions of the gallants of France, argued a want of confidence in
                    his own strength and valour.</p>
                <p>The devotion with which the ancient knights worshipped the fair sex was held to
                    be as old-fashioned and absurd as that which they paid to heaven. The honours
                    paid to chastity and purity in the German forests, and transferred as a sacred
                    point of duty to the sons of chivalry, were as little to be found in the court
                    of France, according to Brantome, as the chastity and purity to which it was
                    due. The gross and coarse sensuality which we have seen engrafted upon
                    professions of Platonic sentiment, became finally so predominant, as altogether
                    to discard all marks of sentimental attachment; and from the time of Catharine
                    of Medicis, who trained her maids of honour as courtezans, the manners of the
                    court of France seem to have been inferior in decency to those of a
                    well-regulated bagnio. The sort of respect which these ladies were deemed <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193355011" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5011-0616"/> entitled to may
                    be conjectured by an anecdote givan by Lord Herbert of Cherbury, whose own
                    character was formed upon the chivalrous model which was now become obsolete. As
                    he stood in the trenches before a besieged place, along with Balagny, a
                    celebrated duellist of the period, between whom and Lord Herbert some
                    altercation had formerly occurred, the Frenchman, in a bravade, jumped over the
                    entrenchment, and, daring Herbert to follow him, ran towards the besieged place,
                    in the face of a fire of grape and musquetry. Finding that Herbert outran him,
                    and seemed to have no intention of turning back, Balagny was forced to set the
                    example of retreating. Lord Herbert then invited him to an encounter upon the
                    old chivalrous point, which had the fairer and more virtuous mistress; to which
                    proposition Balagny replied by a jest so coarse, as made the Englishman retort
                    that he spoke like a mean debauchee, not like a cavalier and man of honour. As
                    Balagny was one of the most fashionable gallants of his time, and, as the story
                    shows, ready for the most hairbrained achievements, his declining combat upon
                    the ground of quarrel chosen by Lord Herbert is a proof how little the former
                    love of chivalry accorded with the gallantry of these later days.</p>
                <p>Bravery, the indispensable requisite of the <hi rend="italic">preux</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">chevalier,</hi> continued, indeed, to be held in the same
                    estimation as formerly; and the history of the age gave the most brilliant as
                    well as the most desperate examples of it, both in public war and private
                    encounter. But courage was no longer tempered with the good faith and courtesy,
                    <hi rend="italic">La bonta dei gli cavalieri anticlii,</hi> so celebrated by
                    Ariosto. There no longer existed those generous knights, that one day bound the
                    wounds of a generous enemy, guided him to a place of refuge, and defended him on
                    the journey, and which, on the next, hesitated not to commit itself in turn to
                    the power of a mortal foe, without fear that he would break the faithful word he
                    had pawned for the safety of his enemy. If such examples occur in the civil wars
                    of France, they were dictated by the generosity of individuals who rose above
                    the vices of their age, and were not demanded, as matters of right, from all who
                    desired to stand well in public opinion. The intercourse with Italy, so fatal to
                    France in many respects, failed not to imbue her nobility with the politics of
                    Machiavel, the coarse licentiousness of Aretin, and the barbarous spirit of
                    revenge, which held it wise to seek its gratification, not in fair encounter,
                    but <hi rend="italic">per ogni</hi><hi rend="italic">modo,</hi> in what manner
                    soever it could be obtained. Duels, when they took place, were no longer fought
                    in the lists, or in presence of judges of the field, but in lonely and
                    sequestered places. Inequality of arms was not regarded, however great the
                    superiority on one side. “Thou hast both a sword and dagger,” said Quelus to
                    Antragues, as they were about to fight, “and I have only a sword.”—“The more thy
                    folly,” was the answer, “to leave thy dagger at home. We came to fight, not to
                    adjust weapons.” The duel accordingly went forward, and Quelus was slain, his
                    left hand (in which he should have had his dagger) being shockingly cut in
                    attempting to parry his antagonist’s blows without that weapon. The challenged
                    person having a right to choose his weapons, often endeavoured to devise such as
                    should give him a decidedly unfair advantage. Brantome records with applause the
                    ingenuity of a little man, who, being challenged by a tall Gascon, made choice
                    of a gorget so constructed that his gigantic adversary could not stoop his neck
                    so as to aim his blows right. Another had two swords forged of a temper so
                    extremely brittle, that unless used with particular caution, and in a manner to
                    which he daily exercised himself, the blade must necessarily fly in pieces. Both
                    these ingenious persons killed their man with very little risk or trouble, and
                    no less applause, it would seem, than if they had fought without fraud and
                    covine. The seconds usually engaged, and when one of the combatants was slain,
                    his antagonist did not hesitate to assist his comrade in opposing by odds him
                    who remained. The <hi rend="italic">little French Lawyer</hi> of Fletcher turns
                    entirely on this incident. By a yet more direct mode of murder, a man challenged
                    to a duel was not always sure that his enemy was not to assassinate him by the
                    assistance of ruffians at the place of rendezvous, of which Brantome gives
                    several instances without much censure. The plighted word of an antagonist by no
                    means insured against treachery to the party to whom it was given. De Rosne, a
                    gentleman well skilled in the practice and discipline of the wars, receiving a
                    challenge from De Fargy, through the medium of a young man, who offered to
                    pledge his word and faith for the fair conduct of his principal, made an answer
                    which Brantome seems to approve as prudential. “I should be unwilling,” he
                    replied, “to trust my life upon a pledge on which I would not lend twenty
                    crowns.” In many cases no ceremony was used, but the nobles assassinated each
                    other without scruple or hesitation. Brantome gives several stories of the Baron
                    des Vitaux, and terms his detestable murders bold and brave revenges. But it
                    would be endless to quote examples. It is enough to call to the reader’s
                    recollection the bloody secret of the massacre of St Bartholomew, which was kept
                    by such a number of the Catholic noblemen for two years, at the expense of false
                    treaties, promises, and perjuries innumerable, and the execution which followed
                    on naked, unarmed, and unsuspecting men, in which so many gallants lent their
                    willing swords.</p>
                <p>In England, the free tone of the government, and the advantage of equal laws,
                    administered without respect of persons, checked similar enormities, which,
                    however, do not appear to have been thought in all cases inconsistent with the
                    point of honour, which, if not, as in France, totally depraved from the ancient
                    practices of chivalry, might probably have soon become so. Sir John Ayres did
                    not hesitate to attack Lord Herbert with the assistance of his servants; and the
                    outrage upon the person of Sir John Coventry, which gave rise to the Coventry
                    act against cutting and maiming, evinced the same spirit of degenerate and
                    blood-thirsty revenge. Lord Sanquhar having lost an eye in a trial of skill with
                    a master of defence, conceived that his honour required that he should cause the
                    poor man to be assassinated by ruffians in his own school; butas this base
                    action met its just reward ńt the gallows, the spirit of Italian revenge was
                    probably effectually checked by such a marked example. At the gallows, the
                    unfortunate nobleman expressed his detestation for the crime, which he then saw
                    in all its enormity. Before his trial he said the devil had so blinded his
                    understanding that he could not understand that he had done amiss, or otherwise
                    than befitting a man of high rank and quality, having been trained up to the
                    court, and living the life of a soldier, which sort of men, he said, stood more
                    on a point of honour than religion. The feelings of chivalry must have been
                    indeed degraded, when so base an assassination was accounted a point of honour.
                    In Scotland, the manners of which country, as is well observed by Robertson,
                    strongly resembled those of France, the number of foul murthers during the
                    sixteenth century was almost incredible, and indeed assassination might be
                    termed the most general vice of the sixteenth century.</p>
                <p>From these circumstances, the total decay of chivalrous principle is sufficiently
                    evident. As the progress of knowledge advanced, men learned to despise its
                    fantastic refinements; the really enlightened, as belonging to a system
                    inapplicable to the modern state of the world; the licentious, fierce, and
                    subtile, as throwing the barriers of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355024"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-5024-0617"/>affected punctilio betwixt them and the safe,
                    ready, and unceremonious gratification of their lust or their vengeance.</p>
                <p>The system, as we have seen, had its peculiar advantages during the middle ages.
                    Its duties were not, and indeed could not always be performed in perfcction, but
                    they had a strong influence on public opinion; and we cannot doubt that its
                    institutions, virtuous as they were in principle, and honourable and generous in
                    their ends, must have done much good and prevented much evil. We can now only
                    look back on it as a beautiful and fantastic piece of frostwork, which has
                    dissolved in the beams of the sun. But though we look in vain for the pillars,
                    the vaults, the cornices, and the fretted ornaments of the transitory fabric, we
                    cannot but be sensible that its dissolution has left on the soil valuable tokens
                    of its former existence. We do not mean, nor is it necessary to trace, the
                    slight shades of chivalry which are yet received in the law of England. An
                    appeal to combat in a case of treason was adjudged in the celebrated case of
                    Ramsay and Lord Reay, in the time of Charles 1. An appeal of murder seems to
                    have been admitted as legal within a recent period, though it has subsequently
                    been abolished by statute; but it is not in such issues, rare as they must be,
                    that we ought to trace the consequences of chivalry. We have already shown that
                    its effects are rather to be sought in the general feeling of respect to the
                    female sex; in the rules of forbearance and decorum in society; in the duties of
                    speaking truth and observing courtesy; and in the general conviction and
                    assurance that, as no man can encroach on the property of another without
                    accounting to the laws, so none can infringe on his personal honour, be the
                    difference of rank what it may, without subjecting himself to personal
                    responsibility. It will be readily believed that, in noticing the existence of
                    duelling as a relic of chivalry, we do not mean to discuss the propriety of the
                    custom. It is our happiness that the excesses to which this spirit is liable are
                    checked by the laws which wisely discountenance the practice; for although the
                    severity of the laws sometimes give way to the force of public opinion, they
                    still remain an effectual restraint, in every case where the circumstances argue
                    either wanton provocation or unfair advantage. It is to be hoped that, as the
                    custom of appealing to this Gothic mode of settling disputes is gradually
                    falling into disuse, our successors may enjoy the benefit of the general
                    urbanity, decency, and courtesy which it has introduced into the manners of
                    Europe, without having recourse to a remedy not easily reconciled to law or to
                    Christianity. (υ. <hi rend="smallcaps">d. d.)</hi><hi rend="italic">Court
