                <p><label type="entry">CANARA</label>, a province of Hindustan, extending from the
                    twelfth to the fifteenth degree of north latitude. It is a narrow strip of
                    territory, running along the western coast of India, 200 miles in length by
                    thirty-five in breadth; and is hemmed in on the east by the great ridge of the
                    Ghaut Mountains. It is bounded on the north by the province of Bejapoor, on the
                    south by Malabar, on the east by Mysore and the Balaghaut territories, and on
                    the west by the Indian Oeean.</p>
                <p>Canara is a corruption of Karnata, the table-land above the Ghaut Mountains. It
                    is a rocky and uneven country, where cattle are scarce, and where, even when
                    they can be procured, they cannot always be employed; where every spot, before
                    it can be cultivated, must be levelled by the hand of man; and where even the
                    land that has been brought under cultivation, if it be neglected for a few
                    years, is soon broken into deep gullies by the heavy torrents of rain which fall
                    during the monsoons. The land is divided into small properties, and the country
                    flourishes from the minute attention bestowed by each proprietor on his own
                    little spot. It is not likely that Canara will ever become a manufacturing
                    country, as it does not produce the necessary materials, and also on account of
                    the heavy rains, which oppose insurmountable obstacles to all operations which
                    require to be carried on under a clear sky. But these same rains give it a
                    never-failing succession of rice crops, which are exported to Malabar, Goa,
                    Bombay, and Arabia. “Canara,” says Sir Thomas Munro,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Life of Sir Thomas

                    “produces nothing but rice and cocoa nuts; its dry lands are totally
                    unproductive, so that the little wheat or other dry grain that is raised is sown
                    in the paddy fields, where the water has been insufficient for the rice. It
                    produces hardly any pepper. The sandal wood for exportation comes all from
                    Nuggar and Soonda. The soil is perhaps the poorest in India. The eternal rains
                    have long washed away the rich parts, if ever it had any, and left nothing but
                    sand and gravel.” In another letter he observes, “there is hardly a spot in
                    Canara where one can walk with any satisfaction, for the country is the most
                    broken and rugged perhaps in the world. The few narrow plains that are in it are
                    under water at one season of the year; and during the dry weather the numberless
                    banks which divide them make it very disagreeable and fatiguing to walk over
                    them. There is hardly such a thing as a piece of gently rising ground in the
                    whole country. All the high grounds start up at once in the shape of so many
                    inverted tea-cups, and they are rocky, covered with wood, and difficult of
                    ascent, and so crowded together that they leave very little room for valleys
                    between.” It was in ancient times in a very flourishing state, while it remained
                    under its Hindu sovereigns, principally owing to the moderate land tax to which
                    it was subjected. An increase was made of fifty per cent. to this tax under the
                    Bednore family, besides many smaller additions, making twenty per cent. more.
                    But all these taxes were easily paid by the inhabitants; and the country, if it
                    did not advance in population and wealth, fully maintained the position to which
                    it had attained. Canara was conquered by Hyder in 1762; and at that time it was
                    a highly improved country, filled with industrious inhabitants, who enjoyed a
                    greater degree of prosperity, and were more moderately taxed, than the subjects
                    of any native power in India. But no sooner was its conquest completed than
                    Hyder ordered an investigation into every source of revenue, for the purpose of
                    augmenting it wherever it could be clone. These exactions were augmented by his
                    son Tippoo, who was determined to relinquish no part of his father’s revenue,
                    and whose policy it was to hold one part of the proprietors and husbandmen
                    liable for the deficiencies of their neighbours. The effect of these violent
                    regulations was to hasten the extinction of all the ancient proprietors of the
                    soil, and to deteriorate the value of the lands until they became unsaleable. In
                    this manner the agriculture of the country was heavily oppressed; and Canara,
                    when it came into the possession of the British, had completely fallen from its
                    ancient prosperity. It is said, in the report of the principal collector of
                    Canara,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="italic">Fifth Report of a Select Committee on India Affairs,</hi>
                    Appendix, p. 808.</p></note> “the evils which have been accumulating in the
                    country since it became a province of Mysore have destroyed a great part of its
                    former population, and rendered its inhabitants as poor as those of the
                    neighbouring countries.” The value of landed property has been greatly reduced;
                    and those lands which are worth any thing are reduced to a very small portion,
                    and he chiefly between the Cundapoor and Chundergherry rivers, and within five
                    miles of the sea. But it is only here and there even in this tract that lands
                    are to be found which can be sold at any price. There is scarcely any saleable
                    land even on the sea-coast to the northward of Cundapoor, or any where except on
                    the banks of the Mangalore and some of the other great rivers. The inland tracts
                    near the Ghaut Mountains are generally waste and overgrown with wood. By the
                    oppressions of its conquerors the population of the country has been diminished
                    about one third; and the value of property has been reduced in an equal
                    proportion. “It may be said,” observes the principal collector, in his report,
                    “that this change in the condition of the country was brought about by the
                    invasion of Hyder; by the four wars which have happened since that event; by
                    Tippoo himself destroying many of thê principal towns on the coast, and forcing
                    their inhabitants to remove to Jumalabad and other unhealthy stations near the
                    hills; by his seizing in one night all the Christian men, women, and children,
                    amounting to above 60,000, and sending them into captivity into Mysore; by the
                    prohibition of foreign trade; and by the general corruption of his government in
                    all its departments.” These circumstances, according to the opinion of the
                    collector, accelerated the change; “but they probably,” he adds, “did not
                    contribute to it so much as the extraordinary augmentation of the land rents.”
                    “Whole villages,” says Colonel Munro, who after the conquest of the country was
                    appointed by the Company to survey it, and to reclaim it from its wild and
                    unsettled state, “have in some places been abandoned by the owners, from the
                    exorbitance of the assessment; in others they are barely able to keep their
                    ground and to subsist; in others the rent is so moderate that the lands are
                    saleable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                <p>When Canara was ceded to the British, it was placed under the management of
                    Colonel Munro, by whose vigilance and activity order was gradually restored in
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347926" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7926-0071"/>country,
                    which had long been distracted by the wars and violence of the rajahs and petty
                    chieftains; the people rejoiced in the protection they received, and the land
                    revenue was punctually realized. A great improvement is also said to have taken
                    place in the condition of the people, which has been exhibited in the dress, in
                    the mode of living, and in an addition to their personal comforts. This may
                    possibly be true; and the British government, under which law and order were
                    maintained, must have improved the condition of the great majority of the
                    inhabitants. But the greatest blessing which the British could have conferred on
                    the country would have been a remission of the heavy and ruinous taxes laid on
                    it by Hyder Ali and his son Tippoo Saib. Here, however, they appear to have
                    hesitated; for they have always been too eager to raise a large revenue.
                    Extortion has still been the erroneous policy of their government; nor have they
                    ever been so intent on protecting the people as on taxing them. A permanent
                    settlement of the land tax is generally recommended by the Company’s revenue
                    collectors, as the approved remedy for all the evils which afflict the country.
                    But the permanency of a tax, if it be exorbitant, is its worst evil: and the
                    first care of an enlightened government ought to be to lower the tax to a
                    moderate standard; that is, to exact from the country no more than may be
                    necessary for the support of its civil establishments. But the Company have
                    always evinced the greatest reluctance to reduce taxation. Thus the collector of
                    Canara, in his report, states, that “had such an assessment as that introduced
                    by Hyder and Tippoo existed in ancient times, Canara would long ago have been
                    converted into a desert.” Yet in the face of this observation he says, “However
                    much I disapprove of the numerous additions made to the ancient land rent by
                    Hyder and Tippoo, I did not think myself at liberty to depart widely from the
                    system which I found established, as it is the same which exists in all the
                    provinces the Company have acquired in the last and former war. I have made no
                    other reductions in the assessment of Tippoo Sultan than such as were absolutely
                    necessary in order to insure the collection of the rest.” The high assessment is
                    considered by Colonel Munro, whose enlightened and comprehensive mind qualified
                    him to be the legislator of those newly conquered countries, as the great check
                    to population; and he conceives that, under the system which he proposed,
                    “cultivation and population would increase so much that, in the course of
                    twenty-five years, lands, formerly cultivated, amounting to star pagodas
                    5,55,962 (yielding a tax of about L.222,000), would be retrieved and occupied,
                    together with a considerable portion of waste never before occupied ;’<note

                    exigencies of government allowed of so great a sacrifice as the remission of
                    twenty-five or even fifteen per cent. on the existing tax, “we should consider
                    the measure highly advisable, and calculated to produce great ulterior
                    advantage.” But it is added, “if the exigencies of the Company’s government do
                    not permit them to make so great a sacrifice, if they cannot afford to give up a
                    share of the landlord’s rent, they must be indulgent landlords.” The whole rent
                    of the soil was thus absorbed by the government tax, under the effects of which
                    great part of the country lay desolate; yet it is doubted whether the exigencies
                    of the government will allow of any remission of this exorbitant exaction. In
                    Canara, however, remissions to a certain extent did take place, extorted partly
                    by the necessities of the country, and partly by the earnest representations of
                    Colonel, afterwards Sir Thomas Munro; and owing to this and the equal protection
                    of the British government, the country soon began to revive from the state in
                    which it had languished under its former tyrants. The tax is still about sixty
                    per cent. of the landlord’s rent, and about one third of the gross produce; and
                    it is clear that such an exorbitant tax must impede the improvement of the
                    country, and confine cultivation within comparatively narrow limits. The
                    judicial and revenue system introduced by Lord Cornwallis into Bengal was
                    afterwards extended to the ceded countries, and to Canara among others, where it
                    produced the usual effects that attend every violent subversion of the existing
                    order of things; and was followed by disorder and misery, and a great increase
                    of crimes. Strenuous exertions have been since made to correct this error, and
                    to bring back the country to its former state.</p>
                <p>The principal trading ports in the province are Mangalore, Ankala, Onore,
                    Cundapoor, Barkoor, and Becul. These were formerly flourishing places, but they
                    have fallen into decay with the ruin of the country. Several of them contain
                    only a few beggarly inhabitants. Honaver, once the second town in trade after
                    Mangalore, has not a single house; and Mangalore itself is greatly decayed. The
                    trade, of which Mangalore is the chief emporium, is not extensive. It exports to
                    Arabia cardamums, coir, pepper, moories, poon spars, rice, sandal-wood, oil,
                    betel-nut, ghee, and iron; to Goa, and to the Mahratta countries, in
                    considerable quantities, rice, horn, grain, and tobacco. The imports from Arabia
                    are dates, brimstone, salt, fish, and horses; from Bombay, brimstone, sugar,
                    horses; and from the Mahratta countries, horses, shawls, blue cloths, &amp;c.

                    between the thirteenth and the fifteenth degrees of northern latitude, and
                    contains three smaller districts of Cundapoor, Onore, and Ancola. On leaving
                    Devakara, in North Canara, commences the country of Karnata, which extends below
                    the Ghauts, and occupies all the defiles leading to the mountains. Here the
                    Western Ghauts, although steep and stony, are by no means rugged or broken with
                    rocks. On the contrary, the stones are buried in a rich mould; and the sides of
                    the mountains are clothed with the most stately forests, in which are seen the
                    finest bamboos and the most stately palms. There is no underwood or creepers to
                    interrupt the passage through these woods; but they are infested with numerous
                    tigers, and the climate is very unhealthy. The district of Ancola is larger than
                    the other two, though, having suffered more severely from the ravages of
                    Mahratta warfare, it does not yield above half the revenue of the other two.
                    North Canara produces sandal-wood, trees, sugar-canes, teak, wild cinnamon,
                    nutmegs, and pepper. About midway up the Ghauts the teak becomes very common. In
                    many parts, as in the western districts of Soonda, the cultivation of gardens is
                    the chief object of the farmer. In these gardens are raised promiscuously
                    betel-nut and betel-leaf, black pepper, cardamums, and plantains. Towards the
                    eastern side of the province there are very few gardens. The land-tax on these
                    gardens was raised by Tippoo, in consequence of which many of them are now
                    waste. Major Munro, after the country came into the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347939" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7939-0072"/>possession of the British,
                    reduced the rent to the former standard. But a greater indulgence was expected
                    by the people before they would begin to plant. To the east of Soonda the great
                    object of cultivation is rice; and although the rains are not so heavy as to the
                    westward, yet in cooling seasons, on a moist soil, they are sufficient to bring
                    to maturity a crop of rice that requires six months to ripen. A few of the
                    highest fields arc cultivated with a kind of rice that ripens in three months.
                    To the north of Battacolla a great portion of the soil is poor. About Beiluru
                    are many groves of the tree from the seeds of which is expressed the common
                    lamp-oil of the country.</p>
                <p>The sea coast is chiefly occupied by villages of the Brahmins. The interior
                    belongs to other castes, who pursue, some of them agriculture, and others trade.
                    Some of them, who are of the purest descent, are cultivators or soldiers, and,
                    as usual among this class of Hindoos, are strongly addicted to robbery; and by a
                    long course of licentiousness during the anarchy which prevailed in Canara, they
                    have acquired habits of extraordinary cruelty, and even compelled many Brahmins
                    to follow their customs, and to assume their caste. The principal towns in North
                    Canara are Battacolla, Ancola, Carwar, Mirjaow, and Onore. The rivers by which
                    the country is watered, from the short intervals between the country and the
                    sea, are of no great magnitude, being generally mountain streams. <hi

                    >South,</hi> is situated between the twelfth and fourteenth degrees of northern
                    latitude; and is separated from the province of Malabar by a wide inlet of the
                    sea. It is called Tulava by the Hindus, and South Canara by the British. It is a
                    strip of land along the sea coast, rising as it approaches the Ghaut Mountains;
                    and the soil becomes gradually less adapted for grain as it recedes from the
                    sea. The best in quality extends from Mangalore to •Buntwalla. The banks of the
                    river Mangalore, which in the rainy season is very large, are very beautiful and
                    rich; and the whole country resembles that of Malabar, only that the terraces on
                    the sides of the hills have been formed with less care than in Malabar. Much of
                    the rice land is so well watered by springs and rivulets, that it produces a
                    constant succession of crops of that grain, one crop being sown as soon as the
                    preceding one is cut. The soil which is second in quality is that which extends
                    from Buntwalla to Punjalcutta, and the worst is that which extends from this
                    place to the hills. There the rains are so excessive that they injure the crops
                    of rice; but this inland portion of the country is very favourable for
                    plantations. About Cavila, east of Mangalore, some of the hills are covered with
                    tall thick forests, in which the teak tree abounds. From Urigara to Hopodurga
                    the country near the sea is low and sandy, and too poor to produce even
                    cocoa-nuts. This country has been dreadfully depopulated by the ravages of war.
                    It suffered severely in its conquest by Tippoo, and by subsequent tyranny. It
                    had been previously shared among petty princes and numerous feudatories, who
                    were all forced to retire before the armies of Tippoo, and to fly into the woods
                    to avoid circumcision, a rite which was invariably forced upon them, in order to
                    make them good Mahommedans; and it generally had this effect, for after
                    suffering such an infliction from Tippoo, they lost their caste, and had
                    therefore no alternative left. The inner parts of the country arc much overgrown
                    with woods, and very thinly inhabited.</p>
                <p>The sugar-cane is cultivated on the low ground; but very small quantities only
                    are raised, and that entirely by the native Christians. Between the rows of
                    sugarcane are raised some cucurbitaceous plants, and some kitchen stuffs that
                    soon come to maturity. On the highest of rice land, where water may be had by
                    digging to a little depth, some people, chic-fly Christians, cultivate capsicum.
                    In the back gardens of the houses are cultivated ginger, turmeric, capsicum,
                    greens, roots, &amp;c. The exports by land consist chiefly of salt, salt-fish,
                    betel-nut, ginger, cocoa-nuts, cocoa-nut oil, and raw silk. The imports by land
                    arc chiefly cloths, cotton, thread, blankets, tobacco, and black cattle, with a
                    small quantity of pepper and sandal-wood.</p>
                <p>The chief inhabitants arc Moplays (Mahommedans), who possess the sea coast, as
                    the Nairs do the interior. It is observed by Dr Buchanan, that the occupiers of
                    land in this district are richer than those of Malabar; but he adds, that the
                    universal cry of poverty which prevails all over India, and the care with which,
                    owing to long oppression, every thing is concealed, render it extremely
                    difficult to know the real circumstances of the cultivator. He concludes,
                    however, from the obstinate contest which takes place for the possession of the
                    land, that the cultivators have still a considerable interest in the soil. It
                    appears, however, from the evidence of other collectors, that the inhabitants
                    manifest in this way their regard to their paternal inheritance, for which they
                    contend to the last; and when their interest as proprietors is lost in the
                    increase of the assessment, they remain tilling the ground in the humble
                    capacity of cultivators. There is no doubt that they never were so completely
                    subdued by a foreign conqueror as the greater part of the Hindoos, and always
                    retained the title to their lands, which their rulers were never able entirely
                    to take from them. When the province accordingly was conquered by the British,
                    they found the landholders possessed of the clearest titles to their respective
                    properties, which were recognised by the law of the country, as well as by
                    immemorial usage. The chief towns of South Canara are Barcelore, Mangalore, and
                    Callianpoor.</p>
                <p>A number of Christians, to the amount of about 800,000, had been ordered to
                    settle in this country by the ancient Hindu princes, with whom they had been in
                    great favour. They were all of Concan descent, and retained their own language,
                    dress, and manners. They were educated in a seminary at Goa, where they were
                    instructed in the Portuguese and Latin languages, and in the doctrines of the
                    Roman church. About this period twenty-seven Christian churches existed in
                    Tulava, each ruled by a vicar, and the whole under the control of a
                    vicar-general, subject to the archbishop of Goa. Tippoo, when he conquered the
                    country, proved himself to be the great persecutor of the Christian religion,
                    throwing the priests into dungeons, destroying the churches, and forcing the
                    laity to assume the Mahommedan creed. After the conquest of the country by the
                    British, many of these persecuted refugees returned and resumed their former
                    faith; 15,000 came back to Mangalore and its vicinity; 10,000 made their escape
                    from Tippoo to Malabar, whence they also have retired. These people are of
                    quiet, sober, and industrious habits, and their superiority is acknowledged by
                    the neighbouring Hindus. The Jain sect abound more in this province than in any
                    other throughout India, and many of their temples are to be seen. Like other
                    Hindus, they are divided into many sects, which cannot intermarry. (F.
