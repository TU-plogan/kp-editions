                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">CENSOR</label> (from <hi rend="italic">censere,</hi> to
                    estimate or judge), one of the principal magistrates in ancient Rome. Their
                    business was to register the effects of the Roman citizens, to impose taxes in
                    proportion to what each man possessed, ļ and to take cognizance or inspection of
                    the manners of ' the citizens. In virtue of this last part of their office, they
                    had authority to censure vice or immorality, by inflicting some public mark of
                    ignominy on the offender. They had •ven a power to create the <hi rend="italic"
                    >princeps senatus,</hi> and to expel rom the senate such as they deemed unworthy
                    of that )ffice. But this power they sometimes exercised with- )ut sufficient
                    grounds; and therefore a law was at length )assed that no senator should be
                    degraded or disgraced n any manner until he had been formally accused and bund
                    guilty by both the censors. It was also a part of he censorial jurisdiction to
                    fill up the vacancies in the enate, upon any remarkable deficiency in their
                    number; o let out to farm all the lands, revenues, and customs, of he republic;
                    and to contract with artificers for the charge ∣f building and repairing all the
                    public works and edifices ιoth in Rome and the colonies of Italy. In all parts
                    of heir office, however, they were subject to the jurisdiction f the people; and
                    an appeal always lay from the judgment of the censors to that of an assembly of
                    the people.</p>
                <p>The first two censors were created in the year of Rome 11, upon the senate
                    observing that the consuls were so ιuch occupied with war as not to have time to
                    look into ther matters. The office continued to the time of the mperors, who
                    assumed the censorial power, calling them-flves <hi rend="italic">morum
                    praefecti</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> though Vespasian and his son )ok also the
                    title of censors. Decius attempted to retore the dignity to a particular
                    magistrate. But after this e hear no more of it till the time of Constantine,
                    who ιade his brother censor; and he seems to have been the st who enjoyed the
                    office.</p>
                <p>The office of censor was so considerable that for a long time no one aspired to
                    it till he had passed all the rest; and hence it was thought aspiring in Crassus
                    to seek to be admitted as censor, without having been either consul or praetor.
                    At first the censors enjoyed their dignity for five years; but in 420 the
                    Dictator Mamercus made a law restraining it to a year and a half, which was
                    afterwards observed very strictly. At first one of the censors was elected out
                    of a patrician, and the other out of a plebeian family; and upon the death of
                    either the other was discharged from his office, and two new ones elected,
                    though not till the next lustrum. In the year of Rome 622, both censors were
                    chosen from among the plebeians; and after that time the office was shared
                    between the senate and the people. On their election in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >comitia centuriata,</hi> the censors proceeded to the capitol, where they took
                    an oath not to be guided either by favour or disaffection, but to act equitably
                    and impartially throughout the whole course of their administration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Censors</hi><hi rend="italic">of Boohs,</hi> persons
                    authorized in different countries to examine all books before they go to the
                    press, and to take care that they contain nothing contrary to faith and good
                    manners. In England we had formerly an officer of this kind, under the title of
                    licenser of the press; but since the revolution our press has been laid under no
                    such restraint. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography.</hi></p>
