                <p><label type="entry">CHALMERS, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, an
                    historical, antiquarian, and political writer of considerable eminence, was
                    descended from the family of Chalmers of Pittensear, in the county of Moray, and
                    was born at Fochabers in the end of the year 1742. After the usual attendance at
                    the grammar school of his native town, he was sent to King’s College, Aberdeen,
                    where lie passed through the regular academical course, and had as one of his
                    preceptors the celebrated Dr Reid, then professor of moral philosophy. Mr
                    Chalmers subsequently removed to Edinburgh, where he studied law for several
                    years. In 1763, when in his twenty-first year, he went to America, with an
                    uncle, as a companion, and to assist him, as a lawyer, in the recovery of a
                    tract of land of considerable extent in Maryland. The prospects which opened to
                    him there induced him to settle at Baltimore, in Maryland, where he practised as
                    a lawyer; and by his abilities, assiduity, and integrity, he acquired in a few
                    years business of considerable extent and emolument. During this time commenced
                    the unhappy disputes between the two countries, which ended in the establishment
                    of American independence; and in which Mr Chalmers rendered himself obnoxious by
                    taking a decided part with the royalist party. In the great question relative to
                    the payment of tithes, which overset the church establishment of the southern
                    colonies, he appeared on the side of the clergy, and was opposed by Patrick
                    Henry, the Virginia lawyer, who afterwards distinguished himself by moving in
                    the Virginia Commons House the five propositions which led to the separation of
                    the colonies from the crown. His pleading, we are informed, was truly
                    constitutional, and displayed great acuteness and research; hut public opinion
                    was so decidedly engaged on the opposite side, and partyspirit raged with so
                    much violence, that he found it expedient to abandon all his professional
                    prospects, and, like many of his countrymen placed in a similar situation, at
                    considerable personal sacrifices to seek for refuge in his native country.</p>
                <p>Mr Chalmers came to England about the year 1775. His claims as a suffering
                    loyalist, and his perfect knowledge of the real object of the colonial dispute,
                    and of the personal character of the leading agitators, with the means both
                    domestic and foreign on which they relied for the success of their cause, might
                    have recommended him to ministers as an able partizan; but he received no
                    compensation for the losses he had sustained, and several years elapsed ere he
                    obtained an appointment which placed him in a state of tranquillity and
                    independence. In the mean time Mr Chalmers applied himself with great diligence
                    and assiduity to the first of his literary undertakings. This was to investigate
                    the history and establishment of the English colonies in North America; and
                    enjoying free access to the state-papers, and other documents preserved among
                    the plantation records, he obtained much original and important information. His
                    work is entitled “Political Annals of the present United Colonies, from their
                    Settlement to the Peace of 1763; compiled chiefly from Records, and authorized
                    often by the insertion of State Papers.” London, 1780, 4to. It was intended to
                    have formed two volumes; but the second, which should have contained the period
                    between the British revolution of 1688 and the peace of 1763, never appeared.
                    The first volume, containing the earlier history, is fortunately complete in
                    itself; and he has traced, in a clear and instructive manner, the original
                    settlement of the different colonies, and the progressive changes in their
                    constitutions and forms of government, as affected by the state of public
                    affairs in the parent kingdom. The number of original documents which are
                    introduced would have given historical value to any similar work, however it
                    might have been executed; but every page of this arduous undertaking bears
                    evidence of the author’s diligence and research; and it has been of essential
                    benefit to later writers. It might be supposed that one chief object
                    contemplated by Mr Chalmers in this work, was to trace the progress of colonial
                    administration, for the purpose of vindicating the conduct of the British
                    government in the recent contests.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>From a list of his publications, communicated by Mr Chalmers
                    to Ι∖l’r George Paton, in May 1791, it appears that Mr Chalmers was also the
                    author of the following tracts. Án Answer from the Electors of Bristol, to the
                    Letter of Edmund Burke, Esq. on the Affairs of America. I.and. 1777, 8vo. The
                    Propriety of allowing a qualified Export of Wool discussed historically. Lond.
                    1782, 8vo. An Introduction to the History of the Revolt of the Colonies. Vol. I.
                    only printed, which was cancelled. Lond. 1782, 8vo, p. 500, ending with the
                    Reign of George I. Three tracts on the Irish Arrangements. Lond. 1785,
                    8vo.</p></note> This, however, was not the fact, although it was natural for a
                    person in his situation to view with some degree of hostility what he styled
                    “the contention of the confederated colonies against the supreme power of the
                    state,” as such feelings were entertained by most men in Britain at that time,
                    who were not prepared to see a people shaking themselves free from the thraldom
                    of a distant government. In 1782 first appeared the “Estimate of the Comparative
                    Strength of Great Britain during the present and four preceding Reigns,” by Mr
                    Chalmers. This work passedthrough several editions in an enlarged form, and was
                    also translated into French and German. It was succeeded by a tract entitled
                    “Opinions on interesting subjects of Public Law and Commercial Policy; arising
                    from American Independance.” London, 1784, 8vo.</p>
                <p>In August 1786, Mr Chalmers was fortunate in Obtaining the situation of chief
                    clerk to the Committee of Privy Council, which was then appointed for the
                    “consideration of all matters relating to trade and foreign plantations.” The
                    duties of this respectable office he continued to discharge for nearly forty
                    years; and being an office of considerable emolument, he was enabled to spend
                    his life in ease and affluence, and to devote himself during this long period to
                    an unwearied prosecution of literary and antiquarian pursuits. He also continued
                    till the close of life to act as colonial agent for the Bahama Islands.</p>
                <p>It was probably not many years after his permanent official appointment that Mr
                    Chalmers had his attention directed in an especial manner to the history, early
                    literature, and topographical antiquities of Scotland; and while he was silently
                    collecting materials for several important national works, and which fully
                    required a lifetime to execute, he allowed himself perhaps too often to lay them
                    aside, to bring out others of a more temporary interest or importance. The
                    following is a list of the several works he published subsequent to 1786. 1.

                <p>This enumeration contains, we believe, a pretty exact list of all Mr Chalmers’
                    publications;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Two
                    excellent papers in the Looker-on have been ascribed by mistake to Air George
                    Chalmers. The author is the present Alexander Chalmers, Esq., a most worthy and
                    highly respected veteran in literature, who is a native of Aberdeen, and has
                    been long resident in London, but is no relative of the author of
                    Caledonia.</p></note> and of most of them it is not necessary to make any
                    particular mention. His Life of Ruddiman the grammarian preserves many curious
                    notices, and throws much light on the state of literature in Scotland during the
                    earlier part of the last century; but written unfortunately in a very stately
                    and inflated style, which the author too much affected. His volumes on the
                    Shakspeare controversy are full of curious matter relating to the history of the
                    stage and the early drama, but, on the whole, display a great waste of
                    erudition; and it would have been as creditable to his judgment had Mr Chalmers
                    not placed himself in a situation to be mistaken for an apologist of literary
                    forgery or credulity, while attempting to show that papers which <hi
                    rend="italic">had</hi> been proved to be forgeries <hi rend="italic">might</hi>
                    nevertheless have been genuine. Neither was he more fortunate in his endeavours
                    to fix the authorship of Junius’ Letters on Hugh Boyd; for although he had
                    satisfied himself, by bringing the proof, as he thought, to a <hi rend="italic"
                    >moral certainty,</hi> and some of the coincidences he has adduced are very
                    remarkable, the public voice has not sanctioned his decision. His edition of Sir
                    David Lyndsay was a valuable accession to our stock of old Scotish poetry, as it
                    is the only complete edition of his poetical works, and the text has been
                    restored by a careful collation of the early printed copies, which are of the
                    greatest rarity. The volume of Churchyard’s pieces is also very curious, and
                    well edited. His Life of Queen Mary is a work of great labour and research, but
                    is not entirely original; at least from the preface we learn that the reverend
                    John Whitaker, the Historian of Manchester, and the Vindicator of the Scotish
                    Queen, had left behind him an unfinished Life of Mary. His papers were put into
                    Mr Chalmers’ hands by his widow and daughters for publication; but he informs us
                    that “various avocations, and some years of ill health, have hitherto prevented
                    me from executing their desires, as well as my own wishes,” by publishing this
                    work; and that he found it necessary “to rewrite the whole.” The history of our
                    ill-fated Queen was one that occupied much of Mr Chalmers’ attention, being
                    “convinced that she was a calumniated woman and an injured princess.” One of the
                    latest acts of his life was to expose an unwise and ignorant attempt to bring
                    into public notice some fictitious letters, purporting to be “originals” of
                    love-letters from Queen Mary to the Earl of Bothwell, and hitherto unknown;
                    while they had appeared in more than one edition about a century before, but had

                <p>But Mr Chalmers’greatest work is his “Caledonia.” Such a gigantic undertaking
                    must have been the labour of many years previous to the appearance of the first

                    In a letter dated February 1794, Mr Chalmers refers to a projected work, Villare
                    Scoticum, which may have been the groundwork of his Caledonia. (Paton Letters,

                    evenings."</hi> It is divided into four books, each treating “of such periods as
                    were analogous to the genuine history of each successive people.” These periods
                    are the Roman, the Pictish, the Scotish, and the Scoto-Saxon period, from A. υ.
                    80 to 1306. In these books there is presented, in a condensed form, all that
                    relates to the people, the language, the history civil and ecclesiastical, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193351033" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1033-0310"/>and the
                    agricultural and commercial state of Scotland during the first thirteen
                    centuries of our era; and in thus investigating the history and antiquities of
                    his native country, he has determined, with not less decision than propriety,
                    many controverted points of great and perplexing obscurity. According to his
                    original plan, the second volume should have contained his “Dictionary of
                    Places;” but was probably reserved for the conclusion of the work, as the author
                    proceeded to carry on his topographical survey of Scotland, deduced from the
                    commencement of the fourteenth century, under the head of the several shires.
                    Accordingly we find that each shire forms a separate chapter, divided into eight
                    sections :—The first treating of its name; the second of its situation and
                    extent; the third of its natural objects; the fourth of its antiquities; the
                    fifth of its establishment as a shire; the sixth of its civil history; the
                    seventh of its agriculture, manufactures, and trade; and the eighth of its
                    ecclesiastical history. This second volume contained the seven south-eastern
                    shires; namely, Roxburgh, Berwick, Haddington, Edinburgh, Linlithgow, Peebles,
                    and Selkirk. “In the subsequent volumes,” he says, “will follow the
                    topographical history of the southwestern, the eastern, and northern shires, in
                    convenient season; as the materials are provided, the details are formed, and
                    the composition is easy to the pen of diligence.” An interval of fourteen years,
                    however, elapsed before the appearance of the third volume, which contained the
                    seven south-western shires, namely, Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Wigton, Ayr,
                    Lanark, Renfrew, and Dumbarton. On this occasion he says, “the accounts of some
                    other shires are already written; and the materials for the whole have been
                    abundantly collected, while the composition becomes daily more facile from the
                    habit of writing. <hi rend="italic">With all those facilities, tujo years will
                    probably see the whole com-pktβd."</hi> But he was not doomed to survive two
                    years, or to have the satisfaction of bringing this work to a successful
                    termination. In fact, another volume would have been inadequate for this
                    purpose, as more than half the shires remained to be described; and we know that
                    Mr Chalmers thought it would extend to five volumes. In a letter to the writer
                    of this article, dated February 1824, he says, “My standing work is Caledonia. I
                    am working hard to go to press with another, that is, the fourth volume, of
                    Caledonia, <hi rend="italic">next autumn.</hi> My heart is set in finishing this
                    great work, if I be spared.” From letters written in the same year, stating his
                    progress in the work, it might be inferred that he had brought it well on to a
                    conclusion; but in the ardour of his desires he was too apt to overlook the most
                    arduous part of his task; and we have reason to believe that he left behind him
                    very scanty materials for this purpose. The last time the writer of this article
                    saw Mr Chalmers (which was only a few weeks before his death, and when he seemed
                    to enjoy his usual good health), he had, in compliance with the urgent request
                    of his friends, and aware of his own very advanced age, being then upwards of
                    eighty, latterly come to the resolution of compressing his materials, so as to
                    keep the work, if possible, within its original prescribed limits.</p>
                <p>Besides the termination of “Caledonia,” Mr Chalmers had for many years been
                    engaged in collecting materials for other works of not less important and
                    laborious a nature. Indeed the vigour of his mind, when he had attained far more
                    than the usual period of human life, was remarkable, and he continued to speak
                    of his literary undertakings as if half that period lay still before him
                    untrodden. One of these works was a <hi rend="italic">History of Scotish
                    Poetry,</hi> another a <hi rend="italic">History of Printing in Scotland</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> each of them, it was calculated, likely to extend to two
                    large volumes in quarto. In reference to these works (for which he had begun to
                    collect materials at least twenty years before), he says, in a letter written in
                    1815, “My collections for Scots Printing are encreased to a pretty large extent,
                    and fair arrangement.” In 1816, “I long much to bring my whole strength upon the
                    History of Poets and Poetry in Scotland, that you may have a standard work upon
                    this interesting subject.” In 1817, “I shall very soon close my Scotish
                    Printers, which will be a more curious book than I originally conceived.” In the
                    same year, as an apology for some delay in answering a letter, he writes, “You
                    will easily pardon or pity a man who is oppressed with official, political, and
                    literary labours; and who does, by working morning, noon, and night, more than
                    any other man in my situation could do.” He had also prepared for the press an
                    elaborate History of the Life and Reign of David I. who died in 1153. With all
                    his unwearied diligence and activity of mind, it was evident to those who knew
                    him, that during the latter period of his life he would have made comparatively
                    but little progress in these works had he been left to his own individual
                    resources. But it was fortunate for him that he enjoyed the able assistance of
                    his nephew Mr James Chalmers, who gave up a situation in one of the public
                    offices for the sole purpose of assisting his uncle in his researches. With what
                    assiduity and success that gentleman continued to labour for upwards of twenty
                    years need not be stated to those who have the pleasure of his acquaintance; and
                    it is matter of regret that not merely the risk, but the certainty of the loss
                    that would attend the publication of such large and voluminous works, should
                    deter him from completing “Caledonia,” or those other works we have alluded to,
                    for which, by his literary habits, he is so eminently qualified.</p>
                <p>Mr "George Chalmers died in his house, James’s Street, Buckingham Gate, London,
                    May 31st 1825, after a few days illness, in the eighty-third year of his age. He
                    was a member of the Royal and Antiquarian Societies, London, an honorary member
                    of the Antiquaries of Scotland, and of other learned societies. In private life
                    he exhibited nothing of that assuming superiority and dogmatic tone which mark
                    his controversial writings. For, in forming a just estimate of his character, it
                    neither can nor ought to be concealed, that he was a writer of strong
                    prejudices, with an indescribable want of taste or elegance in composition. He
                    is also chargeable with a want of minute accuracy in scholarship, in some
                    instances amounting to a forgetfulness of the common rules of grammatical
                    construction. It might have been too much to expect classical purity of style
                    along with patient research and minute elaboration of doubtful points; but we
                    wish he had contented himself with writing in a natural and simple manner,
                    without affecting ornament. But the tone and spirit of his writings is sometimes
                    much more offensive than the manner. In his Life of Queen Mary, he would have
                    left a more favourable impression on the minds of his readers had he declaimed
                    with less vehemence against her various accusers and political antagonists; and
                    we should have valued the book more had he treated with a greater degree of
                    courtesy the persons who, in recent times, presumed to inquire into, or to
                    express their doubts of, the purity and correctness of the personal conduct of
                    the unhappy queen. By his political as well as antiquarian writings he involved
                    himself in disputes with persons of very different characters and attainments.
                    But Mr Chalmers had a mind that was not to be diverted from his purpose by any
                    mode of literary hostility. Neither the sneers of professed wits, nor the cavils
                    and exposures of other adversaries, had any effect in subduing that lofty
                    confidence in himself and his own powers, which is sometimes allied with genius,
                    and is at least essential for the accomplishment of any great undertaking. In Mr
                    Chalmers, however, this sustaining self-complacency<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193351046" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1046-0311"/> was joined with perhaps too
                    liberal a share of indifference to the opinion of others. That in all his
                    literary and political contests he manifested no undue want of candour and
                    forbearance, we fear cannot be truly asserted, as it was not likely that, in the
                    fervour of politics, and the jarrings of party interests, his candour and
                    judgment would have that control over his temper which was wanting in the
                    discussion of questions of less excitement. Among his avowed antagonists in
                    literary warfare the most distinguished were Malone and Steevens, the Shakspeare
                    editors; Mr Mathias, the author of the Pursuits of Literature; Dr Jamieson, the
                    Scotish lexicorapher; Mr Pinkerton, the historian; Dr Irving, the biographer of
                    the Scotish poets; and Dr Currie of Liverpool. Of these we shall allude only to
                    the last in particular. In July 1793 there was published a letter, “political
                    and commercial,” addressed to Pitt, under the name of “Jaspar Wilson,” in which
                    the writer deprecated this country continuing at war with France, and
                    attributing much of the commercial distresses which prevailed, not only in
                    England, but throughout Europe, to the “funding system supporting the
                    war-system.” This letter excited so much attention, that several supporters of
                    the measures of the English government came forward to answer it, and among the
                    rest Mr Chalmers. This he did in the form of a letter of 130 pages, addressed to
                    Dr Currie by name as <hi rend="italic">the reputed</hi> author of Jaspar Wilson,
                    prefixed as a dedication to a new edition, in 1794, of his “Comparative
                    Estimate,” but written in a tone of familiarity and intimacy, which, however it
                    might suit Mr Chalmers’ views at the time, was, it appears, wholly
                    unwarranted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    statement in the Life of Dr Currie, the amiable and accomplished biographer of
                    Robert Burns, vol. i. pp. 201-6, and 504-G.</p></note></p>
                <p>But with all his failings in judgment and in matters of taste, Mr Chalmers was an
                    invaluable writer. He uniformly had recourse to the fountain-sources of
                    information, not trusting to the statements and conclusions of preceding
                    writers; and thus he never failed to bring new lights to bear upon his subject.
                    There can be no doubt also, however biassed he might seem in his sentiments,
                    that the desire of truth was predominant; and his patriotic endeavours to
                    illustrate the history, literature, and antiquities of his native country, were
                    attended by very great pecuniary sacrifices, instead of being productive to the
                    author. As he says in the preface to Caledonia, vol. ii. “In the investigation
                    of truth I have not been discouraged by any difficulty, and I have not declined
                    any labour; I have sought new documents, and I have tried in my narrative to be
                    neither too general nor too minute.” His Caledonia is a work of higher
                    importance than perhaps any that could be named illustrative of the history and
                    state of this part of the British empire. As a literary monument of the author’s
                    industry and erudition, it is to be lamented that a work of such noble
                    dimensions should not have displayed greater simplicity of style; and had it
                    been happily completed, and a new edition called for, although such a process
                    was not to be looked for from the author’s hand, it was susceptible of much
                    improvement,even were such corrections limited to drawing the pen through
                    superfluous epithets and unnecessary reflections. That the plan adopted was the
                    best, any more than that the execution was all that could be desired, cannot be
                    affirmed; but with all such minor defects, it is a work which a person of
                    greater genius or scholarship would not have undertaken, and one which a mere
                    plodding antiquary’ could not have performed. The very able and perspicuous
                    manner in which he has investigated the state of the country from the remotest
                    period of our history, tracing through its fabulous epochs the various tribes
                    who successively inhabited the respective districts and petty kingdoms, may be
                    thought to constitute the most valuable portion of that truly national work; and
                    yet, in the comprehensive view which is given of its subsequent state and
                    condition, whether in general or local detail, not less skill is shown in
                    condensing and reducing a vast and unformed mass of materials, which, even as a
                    mere book of reference, must be of the greatest benefit to all future labourers
                    in the same wide and fruitful field of investigation. As the author of this
                    work, the name of George Chalmers will be honourably remembered by his
                    countrymen; and he may be set forth as an example of what human industry'· and
                    talents, when united in the same individual, are able to accomplish. (c. c.
