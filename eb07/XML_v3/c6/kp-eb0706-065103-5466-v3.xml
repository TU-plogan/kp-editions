                    is to arrange and exhibit the various events which have occurred in the history
                    of the world in the order of their succession, and to ascertain the intervals of
                    time between them.</p>
                <p>The preservation of any record, however rude, of the lapse of time, implies some
                    knowledge of the celestial motions, by which alone time can be accurately
                    measured, and some advancement in the arts of civilized life, which could only
                    be attained by the accumulated experience of many generations. Before the
                    invention of letters, the memory of past transactions could not be preserved
                    beyond a few years with any tolerable degree of accuracy. Events which greatly
                    affected the physical condition of the human race, or were of a nature to make a
                    deep impression on the minds of the rude inhabitants of the earth, might he
                    vaguely transmitted through several ages by traditional narrative; but intervals
                    of time, expressed by abstract numbers, and these too constantly varying, would
                    soon escape from the memory. The invention of the art of writing afforded the
                    means of substituting precise and permanent records for vaguc and evanescent
                    tradition; but in the infancy of the world mankind had neither learned to
                    estimate accurately the duration of time, nor to refer passing events to a fixed
                    and determined epoch. Writing was practised many centuries before historians
                    began to assign dates to the events they narrated.</p>
                <p>For these reasons the history of the early ages of the world is involved in
                    impenetrable obscurity, and chronology, comparatively speaking, is only of
                    recent date. After political relations began to be established, the necessity of
                    preserving a register of passing seasons and years would soon be felt, and the
                    practice of recording important transactions must have grown up as a necessary
                    consequence of social life. But of these early records, how small a portion has
                    escaped the ravages of time and barbarism? The annals of the early Greeks and of
                    the Etruscans are irretrievably lost. Of the chronicles which Manetho, high
                    priest of Sebenne, professed to have reduced from the archives of the Egyptian
                    temples; of the histories of Sanconiathon the Phoenician, of Berosus,
                    Hecataeus,and others, only a few mutilated fragments have been transmitted to
                    our times through the suspected relation of Josephus, Julius Africanus,
                    Eusebius, Syncellus, and other chronologers. The Gauls destroyed the records of
                    ancient Rome. The Romans, in their turn, extirpated the Druids of Gaul and
                    Britain, and obliterated the last vestiges of their ancient traditions. An Arab
                    chief burned the library of Alexandria, a Chinese emperor the histories of his
                    own country, and a Spanish soldier the paintings and hieroglyphics of the palace
                    of Montezuma.</p>
                <p>In order to preserve an exact record of the succession of events, some
                    conventional <hi rend="italic">epochs</hi> or fixed point of time, must be taken
                    as the origin of the reckoning, and some standard period assumed with which the
                    successive intervals may be compared. It is a trite remark, that the simplest
                    ideas are generally the latest in representing themselves to the mind. Nothing
                    seems more obvious than to measure the longer intervals of time by the tropical
                    revolutions of the sun, and to number the years in regular succession. But this
                    simple method was not adopted by historians in the earliest ages. In the
                    Scripture history the lapse of time is frequently estimated by generations, or
                    reigns of kings, and not by exact numbers of years. The historians of early
                    Greece proceeded in a similar manner. Hellanicus regulated his narrative by the
                    succession of the priestesses of Juno in the temple of Argos. Others reckoned by
                    the ephori and kings of Sparta, or the archons of Athens. Ephorus, the disciple
                    of Isocrates, who composed a chronological history of Greece, reckoned by
                    generations. Eratosthenes and Apollodorus, who flourished about a hundred years
                    after the death of Alexander the Great, first attempted to introduce precision
                    into historical records, by substituting numbers of years for generations,
                    reigns, or successions. (See Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Chronology,</hi>
                    Introduction). Now, when time is measured by any of the above methods, it is
                    obvious that we can only approximate to the intervals between successive events,
                    from our knowledge of the average duration of human life, and of kings’ reigns,
                    in the present state of the world. Chronologers usually reckon three generations
                    equivalent to a hundred years, and Sir Isaac Newton allows eighteen or twenty
                    years to a reign or succession. In a great number of years this estimate is
                    probably near the truth, but it affords very uncertain information with respect
                    to short periods, and none whatever with regard to the duration of an individual
                    reign. It is to those loose methods of marking the lapse of time that we must
                    ascribe the great discrepancy that exists among the chronological accounts of
                    the early ages of Greece and Rome.</p>
                <p>Another great cause of uncertainty and confusion in chronology has arisen from
                    the diversity of epochs assumed by historians, and the practice, which has been
                    unhappily too prevalent, of shifting the origin of their eras from one epoch to
                    another. Having little intercourse with each other, the different groups or
                    communities into which mankind were divided in early times, instead of agreeing
                    on a common epoch, began each to date the years from some event, important
                    perhaps in reference to its individual history, but of which other tribes were
                    probably entirely ignorant, or which at least they regarded with indifference.
                    Hence in ancient history we have the Olympiad ofCoraebus, the foundation of
                    Rome, the era ofNabonassar &amp;c.; and in more recent times the Christian era,
                    the Hegira, the era of Yezdegird, &amp;c. Some centuries after the introduction
                    of Christianity, the various sects of Christians began to found their eras on
                    events connected with the appearance of Christ, but without any regard to
                    uniformity. Some reckoned from the epoch of his conception, or the annunciation;
                    others from his birth, others again from his passion, others from his ascension;
                    and hence there is very frequently the greatest difficulty in reconciling the
                    dates given by the historians and annalists of the middle ages.</p>
                <p>In reckoning years from any fixed epoch in constant succession, the numbers
                    denoting the years necessarily undergo a constant and unlimited augmentation.
                    But rude nations, and illiterate people in general, seldom attach any definite
                    idea to large numbers. Hence it has been a practice, very extensively followed,
                    to employ cycles or periods, containing a moderate number of years, and to
                    distinguish and reckon the years by their number in the cycle. The Chinese, and
                    some other nations of Asia, reckon not only the years, but also the months and
                    days, by cycles of sixty. The Saros of the Chaldeans, the Olympiad of the
                    Greeks, and the Roman Indiction, are instances of this mode of reckoning time.
                    Several cycles were formerly known in Europe; but most of them were invented for
                    the purpose of adjusting the solar and lunar divisions of time, and were <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193355492" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5492-0653"/> rather employed
                    in the regulation of the calendar than as chronological eras. They are
                    frequently, however, of very great usc in fixing dates that have been otherwise
                    imperfectly expressed, and consequently form important elements of
                    chronology.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Calendar,</hi> we have already treated of
                    that part of Chronology which relates to the measurement of time, and explained
                    with sufficient detail the principal methods that have been employed, or are
                    still in use, for adjusting the lunar months to the solar year, as well as the
                    intercalations necessary for regulating the civil year according to the
                    celestial motions. In the present article it is our purpose to give an account
                    of the different <hi rend="italic">Eras</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Periods</hi>
                    that have been employed by historians, and by the different nations of the
                    world, in recording the succession of time and events; to fix the epochs at
                    which the eras respectively commenced; to ascertain the form and the initial day
                    of the year made use of; and to establish their correspondence with the years of
                    the Christian era. These elements will enable us to convert, by a simple
                    arithmetical operation, any historical date, of which the chronological
                    characters arc given according to any era whatever, into the corresponding date
                    in the common era of the Incarnation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Julian Period.</hi></p>
                <p>Although the Julian period is not, properly speaking, a chronological cra, yet,
                    on account of its affording considerable facilities in the comparison of
                    different eras with one another, and in marking without ambiguity the years
                    before Christ, it is very generally employed by chronologers. It consists of
                    7980 Julian years. The number 7980 is formed by the continued multiplication of
                    the three numbers 28, 19, and 15, that is, of the cycles of the sun, of the
                    moon, and of the Indiction: hence, when the number of any year in the Julian
                    period is divided by one of these three numbers, the remainder of the division
                    will indicate the number of that year in the corresponding cycle. The first year
                    of the Christian era had ten for its number in the cycle of the sun, two in the
                    cycle of the moon, and four in the Indiction; but 4714 is the only number less
                    than 7980 which, on being divided by 28, 19, and 15, gives the respective
                    remainders 10, 2, and 4 (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Calendar).</hi> Hence the
                    first year of the Christian era corresponded with the year 4714 of the Julian
                    period. In order, therefore, to find the year of our era corresponding to any
                    other year of the period, or the contrary, we have the following rule:</p>
                <p>1. When the given year is anterior to the commencement of the Christian era,
                    subtract the number of the year in the Julian period from 4714, and the
                    remainder is the year before Christ: or subtract the year before Christ from
                    4714, and the remainder is the corresponding year in the Julian period.</p>
                <p>2. When the given year is after Christ, subtract 4713 from the year of the
                    period, and the remainder is the year of the Christian cra; or add 4713 to the
                    year of Christ, and the sum is the corresponding year of the Julian period.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Olympiads.</hi></p>
                <p>The Olympic games, so famous in Grecian history, were celebrated once every four
                    years, between the new and full moon first following the summer solstice, on the
                    banks of the river Alpheus, near the city of Pisa, in the Peloponnesus, and
                    lasted five days. They arc said to have been originally instituted by Hercules,
                    at the funeral ceremonies of Pelops, 1354 years before the Christian era; but
                    they seem to have been forgotten, or at least to have been discontinued, during
                    several centuries. They were afterwards re-established by Iphitus, king of a
                    canton of Elis, in concert with Lycurgus and Cleosthenes of Pisa, 844 years
                    before Christ, and 470 years from the time of their original institution; but it
                    was not till upwards of a hundred years after this time that they began to be
                    used as a chronological epoch. It was then that the practice was adopted of
                    designating the Olympiad, or period of four years, by the name of the victor in
                    the contests of the stadium, and of inscribing his name in the gymnasium of
                    Olympia. The first who received this honour was Coroebus. The games in which
                    Coroebus was victor, and which form the principal epoch of Grecian history, were
                    celebrated about the time of the summer solstice, 776 years before the common
                    era of the Incarnation, in the 3938th of the Julian period, and twenty-three
                    years, according to the account of Varro, before the foundation of Rome.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Eorm of the Olympic Year.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Before
                    the introduction of the Metonic cycle, the ordinary Grecian year consisted of
                    twelve lunar months, containing twenty-nine and thirty days alternately; and in
                    order to reconcile this with the course of the sun, a thirteenth month was
                    added, at first every second year, and subsequently three times in eight years.
                    The additional or intercalary month contained thirty days, so that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Octaeteris,</hi> or period of eight years, consisted of
                    ninety-nine months, containing in all 2922 days, which is exactly equal to eight
                    Julian years. The years which contained the intercalary month were called <hi
                    rend="italic">embolismic,</hi> and formed the third, fifth, and eighth of the
                    period. Hence the Olympiads contained forty-nine and fifty months alternately,
                    the first four years of the. Octaeteris containing one intercalary year, and the
                    second two; and hence, also, the Olympic games were celebrated alternately on
                    common and embolismic years. It has been shown in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Calendar,</hi> that the Octaeteris fell short of the actual
                    length of ninety-nine lunations by a day and a half nearly; at the end of two
                    periods, therefore, the moon’s age was three days less than it had been at the
                    commencement, and in order to restore the coincidence between the civil month
                    and the lunation, three days were added to the last year of each second
                    Olympiad. But this correction introduced an error in respect of the sun, and
                    caused the solar year to commence three days too late. This error was allowed to
                    accumulate till the end of the fortieth Olympiad, when a full month of thirty
                    days was omitted, by which means the solar and lunar years were adjusted, and
                    the forty-first Olympiad commenced with the same day of the moon, and the same
                    season of the year, as the first had done 160 years before. According to this
                    arrangement the common years contained 354 days, and the embolismic 384;
                    excepting however the concluding year of each second Octaeteris, which contained
                    387 .days, and the last year of each fortieth Olympiad, which had 357 days.</p>
                <p>In the fourth year of the eighty-sixth Olympiad, Meton published his celebrated
                    cycle of nineteen years, which, after receiving a slight correction from
                    Calippus, continued to be followed ever afterwards, so long as the practice of
                    dating by Olympiads continued in use. Before the introduction of the Metonic
                    cycle, the Olympic year began sometimes with the full moon which followed,
                    sometimes with that which preceded, the summer solstice, on account that the
                    year sometimes contained 384 days instead of 354; but subsequently to its
                    adoption, the year always commenced with the eleventh day of the moon which
                    followed the solstice. In order to avoid troublesome computations, which it
                    would be necessary to recommence for every year, and of which the results differ
                    from one another only by a few days, chronologers in general regard the first of
                    July as the commencement of the Olympic year. Some authors, however, among whom
                    are Eusebius, Jerome, and the historian Socrates, place its commencement at the
                    first of September; but they seem to have confounded the Olympic<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193355505" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5505-0654"/> year with the civil year of
                    the Greeks, or the cra of the Seleucidae.</p>
                <p>It is material to observe, that as the Olympic years and periods begin with the
                    first of July, the first six months of a year of our era correspond to one
                    Olympic year, and the last six months to another. Thus, when it is said that the
                    first year of the Incarnation corresponds to the first of the 195th Olympiad, we
                    are to understand that it is only with respect to the last six months of that
                    year that the correspondence takes place. The first six months belonged to the
                    fourth year of the 194th Olympiad. In referring dates expressed by Olympiads to
                    our era, or the contrary, we must therefore distinguish two cases.</p>
                <p>Is/, When the event in question happened between the first of January and the
                    first of the following July, the sum of the Olympic year and of the year before
                    Christ is always equal to 776. The year of the era, therefore, will be found by
                    subtracting the number of the Olympic year from 776. For example, Varro refers
                    the foundation of Rome to the 21st of April of the third year of the sixth
                    Olympiad, and it is required to find the year before our era. Since five Olympic
                    periods have elapsed, the third year of the sixth Olympiad is 5 × 4 + 3=23;
                    therefore, subtracting 23 from 776, we have 753, which is the year before Christ
                    to which the foundation of Rome is referred by Varro.</p>
                <p>2d, When the event took place between the summer solstice and the first of
                    January following, the sum of the Olympic year and of the year before Christ is
                    equal to 777. The difference therefore between 777 and the year in one of the
                    dates will give the year in the other date. Thus, the moon was eclipsed on the
                    27th of August, a little before midnight, in the year 413 before our era; and it
                    is required to&gt;find the corresponding year in the Olympic era. Subtract 413
                    from 777, the remainder is 364; and 364 divided by four gives 91 without a
                    remainder; consequently the eclipse happened in the fourth year of the
                    ninety-first Olympiad, which is the date to which it is referred by
                    Thucydides.</p>
                <p>If the year is after Christ, and the event took place in one of the first six
                    months of the Olympic year, that is to say, between July and January, we must
                    subtract 776 from the number of the Olympic year to find the corresponding year
                    of our era; but if it took place in one of the last six months of the Olympic
                    year, or between January and July, we must deduct 777. The computation by
                    Olympiads seldom occurs in historical records after the middle of the fifth
                    century of our cra.</p>
                <p>The names of the months were different in the different Grecian states. The Attic
                    months, which were the most usual, are as follows:</p>
                <p>Hecatombeon. Gamelion.</p>
                <p>Metageitnion. Anthesterion.</p>

                <p>Pyanepsion. Munychion.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of the Foundation of Rome.</hi></p>
                <p>After the Olympiads, the era most frequently met with in ancient history is that
                    of the foundation of Rome, which is the chronological epoch adopted by all the
                    Roman historians. There are various opinions respecting the year in which this
                    event took place; but the authorities most deserving of credit are the five
                    following:</p>
                <p>Is/, Fahius Pictor, who places the epoch of the foundation of Rome in the latter
                    half of the first year of the eighth Olympiad, which corresponds with the 3967th
                    of the Julian period, and with the year 747 before Christ.</p>
                <p>2tZ, Polybius, who places it in the second year of the seventh Olympiad,
                    corresponding with 3964 of the Julian period, and 750 <hi rend="smallcaps">b
                    c.</hi></p>
                <p>3d, Cato, who places it in the first year of the seventh' Olympiad, that is, in
                    3963 of the Julian period, and 751 B. c.</p>
                <p>4∕A, Verrius Flaccus, who places it in the fourth year of the sixth Olympiad,
                    that is, in the year 3962 of the Julian period, and 752 <hi rend="smallcaps">b
                    c.</hi><hi rend="italic">bth,</hi> Terentius Varro, who places it in the third
                    year of the sixth Olympiad, that is, in the year 3961 of the Julian period, and
                    753 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi></p>
                <p>A knowledge of these different computations is frequently necessary, in order to
                    reconcile the Roman historians with one another, and even with themselves. Livy
                    in general adheres to the epoch of Cato, though he sometimes follows that of
                    Fabius Pictor. Cicero follows the account of Varro, which is also in general
                    adopted by Pliny. Dionysius of Halicarnassus follows Cato. Modern chronologers
                    for the most part adopt the account of Varro, which is supported by a passage in
                    Censorinus, where it is stated that the 991 st year of Rome commenced with the
                    festival of the Palilia, in the consulship of Ulpius and Pontianus. Now this
                    consulship corresponded with the 238th year of our era; therefore, deducting 238
                    from 991, we have 753 to denote the year before Christ. The Palilia commenced on
                    the 2lst of April; all the accounts agree in regarding this date as the epoch of
                    the foundation of Rome.</p>
                <p>The Romans employed two sorts of years, the civil year, which was used in the
                    transaction of public and private affairs, and the consular year, according to
                    which the annals of their history have been composed. From the time of Numa the
                    civil year always commenced with the calends of January; but by reason of the
                    arbitrary manner in which, till the time of Julius Caesar, their calendar was
                    regulated by the pontiffs, the civil months did not retain a fixed place in the
                    solar year, and the calends of January successively passed into the different
                    seasons. Hence part of the Roman civil year corresponded to one Julian year, and
                    part of it to another. Thus, when the 1st of January in the civil year
                    corresponded with the Julian lst of September, the first four months of the
                    civil year belonged to one Julian year, and the last eight months to the Julian
                    year following. With regard to the consular year (or year of the reign before
                    the expulsion of the kings) the confusion and uncertainty are still greater. The
                    epoch of the succession of a king regulated the commencement of the years of his
                    reign, and the installation of the consuls the commencement of the consular
                    year. The initial day of the consulate was never fixed, at least before the
                    seventh century of Rome, but varied with the different accidents which in times
                    of political commotion so frequently occurred to accelerate or retard the
                    elections. Hence it happens that a consular year, generally speaking,
                    comprehends a part not only of two Julian years, but also of two civil years.
                    The consulate is the date employed by the Latin historians generally, and by
                    many of the Greeks, down to the sixth century of our era.</p>
                <p>In the era of Rome the commencement of the year is placed at the 21st of April;
                    an event therefore which happened in the months of January, February, March, or
                    during the first twenty days of April, in the year (for example) 500 of Rome,
                    belongs to the ⅛∙ivil year 501. Before the time of the Decemvirs, however,
                    February was the last month of the year. Many authors confound the year of Rome
                    with the civil year, supposing them both to begin on the 1st of January. Others
                    again confound both the year of Rome and the civil year with the Julian year,
                    which in fact became the civil year after the regulation of the calendar by
                    Julius Caesar. Through a like want of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355518"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-5518-0655"/>attention, many writers also, particularly among
                    the moderns, have confounded the Julian and Olympic years, by making an entire
                    Julian year correspond to an entire Olympic year, as if both had commenced at
                    the same epoch. Much attention to these particulars is required in the
                    comparison of ancient dates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Christian Era.</hi></p>
                <p>The Christian or vulgar era, called also the era of the Incarnation, is now
                    almost universally employed in Christian countries, and is even used by some
                    eastern nations. Its epoch or commencement is the 1st of January in the fourth
                    year of the 194th Olympiad, the 753d from the foundation of Rome, and the 4714th
                    of the Julian period. It is usually supposed to begin with the year of the birth
                    of Christ, but there are various opinions with regard to the year in which that
                    event took place. The most probable is, that the birth of Christ happened five
                    years and seven days before the initial day of the vulgar era. This method of
                    dating the years was introduced into Italy in the sixth century, by Dennis or
                    Dionysius the Little, a Roman abbot, and began to be used in France in the
                    seventh, though it was not generally followed in that country before the reigns
                    of Pepin and Charlemagne. In England it seems to have been introduced by St
                    Augustin. Before its adoption the usual practice in Latin countries was to
                    distinguish the years by their number in tlie cycle of Indiction.</p>
                <p>In the Christian era the years are simply marked and distinguished by the
                    cardinal numbers; those before Christ being distinguished by the characters <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> (Before Christ), or A.c. (AnteChristum), and those
                    after Christ by <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (Anno Domini.) This method of
                    reckoning time is more commodious than those which employ cycles or periods of
                    any length whatever; and, provided the commencement of the era had been placed
                    at the creation of the world, or at some point of-time prior to all historical
                    records, it would have satisfied, in the simplest manner possible, all the
                    conditions that are necessary for registering the succession of events. But when
                    the commencement of the era is placed, as in the present case, at an
                    intermediate period of history, some inconvenience is felt with regard to the
                    dates of preceding events, on account of the interruption of the numerical
                    order. Some ambiguity is also occasioned by the want of uniformity in the
                    methods adopted by authors, of numbering the preceding years. In order to
                    preserve uniformity in their computations, astronomers denote the year which
                    preceded the first of our era by 0, and the year previous to that by 1 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>; but chronologers, in conformity with common
                    notions, call the year preceding the era 1 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> the
                    previous year 2 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> and so on. By reckoning in this
                    manner, there is an interruption in the regular succession of the numbers; and
                    in the years preceding the era, the leap years, instead of falling on the
                    fourth, eighth, twelfth, &amp;c., fall, or ought to fall, on the first, fifth,
                    ninth, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the chronicles of the middle ages much uncertainty frequently arises
                    respecting dates, on account of the different epochs that have been assumed for
                    the commencement of the Christian year. Dennis, the author of the era, thinking
                    it more natural to reckon from the conception, adopted the day of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annunciation,</hi> or the 25th of March, which preceded the birth
                    of Christ by nine months, as the commencement of the first year of the era. The
                    epoch of Dennis therefore precedes that of the vulgar era by nine months and
                    seven days. This manner of dating was followed in some of the Italian states,
                    and continued to be used in Pisa even down to the year 1745. It was also adopted
                    by some of the Popes in their Bulls; and there are proofs of its having been
                    employed in France about the middle of the eleventh century. Some chroniclers,
                    who adhere to the day of the annunciation as the commencement of the year,
                    reckon from the 25th of March <hi rend="italic">following</hi> our epoch, as the
                    Florentines in the tenth century. Gregory of Tours, and some writers of the
                    sixth and seventh centuries, make the year commence sometimes with the 1st of
                    March, like the Romans before the time of Numa, and sometimes with the 1st of
                    January. In France under the third race of kings it was usual to begin the year
                    with Easter; and this practice continued at least till the middle of the
                    sixteenth century, for an edict was passed by Charles IX. in the month of
                    January 1563, ordaining that the commencement of the year should thenceforth be
                    considered as taking place on the first of-January. An instance is given, in <hi
                    rend="italic">l’Art de Verifier les Dates,</hi> of a date in which the year is
                    reckoned from the 18th of March; but it is probable that this refers to the
                    astronomical year, and that the 18th of March was taken for the day of the
                    vernal equinox. In Germany, about the eleventh century, it was usual to commence
                    the year at Christmas; and this practice also prevailed at Milan, Rome, and
                    other Italian cities, in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>In England, the practice of placing the beginning of the year at Christmas was
                    introduced in the seventh century, and traces of it are found to exist even in
                    the thirteenth. Gervais of Canterbury, who lived in the beginning of the
                    thirteenth century, mentions that almost all writers of his country had agreed
                    in regarding Christmas day as the first of the year, because it forms as it were
                    the term at which the sun finishes and recommences his annual course. In the
                    twelfth century, however, the custom of beginning the civil year with the day of
                    the Annunciation, or the 25th of March, began to prevail, and continued to be
                    generally followed from that time till the reformation of the calendar in 1752.
                    The <hi rend="italic">'historical</hi> year has always been reckoned by English
                    authors to begin with the first of January. The liturgie year of the church of
                    England commences with the first Sunday of Advent.</p>
                <p>A knowledge of the different epochs which have been chosen for the commencement
                    of the year in different countries is indispensably necessary to the right
                    interpretation of the ancient chronicles and annals, in which the dates often
                    appear contradictory, though correctly and precisely marked. We may cite an
                    example or two. It is well known that the emperor Charlemagne was crowned at
                    Rome on Christmas-day in the year 800, and that he died in the year 814,
                    according to our present manner of reckoning; but in the annals of Metz and
                    Moissac, the coronation of Charlemagňe is stated to have taken place in the year
                    801, and his death in 813. Both these statements appear at first sight to be
                    erroneous; but on attending to the different periods at which the year has been
                    supposed to begin, they will both be easily reconciled with the known facts. In
                    the first case the annalist supposes the year to begin with Christmas, and
                    accordingly reckons the 25th of December and all the following days of that
                    month to belong to 801, whereas in the common reckoning they would be referred
                    to the year 800. In the second case the year has been supposed to begin with the
                    25th of March, or perhaps with Easter; consequently the first three months of
                    the year 814, reckoning from the 1st of January, would be referred to the end of
                    the year 813. As another example, the English revolution is popularly called the
                    revolution of 1688. Had the year then begun, as it now does, with the lst of
                    January, it would have been the revolution of 1689, that event having taken
                    place in February in the year 1689; but at that time the year was considered in
                    England as beginning on the 25th of March. Another circumstance to which it is
                    often necessary to pay attention in the comparison of dates, is the alteration
                    of style which took place on the adoption of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193355531" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5531-0656"/>Gregorian Calendar. The old
                    style still continues to be used by the Russians and Greeks; and in order to
                    convert a date expressed in this manner intô the new style, it is necessary to
                    attend to the variation which takes place from century to century, in the
                    interval between the commencement of the Julian and Gregorian years. From the
                    •reformation of the calendar in 1582 to the 29th of February 1700, the
                    difference is ten days; from the 1st of March 1700 to the 29th of February 1800,
                    it is eleven days; from the 1st of March 1800 to the 29th February 1900 the
                    difference is twelve days; and after the 1st of March 1900, if the old style
                    shall then continue to be in use, the difference will be thirteen days, till the
                    29th of February 2100, as has been explained at length in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Calendar.</hi><hi rend="italic">Era of the Creation of the
                    World.</hi></p>
                <p>As the Greek and Roman methods of computing time were connected with certain
                    Pagan rites and observances, which the Christians held in abhorrence, these
                    began at an early period to imitate the Jews in reckoning their years from the
                    creation of the world. The chronological elements on which both Jews and
                    Christians founded their computations for determining the epoch of that event
                    were derived from the Old Testament narrative, which, though sufficiently
                    circumstantial to enable us to determine the lapse of time during the first two
                    ages of the world with considerable precision, has been transmitted to us
                    through three distinct channels, not only differing greatly in respect of
                    chronology, but totally irreconcilable with each other. These are, first, the
                    Hebrew text of the Scriptures; second, the Samaritan text; and, third, the Greek
                    version of the Septuagint. Unfortunately no very conclusive reason can be given
                    for preferring any one of these accounts to another. We have no concurrent
                    testimony with which to compare them: it is not even known which of them was
                    regarded as the most probable by the Jews themselves, when the books of the Old
                    Testament were revised and transcribed by Ezra; and the ordinary rules of
                    probability cannot be applied to a state of things in which the duration of
                    human life extended to nearly a thousand years.</p>

                <p>Hence it appears that the Greek version assigns to this period a duration of 606
                    years above the Hebrew account, and 955 above the Samaritan, while the two lat
                    ter differ from each other only by 349 years. On account of their nearer
                    agreement, and also of their greater antiquity, critics generally give the
                    preference to the Hebrew and Samaritan texts; and as it appears from a passage
                    in St Jerome, that in his day some manuscripts of the Samaritan agreed with the
                    Hebrew in respect of Methusaleh and Lamech (two out of the three cases in which
                    it at present differs), chronologers usually adopt the Hebrew account. The Latin
                    or vulgate translation, which was declared authentic by the Council of Trent, is
                    in entire conformity with the Hebrew.</p>

                <p>In this case the Samaritan and Greek accounts differ greatly from the Hebrew.
                    Their difference from each other is only 230 years; and if we reject Cainan IL,
                    whose name does not appear either in the Hebrew or Samaritan text, the
                    difference is only 100 years, which may easily be supposed to have arisen from
                    the errors of the copyists. The near agreement of the Samaritan and Greek
                    accounts renders it probable that the Hebrew text is in error. As another reason
                    for giving the preference to the Samaritan, it may also be mentioned, that
                    according to the Hebrew account, the dispersion of the descendants of Noah,
                    which took place in the time of Peleg, must have happened about a hundred years
                    after the deluge; and it can hardly be conceived that in so short a space of
                    time they should have increased to so great an extent, that, as it is mentioned,
                    a single country could not contain them. According to the Samaritan text, the
                    dispersion took place about 400 years after the deluge,—a space of time which
                    allows of a considerable increase in the number of the inhabitants of the
                    earth.</p>
                <p>From this period the intervals of time between the principal events recorded in
                    Scripture are seldom mentioned in the same circumstantial manner; and the
                    chronologers who computed the succession of years had not only to contend with
                    the discordant readings, but were often obliged to assign arbitrary values to
                    the <hi rend="italic">generations,</hi> or other vague terms by which the time
                    is computed. From computations founded on such loose and uncertain data, it
                    would be in vain to look for agreement; accordingly the results not only present
                    great discrepancies, but <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355544"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-5544-0657"/>appear to be as numerous as the computations.
                    Desvig-noles, in the preface to his Chronology of Sacred History, asserts that
                    he has collected upwards of two hundred different calculations, the shortest of
                    which reckons only 3483 years between the creation of the world and the
                    commencement of the vulgar era, and the longest 6984. The difference amounts to
                    thirty-five centuries. In the following table we have inserted the results
                    obtained by some of the most eminent of the computers. The reader who is

                <p>All that can be gathered from these conflicting statements amounts to this, that
                    the true epoch of the creation of the world is utterly unknown. British
                    chronologers in general prefer the computation of Archbishop Usher, who places
                    the creation of the world, or rather of Adam, 4004 years before the vulgar
                    era.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Jewish Year and Eras.</hi></p>
                <p>Before the departure of the Israelites from Egypt, their year commenced at the
                    autumnal equinox; but in order to solemnize the memory of their deliverance, the
                    month of <hi rend="italic">Nisan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Abib,</hi> in which
                    that event took place, and which falls about the time of the vernal equinox, was
                    afterwards regarded as the beginning of the ecclesiastical or legal year. In
                    civil affairs, and in the regulation of the jubilees and sabbatical years, the
                    Jews still adhere to the ancient year, which begins with the month Tisri, about
                    the time of the autumnal equinox.</p>
                <p>The ancient Jewish year was lunisolar, that is to say, the months were regulated
                    by the moon, and intercalations employed to preserve a correspondence between
                    the same months and the same seasons of the year. This correspondence was
                    implied in the ceremonials of their religion. The passover began at the middle
                    of the month Nisan; and, besides the paschal lamb, required the offering of a
                    sheaf of barley as the first fruits of the harvest. Pentecost, or the feast of
                    weeks, which was celebrated fifty days after the passover, required the offering
                    of two loaves as the first fruits of the wheat harvest; and the feast of
                    tabernacles, which was always celebrated on the 15th of the month Tisri, was at
                    the end of the harvest. Hence the passover could only be celebrated about the
                    season when the barley was ready to be cut, Pentecost after the wheat was ripe,
                    and the feast of tabernacles after the vintage and the ingathering of the
                    olives. These regulations rendered it necessary that the three great festivals
                    of the Jews should always occur at nearly the same seasons, and consequently,
                    that some sort of intercalation should be employed for the adjustment of solar
                    and lunar time. But the methods employed for this purpose seem to have been of
                    the rudest kind,—founded on no astronomical calculation, and regulated by no
                    fixed rule. The beginning or end of the month was determined only by sight. When
                    a new moon became visible, a new month began. Experience taught them that it was
                    needless to look out for a new moon before the 29th day of the month; if a new
                    moon then appeared, the next day was the first of the following month; if not,
                    they resumed their watch on the night following, and if the moon was not then
                    visible, they concluded that it must have been obscured by clouds, and the
                    following day was reckoned the first of the succeeding month. Twelve months
                    formed the ordinary year, but every two or three years an intercalary month was
                    added. The rule which they followed with regard to the intercalary month seems
                    to have been this. When the 15th of Nisan, which was the first day of unleavened
                    bread, and of the passover, would have occurred in the ordinary course before
                    the vernal equinox, an intercalary month was inserted before Nisan, in
                    consequence of which the passover, with the feasts depending on it, was thrown
                    back a whole month. The intercalary month was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ve-Adar,</hi> or second Adar, from its immediately following Adar, the last of
                    the twelve ordinary months.</p>
                <p>While the year continued to be regulated in this uncertain and arbitrarymanncr,
                    it is evident that uniformity could only be preserved by conventional
                    arrangements entered into from year to year. Accordingly the Jews, after their
                    dispersion, were constrained to have recourse to the astronomical rules and
                    cycles of the more enlightened heathen, in order that their religious festivals
                    might be observed on the same days in all the countries through which they were
                    scattered. For this purpose they adopted a cycle of eighty-four years, which is
                    mentioned by several of the ancient fathers of the church, and which the early
                    Christians borrowed from them for the regulation of Easter. This cycle seems to
                    be neither more nor less than the Calippic period of seventy-six years, with the
                    addition of a Greek octaeteris, in order to disguise its true source, and give
                    it an appearance of originality. In fact, the period of Calippus containing
                    27,759 days, and the octaeteris 2922 days (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Calendar),</hi> the sum, which is 30,681, is exactly the number of days in
                    eighty-four Julian years. But the addition was very far from being an
                    improvement on the work of Calippus; for instead of a difference of only five
                    hours and fifty-three minutes between the places of the sun and moon, which was
                    the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355557" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5557-0658"/>whole
                    error of the Calippic period, this difference, in the period of eighty-four
                    years, amounted to one day six hours and forty-one minutes. Buccherius places
                    the commencement of this cycle in the year 162 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>;
                    Prideaux in the year 291 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> According to the
                    account of Prideaux, the fifth cycle must have commenced in the year 46 of our
                    era; and it was in this year, according to St Prosperus, that the Christians
                    began to employ the Jewish cycle of eighty-four years, which they followed,
                    though not uniformly, for the regulation of Easter, till the time of the council
                    of Nice.</p>
                <p>Soon after the Nicene council, the Jews, in imitation of the Christians,
                    abandoned the cycle of eighty-four years, and adopted that of Meton, by which
                    their lunisolar year is regulated at the present day. This improvement was first
                    proposed by Rabbi Samuel, rector of the Jewish school of Sora in Mesopotamia,
                    and was finally accomplished in the year 360 of our era by Rabbi Hillel, who
                    introduced that form of the year which the Jews at present follow, and which,
                    they say, is to endure till the coming of the Messiah.</p>

                    because certain days of the week are regarded by the Jews as unlucky; on such
                    days it is not lawful to celebrate the feasts; and as the passover begins on the
                    same day of the week as that with which the year began, when the first day of
                    the year would fall, in the regular course, on one of the unlucky days, the
                    commencement of the year is postponed to the day following.</p>
                <p>Till the fifteenth century the Jews usually followed the era of the Seleucidae or
                    of Contracts. Since that time they generalljr employ a mundane era, and date
                    from the creation of the world, which, according to their computation, took
                    place 3760 years and about three months before the commencement of our era. No
                    rule can be given for determining with certainty the day on which any given
                    Jewish year begins, without entering into the minutiae of their irregular and
                    complicated calendar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Egyptian Year and Canicular Period.</hi></p>
                <p>The ancient year of the Egyptians appears to have been lunisolar, and to have
                    continued so till the reign of Hyperion or Osiris. From that time they employed
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> solar year, which consisted of365days, ortwelve months
                    of thirty days each, with five complementary days added at the end of the last
                    month. This was their religious year; and as its commencement anticipated that
                    of the true solar year by one day every four years, it was adhered to long after
                    they had discovered that the year consists of 3651- days, from superstitious
                    notions, in order that each of the seasons might in its turn be blessed by the
                    enjoyment of the sacred festivals.</p>
                <p>As the anticipation of a day every four years brought back the commencement of
                    the vague year to the same place in the seasons in the space of 1461 years, it
                    follows that 1461 Egyptian years are equal to 1460 Julian years. The period of
                    1461 Egyptian years is denominated in chronology the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sothic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Canicular</hi> period, because it commenced
                    with the heliacal rising of the dog-star, called in Egypt Sothis; that is to
                    say, it commenced at the time when that star begins to disengage itself from the
                    rays of the sun, and to be visible just before sunrise. In the latitude of Lower
                    Egypt the dog-star begins to rise hcliacally about the 20th of July.</p>
                <p>The vague year of the Egyptians began with the month of Thoth, or the 20th of
                    July, in the year of our era 136, which year, therefore, was the first of a
                    Sothic period. The same coincidence took place 1460 Julian years before that
                    time, that is to say, in the year 1325 before Christ. The cycle which began 1325
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> is regarded by chronologcrs as the second which
                    was used in Egypt. Hence, since 1335+ 1460=2785, the first must have commenced
                    in .the year 2785 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> according to the Julian
                    computation. In this first cycle we must place the principal events of Egyptian
                    history, such as the invasion of the shepherds, the establishment of the
                    Israelites in that kingdom, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The names of the Egyptian months are,</p>
                <p>1. Thoth. 7. Phamcnoth.</p>
                <p>2. Paophi. 8. Pharmuthi.</p>

                <p>6. Meshir. 12. Mesori.</p>
                <p>Each month contained thirty days, and the year, as already stated, was completed
                    by the addition of five supplementary or epagomenal days.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Constantinople.</hi></p>
                <p>This era, which is still used in the Greek church, and was* followed by the
                    Russians till the time of Peter the Great, dates from the creation of the world.
                    The incarnation falls in the year 5509, and corresponds, as in our era, with the
                    fourth year of the 194th Olympiad. The civil year commences with the 1st of
                    September; the ecclesiastical year sometimes with the 21 st of March, sometimes
                    with the 1st of April. It is not certain whether the year was considered at
                    Constantinople as beginning with September previous to the separation of the
                    Eastern and Western empires.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of our era there had elapsed 5508 years and four months of
                    the era of Constantinople. Hence the first eight months of the Christian year 1
                    coincide with the Constantinopolitan year 5509, while the last four months
                    belong to the year 5510. In order, therefore, to find the year of Christ
                    corresponding to any given year in the era of Constantinople, we have the
                    following rule: If the event took place between the 1st of January and the end
                    of August, subtract 5508 from the given year; but if it happened between the 1st
                    of September and the end of the year, subtract 5509.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Alexandria.</hi></p>
                <p>The chronological computation of Julius Africanus was adopted by the Christians
                    of Alexandria, who accordingly reckoned 5500 years from the creation of Adam to
                    the birth of Christ; but in reducing Alexandrian dates to the common era, it
                    must be observed that Julius Africanus placed the epoch of the Incarnation three
                    years earlier than it is placed in the usual reckoning, so that the initial day
                    of the Christian era fell in the year 5503 of the Alexandrian era. This
                    correspondence, however, continued only from the introduction of the era till
                    the accession of Diocletian, when an alteration was made by dropping ten years
                    in the Alexandrian account. Diocletian ascended the throne <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193355570" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5570-0659"/>of the Roman empire in the
                    year of Christ 284. According to the Alexandrian computation, this was the year
                    5787 of the world, and 287 of the incarnation; but on this occasion ten years
                    were omitted, and that year was thenceforth called the year 5777 of the world,
                    and 277 of the Incarnation. There are, consequently, two distinct eras of
                    Alexandria, the one being used before, and the other after the accession of
                    Diocletian. It is not very well known for what reason the alteration was made;
                    but it is conjectured that it was for the purpose of causing a new revolution of
                    the cycle of nineteen years (which was introduced into the ecclesiastical
                    computation about this time by Anatolius, bishop of Hierapolis) to commence with
                    the first year of the reign of Diocletian. In fact, 5777 being divided by 19,
                    leaves 1 for the year of the cycle. The Alexandrian era continued to be followed
                    by the Copts in the fifteenth century, and is said to be still used in
                    Abyssinia.</p>
                <p>Dates expressed according to this era are reduced to the common era by
                    subtracting 5502, till the Alexandrian year 5786 inclusive, and after that year
                    by subtracting 5492; but if the date belongs to one of the four last months of
                    the Christian year, we must subtract 5503 till the year 5786, and 5493 after
                    that year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mundane Era of Antioch.</hi></p>
                <p>The chronological reckoning of Julius Africanus formed also the basis of the era
                    of Antioch, which was adopted by the Christians of Syria, at the instance of
                    Panodorus, an Egyptian monk, who flourished about the beginning of the fourth
                    century. Panodorus struck off ten years from the account of Julius Africanus
                    with regard to the years of the world, and he placed the Incarnation three years
                    later, referring it to the fourth year of the 194th Olympiad, as in the common
                    era. Hence the era of Antioch differed from the original era of Alexandria by
                    ten years; but after the alteration of the latter at the accession of
                    Diocletian, the two eras coincided. In reckoning from the Incarnation, however,
                    there is a difference of seven years, that epoch being placed in the reformed
                    era of Alexandria, seven years later than in the mundane era of Antioch or in
                    the Christian era.</p>
                <p>As the Syrian year began in autumn, the year of Christ corresponding to any year
                    in the mundane era of Antioch is found by subtracting 5492 if the event falls
                    between January and September; from September to January subtract 5493.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Nabonassar.</hi></p>
                <p>This era is famous in astronomy, having been generally followed by Hipparchus and
                    Ptolemy. It had been in use for some centuries among the Chaldean astronomers;
                    for the ancient observations of eclipses, which were collected in Chaldea by
                    Callisthenes, the general of Alexander, and transmitted by him into Greece to
                    Aristotle, were for the greater part referred to the commencement of the reign
                    of Nabonassar, founder of the kingdom of the Babylonians. The epoch from which
                    it is reckoned is precisely determined by numerous celestial phenomena recorded
                    by Ptolemy, and corresponds to Wednesday at mid-day, the 26th of February of the
                    year 747 before Christ. The year consisted of ttvelve months of thirty days
                    each, with five complementary days added at the end. No intercalation was used;
                    and it is therefore in all respects the same as the ancient Egyptian year. From
                    this circumstance the initial day of the year falls one day earlier every four
                    years than the first of the Julian year; so that 1460 Julian years are equal to
                    1461 Babylonian years. On account of this difference in the length of the year,
                    the conversion of dates according to the era of Nabonassar, into years before
                    Christ, is attended with considerable trouble. The surest way is to follow a
                    comparative table. Frequently the year cannot be fixed with certainty, unless we
                    also know the month and the day.</p>
                <p>The Greeks of Alexandria formerly employed the era of Nabonassar, with a year of
                    365 days; but soon after the reformation of the calendar by Julius Caesar, they
                    adopted, like the other Roman provincials, the Julian intercalation. At this
                    time the first of Thoth had receded to the 29th of August. In the year 136 of
                    our era, the first of Thoth, in the ancient Egyptian year, corresponded with the
                    20th of July, between which and the 29th of August there are forty days. The
                    adoption of the Julian year must therefore have taken place about 160 years
                    before the year 136 of our era (the difference between the Egyptian and Julian
                    years being one day in four years), that is to say, about the year 25 <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of the Seleucidae, or Macedonian Era.</hi></p>
                <p>The era of the Seleucidae dates from the epoch of the first conquests of Seleucus
                    Nicator in Syria, 311 years before Christ, in the year of Rome 442, and twelve
                    years after the death of Alexander the Great. It was adopted not only in the
                    monarchy of the Selcucidae, but in general in all the Greek countries bordering
                    on the Levant; was followed by the Jews till the fifteenth century; and is said
                    to be used by some Arabians even at the present day. By the Jews it was called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Era of Contracts</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by the
                    writers of the books of Maccabees the <hi rend="italic">Era of Kings.</hi> But
                    notwithstanding its general prevalence in the East during a great number of
                    centuries, the authors by whom it was followed differ much with regard to their
                    manner of expressing dates, in consequence of the different epochs which they
                    adopt for the commencement of the year. Among the Syrian Greeks the year began
                    with the month El ul, which corresponds to our September. The Nestorians and
                    Jacobites at the present day suppose it to begin with the following month, or
                    October. The author of the first book of Maccabees makes the era commence with
                    the month Nisan, or April; and the author of the second book with the first
                    Tishrin, or October. Albategnius, a celebrated Arabian astronomer, dates from
                    the 1st of October. Some of the Arabian writers, as Alfragan, date from the 1st
                    of September. At Tyre the year was counted from the 19th of our October, at Gaza
                    from the 28th of the same month, and at Damascus from the vernal equinox. These
                    discrepancies with respect to the initial day of the year render it extremely
                    difficult to determine the exact correspondence of Macedonian dates with those
                    of other eras; and the difficulty is rendered still greater by the want of
                    uniformity in respect of the length of the year. Some authors who follow the
                    Macedonian era, use the Egyptian or vague year of 365 days; Albategnius adopts
                    the Julian year of 3651- days. For all these reasons, it frequently happens that
                    the date cannot be fixed, unless some other chronological characters are given
                    with it than merely the month and the year.</p>
                <p>According to the computation most generally followed, the year 312 of the era of
                    the Seleucidae began on the 1st of September in the Julian year preceding the
                    first of our era. Hence, to reduce a Macedonian date to the common era, subtract
                    311 years and four months.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Alexander.</hi></p>
                <p>Some of the Greek historians have assumed as a chronological epoch the death of
                    Alexander the Great, which took place in the year 325 before Christ. The year is
                    the same as in the preceding era. This cra has not been much followed; but it
                    requires to be noticed in order that it may not be confounded with the era of
                    the Scleucidae.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Tyre.</hi></p>
                <p>The era of Tyre is reckoned from the 19th of October, or the beginning of the
                    Macedonian month IIyperberetaeus, in the year 126 before Christ. In order,
                    therefore, to reduce it to the common era, subtract 125; and when the date is
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi>, subtract it from 126. Dates expressed according
                    to this era occur only on a few medals, and in the acts of certain councils.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caesarean Era of Antioch.</hi></p>
                <p>This cra was established to commemorate the victory obtained by Julius Caesar on
                    the plains of Pharsalia, on the 9th of August in the year 48 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> and the 706th of Rome. The Syrians computed it·
                    from their month Tishrin I.; but the Greeks threw it back to the month Gorpiaeus
                    of the preceding year. Hence there is a difference of eleven months between the
                    epochs assumed by the Syrians and Greeks. According to the computation of the
                    Greeks, the 49th year of the Caesarean era began in the autumn of the year
                    preceding our history; and, according to the Syrians, the 49th year began in the
                    autumn of the first year of the Incarnation. It is followed by Evagrius in his
                    Ecclesiastical History.</p>

                <p>The conquest of Spain by Augustus, which was completed in the thirty-ninth year
                    before Christ, gave rise to another cra, which began with the first day of the
                    following year, and was long followed in Spain and Portugal, and generally in
                    all the Roman provinces subdued by the Visigoths, both in Africa and the South
                    of France. Several of the councils of Carthage, and also that of Arles, are
                    dated according to this era. After the ninth century it became usual to join
                    with it the year of the Incarnation in public acts. It was followed in Catalonia
                    till the year 1180, in the kingdom of Arragon till 1350, in Valencia till 1358,
                    and in Castile till 1393. In Portugal it is said to have been in use so late as
                    the year 1415, or 1422, though it would seem, that after the establishment of
                    the Portuguese monarchy, no other era was used in the public acts of that
                    country than that of the Incarnation. As the cra of Spain commenced with the 1st
                    of January, and the months and days of the year are those of the Julian ca
                    lendar, any date is reduced to the common era by subtracting thirty-eight from
                    the number of the year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of</hi><hi rend="italic">Actium.</hi></p>
                <p>This era was established to commemorate the battle of Actium, which was fought on
                    the 3d of September, in the year 31 before Christ, and in the 15th of the Julian
                    era. By the Romans the era of Actium was considered as commencing on the Ist of
                    January of the 16th of the Julian era, and the 30th <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi> The Egyptians, who followed it till the time of Diocletian, dated its
                    commencement from the beginning of their month Thoth, or the 29th of August; and
                    the eastern Greeks from the 2d of September. By the latter it was also called
                    the era of Antioch, and continued to be used till the ninth century. It must not
                    be confounded with the Caesarean era of Antioch, which began seventeen years
                    earlier. Many of the medals struck by the city of Antioch in honour of Augustus
                    are dated according to this era. Besides the era of Actium, there was also an
                    Augustan era, which commenced four years later, or 27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.,</hi> the year in which Augustus prevailed on the senate and people of Rome
                    to decree him the title of Augustus, and confirm him in the supreme power of the
                    empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of Diocletian, or Era of Martyrs.</hi></p>
                <p>We have already remarked that the Alexandrians, at the accession of Diocletian to
                    the throne of the Roman empire, made an alteration in their mundane era, by
                    striking off ten years from their reckoning. The same event furnished them with
                    an opportunity of establishing a new era, which is still followed by the
                    Abyssinians and Copts. It commences with the 29th of August (the first day of
                    the Egyptian year) of the year 284 of our era, which was the first of the reign
                    of Diocletian. The denomination of <hi rend="italic">Era of Martyrs,</hi>
                    subsequently given to it in commemoration of the persecution raised by that
                    prince against the Christians, would seem to imply that its commencement ought
                    to be referred to the year 303 of our era; for it was in this year that
                    Diocletian issued his famous edict; but the practice of dating from the
                    accession of Diocletian has prevailed. In order to transfer a date from this era
                    to that of the Incarnation, it is necessary to recollect the form of the
                    Egyptian year. The ancient Egyptian year consisted of 365 days; but after the
                    introduction of the Julian calendar, the astronomers of Alexandria adopted an
                    intercalary year, and added six additional days instead of five to the end of
                    the last month of every fourth year. In consequence of this regulation the year
                    is exactly similar to the Julian year. The Egyptian intercalary year, however,
                    does not correspond to the Julian leap year, but is the year immediately
                    preceding; and the intercalation takes place at the end of the year, or on the
                    29th of August. Hence the first three years of the Egyptian intercalary period
                    commence on the 29th of our August, and the fourth commences on the 30th of that
                    month. Before the end of that year the Julian intercalation takes place, and the
                    beginning of the following Egyptian year is restored to the 29th of August.
                    Hence, to reduce a date according to this era to our own reckoning, it is
                    necessary, for common years, to add 283 years and 240 days; but if the date
                    belongs to the first three months of the year following the intercalation, or,
                    which is the same thing, if it falls between the 30th of August and the end of
                    the year of the third year of the Julian cycle, we must add 283 years and 241
                    days. We ought to remark, that the Ethiopians do not reckon the years from the
                    beginning of the era in a consecutive series, but employ a period of 532 years,
                    after the expiration of which they again commence with unity. This is the <hi

                    followed in the Roman empire for some ages before the adoption of the Christian
                    era. We are unacquainted with the circumstances and the exact time of its
                    origin, but it was certainly not in use before the time of Constantine; and
                    examples occur in the Theodosian code of its being employed in dating the years
                    under the reign of Constance, who died 361 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. c.</hi> Three

                    Indiction,</hi> so called because its establishment is attributed to
                    Constantine. This was also called the <hi rend="italic">Coesarean
                    Indiction.</hi> It commences on the 24th of September, and it is not
                    unfre-quently met with in the ancient chronicles of France and England.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">Roman</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pontifical
                    Indiction,</hi> which began on the 25th of December or 1st of January, according
                    as the Christian year was held to commence on the one or other of these days. It
                    is often employed in the papal bulls, especially after the time of Gregory VII.;
                    and traces of its use are found in some of the old French authors.</p>
                <p>The first year of the first cycle of Indiction is generally considered to
                    correspond with the year 313 of the Christian era. Some authors, however, regard
                    it as having commenced in 312, others in 314, and some also in 315. The number
                    of cycles, however, is scarcely ever referred to, but only the year in the
                    cycle. Reckoning backwards from 313, the first year of our era is found to be 4
                    in the cycle of Indiction. Hence to find the Indiction corresponding to any year
                    of the Christian era, add 3 to the date, divide the sum by 15, and the remainder
                    is the Indiction. If there is no remainder, the proposed year is the 15th or
                    last of the cycle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of the Armenians.</hi></p>
                <p>The epoch of the Armenian era is that of the council of Tiben, in which the
                    Armenians consummated their schism from the Greek church by condemning the acts
                    of the council of Chalcedon; and it corresponds to Tuesday the 9th of July of
                    the year 552 of the Incarnation. In their civil affairs the Armenians follow the
                    ancient vague year of the Egyptians; but their ecclesiastical year, which begins
                    on the llth of August, is regulated in the same manner as the Julian year, every
                    fourth year consisting of 366 days, so that Easter and the other festivals are
                    retained at the same place in the seasons as well as in the civil year. The
                    Armenians also make use of the mundane era of Constantinople, and sometimes
                    conjoin both methods of computation in the same documents. In their
                    correspondence and transactions with Europeans, they generally follow the era of
                    the Incarnation, and adopt the Julian year.</p>
                <p>To reduce the civil dates of the Armenians to the Christian era, we may proceed
                    as follows. Since the epoch is the 9th of July, there were 176 days from the
                    beginning of the Armenian era to the end of the year 552 of our era; and since
                    552 was a leap year, the year 553 began a Julian intercalary period. Multiply,
                    therefore, the number of Armenian years elapsed by 365; add the number of days
                    from the commencement of the current year to the given date; subtract 176 from
                    the sum, and the remainder will be the number of days from the 1st of January
                    553 to the given date. This number of days being reduced to Julian years, add
                    the result to 552, and the sum gives the day in the Julian year, or old
                    style.</p>
                <p>In the ecclesiastical reckoning the year begins on the llth of August. To reduce

                <p><hi rend="italic">Era of the Hegira.</hi></p>
                <p>The epoch of this era, which is universally used in all Mahommedan countries, is
                    Friday the 16th of July, A. <hi rend="smallcaps">d.</hi> 622—the day on which
                    Mahommed fled from Mecca to Medina. Some chronologers, however, and the Arabian
                    astronomers in general, refer its commencement to the preceding day; but though
                    the flight of Mahommed probably began on the evening of Thursday the 15th of
                    July, it is certain, from the comparison of modern dates, that the present
                    practice of the Mahommedans, in dating their civil transactions, is to count
                    from Friday the 16th of July 622. It may be remarked that the civil day of the
                    Mahommedans begins at sunset; the astronomers probably began the day at
                    noon.</p>
                <p>The Mahommedan year is strictly lunar, and the civil months are adjusted to the
                    course of the moon, by means of a cycle of 30 years, containing 19 common years
                    of 354 days, and 11 intercalary years of 355 days; whence the cycle contains
                    10,631 days, which amount to 29 Julian years and 39 days. Each year is divided
                    into 12 months, containing alternately 30 and 29 days, excepting that the last
                    month of the intercalary year contains also 30 days.</p>

                <p>Such are the chronological elements by means of which Mahommedan dates are
                    reduced to the Christian era. As the rules generally given for this purpose are
                    attended with ambiguity, and cannot be depended on to a day, unless corrected by
                    means of a subsidiary table, we will explain at length a method of proceeding by
                    which the correspondence between the two eras is established, without the
                    slightest risk of ambiguity or mistake. The subject is of some interest, in
                    consequence of the era of the Hegira being used over so large a portion of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>Having given a Mahommedan date to find the corresponding date in the Christian
                    era,</p>
                <p>1. Divide the number of years elapsed by 80; the quotient will be the number of
                    eyeles, and the remainder the number of years elapsed since the beginning of the
                    current cycle. Call the quotient A, and the remainder B; and let a? be the
                    number of intercalary years in B. Then the number of days that have elapsed from
                    the commencement of the Hegira to the beginning of the year in.which the date
                    occurs, is given by the formula,</p>
                <p>10631 A + 354 B + <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> for 10,631 is the number of days in the cycle or intercalary
                    period, and 354 is the number of days in the common lunar year. To the sum
                    obtained from this formula add the days since the beginning of the current year,
                    and the result is the number of days from the commencement of the cycle to the
                    given date.</p>
                <p>2. To the number of days from the commencement of the Hegira to the given date,
                    add the number of days between the commencement of our era and the Hegira, and
                    the sum is the number of days from the epoch of the Incarnation to the given
                    date. The number of days from the beginning of our era to the beginning of the
                    Hegira is 22,7016; for 621 × 365 = 226665</p>
                <p>in 621 years there are 155 leap years 155</p>
                <p>from 1st of January to 15th July 622, inclusive 196</p>
                <p>Sum 227016</p>
                <p>3. It now remains only to reduce the sum thus obtained to Julian years. For this

                    May. This, however, is in Old Style. Add eleven days for the change of style,
                    and we have the 10th of June.</p>

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> C. the Persian year resembled that of the ancient
                    Egyptians, consisting of 365 days without intercalation; but at that time the
                    Persian calendar was reformed by Gelal-Edin Malek Schah, sultan of Khorasan, and
                    a method of intercalation adopted, which, though less convenient, is
                    considerably more accurate than the Julian. The intercalary period is 33 years;
                    one day being added to the common year seven times successively at the end of
                    four years, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355622" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5622-0663"
                    />the eighth intercalation being deferred till the end of the fifth year (See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Calendar).</hi> This era was at one period universally
                    adopted in Persia, and it still continues to be followed by the Parsees of
                    India. The months consist of thirty days each, and each day is distinguished by
                    a different name. According to Alfragan, the names of the Persian months are as
                    follows:</p>
                <p>Afrudin-meh. Merded-meh. Adar-meh.</p>
                <p>Ardisascht-meh. Schaharir-meh. Di-meh.</p>
                <p>Cardi-meh. Mahar-meh. Behen-meh.</p>
                <p>Tir-meh. Aben-meh. Affirer-meh.</p>
                <p>The five additional days (in intercalary years six) are named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Musteraca.</hi></p>
                <p>As it does not appear that the above-mentioned rule of intercalation was ever
                    regularly followed, it is impossible to assign exactly the.days on which the
                    different years begin. In some provinces of India the Parsees begin the year
                    with September, in others they begin it with October. We have stated that the
                    era began with the 16th June 632. But the vague year, which was followed till
                    1075, anticipated the Julian year by one day every four years. In 443 years the
                    anticipation would amount to about 112 days, and the beginning of the year
                    would, in consequence, be thrown back to near the beginning of the Julian year
                    632. To the year of the Persian era, therefore, add 631, and the sum will be the
                    year of our era in which the Persian year begins.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chinese Chronology.</hi></p>
                <p>From the time of the emperor Yao, upwards of 2000 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.,</hi> the Chinese had two different years; a civil year, which was regulated
                    by the moon, and an astronomical year, which was solar. The civil year consisted
                    in general of twelve months or lunations, but occasionally a thirteenth was
                    added, in order to preserve its correspondence with the solar year. Even at this
                    early period the solar or astronomical year consisted of 365⅜ days, like our
                    Julian year; and it was arranged in the same manner, a day being intercalated
                    every fourth year.</p>
                <p>According to the missionary Gaubil, the Chinese divided the day into 100 <hi
                    rend="italic">he,</hi> each <hi rend="italic">he</hi> into 100 minutes, and each
                    minute into 100 seconds. This practice continued to prevail till the 17th
                    century, when, at the instance of the Jesuit Schaall, president of the tribunal
                    of mathematics, they adopted the European method of dividing the day into
                    twenty-four hours, each hour into sixty minutes, and each minute into sixty
                    seconds. The civil day commences at midnight, and ends at the midnight
                    following.</p>
                <p>Since the accession of the emperors of the Iīan dynasty, 205 B. c., the civil
                    year of the Chinese has begun with the first day of that moon in the course of
                    which the sun enters into the sign of the zodiac which corresponds with our sign
                    Pisces. From the same period also, they have employed, in the adjustment of
                    their solar and lunar years, a period of nineteen years, twelve of which are
                    common, containing twelve lunations each, and the remaining seven intercalary,
                    containing thirteen lunations. It is, however, not precisely known how they
                    distributed their months of thirty and twenty-nine days, or, as they termed
                    them, <hi rend="italic">great</hi> and <hi rend="italic">small</hi> moons. This,
                    with other matters appertaining to the calendar, was probably left to be
                    regulated from time to time by the mathematical tribunal.</p>
                <p>The Chinese divide the time of a complete revolution of the sun, with regard to
                    the solstitial points, into twelve equal portions, each corresponding to thirty
                    days, ten hours, thirty minutes. Each of these periods, which is denominated a
                    <hi rend="italic">tze,</hi> is subdivided into two equal portions, called <hi
                    rend="italic">tehοηg-hi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tsie-hi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">tchong-ki</hi> denoting the first half of the tee,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">tsie-hi</hi> the latter half. Though the tee are thus
                    strictly portions of solar time, yet, what is remarkable, though not peculiar to
                    China, they give their name to the lunar months, each month or lunation having
                    the name of the <hi rend="italic">tchong∙hi</hi> or sign at which the sun
                    arrives during that month. As the tee is longer than a synodic revolution of the
                    moon, the sun cannot arrive twice at a <hi rend="italic">tchong-hi</hi> during
                    the same lunation; and as there arc only twelve tee, the year can contain only
                    twelve months having different names. It must happen sometimes that in the
                    course of a lunation the sun enters into no new sign; in this case the month is
                    intercalary, and called by the same name as the preceding month.</p>
                <p>For chronological purposes, the Chinese, in common with some other nations of the
                    east of Asia, employ cycles of sixty, by means of which they reckon their days,
                    moons, and years. The days are distributed in the calendar into cycles of sixty,
                    in the same manner as ours are distributed into weeks, or cycles of seven. Each
                    day of the cycle has a particular name; and as it is a usual practice, in
                    mentioning dates, to give the name of the day along with that of the moon and
                    the year, this arrangement affords great facilities in verifying the epochs of
                    Chinese chronology. The order of the days in the cycle is never interrupted by
                    any intercalations that may be necessary for adjusting the months or years. The
                    moons of the civil year are also distinguished by their place in the cycle of
                    sixty; and as the intercalary moons are not reckoned, for the reason before
                    stated, namely, that during one of these lunations the sun enters into no new
                    sign, there are only twelve regular moons in a year, so that the cycle is
                    renewed every five years. Thus the first moon of the year 1833 being the first
                    of a new cycle, the first moon of every sixth year, reckoned backwards or
                    forwards from that date, as 1828, 1823, &amp;c., or 1837, 1842, &amp;c., will
                    also commence a new lunar cycle of sixty moons. In regard to the years, the
                    arrangement is exactly the same. Each has a distinct number or name which marks
                    its place in the cycle, and as this is generally given in referring to dates,
                    along with the other chronological characters of the year, the ambiguity which
                    arises from following a fluctuating or uncertain epoch is entirely obviated. The
                    present cycle hegan in the year 1804 of our era; the year 1832 is consequently
                    the 29th of the current cycle.</p>
                <p>The cycle of sixty is formed of two subordinate cycles or series of characters,
                    one of ten and the other of twelve, which are joined together so as to afford
                    sixty different combinations. The names of the characters in the cycle of ten,
                    which are called <hi rend="italic">celestial signs,</hi> are,</p>
                <p>1. Kea; 2. Yich; 3. Ping; 4. Ting; 5. Woo;</p>
                <p>6. Ke; 7. Kang; 8. Sin; 9. Jin; 10. Kwey.</p>
                <p>And in the series of 12, denominated <hi rend="italic">terrestrial</hi>
                    signs,</p>
                <p>1. Tse; 2. Tchow; 3. Yin; 4. Maou; 5. Shin; 6. Sze;</p>
                <p>7. Woo; 8. We; 9. Shin; 10. Yew; 11. Seo; 12. Hae.</p>
                <p>The name of the first year, or of the first day, in the sexagenary cycle, is
                    formed by combining the first words in each of the above series; the second is
                    formed by combining the second of each series, and so on to the tenth. For the
                    next year the first word of the first series is combined with the eleventh of
                    the second; then the second of the first series with the twelfth of the second;
                    after this the third of the first series with the first of the second, and so on
                    till the sixtieth combination, when the last of the first series concurs with
                    the last of the second. Thus Kca-tse is the name of the first year, Yih-tchow
                    that of the second, Kea-seo that of the eleventh, Yih-hae that of the twelfth,
                    Ping-tse that of the thirteenth, and so on. The order of proceeding is
                    obvious.</p>
                <p>In the Chinese history translated into the Tartar dialect by the orders of the
                    emperor Kang-hi, who died in 1722, the characters of the cycle begin to appear
                    at the year 2357 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> From this it has been inferred,
                    that the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355635" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5635-0664"
                    />Chinese empire was established previous to that epoch; but it is obviously so
                    easy to extend the cycles backwards indefinitely, that the inference can have
                    very little weight. The characters given to that year 2357 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b. c.</hi> are Kea-shin, which denote the 41st of the cycle. We must,
                    therefore, suppose the cycle to have begun 2397 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi>
                    or forty years before the reign of Yao. This is the epoch assumed by the authors
                    of <hi rend="italic">L’Art de Verifier les Pates.</hi> The mathematical tribunal
                    has, however, from time immemorial, counted the first year of the first cycle
                    from the eighty-first of Yao, that is to say, from the year 2277 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi></p>
                <p>Since the year 163 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> the Chinese writers have
                    generally dated the year from the accession of the reigning emperor. An emperor,
                    on his accession to the throne, gives a name to the years of his reign. He
                    ordains, for example, that they shall be called Ta-te. In consequence of this
                    edict, the following year is called the first of Ta-te, and the succeeding years
                    the second, third, fourth, &amp;c. of Ta-te, and so on, till it pleases the same
                    emperor, or his successor, to ordain that the years shall be called by some
                    other appellation. The periods thus formed are called by the Chinese Nien∙hao.
                    According to this method of dating the years, a new era commences with every
                    reign; and the year corresponding to a Chinese date can only be found when we
                    have before us a catalogue of the Nien-hao, with their relation to the years of
                    our era.</p>
                <p>The Chinese chronology is discussed with ample detail by Freret, in the <hi

                <p>The method of dividing and reckoning time followed by the various nations of
                    India resembles in its general features that of the Chinese, but is rendered
                    still more complex by the intermixture of Mahommedan with Hindu customs. Like
                    the'Chinese, the Hindus have a solar year, which is generally followed in the
                    transaction of public business, especially since the introduction of European
                    power; and they have also a lunar year, which regulates their religious
                    festivals, and which they follow in their domestic arrangements. Their solar
                    year, or rather sidereal year, is measured by the time in which the sun returns
                    to the same star, and is consequently longer than our astronomical year, by the
                    whole quantity of the precession of the equinoxes. It is reckoned by the Hindus
                    at 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, 30 seconds, and consequently exceeds a
                    Gregorian year by one day in sixty years. The Indian zodiac is divided into
                    twelve solar and twenty-eight lunar signs; and the year begins with the sun’s
                    arrival at the first degree of the first sign. The month is the time the sun
                    takes to pass through one sign; and as each sign contains the same number of
                    degrees, the months vary somewhat in length, according as the sun is nearer the
                    apogee or perigee. The longest month may contain 31 days, 14 hours, 39 minutes,
                    and the shortest only 29 days, 8 hours, 21 minutes. The civil months, however,
                    depend solely on the moon; though, with the same perversion of ingenuity which
                    we have already remarked with regard to the Chinese, and of which it would be
                    difficult to find an example, except in the east of Asia, they derive their
                    names from the solar signs of the zodiac. The first civil month commences with
                    the day after the full moon of that lunation in the course of which the sun
                    enters the first Hindu sign, and so on with the others. When the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> χ</hi> sun enters into no new sign during the course of a
                    lunation, the month is intercalary, and is called by the name of that which
                    precedes or follows it, which some prefix, to distinguish it from the regular
                    month. In some provinces of India, as in Bengal, the civil month commences with
                    the day after the new moon; but in the upper or northern provinces, it begins,
                    as we have stated, with the day after the full moon. From the manner in which
                    they are reckoned, it is evident that the Hindu months, both solar and lunar,
                    neither consist of an entire number of days, nor are regulated by any cycle, but
                    depend solely on the motion of the sun and moon. The time of their commencement
                    is different on every different meridian; and a Hindu has no means of knowing
                    beforehand on what day any month begins, excepting by consulting his almanack.
                    The civil day in all parts of India begins at sunrise.</p>
                <p>The Hindu eras have been the subject of much controversy. According to the dreams
                    of Indian mythology, the duration of the world is limited to four <hi
                    rend="italic">yugs</hi> or ages, three of which have already passed, and the
                    fourth, which is the <hi rend="italic">hali-yug,</hi> is the last and most
                    deteriorated. It is this only which has any reference to authentic chronology.
                    It forms the principal era of India, and comprehends several others in common
                    use, as the era of Vicramaditya, of Salivahana, the Bengalee era, and the cycle
                    of sixty years.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Kali-yug</hi> commenced in the year 3101 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> The year is sidereal, and begins when the sun enters
                    the first sign of the Hindu zodiac, which at present happens about the 11th of
                    April. Owing to the precession of the equinoxes, the beginning of the year
                    advances in the seasons at the rate of about one day in sixty years.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Era of Vieramaditya</hi> is reckoned from the year 56 B.
                    c., which corresponds to 3045 of the Kali-yug. This era, the years of which are
                    called <hi rend="italic">Samvat,</hi> prevails chiefly in the higher or northern
                    provinces of India, and in Guzerat. Its name is derived from that of a sovereign
                    of Malwa, who, by defeating Soka, king of Delhi, acquired possession of the
                    principal throne of India. Whether the year from which it is reckoned was that
                    of the accession or death of this prince, is uncertain. The years are reckoned
                    in the same manner as those of the Kali-yug; and it may be remarked of the
                    Indian eras in general, that though some of them profess to be counted from the
                    deaths of their kings, or other historical events, they all commence at the time
                    the sun reaches the same point in his annual course through the zodiac.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Era of Salivahana</hi> is the year 78 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a. c.,</hi> which corresponds to 3179 of the Kali-yug, and 134 of the
                    Vicramaditya. The name is derived from Salivahan, who is said to have reigned
                    many years over the kingdom of Nor-singa, and to have been a liberal encourager
                    of the arts and sciences. It is generally used in records or writings of
                    importance, but is most prevalent in the southern provinces of Hindustan. The
                    years are called <hi rend="italic">Saka.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Fuslee Era,</hi> from the near coincidence of its dates
                    with those of the Hegira, seems to have been imposed on the natives of India by
                    their Mahommedan conquerors. It is principally used in revenue transactions, and
                    is pretty generally known over India. There are several eras of this name: but
                    the most common is that which is reckoned from the year 590 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a. c.</hi> At Madras, the commencement of the Fuslee year is fixed on the 12th
                    of July. In Bengal it begins in September, or with the full moon preceding the
                    autumnal equinox.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bengalee Era</hi> is also supposed to be derived from the
                    Hegira; but the year is measured by solar time, and therefore differs entirely
                    from the Mahommedan year, which is purely lunar. At the present time, the
                    Bengalee epoch is about nine years· later than the Hegira; the year 1245 of the
                    Hegira having commenced in July 1829, and the Bengalee year 1236 in April 1829.
                    The sidereal year exceeds the lunar year by 10days 211 hours nearly;
                    consequently, by reckoning backwards, it will be found <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193355648" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5648-0665"/>that the dates of the
                    Bengalee era and of the Hegira coincided about the middle of the sixteenth
                    century. History is silent on the subject; but it seems probable, that though
                    the epoch of the Hegira was partially adopted in India, the Hindus
                    pertinaciously resisted all attempts to disturb their ancient methods of
                    reckoning the subdivisions of the year.</p>
                <p>Besides the Indian eras here enumerated, there are some others which are less
                    generally known, or which are followed only in particular provinces. The cycle
                    of sixty years is also sometimes used, particularly in connection with the era
                    of Vicramaditya. According to the Bengal account, the first cycle began 3185
                    years <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.; and the year 1832 of our era is
                    consequently the thirty-seventh of the eighty-fourth cycle. In the Telinga
                    account the first cycle began 3114 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.; and the year
                    1832 is the twenty-fourth of the eighty-third cycle.</p>
                <p>We will conclude this part of the article with the following table, showing the
                    dates at which the different eras above described respectively commenced.</p>

                <p>The utility of chronological and synchronistic tables in the illustration of
                    history has been long perceived. Of the more ancient writers who devoted their
                    labours to this object, the principal are, Diodorus Siculus, Julius Africanus,
                    Eusebius of Caesarea, and George Syncellus, to whom we are indebted for the
                    preservation of some curious fragments of Berosus, Sanconiathon, and Manetho.

                <p>The subjoined table of political events has been compiled with great care for the

                    will be found to contain a useful summary of the principal events of ancient and
                    modern history. In the early period, the dates are taken from Usher and Blair,
                    as being those followed by the majority of chronologers. (s.)</p>
