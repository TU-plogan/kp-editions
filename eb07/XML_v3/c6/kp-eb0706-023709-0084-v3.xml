                    burial of the dead.</p>
                <p>Some derive the word <hi rend="italic">catacomb</hi> from the place where ships
                    are laid up, which the modern Latins and Greeks called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cumbae.</hi> Others say that <hi rend="italic">cata</hi> was used for <hi
                    rend="italic">ad,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">catacumbas</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">adtumbas</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and accordingly Dadin
                    maintains<pb break="no" facs="nls:193350097" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0097-0238"/> that
                    they anciently wrote <hi rend="italic">catatumbas.</hi> Others, again, derive
                    the word from the Greek καrα, and ryµĉo¢, a hollow, cavity, or the like.</p>
                <p>Anciently the word <hi rend="italic">catacomb</hi> was only understood of the
                    tombs of St Peter and St Paul; and Μ. Chastelain observes, that, among the more
                    intelligent of the people of Rome, the word <hi rend="italic">catacomb</hi> is
                    never applied to the subterranean burying-places hereinafter mentioned, but only
                    to a chapel in St Sebastian, one of the seven stational churches, where, the
                    ancient Roman calendars say, the body of St Peter was deposited, under the
                    consulate of Tuscus and Bassus, in 258.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Catacombs</hi> of Italy, a vast assemblage of subterranean
                    sepulchres near Rome, chiefly about three miles from that city, in the Via
                    Appia; supposed to be the sepulchres of the martyrs, and which are accordingly
                    visited by devotees, and relics thence taken and dispersed throughout the
                    Catholic countries, after having been first baptized by the pope under the name
                    of some saint. These <hi rend="italic">catacombs</hi> are said by many to be
                    caves or cells in which the primitive Christians held their interdicted
                    assemblies, and where they interred such of their number as were martyred. Each
                    <hi rend="italic">catacomb</hi> is three feet broad and eight or ten feet high,
                    running in form of an alley or gallery, and communicating with others. In many
                    places they extend within a league of Rome. There is no masonry or vaulting in
                    them, but each supports itself; and the two sides, which we may look on as the
                    <hi rend="italic">parietes</hi> or walls, were the places where the dead were
                    deposited lengthwise, three or four rows, one above another, in the same <hi
                    rend="italic">catacomb,</hi> parallel to the alley. They were commonly closed
                    with large thick tiles, and sometimes pieces of marble cemented in a manner
                    which the moderns have failed to imitate. Sometimes, though very rarely, the
                    name of the deceased is found on the tile; frequently a palm is seen, painted or
                    engraven, or the cipher Xp, which is commonly read <hi rend="italic">pro
                    Christo.</hi> The opinion entertained by many Protestant authors is, that the
                    <hi rend="italic">catacombs</hi> are heathen sepulchres, being the same with the
                    <hi rend="italic">puticuli</hi> mentioned by Festus Pompeius; that although it
                    was the practice of the ancient Romans to burn their dead, they, in order to
                    avoid expense, threw the bodies of their slaves to rot in holes of the ground;
                    that the Roman Christians, observing at length the great veneration paid to
                    relics, resolved to have a stock of their own; and that, entering the <hi
                    rend="italic">catacombs,</hi> they added what ciphers and inscriptions they
                    pleased, and then shut them up again, to be opened on a favourable occasion;
                    while those in the secret dying or removing, the contrivance was forgotten, till
                    chance opened them at last. But this opinion has even less of probability than
                    the former. Mr Monro, in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi>
                    supposes the <hi rend="italic">catacombs</hi> to have been originally the common
                    sepulchres of the early Romans, and excavated in consequence of the belief that
                    shades hate the light, and that they love to hover about the places where the
                    bodies are laid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Catacombs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">of Egypt</hi> are still extant, and have been described by various
                    travellers, particularly by Belzoni. The bodies found in them are called
                    mummies. The chambers containing these extend a great way under ground. In some
                    of the chambers the walls are adorned with figures and hieroglyphics; in others
                    the mummies are found in tombs ranged around the apartment, and hollowed out in
                    the rock.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians seem to have excelled in the art of embalming and preserving their
                    dead bodies, as the mummies found in the catacombs of Egypt are in a better
                    state than the bodies found either in the Italian catacombs or in those of any
                    other part of the world.</p>
                <p>Depositing the bodies of the dead in caves is certainly the original way of
                    disposing of corpses, and appears to have been introduced by the Phoenicians in
                    the countries to which they sent colonies; interment, as now practised in the
                    open air or in temples, was first introduced by the Christians. When an ancient
                    hero died, or was Killed in a foreign expedition, as his body was liable to
                    conuption, and for that reason unfit to be transported entire, they fell on the
                    expedient of burning, in order to bring borne the ashes, and oblige the <hi
                    rend="italic">manes</hi> to follow; that so his country might not be destitute
                    of the benefit of his tutelage. It was thus that cremation seems to have had its
                    origin; and by degrees it became common to all who could afford the expenses of
                    it, and displaced the ancient method of interment. Thus <hi rend="italic"
                    >catacombs</hi> became disused among the Romans after they had borrowed the
                    manner of burning from the Greeks, and then none but slaves were laid in the
                    ground.</p>
