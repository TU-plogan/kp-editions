                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> V., emperor of Germany and king of Spain, was
                    son of Philip, archduke of Austria, and of Jane, queen of Castile. He was born
                    at Ghent on the 24th February 1500, and succeeded to the crown of Spain in 1517.
                    Two years afterwards he was chosen emperor at Frankfort, upon the death of
                    Maximilian his grandfather. He was a great warrior and politician; and his
                    ambition was not satisfied with the many kingdoms and provinces he possessed;
                    for he is supposed, with some reason, to have aspired at universal empire. He is
                    said to have fought sixty battles, in most of which he was victorious. He took
                    the kingofFrance, Francis I. prisoner, at the battle of Pavia, and afterwards
                    sold him his liberty on very hard terms; yet when the people of Ghent
                    subsequently revolted, he asked leave to pass through the dominions of Francis;
                    and though the generous king thus had his enemy in his power, and an opportunity
                    offered him of revenging the ill treatment he had experienced, yet he received
                    and attended Charles with the utmost pomp and magnificence. This emperor sacked
                    Rome, and took the pope prisoner; and the cruelties which his army exercised
                    there are said to have exceeded those committed by the northern barbarians. Yet
                    the pious emperor went into mourning on account of this conquest; forbade the
                    ringing of bells; commanded processions to be made, and prayers to be offered up
                    for the deliverance of the pope his prisoner; and did not inflict the slightest
                    punishment on those who had treated the holy father and the holy see with such
                    inhumanity. He is accused by some Catholic writers of favouring the Lutheran
                    principles, which he might easily have extirpated. But the truth is, he found
                    his account in the divisions which that sect occasioned; and he never failed to
                    take advantage of them, sometimes against the pope, sometimes against France,
                    and at other times against the empire itself. He was a great traveller, and made
                    fifty different journeys into Germany, Spain, Italy, Flanders, France, England,
                    and Africa. Though he had been successful in many unjust enterprises, yet his
                    last attempt on Metz, which he besieged with an army of 100,000 men, and which
                    deserved to have succeeded, proved a total failure.</p>
                <p>Vexed at the reverse of fortune which seemed to attend his latter days, and
                    oppressed by sickness, which unfitted him any longer for holding the reins of
                    government with steadiness, or guiding them with address, he resigned his
                    dominions to his brother Ferdinand and his son Philip, and retreated to the
                    monastery of St Justus, near Placentia, in Estremadura.</p>
                <p>About six months before his death, the gout, to which he had long been subject,
                    after a longer intermission than usual, returned with a proportional increase of
                    violence. His shattered constitution had nðt strength enough remaining to
                    withstand such a shock. It enfeebled his mind as well as his body; and from this
                    period we hardly discern any traces of that sound and masculine understanding
                    which distinguished Charles among his contemporaries. An illiberal and timid
                    superstition depressed his spirit. He had no relish for amusements of any kind;
                    and endeavoured to conform, in his manner of living, to all the rigour of
                    monastic austerity. He desired no other society than that of monks, and was
                    almost continually employed in chanting with them the hymns of the missal. As an
                    expiation for his sins, he gave himself the discipline in secret, with such
                    severity, that the whip of cords which he employed as the instrument of his
                    punishment was found, after his decease, tinged with his blood. Nor was he
                    satisfied with these acts of mortification, which, however severe, were not
                    unexampled. The timorous and distrustful solicitude which always accompanies
                    superstition still continued to disquiet him, and, depreciating all that he had
                    done, prompted him to aim at something extraordinary, some new and singular act
                    of piety which would display his zeal, and merit the favour of heaven. The act
                    on which he fixed was as wild and uncommon as any that superstition ever
                    suggested to a disordered fancy. He resolved to celebrate his own obsequies
                    before his death. He ordered his tomb to be erected in the chapel of the
                    monastery. His domestics marched thither in funeral procession, with black
                    tapers in their hands; and he himself followed in his shroud. He was laid in his
                    coffin with much solemnity. The service for the dead was chanted; and Charles
                    joined in the prayers which were offered up for the rest of his soul, mingling
                    his tears with those which his attendants shed, as if they had been celebrating
                    a real funeral. The ceremony closed with sprinkling holy water on the coffin in
                    the usual form, and, all the assistants retiring, the doors of the chapel were
                    shut. Then Charles rose out of the coffin, and withdrew to his apartment, full
                    of those awful sentiments which such a singular solemnity was calculated to
                    inspire. But either the fatiguing length of the ceremony, or the impression
                    which this image of death left on his mind, affected him so much that next day
                    he was seized with a fever. His feeble frame could not long resist its violence;
                    and he expired on the 2lst of September, after a life of fifty-eight years, six
                    months, and twenty-one days.</p>

                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi> XII. king of Sweden,
                    born in 1682, was killed at Frederickshall, in Norway, in 1718. His military
                    achievements, which astonished all Europe, and his character as a sovereign,
                    form parts of the history of Sweden, and will be detailed in the account of that
                    country. As to his person, he was tall and of a noble mien, had a fine open
                    forehead, large blue eyes, flaxen hair, fair complexion, a handsome nose, but
                    little beard, and an agreeable smile His manners were harsh and austere, not to
                    say savage; and with respect to religion, he was indifferent towards all, though
                    exteriorly a Lutheran, and a strong believer in predestination. A few anecdotes
                    will illustrate his character. No dangers, however great, made the least
                    impression upon him. When a horse or two were killed under him at the battle of
                    Narva in 1700, he leapt nimbly upon fresh ones, saying, “These people find me
                    exercise.” One day, when he was dictating letters to a secretary, a bomb fell
                    through the roof into the next room of the house where they were sitting. The
                    secretary, terrified lest the house should come down upon them, let his pen drop
                    out of his hand. “What is the matter ?” said the king calmly. The secretary
                    could only reply, “Ah, Sire, the bomb.” “The bomb !” said the king, “what has
                    the bomb to do with what I am dictating to you? Go on.”</p>
                <p>He preserved more humanity than is usually found among conquerors. Once, in the
                    middle of an action, finding a young Swedish officer wounded and unable to
                    march, he obliged the officer to take his horse, and continued to command his
                    infantry on foot. One day, near Leipsic, a peasant threw himself at his feet,
                    with a complaint against a grenadier, that he had robbed him of certain eatables
                    provided for himself and his family. “Is it true,” said Charles sternly, “that
                    you have robbed this man ?” The soldier replied, “Sir, I have not done near so
                    much to this man as your majesty has done to his master; for you have taken from
                    Augustus a kingdom, whereas I have only taken from this poor scoundrel a
                    dinner.” Charles made the peasant amends, and pardoned the soldier for his
                    firmness: “However, my friend,” said he to the grenadier, “you will do well to
                    recollect, that if I took a kingdom from Augustus, I did not take it for
                    myself.”</p>
