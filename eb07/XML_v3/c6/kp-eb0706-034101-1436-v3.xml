                        and the laws which regulate the combinations of the elementary particles of
                        matter. As an <hi rend="italic">art,</hi> it has made very considerable

                        other, and of determining their properties, have been investigated with
                        great success. But as a science, chemistry is still in its infancy; very
                        little being known of the laws which regulate the combinations and
                        separations of the simple substances.</p><p>Our object in the following article will be to give as clear and concise a
                        view as possible of the present state of chemistry in all its different
                        branches. We shall in the first place, however, lay before our readers a
                        sketch of the history of the science, constituting, as it does, one of the
                        most remarkable examples of the aberrations of the human intellect, and
                        exhibiting an example of much important information, resulting from a
                        pursuit at first both frivolous and absurd.</p><p>HISTORY.</p><p>The word <hi rend="italic">Chemistry</hi> (in Greek <hi rend="italic">γr</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">μιnT)</hi> first
                        occurs in Suidas, a Greek writer who is supposed to have lived in the
                        eleventh century, and to have written his lexico during the reign of Alexius
                        Comnenus. The term indeed is said to occur in various Greek manuscripts
                        deposited in the libraries of Rome, Venice, and Paris, and written between
                        the fifth and eleventh centuries; but as these manuscripts have never been
                        printed, nor their exact date determined, nothing positive can be stated on
                        the subject.</p><p>Chemistry, as understood by Suidas, was the <hi rend="italic">art of
                        preparing gold and silver.</hi> He assures us that this art was known before
                        the time of Diocletian. He even affirms that <hi rend="italic">the golden
                        fleece,</hi> in search of which Jason and the Argonauts went to Colchis, was
                        nothing else than a treatise on the art of making gold, written on skins.
                        The Argonautic expedition is commonly believed to have been made as early as
                        one thousand two hundred and twenty-five years before the beginning of the
                        Christian era, As early, therefore, in the opinion of Suidas, was <hi rend="italic">chemistry,</hi> or the art of making gold, studied and
                        known.</p><p>This opinion of the antiquity of chemistry was zealously supported by Olaus
                        Borrichius, and almost the whole body of alchymistical writers. The
                        generally received opinion among them was, that chemistry originated in
                        Egypt; and the honour of the invention has been unanimously conferred on
                        Hermes Trismegistus. He is by some supposed to be the same person with
                        Chanaan, the son of Ham, whose son Mizraim first occupied and peopled Egypt.
                        Plutarch informs us that Egypt was sometimes called <hi rend="italic">Chernia.</hi> This name is supposed to be derived from Chanaan. Hence it
                        was inferred that Chanaan was the inventor of <hi rend="italic">chemistry,</hi> to which he affixed his own name. Whether the Hermes of the
                        Greeks was Chanaan, -or his son Mizraim, it is impossible to decide; but to
                        Hermes is assigned the invention of <hi rend="italic">chemistry,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the art of making gold,</hi> by almost the unanimous consent
                        of the adepts.</p><p>According to Albertus Magnus, “Alexander the Great discovered the sepulchre
                        of Hermes in one of his journeys, full of all treasures, not metallic, but
                        golden, written on a table of <hi rend="italic">zatadi,</hi> which others
                        call <hi rend="italic">emerald”</hi> This passage occurs in a tract of
                        Albertus Magnus, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Secretis</hi><hi rend="italic">Chemins,</hi> which is considered as supposititious.
                        Nothing is said of the source whence the information contained in this
                        passage is drawn; but, from the quotations produced by Kriegsmann, it would
                        appear that the existence of this emerald table was alluded to by Avicenna
                        and other Arabian writers. According to them, a woman called Sarah took it
                        from the hands of the dead body of Hermes, some ages after the flood, in a
                        cave near Hebron. The inscription was written in the Phoenician language;
                        but two different Latin translations were published by Kriegsmann and Gerard
                        Dorneus. The following is a literal translation of this far-famed
                        inscription.</p><p>1. I speak not fictitious things, but what is true and most certain.</p><p>2. What is below is like that which is above, and what is above is similar to
                        that which is below—to accomplish the miracles of one thing.</p><p>3. And as all things were produced by the meditation of one Being, so all
                        things were produced from this one thing by adaptation.</p><p>4. Its father is <hi rend="italic">Sol,</hi> its mother <hi rend="italic">Luna,</hi> the wind carried it in its belly, the earth is its nurse.</p><p>5. It is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole world.</p><p>6. The power is perfect, if it be changed into earth.</p><p>7. Separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the gross, acting
                        prudently and with judgment.</p><p>8. Ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth to heaven, and then again
                        descend to the earth, and unite together the powers of things superior and
                        things inferior. Thus you will possess the glory of the whole world; and all
                        obscurity will fly far away from you.</p><p>9. This thing has more fortitude than fortitude itself; because it will
                        overcome every subtile thing, and penetrate every solid thing.</p><p>10. By it this world was formed.</p><p>11. Hence proceed wonderful things, which in this wise were established.</p><p>12. For this reason I am called Hermes Trismegistus, because I possess three
                        parts of the philosophy of the whole world.</p><p>13. What I had to say about the operation of Sol is completed.</p><p>Such is a literal translation of the celebrated inscription of Hcrmes
                        Trismegistus upon the emerald tablet. It is sufficiently obscure to put it
                        in the power of commentators to affix almost any explanation to it which
                        they choose. The two individuals who have devoted most time to elucidate
                        this tablet are Kriegsmann and Gerard Dorneus. They both agree that it
                        refers to the universal medium, which began to acquire celebrity soon after
                        the time of Basil Valentine.</p><p>This exposition, which appears as probable as any, betrays the time when the
                        inscription seems to have been really written. Had it been taken out of the
                        hand of the dead body of Hermes by Sarah (obviously intended for the wife of
                        Abraham), as is affirmed by Avicenna, it is not possible that Herodotus, and
                        all the writers of antiquity, both Pagan and Christian, should have entirely
                        overlooked it. And how could Avicenna have learned what was unknown to all
                        those who lived nearest the time when the discovery was supposed to have
                        been made? Had it been discovered in Egypt by Alexander the Great, would it
                        have been unknown to Aristotle, and to all the numerous tribe of writers
                        whom the Alexandrian school produced, not one of whom, however, makes the
                        least allusion to it. It bears all the marks of a forgery of the
                        fifteenth<pb break="no" facs="nls:193351449" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1449-0342"/> century; and even the tract ascribed to
                        Albertus Magnus, in which the tablet of Hermes is mentioned, and the
                        discovery related, is probably also a forgery, and doubtless a forgery of
                        the same individual who fabricated the tablet itself, in order to throw a
                        greater air of probability upon a story which he wished to palm upon the
                        world as true.</p><p>Chemistry, or the art of making gold, as it is defined by Suidas, must have
                        been unknown during the classic ages of Greece and Rome, otherwise it is
                        impossible to account for the total silence of all the Greek and Roman
                        writers. It is most probable that it originated among the Arabians when they
                        began to turn their attention to medicine, after the establishment of the
                        caliphs; or, if it had previously been cultivated by the Greeks, that it was
                        taken up by the Arabians, and reduced by them into regular form and
                        order.</p><p>The writings of Geber (if we admit them to be genuine) constitute the oldest
                        chemical tract in existence; and deserve to be particularly noticed, because
                        they make üs acquainted with the state of the science during the eighth
                        century. Geber, whose real name was Abou-Mussah-Dschafar-Al-Soli, was a
                        Sabean of Harran, in Mesopotamia, and lived during the eighth century. His
                        works were translated into Latin as early as the year 1529, and an English
                        translation by Richard Russel was published in the year 1678. They consist
                        of four tracts, distinguished by the following quaint and not very
                        intelligible titles: 1. Of the Investigation of Search of Perfection; 2. Of
                        the Sum of Perfection, or of the Perfect Magistery; 3. Of the Invention of
                        Verity or Perfection; 4. Of Furnaces, &amp;c., with a recapitulation of the
                        author’s experiments.</p><p>The object of Geber’s work is to teach the method of making the <hi rend="italic">Philosophers Stone,</hi> which he distinguishes usually by the
                        name of <hi rend="italic">Medicine of the Third Class.</hi> The whole is in
                        general written with so much plainness, that we can understand the nature of
                        the substances which he employed, the processes which he followed, and the
                        greater number of the products which he obtained. We shall give the
                        following summary of his opinions, and of the facts which he knew.</p><p>He considered all the metals as compounds of mercury and sulphur. It is
                        evident from what he says that this notion had been adopted by his
                        predecessors; men whom he speaks of under the title of the <hi rend="italic">ancients.</hi></p><p>The metals with which he was acquainted were gold, silver, copper, iron, tin,
                        and lead. These are usually distinguished by him under the names of <hi rend="italic">Sol, Luna, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Saturn.</hi> Gold and silver he considered as perfect metals; but the other
                        four were imperfect metals. The difference between them he considered as
                        depending partly upon the proportions of mercury and sulphur in each, and
                        partly upon the purity or impurity of the mercury and sulphur which enters
                        into the composition of each.</p><p>In his book on furnaces he gives a description of a furnace proper for
                        calcining metals; and, from the fourteenth chapter of the fourth part of the
                        first book of his Sum of Perfection, it is obvious that the method of
                        calcining or oxydizing iron, copper, tin, and lead, and also mercury and
                        arsenic, were familiarly known to him. He gives a description of a furnace
                        for distilling, and a pretty minute account of the glass or stone ware, or
                        metallic aludel and alembic, by means of which the process was conducted. He
                        was in the habit of distilling by surrounding his aludel with hot ashes, to
                        prevent it from being broken. He was acquainted also with the water bath.
                        The description of the distillation of many bodies occurs in his work; but
                        there is not the least evidence that he was acquainted with ardent spirits.
                        The term <hi rend="italic">spirit,</hi> indeed, frequently occurs in his
                        writings; but it was applied to volatile bodies in general, and in
                        particular to sulphur and white arsenic, which he considered as substances
                        very similar in their properties. Mercury also he considered as a spirit.
                        The method of distilling <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">descensum,</hi> as is practised in the smelting of zinc, was also known to
                        him. He describes an apparatus for the purpose,'and gives several examples
                        of such distillation in his writings.</p><p>He gives also a description of a furnace for smelting metals, and mentions
                        the vessels in which such processes were conducted. He was acquainted with
                        crucibles, and even describes the mode of making cupels nearly similar to
                        those used at present. The process of cupellating gold and silver, and
                        purifying them by means of lead, is given by him pretty minutely and
                        accurately. He called it <hi rend="italic">einc-ritium</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> at least that is the term employed by the Latin
                        translator.</p><p>He was in the habit of dissolving salts in water and acetic acid, and even
                        the metals in different menstrua. Of these menstrua he nowhere gives an
                        account; but from our knowledge of the properties of the different metals,
                        and from some processes which he notices, it is easy to perceive what his
                        solvents must have been; namely, the mineral acids, which were known to him,
                        and to which there is no allusion whatever in any preceding writer that we
                        have seen. Whether he was the discoverer of these acids cannot be known; he
                        nowhere claims the discovery. Indeed his object appears to have been to slur
                        over these acids as much as possible, that their remarkable properties might
                        not be suspected by the uninitiated. It was this affectation of secrecy and
                        mystery which has deprived the earliest chemists of that credit and
                        reputation to which they would have been justly entitled had their
                        discoveries been made known to the public in a plain and intelligible
                        manner.</p><p>The mode of purifying liquids by filtration, and of separating precipitates
                        from liquids by the same means, was known to him. He called the process <hi rend="italic">distillation through a filter.</hi></p><p>Thus the greater number of chemical processes, such as they were practised in
                        the eighteenth century, were known to Geber. When we compare his works with
                        those of Dioscorides and Pliny, we perceive the great progress which
                        pharmacy had made in the interval. This progress was probably due to the
                        Arabian physician. We shall now notice the different chemical substances or
                        preparations that were known to Geber.</p><p>He knew <hi rend="italic">common salt,</hi> and was acquainted with <hi rend="italic">potash</hi> and <hi rend="italic">soda,</hi> at least in the
                        state of carbonates. Potash was obtained by burning cream of tartar.
                        Carbonate of soda he calls <hi rend="italic">sagimen</hi><hi rend="italic">vitri</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and he points out how it may be made
                        caustic by means of quicklime. <hi rend="italic">Saltpetre</hi> was known to
                        him; and Geber is the first writer in whom we find an account of this salt.
                        <hi rend="italic">Sal ammoniac</hi> would appear to have been quite common
                        in his time, though there is no evidence that it was known during the
                        classical ages of the Greeks and Romans. The same remark applies to <hi rend="italic">alum,</hi> of which he mentions three kinds; icy alum or Rocca
                        alum, Jamenous alum or alum of Jameni, and feather alum. The first two of
                        these were named from the place where they were manufactured; the third kind
                        was probably a native variety. <hi rend="italic">Sulphate of iron,</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">copperas,</hi> in the state of crystals, was known to him,
                        and appears to have been manufactured in his time.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Eaurachox borax</hi> is mentioned by him, but without any
                        description by which we can know whether or not it was our borax. <hi rend="italic">Sulphuric acid</hi> was obtained by him by distilling alum by
                        a strong heat. In like manner <hi rend="italic">nitric acid</hi> was
                        obtained by him by putting into an alembic one pound of sulphate of iron of
                        Cyprus, half a pound of saltpetre, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351462" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1462-0343"/> and a
                        quarter of a pound of alum of Jameni, and distilling till every thing liquid
                        was driven over. To the ni <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> trie acid thus
                        procured he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">dissolving water.</hi> The
                        acid thus obtained he employed to dissolve silver, and he concentrated the
                        solution till the nitrate of silver was obtained in crystals. He was in the
                        habit also of dissolving sal ammoniac in nitric acid, and employing the
                        solution, which was the <hi rend="italic">aqua regia</hi> of the old
                        chemists, as a solvent for gold. There can be no doubt that he was
                        acquainted with <hi rend="italic">corrosive sublimate, cinnabar, red oxide
                        of mercury, sulphuret of copper, black oxide of copper, metallic
                        arsenic,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">red oxide of iron.</hi></p><p>Such is a short summary of the facts known to Geber, so far as they can be
                        deduced from his writings. He is the only Arabian writer whose chemical
                        works deserve to be noticed; for Avicenna, though his reputation was much
                        higher, and though he ruled for many ages with despotic sway over the
                        medical faculty in Europe, or at least divided the medical sceptre with
                        Galen, is not entitled to notice as a chemist. The Arabians, however, had
                        the merit of conveying a knowledge of pharmacy, and of chemistry as they
                        understood it, to the inhabitants of Europe. This communication took place
                        by the channel of Spain.</p><p>It is universally known that the kingdom of the Goths in Spain was overturned
                        by the Saracens, who made themselves masters of the fairest portion of that
                        peninsula, and retained it for a long period. The Mahommedan states in Spain
                        had arrived at such a degree of prosperity in commerce, manufactures,
                        population, and wealth, as is hardly to be credited. The three Abdalrahmans
                        and Alhakem carried, from the eighth to the tenth century, the country
                        subject to the caliph of Cordova to the highest degree of splendour. They
                        protected the sciences, and governed with so much mildness, that Spain was
                        probably never so happy under the dominion of any Christian prince. Alhakem
                        established at Cordova an academy, which for several ages was the most
                        celebrated in the whole world. All the Christians of Western Europe repaired
                        to this academy in search of information. It contained in the tenth century
                        a library of 280,000 volumes. The catalogue of this library filled no fewer
                        than forty-four volumes. Seville, Toledo, and Murcia, had likewise their
                        schools of science and their libraries, which retained their celebrity as
                        long as the dominion of the Moors lasted. In the twelfth century there were
                        seventy public libraries in that part of Spain which belonged to the
                        Mahommedans. Cordova had produced one hundred and fifty authors, Almeria
                        fifty-two, and Murcia sixty-two.</p><p>It was to these celebrated seats of learning that the curious flocked from
                        all parts of Europe. Here they acquired a knowledge of Arabic, and of all
                        the sciences prosecuted by the Maĥommedan sages. Among others, they studied
                        the pharmacy of the Arabians, which differed from that of the Greeks and
                        Romans by containing numerous chemical processes and chemical medicines.
                        Chemistry, or <hi rend="italic">Alchymy</hi> as the Arabians called it,
                        became gradually known to the curious in Europe. And when the human mind,
                        which had lain so long torpid in Europe, began to awaken towards the end of
                        the twelfth century, writers on it gradually made their appearance. At first
                        these were very few in number; but they multiplied by degrees, and in the
                        fourteenth century they became very numerous. It will be sufficient here if
                        we notice a few of the most remarkable of these votaries of alchymy; by
                        which was understood the art of artificially making silver and gold out of
                        the baser metals.</p><p>The first alchymist who deserves notice is Albert Groot, or Albertus Magnus
                        as he is usually styled, a German, who was born in the year 1193, at
                        Bollstaedt, and died in the year 1282. He studied the sciences at Padua, and
                        afterwards taught at Cologne, and finally at Paris. He travelled through all
                        Germany as provincial of the order of dominican monks; visited Rome, and was
                        made bishop of Ratisbon. But his passion for science induced him to give up
                        his bishopric, and return to a cloister at Cologne. Albertus was acquainted
                        with all the sciences cultivated in his time. He was at once a theologian, a
                        physician, and a man of the world. He was an astronomer and an alchymist,
                        and even dipt into magic and necromancy. He wrote seven or eight treatises
                        on various branches of chemistry, which still remain. There is no evidence
                        that his knowledge surpassed that of Geber. But it is clear from his book
                        <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophorum Lapide,</hi> that
                        he was a believer in the existence of the philosophers’ stone, and in the
                        possibility, by means of it, of transmuting the base metals into gold. In
                        that treatise he gives the process for making the philosophers’ stone; but
                        it is not intelligible. This is very remarkable, because every other part of
                        his writings on chemical subjects is quite plain. It seems to have been the
                        opinion of the adepts that it was unlawful to communicate the more recondite
                        processes of their art to mankind in general. This is the reason why all
                        that they have left us respecting the philosophers’ stone is written in such
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> manner that it is impossible to understand the
                        nature of the processes, or the kind of substance which they succeeded in
                        forming by these processes. It is this circumstance that renders the
                        writings of the alchymists in general of so little value. They were
                        laborious men, who subjected the various substances within their reach to a
                        great variety of processes, and who must therefore occasionally have
                        obtained results of importance. Had they related these processes with
                        plainness and simplicity, we should have known the extent of their
                        knowledge, and allowed them the credit due to their ingenuity and
                        discoveries. But as they thought proper to adopt a different plan, their
                        labours have been lost to posterity, and all their discoveries required to
                        be discovered again.</p><p>Soon after Albertus, lived Roger Bacon, by far the most illustrious, the best
                        informed, and the most philosophical of all the alchymists. He was born in
                        1214, in the county of Somerset. After studying at Oxford and in Paris, he
                        became a friar; and devoting himself to philosophical investigations, his
                        discoveries, notwithstanding the pains which he took to conceal them, made
                        such a noise that he was accused of magic, and his brethren in consequence
                        threw him into prison.</p><p>From an attentive perusal of his works, many of which have been printed, it
                        is clear that Bacon was a great linguist, being familiar with Latin, Greek,
                        Hebrew, and Arabic; and that he had perused the most important books at that
                        time existing in all these languages. He was also a grammarian; he was well
                        versed in the theory and practice of perspective; he understood the use of
                        convex and concave glasses, and the art of making them. The camera obscura,
                        burning glasses, and the powers of the telescope, were well known to him. He
                        knew the great error in the Julian calendar, assigned the cause, and
                        proposed the remedy. He understood chronology well; he was a skilful
                        physician and an able mathematician, logician, metaphysician, and
                        theologist. As a chemist, it is clear that he was acquainted with the mode
                        of making gunpowder, and with the violence and noise with which it burns.
                        But there is no evidence that he was aware of the usc to which it might be
                        applied in propelling bullets from a gun-barrel with fatal velocity. We have
                        evidence that gunpowder was known in China and India at a very remote
                        period. These nations knew how to make it, and were in the habit of using it
                        in fire-works; but they never seem to have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351475" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1475-0344"/> thought of
                        the more important application of it as a moving force to propel bullets.
                        This last was a European invention, though the individual to whom it was due
                        seems not to be known. As Bacon was acquainted ∖vith Arabic, it is probable
                        that he derived his knowledge of gunpowder from some eastern treatise.</p><p>Raymond Lully is said to have been a scholar and a friend of Bacon. He was a
                        most voluminous writer, and acquired as high a reputation as any of the
                        alchymists. According to Mutius, he was born in Majorca in the year 1235.
                        His father was seneschal to King James I. of Aragon. In his younger day she
                        went into the army, but afterwards held a situation in the court of his
                        sovereign. Devoting himself to the sciences, he soon acquired a competent
                        knowledge of Latin and Arabic. After studying in Paris, he got the degree of
                        doctor conferred on him. He entered into the order of Minorites, and induced
                        King James to establish a cloister of that order in Minorca. He afterwards
                        travelled through Italy, Germany, England, Portugal, Cyprus, Armenia, and
                        Palestine. He is said by Mutius to have died in 1315, and to have been
                        buried in Majorca. The following epitaph is given by Olaus Borrichius, as
                        engraven on his tomb:</p><p>Raymundus Lulli, cujus pia dogmata nulli Sunt odiosa viro, jacet hic in
                        marmore miro Hic Μ. et CC. Cum P. caepit sine sensibus esse.</p><p>MCCC in the last line denote 1300, and P, which is the fifteenth letter of
                        the alphabet, denotes fifteen; so that if this epitaph be genuine, it
                        follows that his death took place in the year 1315.</p><p>The writings of Raymond Lully are so obscure that the writer of this article
                        has repeatedly tried, but without success, to understand them. In addition
                        to the re-agents known to Geber, he was acquainted with spirit of wine,
                        which he denotes in his writings by the names of <hi rend="italic">aqua
                        vitae</hi><hi rend="italic">ardens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">argentum</hi><hi rend="italic">vivum vegetabile.</hi> He was acquainted also with <hi rend="italic">ammonia.</hi> How far this volatile alkali was known to any of
                        his predecessors we do not know. He was acquainted with cupellated silver,
                        and first obtained rosemary oil by distilling the plant with water. He
                        employed a mixture of flour and white of egg spread upon a linen cloth to
                        cement cracked glass vessels, and used other lutes for similar purposes.</p><p>Arnoldus de Villanova is said to have been born at Villeneuve, a village in
                        Provence, about the year 1240. Olaus Borrichius assures us that in his time
                        his posterity lived in the neighbourhood of Avignon, that he was acquainted
                        with them, and that they were by no means destitute of chemical knowledge.
                        He is said to have been educated at Barcelona, under John Casamila, a
                        celebrated professor of medicine. This place he was obliged to leave in
                        consequence of foretelling the death of Peter of Aragon. He went to Paris,
                        and likewise travelled through Italy. He afterwards taught publicly in the
                        university of Montpellier. His reputation as a physician became so great,
                        that his attendance was solicited in dangerous cases by several kings, and
                        even by the pope himself. He was skilled in all the sciences of his time,
                        and was besides a proficient in Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic. When at Paris he
                        studied astrology, and calculated that the end of the world would be in
                        Ĩ335. In consequence of this he was condemned as a heretic, and obliged to
                        leave France; but the pope protected him. He died in the year 1313, on his
                        way to visit Pope Clement V. who lay sick at Avignon. His works are
                        voluminous; but there is no evidence that he added any thing material to the
                        stock of chemical knowledge derived from his predecessors.</p><p>John Isaac Hollandus, and his countryman of the same name, were either two
                        brothers or a father and son, it is uncertain which. They were born in the
                        village of Stolk in Holland, it is supposed in the thirteenth century. They
                        wrote many treatises on chemistry, remarkable, considering the time when
                        they lived, for clearness and precision, describing their processes with
                        accuracy, and even giving figures of the instruments which they
                        employed.</p><p>Basil Valentine is said to have been born about the year 1394. He is perhaps
                        the most celebrated of all the alchymists, if we except Paracelsus. He was a
                        benedictine monk at Erford, in Saxony. Much of his time seems to have been
                        employed in the preparation of chemical medicines. It was he that first
                        introduced antimony into medicine; and it is said, though on no good
                        authority, that he first tried the effects of antimonial medicines upon the
                        monks of his convent, on whom it acted with such violence, that he was led
                        to distinguish the mineral from which these medicines had been extracted by
                        the name of <hi rend="italic">antimoine</hi> (hostile to monks). But Basil
                        Valentine was a German, and wrote and spoke in that language. Now the German
                        name for antimony is not <hi rend="italic">antimoine,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">spiess∙ glass.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was probably so named from a common shape of one of
                        the most abundant ores of antimony, for spiess in German signifies a
                        tpii∙</p></note></hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> The work on
                        antimony of this chemist was published originally in German; but there is an
                        excellent Latin translation, with a commentary, which was published at
                        Amsterdam in the year 1671.</p><p>The alchymists just named constitute those who acquired the highest
                        reputation, and were considered as possessed of the greatest quantity'· of
                        knowledge of all the adepts. Many other names might be added to the list
                        were it worth while to fill our pages with a long catalogue of names that
                        had better be consigned to oblivion. The opinion of the alchymists was, that
                        all the metals are compounds; that the baser metals contain the same
                        constituents as gold, contaminated indeed with various impurities, but
                        capable, when 'these impurities are removed or remedied, of assuming all the
                        properties and characters of gold. The substance possessing this wonderful
                        power they called <hi rend="italic">lapis</hi><hi rend="italic">philosophorum,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">philosophers stone</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and they usually describe it as a red powder, ‘having a
                        peculiar smell. Many of them assure us that they had seen it, and many of
                        them profess to give processes by which it could be made, though none of
                        these processes are intelligible. They nowhere (or at least very seldom)
                        affirm that they were in possession of this grand arcanum; but there can be
                        no doubt, from the processes which they give, that it was their intention to
                        induce their readers to believe that they were acquainted with it. Many
                        stories of the transmutation of the baser metals into gold are on record,
                        and attested by evidence that at first sight appears unimpeachable. The
                        following relation of this kind is given by Mangetus, on the authority of M.
                        Gros, a clergyman of Geneva, of the most unexceptionable character, and at
                        the same time a skilful physician and expert chemist.</p><p>About the year 1650 an unknown Italian came to Geneva, and took lodgings at
                        the sign of the <hi rend="italic">Green Cross.</hi> After remaining there a
                        day or two, he requested Deluc, the landlord, to procure him a person
                        acquainted with Italian to accompany’· him through the town, and point out
                        those things which deserved to be examined. 1)eluc requested Μ. Gros, at
                        that time a student in Geneva, and about twenty years of age, to accompany
                        the stranger. This he did during about a fortnight, at the end of which the
                        stranger began to complain of the want of money. This rather alarmed Μ.
                        Gros, as he was apprehensive that the stranger intended to ask the loan of
                        money <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351488" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1488-0345"/> from him. But instead of this the Italian
                        asked him if he was acquainted with any goldsmith whose bellows and other
                        utensils they might be permitted to use, and who would not refuse to supply
                        them with ,the different articles requisite for a particular process which
                        he wanted to perform. M. Gros named a Μ. Bureau, to whose house the ltalian
                        immediately repaired. He readily furnished crucibles, pure tin, quicksilver,
                        and the other things required by the Italian. The goldsmith left his
                        workshop that the Italian might be under less restraint, leaving M. Gros
                        with one of his own workmen as an assistant. The Italian put a quantity of
                        tin into one crucible and a quantity of quicksilver into another. The tin
                        was melted in the fire, and the mercury heated. It was then poured into the
                        melted tin, and at the same time a red powder inclosed in wax was projected
                        into the amalgam. An agitation took place, and a great deal of smoke was
                        exhaled from the crucible; but this speedily subsided, and the whole being
                        poured out, formed six heavy ingots having the colour of gold. The goldsmith
                        was called in by the Italian, and requested to make a rigid examination of
                        the smallest of these ingots. The goldsmith, not content with the touchstone
                        and the application of aquafortis, exposed the metal on the cupel with lead,
                        and fused it with antimony; but it sustained no loss. He found it possessed
                        of the ductility and specific gravity of gold; and, full of admiration, he
                        exclaimed that he had never worked before on gold so perfectly pure. The
                        Italian made him a present of the smallest ingot as a recompense; and then,
                        accompanied by M. Gros, he repaired to the mint, where he received from M.
                        Bacuet, the mint master, a quantity of Spanish gold coin, equal in weight to
                        the ingots which he had brought. To Μ. Gros he made a present of twenty
                        pieces, on account of the attention which he had paid him. And after paying
                        his bill at the inn, he added fifteen pieces more to serve to entertain M.
                        Gros and M. Bureau for some days; and, in the mean time, he ordered a
                        supper, that he might on his return have the pleasure of supping with these
                        two gentlemen. He went out, but never returned, leaving behind him the
                        greatest regret and admiration. It is needless to add, that M. Gros and Μ.
                        Bureau continued to enjoy themselves at the inn till the fifteen pieces
                        which the stranger had left were exhausted.</p><p>The preceding story, taken from the preface of Mangetus’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Chemica</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> is as well
                        authenticated as any alchymistical story whatever. The reader will observe
                        that it is stated, not on the authority of a person who was the actor, but
                        by a stranger, to whom a witness of the transmutation related it. Now this
                        evidence, though the best that can be got, is not sufficient to authenticate
                        so wonderful a story. .A little latent vanity might easily induce the
                        narrator to suppress or alter some particulars, which, if known, might have
                        stripped the narrative of every thing marvellous which it contains, and led
                        us into the secret of the origin of this gold which the Italian is said to
                        have transmuted from tin.</p><p>In consequence of the universality of the opinion that gold could be made by
                        art, there was a set of impostors who went about pretending that they were
                        in possession of the philosophers’ stone, and offering to communicate the
                        secret of making it for a suitable reward. Nothing is more astonishing than
                        that persons should be found credulous enough to be the dupes of such
                        impostors. The very circumstance of their claiming a reward was a sufficient
                        proof that they were ignorant of the secret which they pretended to reveal;
                        for what motive could a man have for asking a reward who was in possession
                        of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> method of making gold at pleasure. Yet strange
                        as it may appear, they met with abundance of dupes credulous enough to
                        believe their asseverations, and to supply them with money to enable them to
                        perform the wished-for processes. The object of these impostors was either
                        to pocket the money thus furnished, or they made use of it to purchase
                        various substances, from which they extracted oils, acids, or similar
                        products, which they were enabled to sell with profit. To keep the dupes who
                        supplied them with money in good spirits, it was necessary to show them
                        occasionally small quantities of the baser metals transmuted into gold. This
                        they performed in various ways.</p><p>Sometimes they made use of crucibles with a false bottom. At the real bottom
                        they put a quantity of gold or silver. This was covered with a portion of
                        powdered crucible glued together by gum or wax. The materials being put into
                        the crucible, and heat applied, the false bottom disappeared, and at the end
                        of the process the gold or silver was found at the bottom of the crucible.
                        Sometimes they made a hole in a piece of charcoal, and filled it with oxide
                        of gold or silver, and stopped up the hole with a little wax; or they soaked
                        the charcoal in solutions of these metals; or they stirred the mixture in
                        the crucible with hollow rods, containing oxide of gold or silver within,
                        and the bottom shut with wax. By these means the gold or silver wanted was
                        introduced during the operation, and considered as a product. Sometimes they
                        used solutions of silver in nitric acid, or of gold in aqua regia, or an
                        amalgam of gold or silver, which being adroitly introduced, furnished the
                        requisite quantity of metal. A common exhibition was to dip nails into a
                        liquid, and take them out half converted into gold. The nails were one half
                        gold, one half iron, neatly soldered together, and the gold covered with
                        something to conceal the colour, which the liquid was capable of removing.
                        Sometimes they had metallic rods one half gold and one half silver, and the
                        gold end whitened with mercury; the gold end was dipt into the transmuting
                        liquid, and then heated. The mercury was dissipated, and the gold
                        appeared.</p><p>The alchymists, notwithstanding the absurdity of their pursuits, contributed
                        something towards the progress of chemistry; and when Basil Valentine
                        restored the art to the object for which it was originally cultivated by the
                        Arabians, namely, the preparation and improvement of medicines, it began to
                        attract a little more of the attention of mankind. But the person who first
                        shook the throne of Galen and Avicenna to its foundation, and who satisfied
                        the public of the paramount importance of chemistry in medicine, and who
                        therefore must be considered as indirectly the author of its subsequent
                        popularity and consequent progress, was Paracelsus, of whom therefore it
                        will be proper to give a short account here.</p><p>Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast ab Hohenheim, was born at
                        Einsideln, two German miles from Zurich, where his father was a medical
                        practitioner. After receiving the first rudiments of his education, he
                        became a wandering scholar, as was at that time customary with poor
                        students. He wandered from province to province, predicting the future by
                        the position of the stars and the lines on the hand, and exhibiting all the
                        chemical experiments which he had learned from founders and alchymists. He
                        seems to have been for some time an army surgeon; but whether he ever
                        enjoyed the benefit of an university education is not certain. At the age of
                        thirty-three the great number of fortunate cures which he had performed
                        rendered him an object of admiration to the people of Germany. He assures us
                        that he cured eighteen princes, whose diseases had been aggravated by the
                        practitioners devoted to the system of Galen. Among others, he cured Philip,
                        margrave of Baden, of a dysentery, who promised him a great reward, but did
                        not keep his promise, and even treated him in a way unworthy of that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351501" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1501-0346"/>
                        prince. This cure, however, and others of a similar nature, added greatly to
                        his celebrity; and in order to raise his reputation to the highest pitch, he
                        announced publicly that he was able to cure all the diseases hitherto
                        reckoned incurable; and that he had discovered an elixir by means of which
                        the life of man might be prolonged at pleasure to any extent whatever.</p><p>In the year 1526 he was appointed professor of physic and surgery in the
                        university of Basil, in consequence, it is said, of the recommendation of
                        Oecolampadius. He introduced the custom of lecturing in the common language
                        of the country, as is at present the universal practice. But during the time
                        of Paracelsus, and long after, indeed, all lectures were delivered in Latin.
                        The new method which he followed in explaining the theory and practice of
                        the art, the numerous fortunate cures which he stated in confirmation of his
                        method of treatment, the emphasis with which he spoke of his secrets for
                        prolonging life, and for curing every kind of disease without distinction,
                        but still more, his lecturing in a language understood by the whole
                        population, drew to Basil an immense crowd of idle, enthusiastic, and
                        credulous hearers.</p><p>His lectures on the practice of medicine still remain, written in a confused
                        mixture of German and barbarous Latin, and containing little or nothing
                        except a farrago of empirical remedies, advanced with the greatest
                        confidence. They have a greater resemblance to a collection of quack
                        advertisements than to the sober lectures of a professor in a university. He
                        began his professorial career by burning publicly in his class-room, and in
                        the presence of his pupils, the works of Galen and Avicenna, assuring his
                        hearers that the strings of his shoes possessed more knowledge than those
                        two celebrated physicians. All the universities united had not, he assured
                        them, so much knowledge as was contained in his own beard; and the hairs
                        upon his neck were better informed than all the writers that ever existed
                        put together.</p><p>But his popularity was short lived, being destroyed not so much by the
                        grossness of his language, as by the irregularity and immorality of his
                        life. He hardly ever went to his class-room to deliver a lecture till he was
                        half intoxicated, and scarcely ever dictated to his secretaries till he had
                        lost the use of his reason by a too liberal indulgence in wine. If he was
                        summoned to visit a patient, he scarcely ever went but in a state of
                        intoxication. Not unfrequently he passed the whole night in the ale-house in
                        the company of peasants, and, when morning came, was quite incapable of
                        performing the duties of his station. Towards the end of the year 1527 a
                        disgraceful dispute into which he entered brought his career as a professor
                        to a sudden termination. The canon Cornelius of Lichtenfels, who had been
                        long a martyr to the gout, employed him as a physician, and promised him one
                        hundred florins if he could cure him. Paracelsus made him take three pills
                        of laudanum, and having thus freed him from pain, demanded the sum agreed
                        upon. But Lichtenfels refused to pay him the whole of it. Paracelsus
                        summoned him before the court, and the magistrate of Basil decided that the
                        canon was bound to pay only the regular price of the medicine administered.
                        Irritated at this decision, our intoxicated professor uttered a most violent
                        invective against the magistrate, who threatened to punish him for his
                        outrageous conduct. His friends advised him to save himself by flight. He
                        took their advise, and thus abdicated the professorship. But by this time
                        his celebrity as a teacher had been so completely destroyed by his foolish
                        and immoral conduct, that he had lost all his hearers. In consequence of
                        this state of things, his flight from Basil produced no sensation whatever
                        in that university.</p><p>He betook himself, in the first place, to Alsace, and sent for his faithful
                        follower the bookseller Operinus, together with the whole of his chemical
                        apparatus. In 1528 we find him at Colmar, where he commenced his ambulatory
                        life of a theosophist, which he had led during his youth. In 1531 he was at
                        St Gallen, in 1535 at Pfer-fersbode, and in 1536 at Augsburg. At the request
                        of John de Leippa, marshall of Bohemia, he undertook a journey into Moravia,
                        to cure him radically of the gout. But John de Leippa, instead of receiving
                        benefit from his medicines, became daily worse, and at last died. This was
                        the fate also of the lady of Zerotin, on whom the remedies of Paracelsus
                        produced no fewer than twenty-four epileptic fits in one day. Instead of
                        waiting the disgrace with which the death of this lady would have
                        overwhelmed him, Paracelsus announced his intention of going to Vienna, that
                        he might see how they would receive him in that capital. In 1538 we find him
                        at Villach. In 1540 he was at Mindelheim, and in 1541 at Strasburg, where he
                        died in St Stephen’s Hospital, in the forty-eighth year of his age.</p><p>When we attempt to form an accurate conception of the medical and
                        philosophical opinions of this singular man, we find ourselves beset with
                        almost insurmountable difficulties. His statements are so much at variance
                        with each other in his different pieces, and so much confusion reigns with
                        respect to the order of publication, that we know not what to fix on as his
                        last and maturest opinions. His style is execrable, filled with new words of
                        his own coining, and of mysticisms either introduced to excite the
                        admiration of the ignorant, or from the fanaticism and credulity of the
                        writer, who was to a considerable extent the dupe of his own impostures.
                        That he was in possession of the philosophers’ stone, or of a medicine
                        capable of prolonging life to an indefinite length, as he all along
                        asserted, he could not himself believe. But he had boasted so long and so
                        loudly of his wonderful cures, and of the efficacy of his medicines, that he
                        seems ultimately to have placed implicit faith in them.</p><p>His obscurity may have been partly the effect of design, and may have been
                        intended to exalt the notions entertained of his profundity. He uses common
                        words in new significations, without giving any indication of the change
                        which lie introduced. Thus <hi rend="italic">anatomy</hi> signifies, in his
                        writings, the nature, force, and magical designation of a thing. Paracelsus
                        calls <hi rend="italic">anatomy</hi> the knowledge of that model after which
                        all things are created. He terms the fundamental force of a thing <hi rend="italic">a star,</hi> and defines <hi rend="italic">alchymy</hi> the
                        art of drawing out the <hi rend="italic">stars</hi> of metals. The <hi rend="italic">star</hi> is the source of all knowledge. When we cat, we
                        introduce into our bodies <hi rend="italic">the star,</hi> which is then
                        modified, and favours nutrition.</p><p>It is likely that many of his obscure expressions are the result of
                        ignorance. Thus he uses the term <hi rend="italic">pagoyus</hi> for <hi rend="italic">paganus.</hi> He gives the name of <hi rend="italic">pagoyce</hi> to the four entities or causes of disease founded on the
                        influence of the stars, the elementary qualities, the occult qualities, and
                        the influence of spirits, because these had been already admitted by the <hi rend="italic">pagans.</hi> But the fifth entity, or cause of disease, which
                        has God immediately for its author, is <hi rend="italic">ηοη-pagoya.</hi> As
                        is the case with all fanatics, he treated with contempt every kind of
                        knowledge acquired by labour and application, and boasted that his wisdom
                        was communicated to him directly by God Almighty. From a careful inspection
                        of his works, it appears pretty plain that he was both a fanatic and an
                        impostor, and that his theory (if such a name can be given to the reveries
                        of a drunkard) consisted in uniting medicine with the doctrines of the
                        cabala.</p><p>He continually cries up the importance of chemical medicines<pb break="no" facs="nls:193351514" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1514-0347"/>, and
                        condemns with great violence and coarseness of language the Galenical
                        remedies employed by the physicians of his time. It was this circumstance
                        that made chemical preparations become fashionable among medical men. It was
                        this that drew the attention of apothecaries and physicians to chemical
                        medicines, and occasioned those numerous investigations which contributed so
                        essentially to the improvement and progress of chemistry as a science. He
                        himself employed mercurial preparations without scruple in the cure of the
                        venereal disease. And his success was such as to add greatly to his medical
                        reputation. There is no reason for believing that the use of mercury in this
                        disease was a contrivance of Paracelsus. It is generally admitted that it
                        was first tried for that disease by Carpus of Bologna, and that it was to
                        that Italian physician that Paracelsus was indebted for his knowledge of
                        this most important medicine. Paracelsus seems to have been the first who
                        employed opium freely; and he relied upon it to remove not merely <hi rend="italic">pain,</hi> but to cure several acute diseases. It would seem
                        to have been his remedy for <hi rend="italic">gold,</hi> and even for fever.
                        Nothing is known respecting the source from which he derived his knowledge
                        of this powerful medicine. His reputation as a chemist does not depend on
                        any discoveries which he actually made, but upon the great importance which
                        he attached to the knowledge of it, and to his making an acquaintance with
                        chemistry an indispensable requisite of a medical education.</p><p>Paracelsus had many followers, who cried up chemical remedies to the skies,
                        and ridiculed the inert medicines of the Galenists. This led to a violent
                        controversy, especially in France, where the opinions of Paracelsus were
                        zealously supported by Joseph du Chesne, better known by the name of
                        Quercitanus, who was physician to Henry IV. He was opposed by Riolanus, who
                        attacked chemical remedies with much bitterness. The medical faculty of
                        Paris took up the cause of the Galenists, and prohibited their fellows and
                        licentiates from using any chemical medicine whatever. Fenot affirmed that
                        <hi rend="italic">gold</hi> possesses no medicinal properties whatever, that
                        crabs’ eyes are of no use when administered internally, and that the
                        laudanum of Paracelsus (being an opiate) is in reality hurtful instead of
                        being beneficial. The decree of the medical faculty of Paris, which placed
                        <hi rend="italic">antimony</hi> among the poisons, was followed by that of
                        the parliament of Paris, strictly prohibiting the internal administration of
                        any preparation of that metal. In 1603 the celebrated Theodore Turguet de
                        Mayenne was prosecuted, because, in spite of the prohibition, he continued
                        to sell antimonial preparations. The decree of the faculty against him
                        exhibits a remarkable proof of the bigotry and intolerance of the times. Yet
                        Turguet does not seem to have been molested in consequence of this decree.
                        He ceased indeed to be professor of chemistry, but continued to practise
                        medicine as formerly. At last he went to England, whither he had been
                        invited to accept an honourable appointment.</p><p>The mystical doctrines of Paracelsus arc supposed to have given origin to the
                        sect of the <hi rend="italic">Rosicrucians</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                        the probability is that no such sect ever existed. The notion of their
                        existence seems to have been owing to a ludicrous performance of Valentine
                        Andreae, an ecclesiastic of Calwe, in the country of Wirtemburg. A crowd of
                        enthusiasts swallowed his fictitious statements as true, and endeavoured to
                        unite the followers of the <hi rend="italic">rosa</hi><hi rend="italic">crux</hi> into a sect. According to them, every thing is accomplished,
                        provided only we possess sufficient faith. “To fly in the air, to transmute
                        metals, and to know all the sciences, nothing more is requisite than faith.”
                        Oswald Crollius, physician to the Emperor Rodolph II. must take his station
                        among these enthusiasts. His opinions were refuted by Andrew Libavius of
                        Halle in Saxony, one of the most enlightened men, and one of the most
                        successful chemists, of the time. The <hi rend="italic">bichloride of
                        tin,</hi> which he first formed, still goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">fuming liquor of Libavius.</hi> His system of chemistry, published at
                        Frankfort in 1595, is really an excellent book, and deserves the attention
                        of every person who is interested in the history of chemistry.</p><p>Libavius found, in Angelus Sala of Vicenza, a successor worthy of his
                        enlightened views and indefatigable exertions to oppose the torrent of
                        fanaticism which threatened to overwhelm all Europe. Sala was still more
                        addicted to chemical remedies than Libavius himself; but he had abjured a
                        multitude of prejudices which had distinguished the school of Paracelsus. He
                        discarded <hi rend="italic">po</hi><hi rend="italic">tabile,</hi> and
                        considered <hi rend="italic">fulminating gold</hi> as the only medicine of
                        that metal which deserved to be prescribed. He first ascertained the
                        constituents of <hi rend="italic">sal ammoniac.</hi> To him, therefore, we
                        are indebted for the first accurate notion of <hi rend="italic">ammonia.</hi></p><p>But chemistry was destined speedily to undergo a new revolution, which shook
                        the Spagirical system to its foundation, substituted other principles, and
                        gave to medicine an aspect entirely new. This revolution was in some measure
                        due to the labours of Van Helmont.</p><p>John Baptist Van Helmont was a gentleman of Brabant. Born in Brussels in
                        1577, he studied scholastic philosophy at Louvain till the age of seventeen.
                        He next associated himself to the Jesuits, who then delivered courses of
                        philosophy at Louvain, to the great displeasure of the professors of that
                        city. But Van Helmont was disappointed of the knowledge that he expected
                        from them. Nor was he better satisfied with the doctrine of the Stoics. At
                        last the works of Thomas a Kempis, and of John Tau-lcrus,. fell into his
                        hands. These sacred books of mysticism attracted his attention. He perceived
                        that wisdom is the gift of the Supreme Being; that it must be obtained by
                        prayer; and that we must renounce our own will, if we wish to participate in
                        the influence of the divine grace. From this moment he imitated Jesus Christ
                        in his humility. He abandoned his property to his sister, and renounced his
                        rank in society. It was not long before he reaped the fruit of these
                        abnegations. A genius appeared to him in all the important circumstances of
                        his life. In the year 1633 his own soul appeared to him under the figure of
                        a resplendent crystal. His desire of imitating Christ induced him to study
                        medicine. He made himself master of the works of Hippocrates and Galen. But
                        as his taste for mysticism was insatiable, he soon became disgusted with the
                        writings of the Greeks. An accident led him to abandon them for ever.
                        Happening to take up the glove of a young girl affected with the itch, he
                        caught that disagreeable disease. The Galenists whom he consulted attributed
                        it to the combustion of the bile, and the saline state of the phlegm. They
                        prescribed a course of purgatives, which weakened him considerably, without
                        producing a cure. This led him to form the plan of reforming medicine. He
                        first studied the works of Paracelsus; but could not avoid despising the
                        disgusting egotism and the ridiculous ignorance of that fanatic. He took the
                        degree of doctor of medicine in 1599. After travelling through France and
                        Italy, he married a rich ßrabantine lady, by whom he had several children.
                        He died in the year 1644, in the sixty-seventh year of his age. His works
                        were published after his death by his son Mercurius. As a medical man he
                        must be considered as a great improver on the miserable system of practice
                        at that time followed. As a chemist he is far from being without merit. To
                        him we are indebted for the invention, or at least the first application, of
                        the term <hi rend="italic">gas,</hi> in the sense in which it is employed by
                        modern chemists. He was aware that gas was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351527" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1527-0348"/> extricated
                        in abundance during the application of heat to various bodies, and during
                        the solution of various carbonates and metals in acids. His theory of the
                        formation of urinary calculus does him great credit, and constituted a first
                        step towards the elucidation of that important portion of physiology. He
                        satisfied himself that these calculi differ completely from common stones,
                        and that they do not exist in the food or drink. <hi rend="italic">Tartar,</hi> he says, precipitates from urine, not as an earth, but as a
                        crystallized salt. In like manner, the natural salt of urine precipitates
                        from that liquid, and gives origin to calculi. We may imitate the natural
                        process by mixing spirit of urine with rectified alcohol. Immediately an <hi rend="italic">offa alba</hi> is precipitated.</p><p>The decided preference given to chemical medicines by Van Helmont, and the
                        uses to which he applies chemical theory, had a natural tendency to raise
                        chemistry to a higher rank in the eyes of medical men than it had yet
                        reached. But the man to whom the credit of founding the iatro-chemical sect
                        is due, is Francis de la Boé Sylvius, who was born in 1614. While a
                        practitioner of medicine at Amsterdam, he studied with profound attention
                        the system of Van Helmont, and the rival and much more popular theory of
                        Descartes. Upon these he founded his own theory, which contains little
                        entitled to the name of original, notwithstanding the tone in which he
                        speaks of it, and his repeated declarations that he had borrowed from no
                        one. He was appointed professor of the theory and practice of medicine in
                        the university of Leyden, where he taught with such eclat, and drew after
                        him so great a number of pupils, that Boerhaave alone surpassed him in that
                        respect. Every thing was explained by him according to the principles of
                        chemistry, as at that time understood. And certainly both his physiology and
                        his practice are absurd in an almost incredible degree. All diseases were
                        occasioned by a superabundance of an <hi rend="italic">acid</hi> or an <hi rend="italic">alkali</hi> in the blood. The <hi rend="italic">acid</hi>
                        diseases were cured by the administration of an <hi rend="italic">alhali,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">alkaline</hi> diseases by the
                        administration of an <hi rend="italic">acid.</hi></p><p>It is a remarkable circumstance, and shows clearly that mankind in general
                        had become disgusted with the dogmas of the Galenists, that iatro-chemistry
                        was adopted more or less completely by almost all physicians. And the few
                        that opposed it combated its dogmas by arguments not less nugatory than
                        those of the iatro-chemists themselves. The first person who really shook
                        the pillars on which this sect rested their opinions was Mr Boyle. This he
                        did in 1661, by the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Sceptical
                        Chemist.</hi> His arguments did not indeed immediately put an end to the
                        sect, but they served somewhat to shake the confidence with which they
                        supported their peculiar -opinions. These opinions were successfully refuted
                        by the celebrated Dr Archibald Pitcairn of Edinburgh; and they finally
                        disappeared, being unable to stand their ground against the unrivalled
                        celebrity of Boerhaave.</p><p>Herman Boerhaave possesses so much merit as a chemist, that his name cannot
                        be omitted in this sketch. He was born at Voorhout, a village near Leyden,
                        in 1688, where his father was parish clergyman. At the age of sixteen he was
                        left an orphan, without protection, advice, or fortune. He had already
                        studied theology and the kindred sciences, and meant to offer himself as a
                        clergyman; but being accused of leaning towards the principles of Spinoza,
                        he was obliged to turn his attention to medicine. In 1693 he graduated and
                        began to practise, supporting himself by teaching mathematics, till his
                        medical fees became sufficient to support him. Meanwhile he erected a
                        laboratory, and devoted a considerable time to the study of chemistry and of
                        botany. On the death of Drelincourt in 1702 he was appointed professor of
                        medicine in the university of Leyden. His reputation speedily became very
                        high: he was successively appointed professor of botany and of chemistry,
                        while rectorships and deanships were showered upon him with an unsparing
                        hand.</p><p>His system of chemistry, published in two quarto volumes in 1732, and of
                        which we have an excellent English translation by Dr Shaw, was the most
                        learned and most luminous treatise on chemistry that the world had yet seen,
                        being nothing less than a collection of alt the chemical facts and processes
                        that were known in Boerhaave’s time, collected from a thousand different
                        sources, and from writings equally disgusting for their obscurity and their
                        mysticism. Every thing is stated in the plainest way, and chemistry is shown
                        as a science, and an art of the first importance, not merely to medicine,
                        but to mankind in general.</p><p>Towards the end of the seventeenth century several other chemists appeared,
                        who contributed considerably to the increase of chemical facts, or to the
                        improvement of chemical processes. It will be sufficient to mention the
                        names of Glauber, the discoverer of the salt that bears his name; of Kunkel,
                        the discoverer of phosphorus; of Lemery, who rendered the science so popular
                        in France; and of Homberg, and the two Geoff roys, successively members of
                        the French Academy of Sciences, and makers of important discoveries.</p><p>The first person who attempted to arrange all the known chemical facts under
                        a <hi rend="italic">theory,</hi> was John Joachim Beecher, who was born at
                        Spires, in Germany, in the year 1635. His father was a Lutheran clergyman;
                        but he lost him early; and as the part of Germany where he lived had been
                        ruined by the thirty years’ war, his family was reduced to great poverty.
                        Yet he contrived to procure a medical and chemical education. In 1666 he was
                        appointed professor of medicine in the university of Mentz, and soon after
                        chief physician to the elector. There he was furnished with an excellent
                        laboratory. But he soon fell into difficulties, and was obliged to take
                        refuge in Vienna. Thence he repaired to Holland, and settled in Haerlem. In
                        1680 we find him in Great Britain, where he examined the Scottish lead mines
                        and smelting works; and in 1681 and 1682 lie traversed Cornwall, and studied
                        the mines and smelting works of that great mining county. He died suddenly
                        in 1682, while he was negotiating about an advantageous situation offered
                        him by the Duke of Mecklenburg Gustrow.</p><p>His chemical theory was given to the world in his <hi rend="italic">Physica
                        Subterranea</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it was soon after embraced and
                        improved upon by Stahl. George Earnest Stahl was certainly one of the most
                        remarkable men of the age in which he lived. He was born at Anspach in the
                        year 1660. He studied medicine, and in 1694 was named, at the solicitation
                        of Frederick Hoffmann, second professor of medicine in the university of
                        Halle, which had just been established. It is probable that he also taught
                        chemistry in the same university. He aimed at legislating, both in medicine
                        and chemistry; and this aim, ambitious as it was, was in some measure
                        successful. The chemical theory invented by Beecher, and simplified by
                        Stahl, had for its object the explanation of combustions, and the reasons of
                        the alterations induced by it on bodies. All combustible bodies, in their
                        opinion, are compounds, and contain one principle in common, to which they
                        owe their combustibility. To this principle they gave the name of <hi rend="italic">phlogiston.</hi> When a body burns, the phlogiston leaves it,
                        and occasions the appearance of the beat and the light which constitute
                        combustion in common language. What remains is the other constituent of the
                        body. When <hi rend="italic">sulphur</hi> burns, sulphuric acid remains.
                        Therefore sulphur is a compound <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351540" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1540-0349"/> of
                        sulphuric acid and phlogiston. When the metals are burnt, <hi rend="italic">earthy</hi> bodies or <hi rend="italic">calces</hi> remain. Hence the
                        metals are compounds of calces and phlogiston. This theory was universally
                        adopted by succeeding chemists, and was only overturned in consequence of
                        the prodigious accumulation of new facts for which the Stahlian theory had
                        not provided, towards the end of the eighteenth century.</p><p>The chemical school of Berlin, of which Stahl may in some measure be
                        considered as the founder, has furnished an almost uninterrupted series of
                        eminent chemists. Neumann, Pott, Eller, and Margraaf, are the most
                        celebrated advocates of the Stahlian theory who adorned that school. During
                        the same period a series of most meritorious men and distinguished chemists
                        adorned the Academy of Sciences of Paris. The most deservedly celebrated of
                        them were Reaumur, Hellot, Duhamel, Macquer, and Rouelle.</p><p>Hitherto chemistry had attracted but little attention in Great Britain, and
                        had been cultivated chiefly as an adjunct of medicine. It was in this way
                        that it made its way into the different universities. It was considered as a
                        science necessary for physicians, in order to enable them to prepare
                        chemical medicines. The first person who seems to have viewed chemistry as
                        capable of becoming a separate and important science, equally useful to
                        mankind as mechanics itself, and capable of raising the successful
                        cultivator of it to a high station among men of science, was Dr William
                        Cullen, who afterwards raised the university of Edinburgh to such celebrity
                        as a <hi rend="italic">medical school.</hi> He was born at Hamilton in 1712,
                        and after serving an apprenticeship to a surgeon in Glasgow, he settled,
                        when very young, at Shotts in Lanarkshire. There he accidentally formed an
                        acquaintance with Archibald duke of Argyll, who at that time bore the chief
                        political sway in Scotland. By his influence he was appointed lecturer on
                        chemistry in the University of Glasgow. There he began to explain his views
                        respecting the science; and such was his popularity, that his class soon
                        became crowded with students. Such was his reputation as a chemist, that on
                        Dr Plummer’s death in 1756 he was unanimously invited to fill the vacant
                        chemical chair in the University of Edinburgh. There his popularity followed
                        him, and continued to increase in consequence of his own admirable conduct,
                        notwithstanding the attempts of some of his colleagues to injure him with
                        the public. Though his appointment to the medical chair in the University of
                        Edinburgh in the year 1766 put an end to his chemical career, yet he had the
                        merit of drawing the attention of the public to that fascinating and most
                        important science, and pointing out what might be done by an experimental
                        cultivation of it. He had the merit also of being the teacher of Dr Black,
                        and of filling that eminent chemist with a passion for the science in which
                        he was destined to distinguish himself.</p><p>Joseph Black was born in France, on the banks of the Garonne, in the year
                        1758. His father was a native of Belfast, but of a Scotch family. Young
                        Black was educated in Belfast, and in 1746 he was sent to continue his
                        education in the University of Glasgow. It was at that time that Dr Cullen
                        began to teach chemistry in that university. Young Black, who had made
                        choice of medicine as his profession, naturally attended the chemical
                        lectures. He was soon fascinated with the study, became intimate with
                        Cullen, and soon assisted him in his experiments. He went to Edinburgh to
                        finish his medical studies in 1751. Here he discovered the nature of the
                        difference between limestone and quicklime. The first is a salt, a compound
                        of carbonic acid (which he called fixed air) and lime; the second is the
                        lime uncombined. He showed that carbonic acid is a gas possessed of the
                        properties of air, but capable, like other acids, of combining with bases,
                        and constituting a genus of salts to which the name of <hi rend="italic">carbonates</hi> has been since given. He made this discovery the subject of
                        his inaugural dissertation when he took his medical degree in 1756; and
                        gave, in the same thesis, an account of his experiments on <hi rend="italic">magnesia</hi> and its salts, proving it to possess properties analogous to,
                        but quite different from, those of lime. This thesis immediately raised him
                        to the rank of a first-rate chemist.</p><p>It was at this time that Dr Cullen was removed to Edinburgh, and in 1756 Dr
                        Black succeeded him as lecturer on chemistry in the University of Glasgow.
                        Here he brought to maturity his speculations respecting <hi rend="italic">latent heat,</hi> which first enabled chemists to give the doctrines of
                        heat a scientific form. In 1766 he was appointed professor of chemistry in
                        Edinburgh. Here he continued annually to deliver an admirable course of
                        lectures; but contributed but little afterwards to the progress of the
                        science, except by his annual explanation of its doctrines. He died in
                        November 1799, in the seventy-first year of his age.</p><p>The tempting career which Dr Black had opened, but which his slender stock of
                        health unqualified him for prosecuting, was entered on by Mr Cavendish, and
                        prosecuted with uncommon accuracy. To him we are indebted for the knowledge
                        of the properties of carbonic acid and hydrogen gases, and for the discovery
                        of the composition of water and of nitric acid. He first gave a rigid
                        analysis of the air, and showed that its constituents underwent no sensible
                        variation. To him also we are indebted for our knowledge of the freezing
                        point of mercury. He died on the 4th of February 1810, in the seventy-ninth
                        year of his age.</p><p>But the man who contributed the most to the rapid progress of chemistry, and
                        to whom it is chiefly indebted for the great degree of popularity which it
                        enjoyed towards the end of the eighteenth century, was Dr Priestley. We
                        cannot here expatiate upon the life of this extraordinary man, which will
                        doubtless find a place in another part of this work; but shall merely
                        confine ourselves to an enumeration of some of the most important additions
                        which he made to chemistry. To him we are indebted for a knowledge of the
                        mode of preparing <hi rend="italic">nitrous gas,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">deutoxide of azote</hi> as it is now called, of its remarkable properties,
                        and in particular for the use that may be made of it in analysing
                        atmospheric air. On the 1st of August 1774 he discovered <hi rend="italic">oxygen gas,</hi> by heating the red oxide of mercury, and collecting the
                        gaseous matter given out by it. He almost immediately detected the
                        remarkable property which it has of supporting combustion better, and animal
                        life longer, than the same volume of common air. He first made known <hi rend="italic">sulphurous acid, fluosilicic acid, muriatic acid,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ammonia,</hi> in the gaseous form, and pointed out easy
                        methods of procuring them; he describes with exactness the most remarkable
                        properties of each. He likewise pointed out the existence of <hi rend="italic">carburetted hydrogen,</hi> though he made few experiments to
                        determine its nature. His discovery of <hi rend="italic">protoxide of
                        azote</hi> affords a beautiful example of the advantages resulting from his
                        method of investigation, and the sagacity which enabled him to follow out
                        any remarkable appearance which occurred. Carbonic oxide gas was discovered
                        by him while in America, and it was brought forward by him as·an
                        incontrovertible refutation of the antiphlogistic theory. Though he was not
                        the discoverer of hydrogen gas, yet his experiments on it were highly
                        interesting, and contributed essentially to the revolution which chemistry
                        soon after underwent. He first discovered the great increase of bulk which
                        takes place when electric sparks are passed through ammoniacal gas, a fact
                        which led Bcrthollet to the analysis of this gas. His experiments on the
                        amelioration of atmospherical air by the vegetation of plants, on the oxygen
                        gas given out by their leaves, and on the respiration<pb break="no" facs="nls:193351553" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1553-0350"/> of
                        animals, are not less curious and interesting. Such are the most striking of
                        his discoveries; but his three volumes on air constitute one of the richest
                        storehouses of chemical facts in existence. It may be said without
                        exaggeration that Dr Priestley was one of the most diligent and successful
                        pioneers in chemistry that ever existed. He was too rapid, and too little
                        given to ponder over his opinions before he gave them to the world, to
                        constitute a good philosopher; but in genius and invention he was not
                        inferior to any of his contemporaries. Dr Priestley died in America in the
                        year 1804, in the eighty-first year of his age.</p><p>While the boundaries of chemistry were so rapidly extending by the
                        discoveries of the British chemists, there were two chemists in Sweden who
                        contributed fully as effectually towards the prodigious revolution which it
                        was so soon destined to undergo: these were Bergman and Scheele.</p><p>Torbern Bergman was born in the year 1735, in West Gothland. After finishing
                        his education at the University of Upsala, where he had displayed a decided
                        taste for mathematics and the physical sciences, he was appointed, about the
                        year 1758, <hi rend="italic">magister</hi><hi rend="italic">docens</hi> in
                        natural philosophy. In 1767 he succeeded Walerius as professor of chemistry
                        in Upsala, and filled the chair with the highest reputation for seventeen
                        years; for he died on the 8th of July 1784, at the baths of Medevi, to which
                        he had repaired in hopes of an alleviation of his malady. His works were
                        published in six octavo volumes, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Opuscula.</hi> It would be tedious to notice all the different facts which
                        Bergman ascertained. It may be sufficient to say, that to him chemistry is
                        indebted for the art of analysis, constituting at present the grand
                        instrument for the improvement of the science. His methods of analysing
                        waters, stony bodies, and ores, were indeed imperfect, but they constituted
                        a beginning which was afterwards improved and new-modelled by Klaproth and
                        Vauquelin, and brought to the state of perfection which it has recently
                        attained by different chemists, who still continue to cultivate the science
                        with ardour.</p><p>The other Swedish chemist of that period was Scheele, who constitutes one of
                        the most extraordinary chemists that ever existed. Charles William Scheele
                        was born on the 18th of December 1742, at Stralsund, the capital of Swedish
                        Pomerania. He was bound apprentice to an apothecary in Gottenburg, from
                        which place, after an interval of several years, he went successively to
                        Malmo, Stockholm, and Upsala, and at last he settled at Köping as an
                        apothecary, where he died in 1786, in the forty-fourth year of his age.
                        Scheele’s discoveries were so numerous and important, that a bare catalogue
                        of them will be sufficient to convince the most careless reader of the great
                        services which he performed to the science.</p><p>He first pointed out the method of obtaining <hi rend="italic">tartaric
                        add</hi> in a state of purity. What a benefit this has been to the
                        manufactures of Great Britain every calico-printer is able to appreciate. He
                        discovered <hi rend="italic">fluoric acid,</hi> and pointed out some of its
                        most remarkable properties. He did not, indeed, obtain the acid in a state
                        of purity, but united to silica in the state of <hi rend="italic">fluosilicic acid.</hi> Pure fluoric acid was first made known in 1811 by
                        Gay-Lussac and Thénard. His experiments on manganese constitute a memorable
                        era in chemistry. It was during them that he discovered <hi rend="italic">chlorine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">barytes,</hi> the first of which has
                        quite altered the mode of bleaching formerly followed in this country; and
                        the second is an indispen⅛able article in analysis. It was during these
                        experiments also that he discovered the constituents of ammonia. By heating
                        the bleaching oxide of manganese, he obtained <hi rend="italic">oxygen
                        gas,</hi> the remarkable properties of which he ascertained; so that if
                        oxygen had not been discovered by Priestley, it would have been soon after
                        made known by Scheele, who possessed all the merit, though the want of
                        priority deprived him of the reputation which would otherwise have accrued
                        to him.</p><p>He discovered <hi rend="italic">arsenic add, molybdic acid, tungstic acid,
                        uric acid, mucic acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, gallic acid,
                        citric acid.</hi> He ascertained the constituents of prussic acid, the
                        nature of plumbago, and pointed out the characters of silica and alumina,
                        which till then had been confounded by various chemists of some note. The
                        preceding enumeration contains but an imperfect sketch of the numerous
                        discoveries of Scheele. The necessity of being brief has obliged us to omit
                        much which was highly deserving of notice.</p><p>The discoveries of the British and Swedish chemists made known a prodigious
                        number of facts which had not been anticipated by Beecher and Stahl, and
                        which their theory was inadequate to explain. It was clear, therefore, that
                        the Stahlian theory could not much longer maintain its ground. The chemist
                        to w hose exertions that overthrow was immediately owing was Lavoisier.</p><p>Antoine Laurent Lavoisier was born in Paris in 1743.; He was opulent, and had
                        received a liberal education, lt was Dr Black’s discovery of fixed air that
                        induced him to make choice of chemistry as a field in which much reputation
                        might be gained. He became a member of the Academy of Sciences in 1768, and
                        from that period till the year 1794, or twenty-six years, he was the author
                        of no fewer than sixty memoirs, most of them upon chemical subjects. In the
                        year 1772 he discovered that when metals are converted into calces, they <hi rend="italic">increase</hi> in weight. This led him to suspect the
                        non-existence of phlogiston. This notion he prosecuted with unexampled
                        industry for twenty-four years, till he finally established it to the
                        satisfaction of the chemical world. <hi rend="italic">Combustion,</hi>
                        according to his ’ view, is the combination of the burning body with
                        oxygen.&lt; The oxygen loses the gaseous form, and therefore deposits the
                        heat and the light with which it was formerly united. Hence the reason why
                        bodies after combustion are heavier than they were before. Combustible
                        bodies are either simple substances, or combinations of various simple
                        substances. When they undergo combustion, they unite with oxygen. Hence all
                        the products of combustion are <hi rend="italic">compounds.</hi> Sulphur,
                        for example, is a simple body. When burnt it combines with oxygen, and is
                        converted into sulphuric acid; so that sulphuric acid is a compound of
                        sulphur and oxygen. In 1786 Berthollet, at a meeting of the academy,
                        declared himself satisfied of the truth of Lavoisier’s opinions. He was soon
                        followed by Fourcroy, who had succeeded Buequet as professor of chemistry in
                        the Jardin du Roi, and was at that time the most popular teacher of the
                        science in France. Soon after Morveau, who had greatly distinguished himself
                        as a chemist, and had given gratuitous lectures on chemistry at Dijon for
                        many years, and who was employed in writing the chemical part of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique,</hi> was also converted to the same
                        opinions.</p><p>The old chemical phraseology was at that time exceedingly imperfect, entirely
                        moulded on the Stahlian theory, and quite inadequate to express the opinions
                        of the <hi rend="italic">anti-phlogistians,</hi> as the adherents of
                        Lavoisier were called. Morveau suggested the propriety, or rather the
                        necessity, of forming a new chemical nomenclature; and though his views were
                        at first opposed by the chemical members of the Academy of Sciences, they
                        were finally acceded to; and Lavoisier, Berthollet, Morveau, and Fourcroy,
                        formed themselves into a committee for the purpose of constructing a new
                        chemical nomenclature. The new nomenclature was published in the. year 1787.
                        It was avowedly<pb break="no" facs="nls:193351566" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1566-0351"/> the production of Morveau, except a few terms
                        which had been previously introduced by Lavoisier. Though far from perfect,
                        it was so superior to the old barbarous jargon of the science, that it was
                        in a few years almost universally adopted, and contributed more than any
                        thing else to the overthrow of the Stahlian theory; for thinking is so much
                        dependent upon language, and the old nomenclature was so much identified
                        with the Stahlian theory, that, had it continued to be used, it is doubtful
                        whether the hypothesis of phlogiston could have been got rid of, at least so
                        speedily.</p><p>Mr Kirwan, who had established a high reputation by his labours as a chemist,
                        undertook the task of refuting the antiphlogistic theory, and with that view
                        published a work, to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">An Essay on
                        Phlogiston, and the Composition of Acids.</hi> In that book he maintained an
                        opinion which seems to have been pretty generally adopted by the chemists of
                        the time, namely, that phlogiston is the same thing with what is at present
                        called <hi rend="italic">hydrogen,</hi> and which, when Kirwan wrote, was
                        called light <hi rend="italic">inflammable air.</hi> Of course Mr Kirwan
                        undertook to prove that every combustible substance, and every metal,
                        contains hydrogen as a constituent, and that hydrogen escapes in every case
                        of combustion and calcination. On the other hand, when calces are reduced to
                        the metallic state, hydrogen is absorbed. The book was divided into thirteen
                        sections. In the first, the specific gravity of gases was stated according
                        to the best data then existing; the second section treats of the composition
                        of acids and of water; the third, of sulphuric acid; the fourth, of nitric
                        acid; the fifth, of muriatic acid; the sixth, of aqua regia; the seventh, of
                        phosphoric acid; the eighth, of oxalic acid; the ninth, of the calcination
                        and reduction of metals, and the formation of fixed air; the tenth, of the
                        dissolution of metals; the eleventh, of the precipitation of metals by each
                        other; the twelfth, of the properties of iron and steel; while the
                        thirteenth sums up the whole argument by way of conclusion.</p><p>In this work Kirwan admitted the truth of Lavoisier’s theory, that during
                        combustion and calcination oxygen unites with the burning and calcining
                        body. He admitted also that water is a compound of oxygen and hydrogen. Now,
                        these admissions, which, however, it was scarcely possible for a man of
                        candour to refuse, rendered the whole of his arguments in favour of the
                        identity of hydrogen and phlogiston, and of the existence of hydrogen in all
                        combustible bodies, exceedingly inconclusive. Kirwan’s book was laid hold of
                        by the French chemists as affording them an excellent opportunity of showing
                        the superiority of the new opinions over the old. Kirwan’s view of the
                        subject had been taken by Bergman and Scheele, and indeed by every chemist
                        of eminence who still adhered to the phlogistic system. A refutation of it,
                        therefore, would be a death-blow to phlogiston, and would place the
                        antiphlogistic theory upon a basis so secure, that henceforth it would be
                        impossible to shake it. The book accordingly was translated into French, and
                        published with a refutation at the end of every chapter. These refutations
                        were managed with so much urbanity of manner, and at the same time were so
                        complete, that they produced all the effects expected from them. Mr Kirwan,
                        with a degree of candour and liberality, of which, unfortunately, very few
                        examples can be produced, abandoned phlogiston, and adopted the theory of
                        his opponents.</p><p>Thus, about the year 1790 or 1792, the doctrinc of Lavoisier may be
                        considered to have been fully established. If any adherents of phlogiston
                        still remained, they were utterly unsuccessful in their feeble attempts to
                        stem the current which had set in with so much violence against them. The
                        science continued to be prosecuted in France and Germany; and,
                        notwithstanding the horrors of the French revolution, and the confusion into
                        which it plunged Europe, Berthollet, Fourcroy, Vauquelin, and Pelletier in
                        France, and Klaproth in Germany, were the individuals to which this progress
                        was chiefly owing. Klaproth in particular extended the bounds of the science
                        by the discovery of several new metals, and by bringing the difficult art of
                        analysis to a regular system. To Vauquelin the science was indebted for the
                        discovery of a new metal and a new earth, and to an infinite number of
                        analyses, mineral, vegetable, and animal, all of them calculated to enlarge
                        our knowledge, and extend the dominion of the science of chemistry.</p><p>About the termination of the eighteenth century a new electrical instrument
                        was discovered by Volta, now universally known under the name of the
                        galvanic or Voltaic pile. This new instrument was destined to produce a new
                        revolution in chemistry, nearly as great as the antiphlogistic theory of
                        Lavoisier. About the time that this discovery was made, a new race of
                        chemists had begun to distinguish themselves in Britain. One of the most
                        remarkable of these was Humphry Davy, who was in a great measure
                        self-taught, and who possessed such genius and ardour, that he was sure to
                        make a figure in whatever branch of science he chose to cultivate. His
                        predilection for chemistry was strong, and he saw at once the celebrity
                        likely to accrue from a successful development of the laws which regulate
                        the chemical phenomena connected with the action of the Voltaic battery. He
                        accordingly devoted himself to the study of these phenomena; and about the
                        year 1807 he succeeded in demonstrating that the galvanic energy has the
                        property of decomposing compound bodies according to a determinate law;
                        oxygen and acids attach themselves to the positive pole of the battery,
                        while hydrogen, sulphur, metals,alkalies, and earths, attach themselves to
                        the negative pole. He concluded from this that oxygen and acids are
                        naturally negative, while hydrogen, sulphur, metals, earths, and alkalies
                        are naturally positive. This led to the conclusion that chemical affinity is
                        merely a case of electrical attraction, and that bodies combine because they
                        are in opposite electrical states, and that, in order to produce
                        decomposition, we have only to bring them into the same electrical state.
                        This hypothesis, known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">electrical
                        theory,</hi> was generally adopted by chemists; and it is by means of it
                        that the nature of combination and decomposition is at present attempted to
                        be explained.</p><p>Davy drew as a consequence from his theory, that if the current of
                        electricity can be made sufficiently large, it will decompose all compound
                        bodies whatever. He tried potash and soda, and succeeded in showing that
                        they are compounds of peculiar metals and oxygen. It was immediately
                        inferred that the <hi rend="italic">earths</hi> also are metallic oxides.
                        This was demonstrated by Davy himself with respect to the alkaline earths;
                        and it has been since shown that all the earths proper are also oxides,
                        though the bases of all of them are not metals.</p><p>Davy succeeded also (chiefly in consequence of the important labours of
                        Gay-Lussac and Thenard) in satisfying chemists that <hi rend="italic">chlorine</hi> is not a compound, but a simple substance, analogous to
                        oxygen in its nature, and, like it, attracted by the positive pole of the
                        Voltaic battery. The subsequent discovery of <hi rend="italic">iodine</hi>
                        and <hi rend="italic">bromine,</hi> substances analogous in their nature,
                        and the probable evidence that the base of <hi rend="italic">fluoric
                        acid</hi> is a substance of a similar kind, have completely new-modelled the
                        Lavoisierian theory. There are five substances analogous to oxigen, which
                        may be called <hi rend="italic">supporters</hi> of combustion. They are all
                        capable of uniting with combustible bodies, and the union may be attended
                        with the phenomena of combustion. When they <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351579" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1579-0352"/> combine
                        with one set of combustible bodies they form acids; when with another set,
                        <hi rend="italic">alhalies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bases.</hi> Thus there
                        are at least five different classes of acids, and as many different classes
                        of alkalies. Acids and alkalies of the same class unite together and form
                        salts; but acids and bases of different classes mutually decompose each
                        other, and in general, therefore, cannot unite. Thus there are as many
                        classes of salts as there are of acids and bases. Such is an imperfect
                        sketch of his present chemical theory, which may be fairly considered as
                        having originated with Sir H. Davy, though it has been carried a greater
                        length than he anticipated, and many new facts have been discovered of which
                        lie was ignorant.</p><p>Another improvement has been introduced into chemistry by Mr Dalton, which
                        is, if possible, still more important, by affording a test of accuracy in
                        our experiments, and enabling us to eliminate errors by a method somewhat
                        analogous to that. employed by astronomers. Even at present, while only in
                        its infancy, this improvement has made a complete alteration in the mode of
                        experimenting. What may not be expected from it when it has come to a state
                        of maturity? The improvement to which we allude is usually known by the name
                        of the <hi rend="italic">atomic theory.</hi></p><p>This theory did not originate at once, but was gradually brought into light.
                        A short account of the steps by which it came into view will terminate this
                        imperfect historical detail of the progress of chemistry. The very attempt
                        at analysis is an acknowledgment that bodies unite only in definite
                        proportions; for unless this were the case, all attempts to determine the
                        proportions in which the constituents of bodies are united, would be
                        obviously absurd. The first accurate set of experiments to analyse the salts
                        was made by Wentzel, and published by him in 1777, in a small volume
                        entitled <hi rend="italic">Lehre von der Verwandschaft der Körper,</hi> or
                        Theory of the Affinities of Bodies. These analyses are much more accurate
                        than those of Bergman, yet the book fell almost dead-born from the press.
                        Wentzel was struck with a phenomenon, which had indeed been noticed by
                        preceding chemists; but they had not drawn the advantages from it which it
                        was capable of affording. There are several saline solutions, which, when
                        mixed with each other, completely decompose each other, so that two new
                        salts are produced. Thus, if we mix together solutions of <hi rend="italic">nitrate of lead</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sulphate of soda,</hi> in the
                        requisite proportions, the sulphuric acid of the latter salt will combine
                        with the oxide of lead of the former, and will form with it sulphate of
                        lead, which will precipitate to the bottom in the state of an insoluble
                        powder, while the nitric acid formerly united to the oxide of lead will
                        combine with the soda formerly in union with the sulphuric acid, and form
                        nitrate of soda, which being soluble, will remain in solution in the liquid.
                        Thus, instead of the two old salts, sulphate of soda and nitrate of lead, we
                        obtain the two new salts, sulphate of lead and nitrate of soda. If we mix
                        the salts in the requisite proportions the decomposition will be complete;
                        but if there be an excess of one of the salts, that excess will still remain
                        in solution without affecting the result. If we suppose the two salts
                        anhydrous, then the proportions necessary to complete the decomposition
                        are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Sulphate or soda....</p><p>Nitrate of lead</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>9</p><p>20∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>and the quantity of the new</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>29∙75</p><p>salts formed will be</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Sulphate of lead...</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>19</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Nitrate of soda</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>10∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>29*75</p></cell></row></table><p>We see that the absolute weights of the two sets of salt are the same. All
                        that has happened is, that both the acids and both the bases have exchanged
                        situations. Now, if, instead of mixing them in the above proportions, we
                        employ sulphate of soda 9, and nitrate of lead 25∙75∙, that is to say, if we
                        employ five parts of nitrate of lead more than is sufficient for the
                        purpose, we shall have exactly the same decomposition as before. But the
                        five of excess of nitrate of lead will rema'ņ in solution mixed with the
                        nitrate of soda. These will be precipitated as before—sulphate of lead 19;
                        and there will remain in solution nitrate of soda 10∙75, and nitrate of lead
                        5. The phenomena are precisely the same as before. The additional five of
                        nitrate of lead has occasioned no alteration. The decomposition has gone on
                        just as if they had not been present.</p><p>Now, the phenomenon which drew the particular attention of Wentzel is, that
                        if the salts were neutral before being mixed, the neutrality was not
                        affected by the decomposition which took place on their mixture. A saltis
                        said to be neutral when it neither possesses the character of an acid nor an
                        alkali. Acids <hi rend="italic">redden</hi> vegetable blues, while alkalies
                        render them <hi rend="italic">green.</hi> A neutral salt possesses no effect
                        whatever on vegetable blues. This observation of Wentzel is very important.
                        It is obvious that the salts, after their decomposition, could not have
                        remained neutral, unless the elements of the two salts had been such that
                        the bases in each just saturated the acids in either of the salts. The
                        constituents of the two salts are as follows:—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>9 suphate of soda, ∙j</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5 sulphuric acid.</p><p>1 4 soda.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>20*75 nitrate of lead, J</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>∣6*75 nitric acid.

                        fourteen oxide of lead; while 6∙75 nitric just saturate the same quantities
                        of each of these bases. Thus the saturating powers of soda and oxide of lead
                        are to each other as 4 to 14; while the saturating powers of sulphuric and
                        nitric acids are to each other as 5 to 6 ’ 75.</p><p>In the year 1792 another labourer in the same department of chemistry
                        appeared. This was Jeremiah Benjamin Richter, a Prussian chemist, who died
                        in the prime of life in the year 1807. In 1792 lie published a work entitled
                        <hi rend="italic">Anfangsgründe der Stochiometrie</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">oder</hi><hi rend="italic">Messkunsi</hi><hi rend="italic">Chymischer Elemente,</hi> Elements of Stochiometry, or the
                        Mathematics of the Chemical Elements. ∙ A second and third volume of this
                        work appeared in 1793, and a fourth in 1794. The object of the book was a
                        rigid analysis of the different salts, founded on the fact just mentioned,
                        that when two salts decompose each other, the salts newly formed are neutral
                        as well as those which have been decomposed. He took up the subject nearly
                        in the same way as Wentzel had done, but advanced much farther, and
                        endeavoured to determine the capacity of saturation of each acid and base,
                        and to attach numbers to each, indicating the weights which mutually
                        saturate each other. He gave the whole subject a mathematical dress, and
                        endeavoured to show that the same relation existed between the numbers
                        representing the capacity of saturation of these bodies, as does between
                        certain classes of figurative numbers. When we strip the subject of the
                        mystical form under which he presented it, the labours of Richter may be
                        exhibited under the two following tables, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351592" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1592-0353"/> which
                        represent the capacity of saturation of the acids and bases, according to

                        will, according to Richter, be exactly saturated by the weight of each base
                        put after it in the second column. Thus 1000 grains of sulphuric acid will
                        be saturated by 525 grains of alumina, 615 of magnesia, 672 of ammonia, 793

                        its name in the second column will be just saturated by the weight of each
                        acid placed after its name in the first column. Thus 793 parts of lime will
                        be just saturated by 427 parts of fluoric acid, 577 of carbonic acid, 706 of
                        sebacie acid, and so on.</p><p>Richter’s labours in this important field produced as little attention as
                        those of Wentzel. Indeed, as his experiments were far from accurate, and his
                        numbers not exact, the accuracy of his principles was not at first sight
                        perceptible. However, his views were not altogether overlooked. They were
                        appreciated by Berzelius, who devoted several years to put them to the test
                        of experiment, and who was at last able, by gradually bringing the analysis
                        of the salts nearer and nearer to perfection, to see the justice of the
                        principle which Richter had spent his life in endeavouring to establish.</p><p>Mr Dalton of Manchester had laid the foundation of the high reputation which
                        he has so justly obtained by his papers <hi rend="italic">on Vapour,</hi>
                        published in the Memoirs of the Literary Society of Manchester in the year
                        1802. Soon after this, probably as early as 1803, he began to speculate
                        respecting the nature of the ultimate elements of bodies. He had been
                        occupied in determining the composition of the two gases distinguished by
                        the names of <hi rend="italic">carburetted hydrogen</hi> and olefiant gas.
                        He observed, that for complete combustion they require different but
                        determinate quantities of oxygen gas. A volume of carburetted hydrogen
                        requires for complete combustion two volumes, while a volume of olefiant gas
                        requires three volumes of oxygen gas. When one volume of carburetted
                        hydrogen is burnt, there is formed just one volume of carbonic acid gas; but
                        when a volume of olefiant gas is burnt, there are formed two volumes of
                        carbonic acid gas, or double the former quantity. Now, carbonic acid is a
                        compound of oxygen and carbon. The oxygen gas supplies the first of these,
                        and the inflammable gases the second. It is clear from the experiment, that
                        the quantity of carbon in a voluμιe of olefiant gas is just twice as great
                        as that in a volmńe of'carburetted hydrogen. It had been shown by Lavoisier
                        that carbonic acid’gas contains just its own bulk of oxygen ġäs. It is
                        evident from this that one of the two volumes of oxygen gas employed in the
                        combustion of carburettćd hydrbgěn went tb the formation of carbonic acid;
                        wliilé tŵb of the three volumes employed in the combustion of'olefiant gas
                        went to’ the same purpose.</p><p>There remained in each combustion one volume of oxygen gas, which was
                        employed in uniting to hydrogen contained in each gas, and in forming water.
                        Now, as the quantity of oxygen necessary to convert the hydrogen into water
                        is the same in each, it is clear that a volume of each gas contains exactly
                        the same quantity of hydrogen. In this way did Mr Dalton, with much
                        sagacity, demonstrate that a volume of carburetted hydrogen gas and of
                        olefiant gas contains each the same weight of hydrogen; but that the weight
                        of carbon in the latter gas is just double that in the former.</p><p>This led him to attend to the nature of the ultimate particles of bodies; and
                        he concluded, with the ancients, that they consisted of <hi rend="italic">atoms</hi> incapable of further diminution or division. It was known
                        already, that when bodies unite chemically, it is the ultimate particles or
                        atoms that unite. And he concluded (very naturally), from the facts above
                        stated respecting the combustion of the two inflammable gases, that
                        carburetted hydrogen is a compound of one atom hydrogen and one atom carbon;
                        while olefiant gas is a compound of one atom hydrogen and two atoms carbon.
                        He inferred further, that every atom of a body (viewed along with its
                        atmosphere of heat) is a sphere. He represented an atom of hydrogen by the
                        symbol Θ (a circle with a dot in the centre), and an atom of carbon by the
                        symbol @ (a circle blackened in the inside); and he denoted an integrant
                        particle of the two gases in the following manner :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carburetted hydrogen..</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.... ©©.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Olefiant gas:</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>..·©·.</p></cell></row></table><p>The former is a binary compound, or a compound of <hi rend="italic">two</hi>

                        gave Mr Dalton’s opinions so much clearness. Oxygen was represented by O (a
                        circle); azote by φ (a circle with a vertical diameter). The composition of
                        several of the best-known bodies was represented by him as follows :—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Water O ©</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>a binary compound.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Nitrous gas O(D</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>a binary compound.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Ammonia (D©</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>a binary compound.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbonic acid..

                        weights of the atoms of the simple bodies. For example, Dalton concluded
                        from his experiments, that carburetted hydrogen is composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>while olefiant gas is composed of</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>10</p></cell></row></table><p>Now, as the former gas is a compound of one atom of hydrogen and one atom of
                        carbon, it follows that the weights of the atoms of hydrogen and carbon are
                        to each other as the numbers one to five. If, therefore, we represent the
                        weight of the atom of hydrogen by one, that of carbon will be five.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="2" role="data" rows="1"><p>If water be a compound of</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8</p></cell></row></table><p>then (if its symbol be Ο Θ) it is clear, that if the atom of hydrogen be

                        ratios of the weight) of the atoms of all the simple bodies may be
                        determined by an accurate analysis of the compound bodies formed by the
                        union of these simple bodies.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193351605" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1605-0354"/><p>When Mr Dallon first started the atomic theory, it was not possible to
                        determine the weights with any thing like an approach to accuracy, because
                        at that time chemistry did not possess a single analysis which could be
                        considered as even approaching to accuracy. We need not be surprised then
                        that Mr Dalton’s first numbers were not exact. It required infinite
                        sagacity, and not a little labour, to come so near the truth as he did. In
                        consequence of this state of the science, neither the importance nor the
                        truths of the theory were at first appreciated; and several chemists, from
                        whom better things might have been expected, refused to admit it, and even
                        turned the whole doctrine into ridicule. It may be sufficient to mention Sir
                        Humphry Davy, who expressed himself very strongly at first in opposition to
                        the atomic theory.</p><p>The first direct proofs in favour of the theory were advanced by Dr
                        Wollaston, who showed the existence of three salts composed of oxalic acid
                        and potash, the oxalate, binoxalate, and quateroxalate. In these, if the
                        quantity of potash be reekoned unity, that of oxalic acid will be
                        respectively one, two, and four. Hence he concluded, that oxalate of potash
                        is a compound of 1 atom potash + 1 atom oxalic acid; binoxalate, of 1 atom
                        potash + 2 atoms oxalic acid; and quateroxalate, of 1 atom potash + 4 atoms
                        oxalic acid. He showed also that carbonic acid and potash unite in two
                        proportions, forming carbonate and bicarbonate of potash; the former
                        composed of 1 atom potash + 1 atom carbonic acid, and the latter of 1 atom
                        potash + 2 atoms carbonic acid. About the same time Dr Thomson showed that*
                        there are two oxalates of strontian, the oxalate and binoxalate, the former
                        composed of 1 atom strontian + 1 atom oxalic acid, and the second of 1 atom
                        strontian and 2 atoms of oxalic acid. Some years after, M. Berzelius brought
                        forward a great many examples, and fully confirmed the great principle of
                        Richter. It was easy to apply this principle to the atomic theory of Dalton,
                        and to show that it was merely a case of this theory. In consequence of
                        these confirmations the atomic theory gradually gained ground, and was at
                        last universally adopted by chemists. But it was adopted with two different
                        modifications.</p><p>In the year 1809 M. Gay-Lussac published, in the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">dArcueil,</hi> a paper on the
                        union of the gaseous bodies with each other. In this paper he shows that the
                        proportions in which the gases unite with each other are of the simplest
                        kind, one volume of one gas either combining with one volume of another, or
                        with two volumes, or with half a volume. The atomic theory of Dalton had
                        been opposed with considerable keenness by Berthollet, in an introduction
                        which lie prefixed to the French translation of Dr Thomson’s system of
                        chemistry. Nor was this opposition to be wondered at, because it was evident
                        that its admission would overturn the opinions which Berthollet had laboured
                        to establish in his <hi rend="italic">Chemicμl Statics.</hi> The object of
                        Gay-Lussac’s paper was to confirm and establish the atomic theory, by
                        exhibiting it in a new point of view. Nothing can be more ingenious than his
                        mode of treating the subject, or more complete than the proofs which lie
                        brings forward in support of it. It had been already established that water
                        is formed by the union of one volume of oxygen with two volumes of hydrogen
                        gas. Gay-Lussac found by experiment that one volume of muriatic acid gas is
                        just saturated by one volume of ammoniacal gas. Fluoboric acid unites in two
                        proportions with ammoniacal gas; one volume of the acid gas with one and
                        with two volumes of the alkaline gas. Carbonic acid gas and ammoniacal gas
                        unite also in two similar proportions. M. A. Berthollet had proved that
                        ammonia is a compound of one volume of azotic and three volumes of hydrogen
                        gas; and Gay-Lussac had shown that sulphuric acid is a compound of one
                        volume of sulphurous acid gas and half a volume of oxygen gas. He showed
                        further, that the compounds of azote and oxygen are composed as follows:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Azotic.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygen.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Protoxide of azote....</p></cell><cell cols="2" role="data" rows="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Deutoxide of azote...</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 ...</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>+ 1 ...</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Nitrous acid</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 ...</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>+ 2 ...</p></cell></row></table><p>He showed also, that when two gases, after combining, remain in the gaseous
                        state, the diminution of volume is either 0, or ļ, or</p><p>The constancy of these proportions left no doubt that the combinations of all
                        gaseous bodies were definite. The theory of Dalton applies to them with
                        great facility. We have only to consider a volume of gas to represent an
                        atom, and then we see that in gases one atom of one gas combines either with
                        one, two, or three atoms of another gas, and never, or very seldom, with
                        more.</p><p>In this country chemists have in general adopted the simple theory of Dalton.
                        But Berzelius has founded his notions of the atomic theory upon the doctrine
                        of volumes of Gay-Lussac; and this view of the subject has been generally
                        embraced on the Continent. The principal difference between the two views
                        consists in the composition of water. Whenever hydrogen and oxygen gas are
                        burnt, in what proportion soever they are mixed, they form water; and they
                        cannot be made to unite directly in any other proportion. This induced
                        Dalton to consider water as a compound of one atom oxygen and one atom
                        hydrogen. But water being composed by weight of eight parts of oxygen and
                        one part of hydrogen, it follows from this, that the atom of oxygen is eight
                        times heavier than the atom of hydrogen. On the other hand, water is formed
                        by the union of two volumes of hydrogen with one volume of oxygen gas.
                        Hence, if we consider a volume of a gas as in all cases equivalent to an
                        atom, it will follow that water is a compound of two atoms of hydrogen and
                        one atom of oxygen. This would make an atom of oxygen sixteen times heavier
                        than an atom of hydrogen. Thus, we have two different atomic weights for
                        hydrogen, one adopted in Great Britain, and another on the Continent. Nor
                        has it yet been decided by decisive arguments which of these two views is
                        correct. Analogy is in favour of the view taken by British chemists; but
                        further investigations ' will be necessary, and more knowledge of the
                        subject must be obtained, before a final decision can be made.</p><p>Though chemists have agreed to consider all those bodies which they have been
                        unable to decompose as simple, yet by that term they do not mean to
                        insinuate that they are absolutely simple, but merely that, relative to our
                        state of knowledge, they cannot be reduced into simpler constituents. It is
                        by no means impossible that the <hi rend="italic">metals</hi> themselves may
                        be compounds. But as no one has hitherto succeeded in decomposing them, or
                        has been able to produce any plausible evidence of their being compounds, we
                        are obliged to consider them as simple. Succeeding chemists may in progress
                        of time be more fortunate than we are, and may be able to show that they are
                        all compounds. When this happens, a new set of simple bodies will come into
                        view, of which at present we have no notion.</p><p>To the ultimate integrant part of those bodies which we consider as simple,
                        we apply the term <hi rend="italic">atoms</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                        the weights (or rather the ratios of the weights) of these atoms have been
                        determined in numbers. Thus an atom of copper weighs 4, an atom of iron 3∙5,
                        and an atom of lead 13. Should it be discovered hereafter that these metals
                        are compounds of two ingredients, it is clear that the atomic weight of
                        these two ingredients must be such that their <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351618" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1618-0355"/> sum will
                        be equal to the present atomic weight of the metal. Thus, for example, the
                        atomic weight of potash is 6. For a long period potash was considered as a
                        simple body, till Davy ascertained that it is a compound of potassium and
                        oxygen. The atom of potassium weighs 5, and that of oxygen is 1. Now 5 + 1 =
                        6, the atomic weight of potash.</p><p>These observations are sufficient to show the probability that all our atoms
                        are compounds. Hence it is conceivable that they may admit of subdivision.
                        This makes the existence of half atoms and thirds of atoms, which we are
                        obliged to admit occasionally, cease to be an absurdity. Indeed, from some
                        facts that have of late come into view, it is not unlikely that the atoms of
                        simple substances may usually appear united in groups of two, three, or more
                        atoms. Hence what we call an atom may probably be a congeries of two or more
                        atoms. Should this be the case, the existence of half or a third of an atom
                        would no longer be problematical. We shall find that oxygen, water, and even
                        hydrogen, not unfrequently combine to the amount of half an atom or the
                        third of an atom.</p><p>Having thus finished our historical sketch of the progress of chemistry, it
                        is now time to enter upon a detail of the great collection of facts which
                        constitute the body of the science. For the sake of perspicuity we shall
                        divide the subject into four parts. In the first part we shall treat of the
                        <hi rend="italic">laws of combination and decomposition</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in the second, of the chemistry of <hi rend="italic">inorganic bodies</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in the third, of the
                        chemistry of <hi rend="italic">vegetable bodies</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in the fourth, of the chemistry of <hi rend="italic">animal
                        bodies. Of</hi> these four parts, the second, in the present state of the
                        science, is most important, and must therefore be treated most in
                        detail.</p></div><div type="section"><head>PART I.</head><p>OF THE LAWS OF CHEMICAL COMBINATION AND DECOMPOSITION.</p><p>1. When bodies uñite chemically, it is the atoms or ultimate particles of
                        each which combine; not large masses of matter. Thus, when copper combines
                        with oxygen, it is converted into a black powder called oxide of copper. How
                        small soever the quantity of this black powder which we examine, we shall
                        find in it both copper and oxygen. This oxide is formed by the union of an
                        atom of copper with an atom of oxygen.</p><p>2. Now the atoms of bodies are small to a degree of which we can form no
                        adequate conception. Gold leaf is beat out so thin, that 50∙7 square inches
                        of it weight only one grain. Now the 1000th part of a line or inch is easily
                        visible through a common pocket-glass. A square inch of gold therefore is
                        divisible into a million of parts, each visible through a common microscope.
                        Hence it follows, that when gold is reduced to the thinness of gold leaf,
                        yōTüo'īľōōth °f <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> g <hi rend="superscript">
                        ra</hi> i∏ of gold may be distinguished by the eye. But Reaumur has shown
                        that one grain of gold of the thinness which it is upon silver wire, will
                        cover an area of 1400 square inches. It is plain that in this case
                        rrōüōľmTōō^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> °f <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                        grain of gold may be rendered visible. But small as this particle is, we
                        have no reason for believing that it does not constitute a considerable
                        number of atoms.</p><p>3. But small as these atoms are, the ratios of their weight to each other
                        have been determined with considerable exactness. The weight of the atom,
                        together with the specific gravity of a body, enables us to determine its
                        relative volume. In this way may the volumes of the atoms of different
                        bodies be determined. The following table exhibits these bulks, that of
                        carbon being reckoned one.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Bulk of Atoms·</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Bulk of Atoms.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Tungsten ļ</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Nickel 1</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙75</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Bismuth</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Cobalt J</p><p>Manganese )</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Mercury</p><p>Tin ∣</p><p>Sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>9</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Iron J</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Selenium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>- 5∙4</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Platinum 1</p><p>Palladium j</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙6</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Lead</p><p>Gold</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Zinc</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙75</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Silver</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p><hi rend="italic">r</hi> 6</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Rhodium )</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Osmium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Tellurium .</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Chromium )</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>„ Q∙⅛⅛</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Molybdenum..</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙25</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Azote</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Silica I</p><p>Titanium J</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙5</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Chlorine</p><p>Uranium ....</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>13-5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Cadmium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙75</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Columbium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>ļ- 14</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Arsenic )</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Sodium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Phosphorus &gt;

We have no means of determining the shape of these atoms, but the most
                        commonly received opinion is that they are spherical, or at least
                        spheroidal.</p><p>5. When the atoms of two different bodies unite, the compound which they form
                        differs so much in its properties from the constituents, that we could form
                        no notion whatever what these constituents are. Thus, <hi rend="italic">water</hi> bears no resemblance whatever to either of its constituents, <hi rend="italic">oxygen</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hydrogen</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> nor <hi rend="italic">saltpetre</hi> to its
                        constituents, <hi rend="italic">nitric acid</hi> and <hi rend="italic">potash.</hi></p><p>6. When bodies combine chemically, the union is always accompanied by a
                        change of temperature. Sometimes the temperature sinks, but in by far the
                        greater number of cases it rises.</p><p>7. When two substances unite chemically, the bulk of the compound is very
                        seldom exactly the same as that of its constituents. In most cases the bulk
                        diminishes, in a few cases it increases, and in some rare instances no
                        alteration in bulk whatever takes place. One volume of azotic, and half a
                        volume of oxygen gas united, constitute only one volume of protoxide of
                        azote. When copper and gold are melted together, the bulk of the compound is
                        greater than that of the two constituents before their union; 916⅛ cubic
                        inches of gold and 83j∙ of copper, after union, become 1029 cubic inches,
                        instead of 1000, which was their bulk before combination. Finally, one
                        volume of azotic and one volume of oxygen gas united, constitute two volumes
                        of deutoxide of azote; so that no alteration of bulk whatever has taken
                        place.</p><p>8. When bodies are chemically united with each other, we cannot separate them
                        again by filtration, or any mechanical means whatever. Heat sometimes
                        enables us to produce a separation, but in the greater number of cases this
                        expedient is quite unsuccessful. When a volatile substance is united to
                        another which is more fixed, it cannot be again separated so easily by
                        applying heat as we might be led to expect from our knowledge of the
                        difference between the volatility of the two constituents. Sulphuric acid
                        does not boil till heated above 600°, while water boils at 212°. But a
                        mixture of sulphuric acid and water does not boil till much hotter than
                        212°; and what is driven off by boiling is not water, but a compound of
                        sulphuric acid and water.</p><p>9. It is therefore impossible, in the greater number of cases, to separate
                        substances that have been combined,, either by mechanical means or by the
                        application of heat.' But by multiplying experiments in the way of mixture,
                        a, discovery has been made which has been of infinite use to-chemists, and
                        has greatly enlarged their power over compounds<pb break="no" facs="nls:193351631" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1631-0356"/>. It has
                        been found that the addition of some third body to a compound of two
                        ingredients which are strongly united by chemical combination, will in many
                        cases dispose them to separate from each other. The third body unites to one
                        of the constituents of the compound, and sets the other constituent at
                        liberty. Thus, if we add potash in the requisite quantity to a compound of
                        sulphuric acid and water, it will combine with the acid, and set the water
                        at liberty. If we now apply heat, the water may be distilled off pure, while
                        sulphate of potash remains behind. The whole art of chemistry consists in
                        forming compounds by uniting different bodies with each other; and he is the
                        best and most skilful chemist who knows what third body will answer to
                        effect the decomposition which he has in view.</p><p>10. The phenomena of combination and decomposition were at first explained by
                        chemists by the application of supposed mechanical powers. When a fluid has
                        the property of dissolving a solid body, it was supposed to abound in sharp
                        and pointed particles, having the form of needles or wedges, which were
                        agitated in the fluid with a rapid and confused intestine motion. The solid
                        again was supposed to contain pores of such sizes and shapes as were fitted
                        to the pointed particles of the fluid. These pores were penetrated by the
                        fluid, and the solid torn asunder. The precipitating bodies again were
                        supposed to be porous and spongy; and by this configuration, and by a
                        confused motion, they break the spiculae of the solvent, and thus allow the
                        solid again to fall down. This explanation is so crude and unsatisfactory,
                        that it is not entitled to the honour of a refutation.</p><p>11. The first attempt at a rational explanation of chemical combination was
                        by Sir Isaac Newton. He had demonstrated that the planets are retained in
                        their orbits by the <hi rend="italic">attraction of gravitation.</hi> He
                        conceived that there are other forces or principles of motion in nature, by
                        which certain bodies act, or appear to act, at sensible distances from each
                        other. This is the case with the attractions and repulsions connected with
                        <hi rend="italic">electricity</hi> and <hi rend="italic">magnetism.</hi> He
                        suspected that there are still other forces whose sphere of action is
                        confined to the ultimate particles or atoms of bodies. <hi rend="italic">Capillary attraction,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">inflection</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">deflection</hi> of light, are examples of such actions.
                        Chemical combinations and decompositions, in his opinion, depend upon powers
                        somewhat resembling the others. He was of opinion that the ultimate
                        particles of certain bodies attract each other with a certain unknown but
                        enormous force, <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> which begins to exert itself
                        only at very minute distances. Hence, when such bodies are mixed, the
                        particles of each being brought within the requisite distance, this force
                        exerts itself, and the bodies unite. The decomposition produced by a third
                        body he ascribes to the superiority of the attraction of this third body for
                        one of the constituents of the compound, in consequence of which it unites
                        with that constituent, and separates the other which was previously in
                        combination.</p><p>These views of Newton made their way into the science very slowly; but before
                        the middle of the eighteenth century they seem to have been almost
                        universally adopted. Chemists, however, instead of the term <hi rend="italic">attraction</hi> employed by Newton, substituted <hi rend="italic">affinity,</hi> first introduced into chemistry by Dr Hook, and
                        caught with avidity by the chemists on the Continent. By <hi rend="italic">chemical affinity</hi> then is meant that unknown force which causes the
                        ultimate particles of different bodies to unite together, and to remain
                        united.</p><p>As soon as the Newtonian notions of affinity were adopted by chemists, they
                        naturally concluded, that when a compound <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> was
                        decomposed by the body <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> which combined with <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> disengaging <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> this was because
                        c had a stronger affinity for <hi rend="italic">b</hi> than <hi rend="italic">a</hi> had. <hi rend="italic">Decomposition</hi> therefore
                        came to be considered as the measure of the strength of affinity. In the
                        year 1718, M. Geoffroy, senior, thought of arranging bodies in the order in
                        which they separate each other from a given substance. Bodies thus arranged
                        were considered as exhibiting the order of the affinity of the respective
                        bodies for the substance with which they united; that body being placed
                        highest which had the strongest affinity, or was capable of displacing all
                        the others. The rest of the bodies were placed in the.order of their
                        affinity. The following little table will show the nature of Geoffroy’s
                        method.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sulphuric Acid.</hi></p><p>Barytes. Soda.</p><p>Strontian. Lime. Potash.</p><p>Magnesia.</p><p>All the substances in the table combine, or have an affinity, for <hi rend="italic">sulphuric</hi> acid. If <hi rend="italic">magnesia,</hi> which
                        is at the bottom of the table, be united to sulphuric acid, the addition of
                        lime, soda, potash, or any of the substances in the table, will separate it.
                        Lime will be separated by any of the substances except magnesia; potash will
                        be separated by barytes or strontian, but not by soda, lime, or magnesia.
                        Barytes, which stands highest, will be separated by none, while it separates
                        all below it. In short, every substance in the table is capable of
                        separating sulphuric acid from all the bodies placed below it, but not from
                        those placed above it.</p><p>The tables of Geoffroy were necessarily very imperfect, but they were
                        successively improved by Gellert, Lim∙∙ bourg, &amp;c.; and in 1775 a very
                        copious table of <hi rend="italic">elective attractions,</hi> as he termed
                        <hi rend="italic">affinity,</hi> was published by Bergman. This work of
                        Bergman appears to have fixed the opinions of chemists in general to his own
                        views of the subject. According to him, the affinity of each of the bodies
                        <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d,</hi> &amp;c. for <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                        differs in intensity in such a manner that the intensity of the affinity of
                        each may be expressed by numbers. He was of opinion also that affinity is
                        elective, in consequence of which, if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> have a
                        greater affinity for <hi rend="italic">x</hi> than <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                        has, if we present <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to the compound <hi rend="italic">bx, x</hi> separates altogether from <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                        and unites to ű.</p><p>These opinions of Bergman continued to be admitted till Berthollet published
                        his <hi rend="italic">Clιemical Statics</hi> in 1803. He considered <hi rend="italic">affinity</hi> as an attraction similar to that which exists
                        between the planetary bodies. But in consequence of the very small distance
                        between the attracting bodies, the strength of affinity depends not merely
                        upon the quantity of matter which they contain, but likewise upon their
                        shape. Affinity being an attraction, must always produce combination; and
                        its strength must increase with the mass of the attracting body. According
                        to this doctrine of Berthollet, affinity is not elective. A substance which
                        has a stronger affinity is not capable of separating those which have a
                        weaker affinity; or, if this happens, some other cause intervenes. It will
                        be acknowledged that Berthollet was successful in overturning Bergman’s
                        notions of <hi rend="italic">elective attraction</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for Bergman’s explanation, why a body having a stronger affinity is
                        capable of displacing one having a weaker affinity, is not satisfactory.</p><p>But Berthollet’s own views were not more solid than those of Bcrgman. He
                        denied that bodies united in definite proportions’, but affirmed that they
                        were capable of combining in all proportions whatever. This occasioned a
                        controversy between him and Proust, in which the latter was obviously
                        victorious.</p><p>The electrical theory, first started by Sir H. Davy, has <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351644" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1644-0357"/> enabled us
                        at last to form some idea of the way in which one substance is capable of
                        displacing another. <hi rend="italic">Oxygen, chlorine, bromine,</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">iodine,</hi> are always in a <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> state; while the other simple bodies are <hi rend="italic">positive.</hi> Hence the reason why these four bodies have a tendency to
                        combine with all the others. Potassium is strongly <hi rend="italic">positive,</hi> while oxygen is strongly <hi rend="italic">negative.</hi>
                        Hence the strong affinity which exists between these two bodies, and the
                        difficulty of decomposing them when united. If a current of chlorine gas be
                        passed through hot potash (which is a compound of potassium and oxygen), the
                        oxygen is disengaged in the state of gas, and the chlorine unites to the
                        potassium in its place. This decomposition is brought about by the agency of
                        two forces. Chlorine, like oxygen, is negative. It is therefore attracted by
                        potassium and repelled by oxygen. The heat acts partly perhaps by
                        diminishing the cohesion that exists between the particles of potash, but
                        chiefly by exalting the negative energy of the chlorine. This energy, when
                        increased by heat, is greater than that of oxygen. Hence its attraction for
                        potassium must exceed that of.oxygen for the same base. It therefore takes
                        the place of the oxygen; and the mutual repulsion between chlorine and
                        oxygen, together with the elasticity of the oxygen, is sufficient to cause
                        that principle to fly off and make its escape.</p><p>The reason why many bodies require a red heat before they combine, and why,
                        when raised to that temperature, they unite with great energy, may be
                        conceived from the data furnished by the electric theory of affinity. Let us
                        take the case of oxygen and hydrogen gases.' The former of these bodies is
                        negative, and the latter positive. They have therefore a strong attraction;
                        but this attraction is not sufficient to overcome the mutual elasticity of
                        the two gases, occasioned probably by an atmosphere of heat surrounding the
                        atoms of each. But a red heat exalts the electric energies of both so much
                        that they are enabled to overcome the resistance occasioned by the
                        elasticity of the gases, and in consequence to combine together.</p><p>To what circumstance the negative state of oxygen, chlorine, bromine, and
                        iodine, and the positive state of the other simple bodies, is owing, cannot
                        be explained. Were we to admit, with electricians in general, that negative
                        and positive electricity constitute two distinct fluids, it would follow
                        that a coating of negative electricity must be deposited on the surface of
                        the particles of the <hi rend="italic">simple supporters,</hi> while a
                        coating of positive electricity is deposited on the surface of the other
                        simple bodies. These electricities arc attached to the respective bodies in
                        a way which we cannot at present explain; but from the well-known phenomena
                        of electricity, it can scarcely be doubted that the electricities are not
                        inseparably attached, but capable of being increased or diminished according
                        to the laws which bodies follow with regard to electricity. Hence it happens
                        that a substance may be in one electrical state when compared with one body,
                        and in another electrical state when compared with another. In oxygen there
                        is a great preponderancy of negative electricity; it is negative with
                        respect to every other body. Sulphur is negative with regard to most bodies,
                        but it is obviously not so powerfully negative as oxygen. Let us suppose an
                        atom of sulphur to be placed within a very small distance of an atom of
                        oxygen. We know that the two electricities will act on each other. The
                        negative electricity of the oxygen atom will repel the negative electricity
                        of the sulphur; and as an atom of oxygen is almost twice the size of an atom
                        of sulphur, and contains a much greater quantity of negative electricity, it
                        is evident that it will act with greater energy. A portion of the negative
                        electricity of the sulphur will be driven off, while the positive
                        electricity will accumulate in it, in consequence of the attraction
                        exercised on it by the negative* electricity of the oxygen. Positive
                        electricity will accumulate in the sulphur, and negative electricity will
                        diminish. This will of course render it positive, though, before the action
                        of the oxygen on it, it had been negative. In consequence of these two
                        different states, the two atoms combine, and the attraction subsisting
                        between the two electricities will prevent any alteration in their state as
                        long as they remain united. Thus we may conceive how an atom may be positive
                        when it combines with one body, and negative when it combines with another.
                        Hence the reason why oxygen is capable of combining with the other
                        supporters, and why the different positive bodies are capable of uniting
                        with each other. Thus sulphur and phosphorus unite with the metals, and the
                        different metals with each other.</p><p>Salts are composed of an acid united to an alkali, usually atom to atom; and
                        it is generally observed that they∣ are more difficult of decomposition than
                        the acids and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> bases of which they are
                        constituted when in an insulated state. Thus sulphuric acid is decomposable
                        at a red heat; but sulphate of potash may be exposed to a red heat without
                        undergoing any alteration. The reason of this increase of permanence is
                        probably owing to the way in which the constituents combine. The acid being
                        composed of two constituents, one of which is positive and the other
                        negative, may be represented thus, -∣ . The alkaline base being similarly
                        composed, may be represented by the same symbol, 1-. Now there can be little
                        doubt that the acid and base, when combined, will arrange themselves
                        thus,</p><p>+ - l·</p><p>That is to say, the positive ingredient of the one will attach itself to the
                        negative ingredient of the other. Thus every negative body will be placed
                        between two positive, and every positive between two negative—a situation
                        which ought to increase the firmness and steadiness of the compound.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">black</hi> or <hi rend="italic">gray</hi> oxide of
                        manganese employed for ob- taining oxygen and chlorine, is a compound of one
                        atom? of manganese and two atoms of oxygen. When strong? sulphuric acid is
                        poured over this compound, one half of <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> the
                        oxygen of the oxide is disengaged, and makes its escape in the gaseous form,
                        while the sulphuric acid unites with protoxide of manganese, and forms a
                        sulphate of manganese. To account for this curious decomposition, it may be
                        observed, in the first place, that manganese is the most <hi rend="italic">positive</hi> of all the metals. Hence it is capable of uniting with and
                        condensing into a solid no fewer than three atoms of oxygen, although the
                        size of an atom of oxygen is more than four times as great as that of an
                        atom of manganese. When manganese is united with only one atom of oxygen, it
                        still retains its positive nature so strongly as to possess powerful
                        alkaline qualities, and to be capable of uniting with and neutralizing the
                        different acids. But when it has combined with three atoms of oxygen, it has
                        become negative, and possesses the characters of an acid. Hence three atoms
                        of oxygen are more than capable of neutralizing an atom of manganese. Even
                        the gray oxide (containing two atoms of oxygen united to one atom of
                        manganese), though nearly neutral, rather leans to an acid than a base, as
                        it is capable of uniting indefinite proportions with barytes and lime. But
                        the second atom of oxygen cannot be retained by the manganese with the same
                        force as the first atom.</p><p>Sulphuric acid is a compound of one atom of sulphur and three atoms of
                        oxygen. The oxygen is obviously not neutralized by the sulphur, for the
                        compound possesses strong acid properties. Here then we have two bodies
                        brought into contact, containing both oxygen in considerable<pb break="no" facs="nls:193351657" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1657-0358"/> quantity,
                        and not neutralized by the bases with which it is combined. The oxygen in
                        both being highly negative, it is obvious that the atoms of it must repel
                        each other. The volume of the sulphur atom, being much larger than that of
                        the atom of manganese, acts with most energy in retaining the oxygen. The
                        protoxide of manganese being positive, will be attracted by the sulphuric
                        acid, while the second atom of oxygen united to the manganese will be
                        repelled by the oxygen in the acid, and even by the other atom of oxygen
                        united to the manganese. It will therefore be expelled, and sulphate of
                        manganese formed.</p><p>It may be asked why the same decomposition of gray oxide of manganese does
                        not take place when nitric acid is poured over it. The reason seems to be,
                        that the azote, the atom of which is of the same size with that of oxygen,
                        more completely neutralizes the oxygen in the nitric acid. It does not
                        therefore act with so much energy in repelling the oxygen united to the
                        manganese; but that it acts is evident, because when a little sugar is added
                        to the mixture, the second atom of oxygen in the oxide combines with carbon,
                        and the nitric acid immediately forms a nitrate of manganese.</p><p>Chlorine decomposes lime, or oxidc of calcium as it may be called, because,
                        when assisted by heat, it becomes more negative than oxygen: it therefore
                        repels the oxygen, and attracts the calcium; and these two forces acting
                        together arc sufficiently strong to expel the oxygen from the calcium, and
                        enable the chlorine to take its place. When a body is applied to a binary
                        compound which is capable of combining with both its constituents, it seldom
                        fails to produce decomposition, though it would not have been able to have
                        effected it had it been capable of uniting only with one of the
                        constituents. For example, when charcoal heated to redness is placed in
                        contact with steam, it decomposes that fluid, though hydrogen, being more
                        strongly positive than carbon, ought not to be disengaged from oxygen by
                        that substance. The reason of the disengagement is, that the charcoal
                        combines both with the oxygen and the hydrogen of the water, to the one
                        being positive, and to the other negative. It is for the same reason that
                        oxygen is capable of decomposing many sulphurets, while sulphur equally
                        decomposes many oxides.</p><p>When two neutral saline solutions are mixed, we would naturally expect that
                        the two salts should unite together and form a double salt. This frequently
                        happens. But often also they show no tendency to unite; and when the mixed
                        saline solution is evaporated, the two salts crystallize separately.</p><p>The tables which originated with Geoffroy, and which Bergman improved so
                        much, instead of being called tables of affinity, should be considered as
                        merely representing the order of decomposition. And if the order of
                        decomposition were regular and unvaried, such tables would be of
                        considerable utility. The order of decomposition seems to be intimately
                        connected with the electric state of the respective bodies. The reason why
                        it varies seems to be, that the electrical state of a body is susceptible of
                        variation according to the temperature, being exalted by heat and depressed
                        by cold. The following table exhibits the non-metallic bodies in the order

                        atmosphere. It was discovered by Dr Priestley on the 1st of August 1774, and
                        called by him <hi rend="italic">deplilogisticated air</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> Scheele discovered it before 1775, and called <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">tempyreal</hi> air; Condorcet gave it the name of
                        <hi rend="italic">vital</hi> air; and Lavoisier (from a plausible but
                        erroneous hypothesis) contrived the term <hi rend="italic">oxygen,</hi> by
                        which it is now generally known. By <hi rend="italic">oxygen</hi> he meant
                        the <hi rend="italic">generator</hi> or <hi rend="italic">producer of
                        adds.</hi></p><p>It may be obtained by exposing black oxide of manganese in fine powder to a
                        red heat in an iron bottle, to which a metallic tube with a joint is fixed
                        air-tight, in order to convey it to the proper <hi rend="italic">gas-holders,</hi> which may be either copper vessels or glass jars filled
                        with water, standing inverted on the shelf of the pneumatic trough. It may
                        be obtained also by mixing strong sulphuric acid with black oxide of
                        manganese in a glass retort, and applying the heat of a lamp to the mixture.
                        The purest oxygen gas of all is obtained by putting about an ounce of <hi rend="italic">chlorate of j)otash</hi> into a very small green glass retort
                        with a long beak, and heating it to redness over a charcoal fire. The salt
                        melts, and yields pure oxygen gas in great abundance.</p><p>i. Oxygen gas is colourless, destitute of taste and smell, and possessed of
                        all the mechanical properties of atmospherical air. Its specific gravity is
                        1∙1111, that of common air being reckoned unity. Hence, at the temperature
                        of sixty degrees, and when the barometer stands at thirty inches, a hundred
                        cubic inches of oxygen gas weigh 34∙60 grains.</p><p>Combustible bodies burn in it with more splendour, and give out more heat and
                        light, than when they burn in common air. Animals breathe it without
                        inconvenience for a much longer time than they can do the same bulk of
                        common air.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that common air, not reckoning some vapour of water
                        and some carbonic acid which it always contains, is a mixture of oxygen gas
                        and azotic gas in the proportion of 20 volumes of the former and 80 of the
                        latter.</p><p>Oxygen refracts light rather badly. If the refracting power of air be unity,
                        that of oxygen gas, according to Dulong, is 0∙324. * - <hi rend="superscript"> λ</hi>---</p><p>Oxygen has the property of combining with every other simple body. The
                        compounds thus formed are frequently called <hi rend="italic">oxides,</hi>

                        been shown by Dr Henry to be capable of absorbing 3∙55 percent, of its
                        volume of oxygen gas.</p><p>In the subsequent part of this article the weight of an atom of oxygen will
                        be considered as 1. A. volume of oxygen gas is equivalent to two atoms,
                        provided we suppose water to be a compound of one atom of oxygen and one
                        atom of hydrogen.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of Chlorine.</hi></p><p>This substance, which is also a gas, was discovered by Scheele, and an
                        account of it published in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Stockholm
                        Academy of Sciences</hi> for 1774. He gave it the name <hi rend="italic">of
                        dephlogisticated muriatic acid.</hi> The French chemists, in consequence of
                        the experiments of Berthollet, gave it the name of <hi rend="italic">oxygenized muriatic acid,</hi> which was afterwards contracted into <hi rend="italic">oxymuriatic acid.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">cldorine,</hi> by which it is at present known, was applied to it by Davy
                        in 1810, when he showed it to be a simple substance.</p><p>It may be obtained by putting a quantity of gray oxide of manganese in fine
                        powder into a retort, and then pouring over it the muriatic acid of
                        commerce. An effervescence takes place, and a yellowish green coloured gas
                        is extricated, which may be received in glass phials previously filled with
                        water, and having their heads sunk into a small water trough. When the gas
                        ceases to come over, the extrication will be renewed by heating the mixture
                        in the retort.</p><p>Chlorine has a yellowish-green colour, and a strong suffocating smell similar
                        to that of <hi rend="italic">aqua regia.</hi> It has also a pretty strong
                        astringent taste.</p><p>Its specific gravity is 2∙5, if we reckon that of air unity. It refracts
                        light very powerfully. If the refracting power of light be one, that of
                        chlorine gas, according to Dulong, is 2 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                        628∙</p><p>It has the property of destroying vegetable colours, and of rendering
                        vegetable bodies exposed to its action white. This property has occasioned
                        the introduction of chlorine into the process of bleaching. See the article
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Bleaching</hi> in this Encyclopaedia.</p><p>A lighted taper plunged into chlorine gas burns with a low red flame, giving
                        but little light, but emitting a great deal of smoke. But several metals, as
                        antimony and arsenic, take fire of their own accord when thrown into it.
                        This is the case also with phosphorus, which first melts, and then burns
                        with a low greenish-yellow flame. No animal can breathe this gas without
                        suffocation.</p><p>When exposed to a pressure of about four atmospheres, and at the same time
                        cooled, it is condensed into a liquid, as was first observed by Faraday. In
                        this state it is a limpid yellow-coloured fluid, exceedingly volatile. Its
                        specific gravity is very nearly 1∙33, its refracting power is less than that
                        of water. It is a non-conductor of electricity.</p><p>Water, according to Dalton, absorbs twice its volume of this gas. It acquires
                        a greenish-yellow colour, and the smell and properties of chlorine. When
                        water thus impregnated is kept for some time in a temperature as low as 36°,
                        crystals in plates, of a lively yellow colour, are formed. The specific
                        gravity of these crystals at 32° is 1∙2. They have been shown by Faraday to
                        be composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom chlorine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>10 atoms water</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>11∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>15∙75</p></cell></row></table><p>They constitute therefore a <hi rend="italic">decihydrate of

                        compounds, which deserve to be described.</p><p>1. When a current of chlorine gas is passed, through a solution of carbonate
                        of potash, an effervescence takes place, and small crystals in plates are

                        has been given. This salt is a compound of chloric acid and potash. It
                        possesses many properties similar to those of saltpetre, though it acts as a
                        supporter of combustion with much greater vigour. If 15 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 parts of chlorate of potash be heated to

                        in the retort. We obtain this salt best when we use three or four grains of
                        strong sulphuric acid for every grain of chlorate of potash. After the first
                        violent action of the acid is at an end, heat is to be applied and continued
                        till the yellow colour of the mass disappear. If we dissolve this residue in

                        properties, and made it known to the public on the 3d of July 1826. It was
                        obtained by him from the mother water of the brine springs in the
                        neighbourhood of Montpellier. It is a constituent of brine springs in
                        general, and also of sea-water.</p><p>Balard’s process was as follows. A current of chlorine gas is passed through
                        the liquid containing it, taking care not to add too much. A quantity of
                        sulphuric ether is now poured on the liquid in a phial, taking care that the
                        phial is completely filled. The two liquids being agitated together, are
                        then left in a state of rest. The ether swims on the top, having acquired a
                        fine hyacinth colour by dissolving the bromine. Agitate the ether with a
                        strong solution of caustic potash. A salt is formed, which crystallizes in
                        cubes. It is a <hi rend="italic">bromide of potassium.</hi> Reduce these
                        cubes to powder, mix them with gray oxide of manganese in powder, and dilute
                        sulphuric acid, and distil. Red vapours rise, which condense in drops on the
                        beak of the retort, and fall to the bottom of the receiver. This liquid is
                        bromine.</p><p>Bromine has a brownish-red colour, so intense as to appear opaque. Its smell
                        is very disagreeable, and has some resemblance to that of protoxide of
                        chlorine, but is stronger and more suffocating.</p><p>Its taste is sharp and strong; and when taken internally, it acts as a
                        violent poison. It acts with energy upon organic bodies, and particularly on
                        the human epidermis, which it corrodes, giving it a yellow tinge.</p><p>Its specific gravity is 2∙96. It remains liquid at zero, but becomes solid
                        and brittle at — 4 degrees. It is very volatile, and boils when heated to
                        116⅜ degrees. The specific gravity of its vapour is probably 5∙5555, that of
                        air being unity. It is a non-conductor of electricity. A taper is
                        extinguished when plunged into its vapour; but several of the metals burn
                        brilliantly when they come in contact with it.</p><p>It destroys vegetable colours almost as powerfully as chlorine itself. It is
                        slightly soluble in water, communicating a yellow colour to that liquid. It
                        is more soluble in alcohol, and much more soluble in sulphuric ether; olive
                        oil acts on it slowly. It is insoluble in sulphuric acid. When dropt into a
                        solution of starch, it communicates a fine yellow colour.</p><p>Its atomic weight, from the experiments of Balard, Liebig, and Berzelius,
                        appears to be ten.</p><p>It unites with oxygen, so far as is known, only in one proportion, forming a
                        compound to which the name of <hi rend="italic">bromic acid</hi> has been
                        given. When bromine is agitated with a sufficiently concentrated solution of
                        potash, two compounds are formed; namely, <hi rend="italic">hydrobromate of
                        potash,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bromide of potassium,</hi> which remains
                        in solution; and <hi rend="italic">bromate of potash,</hi> which being very
                        little soluble in water, precipitates in a white crystalline powder. We may
                        form bromate of barytes by agitating chloride of bromine in a concentrated
                        solution of barytes. The bromate of barytes precipitates in the state of a
                        whole powder. By solution in boiling water it may be obtained in acicular
                        crystals. These crystals may be dissolved in hot water, and the barytes
                        thrown down by dilute sulphuric acid. What remains is bromic acid held in
                        solution by water.</p><p>By gentle evaporation, a part, but not the whole, of the water can be driven
                        off. A syrupy liquid remains, which reddens litmus paper, and then
                        discolours it. It has little smell; the taste is acid, but not caustic. When
                        bromate of potash is heated it gives out oxygen gas, and is converted into
                        bromide of potassium.

                        bromine. It is a very volatile liquid, which 1 may be formed by passing a

                        by passing them into a receiver, surrounded by a mixture of snow and salt.
                        .It has a reddish yellow colour, a strong disagreeable smell, and a strong
                        taste. It is very fluid, and very volatile. Metals plunged into it become
                        incandescent, and are converted into chlorides and bromides. It dissolves in
                        water. When potash is added to the aqueous solution, the chloride is
                        decomposed, and an alkaline bromate and muriate is formed. No attempt has
                        yet been made to analyse this chloride.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Of Iodine.</hi></p><p>This substance was discovered in the year 1811, by M. Courtois, a saltpetre

                        are separated. The liquid is now mixed with sulphuric acid, and boiled for
                        some time, till all the muriatic acid is expelled. Gray oxide of manganese
                        being now added, the whole is put into a retort or stoneware still, with a
                        glass capital, and heat is applied. Violetcoloured vapours pass into the
                        receiver, and are condensed: these constitute <hi rend="italic">iodine.</hi></p><p>Iodine thus obtained is a solid substance of a grayish-blue colour, and
                        something of the metallic lustre. It is usually in scales, but may be
                        crystallized in octahedrons, similar to the primary form of sulphur. Its
                        specific gravity is 3∙0844. It has a disagreeable smell, similar to that of
                        chlorine, but not nearly so strong. Its taste is acrid and hot, and it
                        continues for some time in the mouth. It possesses poisonous properties. It
                        is strongly stimulating, and has of late been much employed as a
                        medicine.</p><p>It destroys vegetable colours, but with less intensity than chlorine. It
                        melts when heated to 2241 degrees, and is volatilized under the common
                        pressure of the atmosphere when heated to 3511 degrees. Its vapour has a
                        beautiful violet colour, and hence the name iodine <hi rend="italic">(yωbrf).</hi> The specific gravity of this vapour is 8∙8.</p><p>It is very slightly soluble in water, but more soluble in alcohol and ether.

                        of iodine appears to be 15∙75.</p><p>Iodine combines with oxygen, chlorine, and bromine, and forms compounds which

                        is called, may be obtained in the following way: Put forty grains of iodine
                        into a thin long-necked receiver; and into a bent tube shut at one end put
                        100 grains of chlorate of potash, and pour over it 400 grains of muriatic
                        acid, of the specific gravity 1*105; then introduce the point of the bent
                        tube into the receiver, and apply a gentle heat to it; protoxide of chlorine
                        is generated. As soon as it comes in contact with the iodine, a combination
                        takes place, and two new substances are formed; 1, a compound of iodine and
                        chlorine; 2, a compound of iodine and oxygen. When heat is applied to the
                        mixture, the first of these compounds is volatilized, and the last remains,

Bromine and iodine seem to be capable of uniting in two proportions. When
                        the two bodies are placed in contact in certain proportions, we obtain a

                        condensing into small crystals of the same colour, and resembling fern

                        a liquid, resembling hydriodic acid, containing a great excess of iodine.
                        This liquid bromide is soluble in water, to which it communicates the

                        with a certain portion of water, its specific gravity becomes 1∙25. Its
                        attraction for water is very strong. Its fumes are very deleterious when
                        drawn into the lungs. When a drop of it falls on the skin it acts as a
                        corrosive, and produces a sore which does not soon heal. It corrodes glass
                        with great rapidity, combining with and carrying off the silica of the
                        glass.</p><p>It was long the opinion of chemists that this acid is a compound or oxygen
                        and an unknown combustible basis. But all attempts to obtain this basis
                        having failed, Ampere suggested, in 1810, that it was probably a compound of
                        hydrogen with an unknown supporter, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">fluorine</hi> may be given. This opinion was taken up by Davy in 1811, and
                        his experiments, though they have not demonstrated the truth of Ampere’s
                        hypothesis, have rendered it at least exceedingly likely to be true. We may
                        state here some of the strongest proofs of the hypothesis which Davy was
                        able to adduce.</p><p>1. When fluoric acid and potassium are brought into contact, a violent action
                        takes place; a solid white substance is formed, and a quantity of hydrogen
                        gas is disengaged. In this case the probability is that the fluorine of the
                        fluoric acid unites to the potassium, and forms the white salt, while the
                        hydrogen is disengaged.</p><p>2. When potassium is heated in contact with sal ammoniac, chloride of
                        potassium is formed, and a quantity of gas disengaged. This gas is a mixture
                        of ammonia and hydrogen, and consists of two volumes of ammoniacal, and one
                        volume of hydrogen gas. Now when fluate of ammonia is treated with
                        potassium, a similar effect is produced. A white salt is formed, and a gas
                        evolved consisting of a mixture of two volumes of ammoniacal and one volume
                        of hydrogen gas. It is probable that the salt formed in this case is
                        fluoride of potassium.</p><p>3. When fluoric acid is exposed to the action of galvanism, hydrogen gas is
                        given out at the negative wire; and the positive wire, supposing it
                        platinum, is coated with a chocolate powder. When muriatic acid is treated
                        in the same way it is decomposed, its hydrogen being given off at the
                        negative wire, while its chlorine unites with the positive wire. Is it not
                        probable that the chocolate powder is a compound of fluorine and
                        platinum?</p><p>It has been shown that the atomic weight of fluorine (supposing it to exist)
                        must be 2∙25.</p><p>Such are the properties of the supporters of combustion. They seem capable of
                        uniting with every one of the other simple bodies. By uniting with one set
                        they constitute <hi rend="italic">acids</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by
                        uniting with another they constitute <hi rend="italic">alhalies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bases.</hi> Those acids and bases containing the same
                        supporter are capable of uniting with each other, and of forming salts
                        without decomposition. But when an acid containing one supporter is brought
                        into contact with a base containing another supporter, it is more rarely
                        that they combine. Much more frequently they mutually decompose each other.

                        constitutes one of the ingredients of water, from which it may be disengaged
                        by simple processes. Its properties were first investigated by Cavendish in
                        1766. It maybe obtained by dissolving zinc or iron filings in dilute
                        sulphuric acid in a flask or small retort. An effervescence takes place, and
                        hydrogen is evolved. It may be received in glass jars filled with water, and
                        inverted on the shelf of the water-trough.</p><p>The gas, when pure, is colourless, and destitute of taste or smell. But it
                        usually has a bituminous and disagreeable smell, which is very strong when
                        we employ cast-iron turnings to procure it.</p><p>It is the lightest body with which we are acquainted, its specific gravity
                        being only 0∙0694, that of air being 1. So that oxygen gas is sixteen times
                        as heavy as hydrogen gas. In consequence of this lightness it is employed to
                        elevate air-balloons.</p><p>It refracts light much more powerfully than any other gaseous body, if we
                        take into account its small specific gravity; for if the refracting power of
                        air be one, that of hydrogen gas is 0∙470, as determined by Dulong. It has a
                        great effect in blunting the sound of sonorous bodies struck in an
                        atmosphere of this gas. It is well known that sound moves at least thrice as
                        fast in this gas as it does in common air.</p><p>Burning bodies plunged into it are immediately extinguished. Animals, when
                        obliged to breathe it, soon die, precisely as if they were plunged into
                        water. When a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen gases is made in the same
                        proportion as in common air, hydrogen being substituted for azote, animals
                        breathe it with impunity. But Messrs Allen and Pepys observed, that when
                        animals are put into such an atmosphere, they are thrown into a profound
                        sleep.</p><p>A hundred cubic inches of water previously deprived of air by boiling were
                        found by Dr Henry to absorb 1 ∙53 cubic inches of this gas.</p><p>When mixed with oxygen gas in the proportion of one volume of oxygen to two
                        volumes of hydrogen, it burns with a loud explosion by an electric spark, or
                        the contact of a red-hot wire. Mr Cavendish first ascertained that the
                        product of this combustion is water; so that water is a compound of one
                        volume of oxygen and two volumes of hydrogen gas, or, by weight, of oxygen
                        eight, and hydrogen one.</p><p>If we mix a hundred volumes of air with forty-two volumes of hydrogen gas,
                        and pass an electric spark through the mixture, a detonation takes place,
                        and sixty volumes disappear. Now one third of this loss is oxygen. If we
                        examine the residuary gas, we shall find no trace of oxygen in it. Hence it
                        is evident that a hundred volumes of air contain just twenty of oxygen.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Water,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">oxide of hydrogen</hi> as
                        it might be called, is a transparent and colourless liquid, destitute of
                        smell, and having but little taste. It freezes at 32°, and boils at 212°.
                        Its density is greatest at the temperature of 39°. A cubic inch of water at
                        the temperature of 62°, and when the barometer stands at thirty inches,
                        weighed in air with brass weights, weighs 252∙458 grains. Hence at the
                        temperature of 60° the weight of a cubic inch of water is very nearly 252∙5
                        grains.</p><p>A hundred cubic inches of air at the temperature of 60°, and when the
                        barometer stands at thirty inches, weigh 31T446 grains. Hence it follows
                        that water at that temperature and pressure is 8l0∙734 times heavier than
                        air.</p><p>Water, if we are to judge from the combinations into which it enters, is a
                        neutral body. It shows little tendency to combine with simple bodies,
                        whether supporters or acid or alkaline bases. But it combines, and
                        apparently with equal ease, both with acids and bases, though without
                        disguising their peculiar properties, or neutralizing their energies. To
                        these combinations the term <hi rend="italic">hydrate</hi> was applied by
                        Proust, which, though somewhat exceptionable, has been generally adopted. It
                        is not easy to form an accurate idea of the way in which water unites with
                        other bodies. The electric theory of combination will scarcely apply to it;
                        or at least we cannot determine, except from analogy, whether it be positive
                        or negative with respect to those bodies with which it unites.</p><p>Hydrogen is capable of uniting with another dose of oxygen, and of forming a
                        new liquid compound, which has been distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">deutoxide of hydrogen.</hi> It was formed by Thenard by
                        dissolving peroxide of barium in dilute muriatic acid, and then
                        precipitating the barytes by means of sulphuric acid. This process is
                        repeated a number of times, and then the muriatic acid is removed by
                        treating the liquid with sulphate, of silver. The sulphuric acid left by
                        this process is removed by means of barytes. Nothing now remains but a
                        mixture of water and deutoxide of hydrogen, which is put into the exhausted
                        receiver of an air-pump over sulphuric acid. The water gradually evaporates,
                        and leaves the deutoxide of hydrogen in a state of purity.</p><p>It is a liquid which has a specific gravity of 1∙453. It attacks, the
                        epidermis almost instantly, and produces a prickling pain, the duration of
                        which varies according to the quantity of liquid applied. It whitens the
                        tongue, and thickens the saliva.</p><p>When deutoxide of hydrogen is left to itself, it undergoes spontaneous
                        decomposition, oxygen gas being given out. When heated to 80° it is
                        decomposed with a violent explosion, oxygen gas being evolved in great
                        abundance. By collecting the gas thus driven off from a given weight of
                        deutoxide, it has been shown that it contains twice as much oxygen as water
                        does.

                        palladium, rhodium, and iridium. Lead, bismuth, and mercury exercise an

                        The oxygen is driven off, and the metals are not oxydized. Several bodies,

                        placed in contact with deutoxide of hydrogen. Several of the metallic oxides
                        absorb an additional dose of oxygen, while others drive off the second
                        portion of oxygen from the deutoxide without any of it combining with
                        them.</p><p>Hydrogen has the property of combining with chlorine, and of forming the very
                        important chemical substance known by the name of <hi rend="italic">muriatic
                        acid.</hi> If equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen gas be put into a glass
                        tube, and exposed to the direct rays of the sun, an explosion takes place.
                        If this mixture be put into an exhausted glass vessel, it will be found that
                        after the explosion the two gases have disappeared, and a quantity of
                        muriatic acid gas has come in their place, exactly equal to the volume and
                        weight of the two gases. It follows from this that muriatic acid gas is a
                        compound of one volume of hydrogen and one volume of chlorine gas united
                        together, without any alteration in bulk. Hence, the specific gravity of
                        muriatic acid gas is the mean between that of hydrogen and chlorine gases,

                        and heating the mixture in a small retort, the beak of which is plunged into
                        mercury. A gas comes over, which is hydrobromic acid. But this gas may be
                        obtained in a state of greater purity by moistening bromide of phosphorus,
                        and exposing it in a small retort to the heat of a lamp.</p><p>It is a colourless gas, having an acid taste, and smoking when mixed with

                        standing over mercury. Tin, when heated in it, absorbs the bromine and
                        leaves the hydrogen; so does potassium. By this process the volume of the
                        gas is reduced to one half. Hence hydrobromic acid gas is a compound of
                        equal volumes of hydrogen gas and bromine vapour united together without any
                        alteration of volume. Its specific gravity is 2∙8125, and it is a compound

                        heat. Neither is bromine capable of decomposing water, when the mixed
                        vapours of the two liquids are passed through an ignited porcelain tube.</p><p>Hydrogen and iodine, when united together, constitute a gaseous substance,
                        distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">hydriodic acid.</hi> It may
                        be obtained by mixing together four parts of iodine and one part of
                        phosphorus, moistening the compound with water, and heating it in a small
                        retort. The gas which comes over must be received over mercury. This gas is
                        hydriodic acid.</p><p>It is colourless and elastic like common air, has a smell similar to that of
                        muriatic acid, and a very acid taste. When left in contact with mercury,
                        that metal absorbs the iodine and leaves the hydrogen. By this process the
                        volume of the gas is reduced to one half. It is evident from this, that
                        hydriodic acid gas is a compound of one volume hydrogen gas and one volume
                        iodine vapour united together without any alteration of bulk. Hence its

                        afterwards professor of botany in the University of Edinburgh. Being one of
                        the constituents of air, it may be obtained by various processes. l.If we

                        ceases to smoke, the residual gas, after being washed with water, is azote.
                        2. If we mix in a wide jar standing over water a hundred cubic inches of

                        put into the retort through the tubular mouth, a pretty strong effervescence
                        takes place, and azotic gas is disengaged abundantly.</p><p>Azotic gas possesses the mechanical properties of com-1 mon air, and, like

                        animals without suffocation. Animals obliged to breathe it die precisely as

                        forms spontaneously in the soil of different countries. The presence of
                        animal matters and of lime has been found to promote its formation. It is
                        obtained in different countries, particularly in India, by lixiviating the

                        deposited. These crystals are afterwards purified by a second

                        Its taste is intensely sour. When applied to any part of the body, it acts
                        as an escharotic, and speedily produces a sore, by destroying the texture of
                        the part. It is one of the most powerful and useful of all the acids. Its
                        atomic weight is 6∙75, that of oxygen being considered as unity. It is by
                        means of nitric acid that all the other compounds of oxygen and azote are
                        obtained.</p><p>1. Protoxide of azote was discovered by Dr Priestley, and called by him <hi rend="italic">dephlogisticated nitrous gas.</hi> It is most easily obtained
                        by saturating nitric acid with ammonia, and evaporating the liquid to
                        dryness. A fibrous deliquescent salt is obtained, known by the name of <hi rend="italic">nitrate of ammonia.</hi> When this salt is heated in a small
                        retort to about the temperature of 400°, it melts and effervesces, <hi rend="italic">ŭnà protoxide of azote</hi> is given out abundantly.</p><p>This gas is colourless, and destitute of smell. It has a sweetish taste, and
                        its specific gravity is 1∙5277. Water absorbs about three fourths of its
                        volume of this gas. Its refracting power, according to Dulong, is 1∙710, if
                        we reckon that of air unity.</p><p>It is capable of supporting combustion, and bodies burn in it with as much
                        brilliancy as in oxygen gas. But the combustion lasts only for a very short
                        time, and it does not begin unless the body be in the first place heated to
                        whiteness. Animals arc capable of breathing this gas for a few minutes
                        without inconvenience, as was first discovered by Sir H. Davy. The breathing
                        of it sometimes produces feelings of intoxication, but they are not follow
                        ed by that languor and debility which is a constant attendant of
                        intoxication by ardent spirits.</p><p>It is not altered by exposure to light, or by any heat below ignition. When
                        passed through a red hot tube, or when electric sparks are passed through
                        it, decomposition takes place, and nitric acid is formed. When exposed to a
                        pressure of fifty atmospheres at the temperature of 45°, it becomes liquid.
                        In that state it is transparent and colourless, exceedingly volatile, and it

                        of protoxide of azote present. 100 volumes of protoxide of azote must be
                        mixed, for complete combustion, with 100 volumes of hydrogen. After the

                        copper or mercury, it dissolves either of&lt; these metals, an effervescence
                        takes place, and a gas is extricated, which may be received in glass jars
                        standing over water. This gas is <hi rend="italic">deutoxide of azote,</hi>
                        or <hi rend="italic">nitrous gas</hi> as it was called by Dr Priestley, the
                        original discoverer of it.</p><p>It is colourless and invisible, like common air. Whether it has any taste or
                        smell cannot easily be determined, because, whenever it comes in contact
                        with air, <hi rend="italic">nitrons acid</hi> is formed, which communicates
                        its peculiar odour to the gas. Its specific gravity is 1∙0416. If we reckon
                        the refracting power of air one, that of this gas is 1∙03, according to D
                        along.</p><p>It is not sensibly absorbed by water. When that liquid is freed from air by
                        boiling, 100 volumes of it absorb five volumes of this gas.</p><p>When deutoxide of azote is mixed with common air or oxygen gas, red fumes of
                        nitrous acid are produced, heat is evolved, and the volume of gas is
                        diminished. This is owing to the union of the gas with oxygen, and the
                        formation of acid fumes, which are absorbed by water. The proportion of the
                        two gases which unite varies according to circumstances. If we make the
                        mixture in a glass tube 0∙9 inch in diameter, then one volume of oxygen gas
                        unites with two volumes of deutoxide of azote. When we put deutoxide of
                        azote into a globular vessel, and let up <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351761" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1761-0366"/> common air
                        to it bubble by bubble, agitating after the addition of each bubble, then
                        one volume of oxygen gas will be found to unite with four volumes of
                        deutoxide of azote. All intermediate proportions between these two extremes
                        may be made to unite by varying the circumstances.</p><p>À solution of green vitriol, or of chloride of iron, has the property of
                        absorbing this gas slowly, while at the same time it acquires a dark brown
                        colour, and becomes opaque. By this absorption the purity of the gas may be
                        determined.</p><p>When electric sparks are passed through this gas it undergoes decomposition,
                        being· converted into nitrous acid and azotic gas. When passed through an
                        ignited porcelain tube, it undergoes the same decomposition.</p><p>Charcoal and phosphorus may be burnt in this gas. When charcoal is burnt in
                        it, the bulk of the gas is not altered, but it is converted into a mixture
                        of equal volumes of carbonic acid and azotic gas. Now carbonic acid gas
                        contains its own volume of oxygen gas. Hence it is obvious that deutoxide of
                        azote is a compound of one volume of azote and one volume of oxygen gas
                        united together, without any alteration of volume; consequently its specific
                        gravity is the mean of that of oxygen and azotic gases. It is composed, by
                        weight, of azote 0∙9722 or 1∙75, oxygen l∙1111 or 2. If we reckon the atomic
                        weight of azote 1∙75, this gas is obviously a compound of one atom azote and
                        two atoms oxygen.</p><p>3. When deutoxide of azote is mixed with oxygen gas, bubble by bubble, in a
                        wide glass vessel, four volumes of deutoxide combine with one volume of
                        oxygen gas, and form an acid which is absorbed by the water. Now four
                        volumes of deutoxide of azote consist of two volumes azotic and two volumes
                        oxygen gas united together. It is clear, therefore, that the acid formed
                        must be a compound of two volumes azotic and three volumes oxygen gas, or of
                        one volume azotic and one and a half volume oxygen gas. This, by weight,
                        constitutes azote 0∙9722 or 1∙75, oxygen 1∙6666 or 3. If we reckon the
                        atomic weight of azote 1∙75, we see that the acid formed in this case is a
                        compound of one atom of azote and three atoms of oxygen.</p><p>This acid has received the name of <hi rend="italic">hyponitrous.</hi> It can
                        exist only in combination. All the salts formerly called <hi rend="italic">nitrites</hi> are in fact combinations of this acid with a base.
                        Hyponitrous acid readily combines with bases, and forms a genus of salts to
                        which the name of <hi rend="italic">hyponitrites</hi> has been given. When
                        we attempt to separate the acid from any of these salts, it is immediately
                        resolved into nitrous acid and deutoxide of azote. Hyponitrous acid is
                        always formed whenever deutoxide of azote is left in contact with a powerful
                        base.</p><p>4. If we take a quantity of pure crystallized nitrate of lead, and, after
                        drying it for some timeat the temperature of 300°, reduce it to powder and
                        put it into a small bottle-glass retort; when heated almost to redness an
                        acid liquid comes over, which must be collected in a receiver surrounded by
                        a mixture of snow and salt. This acid has received the name of <hi rend="italic">nitrous.</hi></p><p>It is a liquid of an orange-yellow colour, has a caustic taste, a very strong
                        smell, and a specific gravity of 1 ’ 451. It boils at 82° ∙5, and assumes
                        the form of an orange-red vapour. Water decomposes it instantly, and
                        converts it into nitric acid and deutoxide of azote. It does not seem
                        capable of combining with bases; hence no such genus of salts as <hi rend="italic">nitrites</hi> exist. Dulong analysed it by passing it through
                        red-hot copper turnings. Azotic gas was driven off, and the copper was
                        oxydized. From this analysis it appears that it is a compound of one volume
                        azotic and two volumes oxygen gas. Hence its constituents by weight are,
                        azote 0∙9722 or 1∙75, oxygen 2∙2222 or 4. So that (supposing an atom of
                        azote to weigh 1∙75) it is a compound of one atom azote and four atoms
                        oxygen.</p><p>5. It has been ascertained by experiments that appear decisive, that nitric
                        acid is a compound of one volumeazotic and two and a half volumes oxygen
                        gas. Hence its constituents by weight are, azote 0∙9722 or 1∙75, oxygen
                        2∙7777 <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> r 5. Hence it is a compound of one atom
                        azote and five atoms oxygen.</p><p>Such are the poperties and constitution of the compounds of azote and oxygen.

                        represents the atomic weight of azote.</p><p>Chemists are not quite agreed about the atom of azote. The difference of
                        opinion depends upon the view taken of the constitution of water. Those who
                        consider water as a compound of one atom hydrogen and one atom oxygen, draw,
                        asa necessary consequence, that half a volume of oxygen is equivalent to an
                        atom, while a whole volume of most other gases represents an atom. Those who
                        have adopted this opinion represent the atom of azote by 1∙75. But those
                        chemists who consider water as a compound of two atoms hydrogen and orie
                        atom oxygen, naturally deduce the number of atoms in each compound from the
                        number of volumes of each constituent. Deutoxide of azote being a compound
                        of one volume of each constituent, they consider it as a compound of one
                        atom of azote and one atom of oxygen. Hence the atomic weight of azote will
                        be O∙875, and the composition of the various compounds will be as

                        demonstrated; but the first of the two is the simplest, and has been
                        generally adopted by British chemists.</p><p>Azote has the property of combining with chlorine, and of forming a very
                        singular compound, first noticed by Dulong, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">chloride of azote</hi> has been given.</p><p>To procure it, dissolve a quantity of nitrate of ammonia in water of the
                        temperature 110°, put the solution into a flat dish, and invert over it a
                        phial or cylindrical glass jar, previously filled with chlorine gas. The
                        chlorine is slowly absorbed. A yellowish oily looking matter collects on the
                        surface of the liquid within the jar, and gradually falls to the bottom.
                        This is the <hi rend="italic">chloride of azote.</hi> It is so formidable a
                        compound, that experiments on it should be made upon a very small scale.</p><p>Its colour is similar to that of olive oil. Its smell is peculiar and strong.
                        It is very volatile, and is soon dissipated when left in the open air. It
                        may be distilled over at <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351774" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1774-0367"/> 160°, but when heated to 212° it explodes
                        with prodigious violence. In a vacuum it is converted into vapour, which is
                        again condensed into a liquid when the pressure of the atmosphere is
                        restored. If this vapour be heated sufficiently, it explodes with as much
                        violence as the liquid itself. The specific gravity of this liquid is 1∙653.
                        It does not become solid though exposed to the cold produced by a mixture of
                        ice and chloride of calcium. When it comes in contact with phosphorus or
                        oils, a violent detonation takes place. The effect is so instantaneous and
                        so great that it has been impossible to collect the products.</p><p>When chloride of azote is brought in contact with copper, azotic gas is
                        disengaged, and there is formed a solution of chloride of copper. This shows
                        that the substance is a compound of azote and chlorine. Davy, from
                        decomposing it by mercury, concluded that it is composed of one volume
                        azotic and four and a fourth volumes chlorine gas. Probably it is in reality
                        a compound of one volume azotic and five volumes chlorine gas. This would be

                        fixed firm to it by means of a little paste or mucilage; for the powder,
                        when dry, detonates violently upon the smallest agitation. If potash
                        solution or hydriodate of ammonia be poured upon it, azotic gas is evolved,
                        and the iodide is decomposed. Even water occasions a slow evolution of
                        azotic gas. The iodide detonates with great violence when slightly touched
                        or when heated. The only products are azotic gas and iodine. These are of
                        course its constituents, but it has not been possible to determine the
                        proportions in which they are united.</p><p>Azote is capable likewise of combining with hydrogen, and of forming an
                        important compound called <hi rend="italic">ammonia.</hi><hi rend="italic">Ammonia</hi> may be obtained in the state of gas by means of the salt
                        called sal ammoniac, which is a compound of muriatic acid and ammonia.
                        Introduce into a small retort about half an ounce of sal ammoniac,
                        previously reduced to powder; reduce about half an ounce of unslaked
                        quicklime to powder, and introduce it into the same retort. Shake, them well
                        so as to mix them together; then fill the whole belly of the retort with
                        unslaked lime in powder. Plunge the beak of the retort under mercury, and
                        apply the heat of a lamp. Ammoniacal gas is disengaged abundantly, and must
                        be received in glass jars standing over mercury.</p><p>Ammoniacal gas is colourless, and possesses the mechanical properties of air.
                        Its smell is strong, pungent, and quite peculiar. Its taste is acrid and
                        caustic, and when drawn into the mouth it destroys the cuticle. It cannot be
                        breathed, nor even drawn into the lungs. Its specific gravity is 0∙59027. If
                        we reckon the refracting power of air 1, that of ammoniacal gas is 1∙309,
                        according to Dulong. It converts vegetable blues into green.</p><p>When this gas is subjected to a pressure of six and a half atmospheres at the
                        temperature of 50°, it is condensed into a colourless fluid, having a
                        greater refracting power than water, and a specific gravity of 0∙76.</p><p>Water absorbs 780 times its volume of this gas, and acquires the smell and
                        properties of ammonia. In this state it is employed for chemical purposes.
                        It is specifically lighter than water, and it is lighter in proportion to
                        the quantity of gas which it contains. The following table by Dalton

                        When chlorine and ammonia are mixed in the gaseous state, a sudden
                        combustion and detonation takes place. The chlorine unites with the hydrogen
                        of the ammonia, and forms muriatic acid, while the azote is disengaged in

                        crystallized and transparent, when it is distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">diamond.</hi></p><p>There are two varieties of wood charcoal. If the wood be not heated to
                        ignition, but only till all vapours cease to be emitted, we obtain a black
                        shining mass, having the shape of the pieces of wood employed, but much
                        lighter. Charcoal made in this way burns with some smoke and flame. It is a
                        non-conductor of electricity, and cannot be employed as one of the elements
                        of the galvanic pile. It is a very bad conductor of heat.</p><p>If the heat be raised to redness, and kept at that point till all smoke and
                        vapour cease to be emitted, the charcoal obtained is black, and, like the
                        former, retains the shape of the pieces of wood employed. It is an excellent
                        conductor of electricity, and may be substituted for one of the metals in
                        the galvanic pile. It is also a good conductor of heat, and not nearly so
                        combustible as the first species of charcoal.</p><p>Charcoal is insoluble in water; it is destitute of taste and smell, and may
                        be exposed to the most violent heat that we can raise in close vessels
                        without alteration. It does not putrefy, like wood. It has the curious
                        property of absorbing <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> smells from cloth when
                        wrapt up in them. New-made charcoal absorbs moisture with avidity. It also
                        absorbs gases, and many of them become much more condensed in the pores of
                        the charcoal than in their natural state. This will be obvious from the

                        a soft mineral, having a greasy feel, the metallic lustre, and a colour
                        approaching that of lead. Its specific gravity varies from 1∙9 to 2∙32. It
                        is a conductor of electricity, and, when strongly heated, burns slowly, and
                        without emitting any flame.</p><p>The diamond has been hitherto found only in the torrid zone, and the two
                        known localities are India and Brazil. It is said to have been lately
                        discovered in Siberia; but no accurate information on the subject has yet
                        reached this country. It is usually white and transparent, has a splendent
                        lustre, is crystallized in octahedrons, and has a specific gravity of 3∙52.
                        It refracts light powerfully, and is a non-conductor of electricity. When
                        heated to red ness in the open air, it consumes slowly without flame; but in
                        a close vessel it withstands the most violent heat that can be applied,
                        without undergoing any alteration.</p><p>Carbon combines with all the supporters of combustion, and likewise with
                        hydrogen and azote. Let us take a view of these combinations.</p><p>I. There are three combinations of carbon and oxygen, ∣ namely, <hi rend="italic">carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, oxalic acid.</hi> The first and
                        third of these compounds possess <hi rend="italic">acid</hi> properties;'
                        but the second is <hi rend="italic">neutral,</hi> or at least has not
                        hitherto been observed to have any tendency to combine either with bases or
                        acids.</p><p>1. When charcoal is burnt in a given volume of air,∣ though no smell is
                        evolved, yet the nature of the air is soi much altered that animals can no
                        longer breathe it without death. It was ascertained by Lavoisier, that in
                        such cases of combustion the oxygen of the air is converted into <hi rend="italic">carbonic acid,</hi> which is the substance that gives the air
                        its suffocating properties. When charcoal is ignited in oxygen gas, the
                        volume of the gas is not altered; but it is gradually converted into <hi rend="italic">carbonic acid gas.</hi></p><p>The easiest method of procuring carbonic acid is to put pure calcareous spar
                        or chalk into a small retort or flask, and to pour over it muriatic acid
                        previously diluted with water. The chalk dissolves, an effervescence takes
                        place, and carbonic acid gas is disengaged abundantly. It may be received
                        over water.</p><p>It is a colourless gas, possessing the mechanical properties of common air.
                        When applied to the nose it excites a pungent sensation, similar to that
                        produced by brisk beer. Its taste is that of a weak but distinct acid. Its
                        specific gravity is 1∙5277. If the refracting power of air be 1, that of
                        this gas is 1∙526, according to Dulong. It acts feebly upon vegetable blues.
                        It gives a purple colour to litmus infusion, but has no sensible effect on
                        water rendered blue by the juice of red cabbage. It cannot be breathed, nor
                        even drawn into the lungs; the attempt is speedily followed by asphyxia and
                        death, unless the animal be immediately removed into pure air.</p><p>No combustible will burn in it. A mixture of nine volumes air and one volume
                        carbonic acid gas extinguishes a candle. Water absorbs about its own volume
                        of this gas, and acquires a sour taste and the properties of a weak acid.
                        When water thus impregnated is exposed to the open air, the carbonic acid

                        into a liquid, which is colourless, very fluid and light, and which has a
                        less refractive power than water. It may be passed through an ignited
                        porcelain tube without alteration; but when electric sparks are passed
                        through it for some time, it is probably decomposed into carbonic oxide and
                        oxygen gas. When a mixture of equal volumes of this gas and hydrogen is
                        passed through an ignited porcelain tube, the carbonic acid is converted
                        into carbonic oxide and water. If we pass the gas through ignited charcoal,
                        it will be converted into carbonic oxide, and its bulk will be doubled.</p><p>As oxygen gas is converted into carbonic acid without any alteration of bulk
                        by burning in it charcoal or diamond, while these bodies disappear, it is
                        obvious that this gas is a compound of oxygen and carbon. The proportion of
                        the carbon may be learned by subtracting the specific gravity of oxygen gas
                        from that of carbonic acid gas.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Specific gravity of carbonic acid gas</p><p>Specific gravity

                        of wood and coal, it is not surprising that a portion of it should always
                        exist in the atmosphere. The proportion varies somewhat, being diminished by
                        rain and increased by dry weather. The mean bulk of this gas in 10,000
                        volumes of air is, according to Saussure, 4∙15 volumes. The greatest
                        quantity observed by him was 5∙74 volumes, and the smallest 3∙15
                        volumes.</p><p>This gas combines with bases, and forms a genus of salts called <hi rend="italic">carbonates.</hi> Like all weak acids, it unites in various

                        exposing the mixture to a strong red heat in an iron bottle. A mixture of
                        carbonic acid and carbonic oxide is extricated, the former of which may be
                        removed by washing the gaseous product in milk of lime.</p><p>Carbonic oxide gas is colourless, and destitute of taste and smell. Its
                        specific gravity is 0∙9722. Its refractive power is 1*157, that of air being
                        1. Water freed from air absorbs about yθth of its volume of this gas. No
                        animal can breathe it, one or two inhalations producing asphyxia. It burns
                        with a blue flame, and gives but little light. It explodes by electricity
                        when mixed with oxygen gas. One volume of the gas requires for complete
                        combustion half a volume of oxygen gas. The product is a volume of carbonic
                        acid gas. It is clear from this that one volume of carbonic oxide gas
                        contains just as much carbon as carbonic acid gas, but only one half the

                        prisms. When shavings of wood are mixed with caustic potash, and exposed to
                        a heat considerably higher than that of boiling water, the wood suffers
                        decomposition, and is partly converted into oxalic acid. This is probably
                        the mode taken by the manufacturers of oxalic acid in this country.</p><p>Oxalic acid crystallizes in small prisms. Its taste is intensely acid, and
                        when taken internally, even in small quantities, it destroys life. When
                        taken to the extent of about half an ounce it proves almost instantly fatal.

                        combustible. It is insoluble in water, but dissolves readily in alcohol, and
                        still more easily in ether. It is scarcely acted on by acids or alkalies. It

                        This mixture is put into a phial, into the mouth of which a bent tube is
                        luted. Heat is applied to the-bottom of the phial, while the open end of the
                        tube is plunged into a vessel filled with water. The heat must just be
                        sufficient to melt the iodide of carbon. Some vapours of iodine first make
                        their appearance, then a red liquid passes over and falls to the bottom of
                        the water, where it speedily loses its colour. Iodine, chloride of iodine,
                        and iodide, of phosphorus, remain in the phial. The liquid is separated from
                        the water by means of a funnel, with a capillary tube. It is purified .by
                        washing it in caustic potash. It is freed from hydrocarburet of chlorine by
                        pouring on it about, five times its þulk of concentrated sulphuric acid, and
                        stirring the mixture from time to time with a,glass rod. The hydrocarburet
                        is destroyed, and the pure iodide of carbon collects at the bottom, being
                        heavier than sulphuric acid.</p><p>It is a transparent light yellow liquid, having a peculiar and strong,
                        ethereal smell. Its taste is very sweet, with a sensation of coolness

                        is formed also abundantly at the bottom of stagnant pools containing decayed
                        vegetable matter during the summer season. When the bottom of the pool is
                        stirred, abundance of gas is extricated, consisting of carburetted hydrogen,
                        mixed with a little carbonic acid gas, and usually also with some
                        atmospherical air.</p><p>It is a colourless gas, destitute of taste and smell. Its specific gravity is
                        0∙5555. Its refracting power is l∙504, that of air being unity. It cannot be
                        breathed, the attempt bringing on instant asphyxia. It burns with a yellow
                        flame, and gives a good deal of light. When mixed with aiŗ or oxygen gas in
                        the requisite proportions, it detonates by the electric spark. For complete
                        combustion, it requires twice its volume of oxygen gas, and produces exactly

                        sublimed, and is always deposited in crystalline plates. It does not burn
                        easily, but when suddenly heated it may be made to burn with a strong yellow
                        flame, emitting much smoke. It is very slightly soluble in water, but
                        dissolves readily in alcohol and ether, and in volatile and fixed oils. It
                        dissolves in sulphuric acid, and forms an acid to which the name of <hi rend="italic">theio-naphthalic acid</hi> may be given. It is composed of

                        our towns, and even in private houses, is obtained by distilling <hi rend="italic">cannel coal</hi> in iron or clay retorts, and purifying the
                        gas which is evolved. Its goodness depends not only on the nature of the
                        coal employed in its production, but also upon the heat to which these coals
                        are exposed, the gas being always the better the lower the temperature at

                        the borders of certain lakes. It exists also (at least one of its
                        constituents) in certain lakes in Tuscany and Sicily, seemingly in large
                        quantities. When this salt is dissolved in hot water, and the solution mixed
                        with sulphuric or nitric acid till it becomes sensibly sour, if we set it
                        aside till it cools, a quantity of fine white sealycrystals are deposited.
                        These constitute <hi rend="italic">boracic acid,</hi> one of the
                        constituents of boron, the other constituent being soda. When one part of
                        dry powdered boracic acid is mixed with two parts of potassium in a platinum
                        crucible, and heated to incipient ignition, a detonation takes place, the
                        boracic acid is decomposed, giving out its oxygen to the potassium, while
                        its base, <hi rend="italic">boron,</hi> is set at liberty. Mix the matter in
                        the crucible with water, and throw it on a filter. Potash is dissolved in
                        the water, while the boron remains on the filter.</p><p>When washed and dried, it is a powder of a deep-brown colour, almost black,
                        and without either taste or smell. In close vessels it may be exposed to the
                        most violent heat that can be raised, without any alteration. It is
                        insoluble in water, alcohol, ether, and oils, whether hot or cold. It does
                        not decompose water. It is a non-conductor of electricity. When heated in
                        air or oxygen it burns with splendour, and is converted into boracic acid.
                        The atomic weight of boracic acid, determined from the composition of borax,
                        is three. There is reason to believe that when boron is converted into
                        boracic acid, it combines with twice its weight of oxygen. Hence the atomic
                        weight of boron must be 1, and boracic acid is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom boron</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell></row></table><p>Boron combines readily with chlorine, and forms an acid compound which is in

                        It may be obtained by putting a mixture of very dry boracic acid and
                        charcoal into a porcelain tube, heating the mixture to redness, and passing
                        a current of chlorine gas through it. The boracic acid is decomposed by the
                        joint action of the chlorine and charcoal. The gas which is extricated is a
                        mixture of two volumes borochloric acid and three volumes oxide of carbon.
                        Borochloric acid is a colourless gas, possessing the mechanical properties
                        of common air. It has a very strong and peculiar smell. When it comes in
                        contact with common air it gives out thick vapours. Its specific gravity,
                        according to Dumas, is 3∙942. Water absorbs it with avidity, and the gas is
                        changed into muriatic and boracic acids by the decomposition of water. It is
                        absorbed also by water. This gas has not yet been subjected to a
                        satisfactory analysis.</p><p>We are not acquainted with any compound of boron with bromine or iodine; but
                        it has the property of combining with fluorine, and of forming a powerful
                        acid, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">fluoboric acid</hi> has been
                        given. It was discovered by Gay-Lussac and Thenard, and may be obtained by
                        heating a mixture of one part anhydrous boracic acid, two parts fluor spar,
                        and twelve parts of sulphuric acid. A gas comes over, which must be
                        collected over mercury. A still easier method is to dissolve boracic acid in
                        fluoric acid, and apply a slight heat.</p><p>Fluoboric acid is a colourless gas, having a smell similar to that of

                        of the specific gravity 1∙77. It has a certain degree of viscosity, and
                        requires a high temperature to cause it to boil. This acid seems to be a

                        essentially of a peculiar acid substance, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">silica</hi> or <hi rend="italic">silicic acid</hi> has been
                        given. It is a white tasteless powder, insoluble in water, but capable of
                        combining with the different bases in definite proportions, and forming
                        compounds analogous to the salts.</p><p>Silica constitutes one of the constituents of <hi rend="italic">fluosilicic

                        sulphuric acid is heated in a glass retort. If we mix fluosilicate of potash
                        in powder with five fourths of its weight of potassium, and apply heat, a
                        violent combustion takes place, and a coherent mass of a liver-brown colour
                        is the result. Digest this substance in cold water. A brown matter remains,
                        which must be well washed in cold water, and then dried; it is <hi rend="italic">silicon,</hi> or the basis of silica.</p><p>Silicon is a powder of a deep-brown colour, and so similar in its appearance
                        to <hi rend="italic">boron,</hi> that it would be difficult to distinguish
                        them. It is a non-conductor of electricity. It stains the fingers, and
                        adheres to every thing that comes in contact with it. It may be exposed to a
                        very high temperature in close vessels without fusion, but it becomes
                        harder, and its properties are materially altered.</p><p>Before having been strongly heated, it is readily combustible in the air, and
                        burns with a lively flame. By this combustion about one third of it is
                        converted into silica, which forming a crust, prevents the other two thirds
                        from coming in contact with the atmosphere, and consequently from burning.
                        There is always a quantity of water formed at the same time, showing that
                        the silicon before ignition is not pure, but is combined with a certain
                        quantity of hydrogen. It is not acted on by sulphuric or nitric acid, or
                        aqua regia, but liquid muriatic acid dissolves it even without the
                        application of heat. So also does a concentrated solution of caustic potash
                        when assisted by heat.</p><p>After silicon has been ignited, its specific gravity is higher than 1∙837. It
                        neither burns in air nor in oxygen gas. It is not altered by the action of
                        the blowpipe, even when mixed with chlorate of potash; nor does it burn
                        though heated to redness with saltpetre. Neither fluoric acid nor solution
                        of caustic potash has any action on it; but a mixture of fluoric and nitric
                        acid dissolves it with great facility, while at the same time deutoxide of
                        azote is given out.</p><p>When mixed with dry carbonate of potash or soda, and heated far below
                        redness, it burns vividly at the expense of the carbonic acid; carbonic
                        oxide is disengaged, and the residue is tinged black by carbon deposited. By
                        this process the <hi rend="italic">silicon</hi> is converted into <hi rend="italic">silica,</hi> which combines with the alkali. The atomic weight
                        of silica is 2. From the phenomena of the combustion of silicon, it follows
                        that silica is composed of equal weights of silicon and oxygen. Hence it
                        follows that the atomic weight of silicon is 1, and that silica is a

                        very volatile. It boils below 212°, and the specific gravity of its vapour,

                        that of cyanogen. It seems to possess acid properties. When dropt into
                        water, it swims on the surface of that liquid, and is gradually dissolved,
                        depositing at the same time a little gelatinous silica. By the action of
                        water it is converted into muriatic acid and silica. It follows from this

                        at 218°, and is very liquid and amber coloured till the temperature reaches
                        252°. About 340° it begins to get thick, and assumes a reddish colour; and
                        between ,428° and 482° it is so thick that the vessel containing it may. be
                        inverted without spilling a drop. From 482° to,its boiling point, which is
                        not far from 750°, it becomes thinner, but never so thin as when below 248°,

                        brittle; but if it be suddenly cooled when viscid, it remains quite soft,so
                        that it maybe drawn out into threads. In the first case it crystallizes, in
                        the second case it does not.</p><p>It crystallizes in two different and incompatible forms. 1. An octahedron
                        with scalene triangular faces. It consists of two four-sided pyramids
                        applied base to base, the common base of which is a rhomboid, the larger
                        diagonal of which is to the shorter as five to four. It is found
                        crystallized in this state native. 2. An oblique prism with a rhombic base.
                        The. larger angle of the base is 90° 32', and the base makes an angle of 85°
                        54' with the lateral faces of the prism. This is the form which sulphur
                        assumes when it is fused and left to cool slowly.</p><p>I. Sulphur combines with five different proportions of oxygen, and forms five
                        compounds, all of which are possessed of acid properties. These are <hi rend="italic">sulphuric acid, sulphurous acid, hyposulphurous acid,
                        subsulphurous acid, and hyposulphuric acid.</hi></p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Sulphurous acid.</hi> When sulphur is heated to the
                        temperature of about 300° in the open air, it takes fire and burns with a
                        pale blue flame, and at the same time emits abundance of fumes, having a
                        very suffocating odour. By this combustion it is converted into an invisible
                        gas, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">sulphurous acid</hi> has been
                        given. The easiest method of obtaining this gas in a state of purity is to
                        heat a mixture of sulphuric acid and mercury in a small glass retort by
                        means of a spirit-lamp. An effervescence takes place, and a gas is
                        extricated which must be received over mercury.</p><p>It is colourless, and possesses the mechanical properties of common air. It
                        has a strong suffocating odour, precisely the same as that of burning
                        sulphur. It converts vegetable blues into red, and gradually destroys them.
                        Its specific gravity is 2∙2222. Water absorbs about thirty times its volume
                        of this gas, and acquires the taste, smell, and properties of sulphurous
                        acid. When sulphur is burnt in oxygen gas, the volume of the gas is not
                        altered; but it is converted into sulphurous acid, while at the same time
                        the sulphur disappears. It is evident from this that sulphurous acid is a
                        compound of oxygen and sulphur, and that it contains its own volume of
                        oxygen gas. But the specific gravity of sulphurous acid is just double that
                        of oxygen gas. It must therefore be composed of equal weights of oxygen and
                        sulphur. Its constituents must be</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygen....</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4</p></cell></row></table><p>Now, by analyzing the <hi rend="italic">sulphites</hi> (as the salts

                        shown that the atomic weight of sulphurous acid is 4, if we represent the
                        atomic weight of oxygen by unity. If we suppose this acid to be a compound
                        of one atom of sulphur and two atoms of oxygep, then the atomic weight of
                        sulphur will be 2.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sulphuric acid.</hi> This, acid is made in great
                        quantities&lt; for the use of bleachers and other manufacturers, by burn-
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">ĩ</hi> ing sulphur in leaden chambers. At the same time
                        a quantity of nitric acid from thedeċomposition of saltpetre <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351878" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1878-0375"/> is let
                        into the chamber. The sulphur is converted into sulphurous acid. Five atoms
                        of this acid unite with one atom of nitric acid and two atoms of water, and
                        form a white solid salt, which falls to the bottom of the chamber into a
                        quantity of water placed to receive it. As soon as it comes in contact with
                        the water a strong effervescence takes place, the nitric acid is decomposed
                        and converts the sulphurous into sulphuric' acid, while at the same time a
                        quantity of deutoxide of azote is disengaged. This gas coming in contact
                        with the oxygen of the air, is converted into nitric acid, which combines
                        with an additional dose of sulphurous acid, and is decomposed as before.
                        Thus the process goes on as long as sulphurous acid and oxygen gas exist in
                        the leaden chamber.</p><p>Sulphuric acid thus obtained is a colourless liquid, having some viscidity;
                        and when as much concentrated as possible it has a Specific gravity of
                        1∙837. A stronger acid may be made by exposing sulphate of iron, previously
                        deprived of its water, to a strong heat. When this acid is heated in a
                        retort, a portion of it is Volatilized in the form of a white, fibrous,
                        tough matter, which smokes violently when in contact with the air, and
                        unites with water with great violence. In this state it constitutes
                        sulphuric acid totally destitute of water.</p><p>Sulphuric acid is a very powerful and corrosive acid. It is easy, by the

                        retort, we gradually convert them into sulphuric acid. The weight of the
                        acid thus formed is exactly five.

                        in water to the air, it is gradually converted into five sulphuric acid.
                        Thus we see that four sulphurous acid and five sulphuric acid contain each
                        the same quantity of sulphur, namely two. Consequently the oxygen in them
                        must be, respectively, two and three.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Subsulphurous acid.</hi> A solution of pure sulphurous

                        water. A neutral salt is formed, which dissolves in the water. To the

                        acid be thrown down. There remains in solution hyposulphate of barytes.
                        Crystallize the salt, redissolve it in water, and throw down the barytes by
                        means of sulphuric acid, taking care not to add the acid in excess. Filter
                        the liquid. It now consists of water holding <hi rend="italic">hyposulphuric

Chlorine and sulphur are capable of combining, probably in various

                        bromine on flowers of sulphur. An oily fluid is formed, having a much deeper
                        red colour than chloride of sulphur. It is very volatile, and its smell is
                        analogous to that of chloride of sulphur. Cold water has but little action
                        on it; but with boiling water it slightly detonates; hydrobromic acid is
                        formed together with sulphuric acid and sulphuretted hydrogen. Chlorine
                        decomposes this bromide; bromine is driven off and chloride of sulphur
                        formed.

                        two ingredients in a glass tube, and heating the mixture till it undergoes
                        fusion. A grayish-black mass is obtained, having a radiated structure like
                        that of sulphuret of antimony. It has not been hitherto formed in definite

                        obtained.</p><p>V. From an experiment of Davy, it seems probable that fluoride of sulphur may
                        be formed, and that it is a liquid. He mixed sulphur and fluoride of lead,
                        and distilled in a platinum vessel. Sulphuret of lead was formed, and a
                        liquid volatilized. But the properties of this liquid have not been
                        determined.</p><p>VI. Sulphur forms with hydrogen an important gaseous compound, distinguished
                        by the names of <hi rend="italic">sulphuretted hydrogen</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">hydrosulphuric acid.</hi> It may be obtained by melting iron
                        filings and sulphur in a Hessian crucible. Leaving the sulphuret thus formed
                        in contact with water for twenty-four hours, and then pouring over it dilute
                        sulphuric acid, a copious effervescence takes place, and sulphuretted
                        hydrogen is evolved abundantly. We may obtain it also very pure by pouring
                        concentrated muriatic acid on sulphuret of antimony in the state of
                        powder.</p><p>This gas is colourless, and possesses the mechanical properties of common
                        air. It has a strong foetid and peculiar smell, approaching somewhat that of
                        rotten eggs. Its taste is sweetish, it does not support combustion, nor can
                        animals breathe it without suffocation. Its specific gravity is 1 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 1805. Its refracting power is 2∙187, that of air
                        being unity. When subjected to a pressure of seventeen atmospheres, it is
                        condensed into a transparent and colourless fluid, having a specific gravity
                        of about 0∙9.</p><p>Water absorbs 3∙66 times its volume of this gas. Alcohol absorbs it in still
                        greater quantity. It is soluble also in ether. Water thus impregnated has
                        the smell and taste of the gas, and reddens vegetable blues.</p><p>This gas is combustible; it burns with a bluish-red flame, and at the same
                        time deposits a quantity of sulphur. For complete combustion we must mix one
                        volume of this gas with one and a half volume of oxygen gas.</p><p>When an electric spark is passed through this mixture it is converted into
                        water and sulphurous acid. From this combustion we see that the constituents
                        are hydrogen and sulphur. The sulphurous acid formed amounts to the same
                        volume as that of the sulphuretted hydrogen gas consumed. It is obvious from
                        this that this gas contains one volume of sulphur vapour and one volume of
                        hydrogen gas united together and condensed into one volume; hence its
                        specific gravity is equal to that of these two bodies added together.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Specific gravity of sulphur vapour ...1∙1111</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Specific gravity of hydrogen gas. 0∙0694</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙1805</p></cell></row></table><p>Its atomic constituents are obviously</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom sulphur</p><p>1 atom hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p><p>0∙125</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙125</p></cell></row></table><p>and its atomic weight is 2∙125.</p><p>When electric sparks are passed for a long time through this gas, the whole
                        sulphur is deposited and pure hydrogen gas remains, but the gaseous volume
                        is not altered. When sulphur is heated in hydrogen gas it is partially
                        converted into sulphuretted hydrogen, but the volume of gas is not
                        altered.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Hydrosulphurous acid.</hi> When three volumes of
                        sulphuretted hydrogen gas and two volumes of sulphurous acid gas are mixed
                        together over mercury, they unite together, and are condensed into a solid
                        body, which adheres firmly to the sides of the jar. This compound has
                        received the name of <hi rend="italic">hydrosulphicrous acid.</hi></p><p>It has an orange colour, an acid and hot taste, and it leaves a disagreeable
                        impression in the mouth. It does not alter litmus paper when dry, but if it
                        be moist the paper becomes red. Water, alcohol, nitric acid, sulphuric acid,
                        decompose it and disengage sulphur. When agitated in barytes water, no
                        immediate precipitate appears. For fusion, a higher temperature is requisite
                        than the fusing point of sulphur. When it is kept in fusion an effervescence
                        takes place, and pure sulphur remains behind. From the proportions employed
                        in forming it, it is obviously a compound of one volume sulphurous acid and
                        one and a half volume sulphuretted hydrogen, or, substituting atoms for
                        volumes, we have</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom sulphurous acid</p><p>1⅜ atom sulphuretted

There is another compound of sulphur and hydrogen, which was first
                        observed by Scheele, and to which the name of <hi rend="italic">bisulphuret
                        of hydrogen</hi> has been given. To form it, we may fuse carbonate of potash
                        in a covered crucible, with a considerable excess of sulphur. By this
                        process we obtain persulphuret of potassium, composed of five atoms of
                        sulphur and one atom of potassium. A concentrated solution of this sulphuret
                        is to be poured into dilute muriatic acid by little and little, taking care
                        to mix the two liquids well after every addition. A yellow oily looking
                        liquid collects at the bottom of the vessel. It is transparent if the
                        process has been successfully conducted. This liquid cannot be preserved,
                        undergoing spontaneous decomposition even in well-closed vessels. It is a

                        carbon, and forms a very remarkable compound, first discovered by Lampadius
                        in 1796, while distilling a mixture of pyrites and charcoal. It maybe
                        obtained by filling an inclined poreclain tube with fragments of charcoal,
                        heating it to redness, and making a current of melted sulphur pass slowly
                        through the ignited charcoal. A liquid passes through the tube, which is
                        condensed at the bottom of a glass jar filled with water. Bisulphuret of
                        carbon,'when first formed, is yellow, but when rectified by distillation at
                        the temperature of 110° it is transparent and colourless like water.</p><p>Its taste is acid, pungent, and somewhat aromatic. Its smell is nauseous and
                        fetid, though quite peculiar. Its specific gravity is 1∙272. It boils
                        briskly between 105° and 110°. It does not congeal, though cooled down to —
                        60°. It is very volatile, and produces much cold during its evaporation. A
                        thermometer, the bulb of which is covered with lint moistened with this
                        liquid, sinks in the exhausted receiver of an air-pump to — 82° in less than
                        two minutes. It takes fire when heated to the temperature at which mercury
                        boils, and burns with a blue flame, giving out the smell of sulphurous acid.
                        When its vapour is mixed with oxygen gas it detonates by electricity. If the
                        oxygen gas amount to six or seven times the bulk of the vapour, the whole is
                        converted into sulphurous acid and carbonic acid.</p><p>It is scarcely soluble in water, but dissolves readily in alcohol and ether.
                        When passed through redrhot copper filings, it combines with that metal,
                        forming a carbo-sulphuret. When passed slowly through red-hot peroxide of
                        iron it is completely decomposed, and converted partly into sulphuret of
                        iron, and partly into sulphurous acid and carbonic acid gases. By these
                        processes the proportions of its constituents have been determined, and it
                        has been found a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙75</p></cell></row></table><p>consequently its atomie weight is 4∙75.</p><p>2. There seems likewise to be a solid compound of sulphur and carbon, but its
                        properties have not been accurately investigated. When gunpowder (which is
                        made by triturating together saltpetre, sulphur, and charcoaD is digested in
                        water, the saltpetre is dissolved out. A black matter remains, consisting of
                        sulphur and charcoal, united so intimately that the sulphur cannot be
                        separated by sublimation. But the properties of this substance, which seems
                        to be a compound of five atoms charcoal and one atom sulphur, have not been
                        examined.</p><p>3. From an experiment of Scheele, not attended to by modern chemists, it
                        would seem that a gaseous compound of sulphur and carbon also exists. He
                        mixed per-sulphuret of potassium and well-burnt charcoal, and heated the
                        mixture. A gas was obtained having the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen, but
                        not absorbable by water. It was inflammable, and when burnt, the products
                        were carbonic acid gas and sulphurous acid. Chlorine decomposes it
                        instantly, and a portion of sulphur is deposited.</p><p>VIII. <hi rend="italic">Sulphurei</hi><hi rend="italic">of boron.</hi> When
                        boron is heated to whiteness in the vapour of sulphur, it burns with a red
                        flame. The sulphuret formed is white and opaque. If it be kept red-hot till
                        the vapour of sulphur with which it is surrounded be condensed on the colder

                        remained after the combustion of an impure sulphur extracted from the iron
                        pyrites at Fahlun, to supply a small sulphuric acid work in that place. From
                        this matter it may be extracted in the following manner: Put a pound of it
                        into a tubulated retort, and pour over it, by small quantities at a time, a
                        mixture of 8 lbs. muriatic acid of the specific gravity 1∙2, and 4 lbs.
                        nitric acid of the specific gravity 1∙5. To the retort is to be luted a
                        large globular receiver, from which proceeds a glass tube plunging into a
                        flask filled with water. After every addition of acid a violent
                        efferveseence takes place, and abundance of red vapours pass, which give a
                        reddish-yellow colour to the water in the flask. After adding the whole
                        acid, distil it over into the receiver by a gentle heat. Pour the liquid of
                        the receiver back into the retort, and distil again. Add 1⅜ lb. of strong
                        nitric acid to the matter in the retort, and distil it off. Finally, boil
                        the residue in the retort with a sufficient quantity of distilled water, and
                        throw the whole on a filter. To the liquid thus obtained add fresh sulphite
                        of ammonia. The selenium precipitates in large red flakes, which is to be
                        washed and dried. When the liquid is concentrated, the addition of sulphite
                        of ammonia throws down a new dose of selenium. The acid liquor distilled
                        over contains also some selenium, which may be precipitated by putting into
                        it bars of zinc.</p><p>Selenium thus obtained, when exposed to a heat rather higher than 212°,
                        melts, and on cooling becomes solid. In this state it has the metallic
                        lustre, and a deep brown colour. Its powder is deep red. It crystallizes
                        with difficulty in cubes, or four-sided prisms. Its specific gravity is 4∙3.
                        It is soft, and easily reduced to powder. Ar 212° it becomes semiliquid, and
                        it melts when raised a few degrees higher. After cooling, it remains long in
                        a soft and semifluid state. It is a bad conductor of heat, and a
                        nonconductor of electricity.</p><p>I. It combines with three different portions of oxygen, and forms three
                        compounds, which have been distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">oxide of selenium, selenious acid,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">selenic
                        acid.</hi></p><p>1. Oxide of selenium has not yet been obtained in a separate state. It is
                        formed whenever selenium is strongly heated in the open air, and is
                        distinguished by a very strong smell of horse-radish. Berzelius considers it
                        as a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351917" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1917-0378"/> gas. It does not appear to possess acid or
                        alkaline properties.</p><p>2. Selenious acid may be formed by burning selenium in oxygen gas, or by
                        heating it in contact with nitric acid or aqua regia. When the solution
                        cools, the selenious acid is deposited in large prismatic crystals,
                        longitudinally striated, and similar to nitrate of potash. It distils over
                        at a heat inferior to what is necessary to draw over sulphuric acid. It
                        condenses in the receiver in long foursided needles. Its vapour resembles
                        chlorine gas in colour. Its taste is acid, and it leaves a slightly burning
                        impression upon the tongue. It is very soluble in water and alcohol.</p><p>The atomic weight of this acid is seven, and it is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Selenium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygen .</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>7</p></cell></row></table><p>Hence it is probable that the atom of selenium weighs five, and that
                        selenious acid is a compound of one atom selenium and two atoms oxygen.</p><p>3. Selenic acid may be obtained by detonating an intimate mixture of one part
                        of selenium and three parts of nitre, in small quantities at a time, in a
                        red-hot crucible. The residue, which contains seleniate of potash, is to be
                        dissolved in water, and nitrate of lead added to the neutralized solution,
                        till all the selenic acid is thrown down in the state of seleniate of lead.
                        This powder being washed and diffused in water, a current of sulphuretted
                        hydrogen is passed through the liquid, till the whole lead is converted into
                        sulphurct. The filtered liquid, after being heated to drive off' any excess
                        of sulphuretted hydrogen, is an aqueous solution of selenic acid.</p><p>It may be concentrated by evaporation, till the temperature reaches 536°. But

                        changed into selenious. It resembles sulphuric acid in its consistence, and
                        in the heat evolved, when it is mixed with water. In its most concentrated

                        into a solid matter having a white colour. When this matter is heated, it
                        sublimes without melting, and condenses into small crystals in the upper

                        gravity of hydrogen gas), makes 2*8472 for the specific gravity of

                        acid in water, a sulphuret of seleniuŉi is formed, which renders the liquid
                        muddy and lemonyellow, but does not easily separate. The precipitation is
                        facilitated by the addition of some muriatic acid to the liquid. Sulphuret
                        of selenium has a deep orange colour; it softens at 212°, and becomes liquid
                        at a few degrees higher. At a still higher temperature it boils, and may be
                        distilled over. The portion distilled over is transparent, has a
                        reddish-orange colour, and resembles melted orpiment. It dissolves in the
                        caustic fixed alkalies, and in the sulphohydrates: the solution has a very

                        Klaproth.</p><p>. Tellurium has a silver-white colour, and considerable brilliancy. Its
                        texture is laminated. Its specific gravity is 6*1379. It is very brittle,
                        and may easily be reduced to powder. For fusion it requires a temperature
                        rather -higher than what is necessary to melt lead. It easily boils, and it
                        maybe distilled over in a glass retort.</p><p>I. So far as we know, it combines with only one proportion of oxygen, and
                        forms a compound possessing at once acid and alkaline properties. It has
                        been called <hi rend="italic">oxide of tellurium.</hi> When tellurium is
                        heated before the blowpipe it burns with a blue flame, emitting a white
                        smoke, which is the oxide. It may be obtained most easily by dissolving
                        tellurium in nitro-muriatic acid, and diluting the solution with a large
                        quantity of water. A white powder falls, which is the oxide of tellurium. It
                        is a white, tasteless powder, insoluble in water, but soluble in acids. When
                        heated it melts into a straw-coloured matter, which when congealed assumes a
                        radiated texture. When made into a paste with oil, and heated in charcoal,
                        it is reduced to the metallic state with great facility. It may be
                        volatilized by heat. From the experiments of Klaproth and Berzelius, it
                        would appear that the atomic weight of tellurium is four, and that the oxide

                        chiefly of phosphate of lime. This salt is decomposed by means of sulphuric
                        acid. The liquid, freed from sulphate of lime, is evaporated to dryness. A
                        salt is obtained consistingof phosphoric acid combined with a little lime.
                        This salt is mixed with about one sixth of its weight of charcoal powder,
                        and heated strongly in a stoneware retort, the beak of which is plunged into
                        a receiver containing water. The charcoal decomposes the phosphoric acid,
                        and the phosphorus passes over into the receiver in melted drops.</p><p>Phosphorus is an amber-coloured and semitransparent solid. Its specific
                        gravity is 1*748. When heated to 108° it melts; it evaporates at 219°, and
                        boils at 554°. It crystallizes in dodecahedrons. It is slightly soluble in
                        alcohol, ether, and oils. When taken internally it acts as a poison. When
                        exposed to the open air (unless the temperature be very low) it emits a
                        white smoke having the smell of garlic, and appears luminous in the dark,
                        undergoing in fact a slow combustion. At the temperature of 148° it burns
                        with a very large bright flame, giving out much white smoke, being converted
                        into phosphoric acid. An orange coloured residue<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is an oxide of phosphorus, composed

The easiest method of obtaining phosphoric acid is to saturate the impure
                        phosphoric acid (separated from earth of bones by means of sulphuric acid)
                        with ammonia, which throws down a little phosphate of lime. When the
                        filtered liquid is concentrated it deposits large crystals of phosphate of
                        ammonia. These crystals are to be cautiously heated in a platinum crucible.
                        They melt and swell up, giving out water and ammonia. The heat is to be
                        continued till the matter in the crucible is reduced to a state of
                        tranquillity. Let it be now kept for a little in a red heat, in a state of
                        fusion. On cooling, it will be pure phosphoric acid.</p><p>Phosphoric acid thus prepared is a transparent solid body like glass; its
                        taste is acid. It dissolves very slowly in water; but when sufficiently
                        digested in it, that liquid dissolves a great deal of the acid, without
                        showing any disposition to deposit it again. Liquid phosphoric acid thus
                        obtained is glutinous. It has no smell, but an exceedingly sour taste; it is
                        not corrosive. When heated to redness it parts with most of its water, but
                        not the whole. At a red heat it smokes, and might be wholly volatilized by
                        continuing the heat in an open crucible.</p><p>The atomic weight of phosphoric acid is 4∙5, and it is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom phosphorus</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>9</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2~ atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>so that if we reckon the atomic weight of phosphorus 2, the acid will contain
                        two and a half atoms of oxygen,— certainly an unexpected proportion; but it
                        seems to be established by incontrovertible experiments.</p><p>Mr Clarke observed, that when phosphate of soda is ex- . posed to a red heat,
                        the nature of the acid is changed. He called the newly modified acid <hi rend="italic">pyrophosphoric acid.</hi> Common phosphoric acid throws down
                        oxide of silver of a yellow colour, and the salt is not neutral; but
                        pyrophosphoric acid throws down oxide of silver white, and the salt is
                        neutral. The atomic weight of pyrophosphoric acid is precisely the same as
                        that of phosphoric. Hence its constituents must be the same. But phosphoric
                        acid is a stronger acid than the pyrophosphoric, and decomposes the
                        pyrophosphates.</p><p>2. Phosphorous acid was first obtained pure by Davy, by dissolving chloride
                        of phosphorus in water, and evaporating the solution. The phosphorous acid
                        was obtained in crystals. This acid has an acid taste, and reddens vegetable
                        blues. It is obviously a very feeble acid. When exposed to the air it
                        absorbs oxygen, and is converted into phosphoric acid; but the change goes
                        on very slowly if the acid be concentrated. When mixed with oxide of mercury
                        it is instantly converted into phosphoric acid, while the oxide assumes the
                        metallic state. If we attempt to dissolve iron or zinc in this acid,
                        sesquihydret of phosphorus is given out, and phosphoric acid remains to
                        unite with the oxides of the metals employed.

                        which he gave the name of hypophosphorous acid. It may be obtained thus: Mix
                        together a quantity of barytes and phosphorus, and boil the mixture in a
                        flask with water. Phosphuretted hydrogen gas is given out, and hypophosphite
                        of barytes formed in the liquid. When the process is terminated, the liquid
                        is filtered and mixed with an excess of sulphuric acid, to throw down the
                        barytes. The filtered liquid is left in contact with carbonate of lead. The
                        sulphate of lead remains insoluble, but the hyposulphite of lead dissolves.
                        Filter the liquor and pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen through it.
                        The lead is thrown down, and hypophosphorous acid remains in solution in the
                        water. This acid has a sharp and very sour taste. It is distinguished by the
                        great solubility of all the salts which it forms in water, every one of them
                        hitherto examined being soluble. According to the analysis of Rose, it is a

                        with a capillary beak, it gradually: absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere, and
                        a liquid drops from the beak of the funnel, which may be received in a

                        When thrown into water it acts with great violence, the water is decomposed,
                        and muriatic acid and phosphoric acid are formed. It is obvious from this
                        decomposition that the perchloride is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom phosphorus</p><p>2∣ atoms chlorine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p><p>11∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>13∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>Two atoms of it decompose five atoms of water, the hydrogen of which unites
                        with the chlorine, and the oxygen with the phosphorus. It is therefore
                        analogous to phosphoric acid in its composition.</p><p>III. Bromine and phosphorus likewise combine in two proportions, forming a
                        <hi rend="italic">sesquibromide,</hi> which is liquid, and a perbromide,
                        which is solid.</p><p>When dry phosphorus is dropt into bromine in a glass tube, the action is
                        violent, both heat and light being evolved. Indeed an explosion usually
                        takes place, and the whole is thrown out of the tube. It is best, therefore,
                        to mix the two bodies in minute quantities at a time. Two compounds are
                        formed; a solid body, which sublimes and crystallizes in the upper part of
                        the tube; and a liquid, which remains at the bottom. The solid contains most
                        bromine; for the liquid may by the addition of bromine be converted into the
                        solid.</p><p> 1. The liquid or <hi rend="italic">sesquibromide</hi> does not lose its
                        fluidity when cooled down to 10∙ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 5. It is
                        very volatile, and emits pungent vapours. It is capable of dissolving an
                        excess of phosphorus. When put into water that liquid is decomposed, and
                        hydrobromic acid formed. When the liquid is evaporated to dryness, a slight
                        combustion takes place, and phosphoric acid remains. We see from this that
                        it was phosphorous acid that was formed at first. Hence it is evident that
                        the sesquihromide must be a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>l∣ atom bromine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>15</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom phosphorus</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>17</p></cell></row></table><p>2. The solid <hi rend="italic">bromide</hi> has a yellow colour. When
                        slightly heated it melts into a red liquor, which gives out vapours having
                        the same colour. When these vapours are condensed they crystallize in long
                        needles; but when the fused bromide is allowed to cool, it forms rhomboidal
                        crystals. In the open air it gives out dense and pungent vapours. When mixed
                        with water a double decomposition takes place, hydrobromic acid and
                        phosphoric acid being formed, showing that the constituents of this bromide
                        are</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2⅜ atoms bromine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom phosphorus</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>27</p></cell></row></table><p>IV. Iodine and phosphorus combine also in two proportions similar to the

                        iodine in a glass tube, they unite with great rapidity, and the product is a
                        reddish brown solid body, which melts when heated to the temperature of
                        about 84°. Water decomposes this compound, and converts it into hydriodic
                        and phosphorous acids.

                        decomposed and converted into hydriodic and phosphoric acids. Hence its

                        acid, a little red-coloured phosphorus remaining behind.</p><p>V. When phosphorus is mixed with fluoride of mercury or fluoride of lead, and
                        the mixture distilled in a platinum vessel, a liquid passes over, which is
                        probably a fluoride of phosphorus. It is a fuming liquid, which may be burnt
                        in oxygen gas. When mixed with water it is decomposed into hydrofluoric acid
                        and phosphorous acid, showing that it must be a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>11 atom fluorine</p><p>1 atom phosphorus</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙375</p><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5∙375</p></cell></row></table><p>It is therefore a sesquifluoride.</p><p>The compounds of phosphorus with oxygen, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and

                        them is farther advanced, they will be all equally numerous.</p><p>VΓL Phosphorus combines with hydrogen in various proportions, two of which

                        completely decomposed, and a quantity of muriatic acid gas is formed, equal
                        to three times the volume of the phosphuretted hydrogen gas. But muriatic

                        of hydrogen gas, which will require 0∙75 volume of the oxygen to convert it
                        into water. There remains 1 ’ 125 volume of oxygen to combine with the

                        unites readily to hydriodic acid, and forms a white substance, which

                        obtained also by exposing phosphuretted hydrogen gas to the direct rays of
                        the sun. A quantity of phosphorus is deposited, and the gas is changed into

                        air. Its smell is similar to that of phosphuretted hydrogen, but not so
                        strong. When mixed with oxygen gas, it does not burn spontaneously unless it
                        be rarefied. When so rarefied as to support a column of mercury twenty
                        inches in height, it detonates spontaneously at 68°; but if the temperature
                        be lower the rarefaction must be carried farther.</p><p>Its specific gravity is 1*21527. For complete combustion a volume of it
                        requires one and a half or two volumes of oxygen gas. The products are water
                        and phosphorous or phosphoric acid, according to the quantity of oxygen
                        consumed. When a volume of this gas is heated with corrosive sublimate, it
                        is decomposed, and leaves three volumes of muriatic acid. Hence a volume of
                        it contains one and a half volume of hydrogen gas. The rest is

                        muriatic acid. It is a powder having a dirty lemonyellow colour, and
                        destitute both of taste and smell. It slowly absorbs moisture from the
                        atmosphere. When heated to redness in a close vessel, phosphorus is driven
                        off, and charcoal remains.</p><p>IX. Sulphur and phosphorus combine. Put five parts of sulphur, and seven of

                        in liquid ammonia, and then set the whole aside for some hours. It becomes
                        light yellow, transparent, and of greater fluidity. When left for some weeks
                        in water, it deposits crystals of sulphur, becomes less fluid, and at 40°
                        congeals into a crystalline mass. In this stato it is sometimes a

                        compound, having a dark brown colour, a good deal of lustre, and a vitreous
                        fracture. When the phosphorus is in excess, the compound is red, and
                        destitute of the metallic lustre.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> X.— <hi rend="italic">Of Arsenic.</hi></p><p>Arsenic occurs in commerce in the state of a white heavy body, resembling

                        It is soft, and so brittle that it is easily reduced to a fine powder by
                        trituration in a mortar. Its specific gravity is 5 ’ 672. When kept for some
                        time at a red heat in a close vessel, it acquires much greater brilliancy,
                        and its specific gravity becomes as high as 5∙959. Its melting point has not
                        been determined, but it is volatilized when heated to the temperature of
                        365°. When sublimed slowly it crystallizes in tetrahedrons. When exposed to
                        the air, it soon loses its lustre, and becomes a dirty black on the
                        surface.</p><p>I. It combines with oxygen in two proportions, and forms two compounds, both
                        of which possess acid properties; they are distinguished by the names of <hi rend="italic">arsenious</hi> and <hi rend="italic">arsenic acids.</hi></p><p>1. When arsenic is exposed to a moderate heat in contact with the air, it
                        sublimes in the form of a white powder, and at the same time emits a smell
                        resembling garlic. If the heat be increased, it burns with a pale blue
                        flame. The white matter thus formed is <hi rend="italic">arsenious
                        acid,</hi> seldom made artificially by chemists, because it is in this state
                        that arsenic occurs in commerce, being sublimed chiefly from certain ores of
                        cobalt.</p><p>Arsenious acid is a white, brittle, compact substance. It has a weak but
                        acrid taste, which at last leaves an impression of sweetness. It is one of
                        the most virulent poisons known. A thousand parts of cold water dissolve
                        only two and a half parts of this acid, but 1000 parts of boiling water
                        dissolve 77^ parts of it. The solution has very little taste, but reddens
                        vegetable blues. When slowly evaporated, the acid crystallizes in regular
                        octahedrons. It has been ascertained by accurate experiments that this acid
                        is composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom arsenic</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>l⅜ atom oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>so that its atomic weight is 6∙25, and the atom of arsenic weighs 4∙75. Thus
                        arsenious acid and phosphorous acid are precisely similar in their
                        constitution.</p><p>2. Arsenic acid, the other compound of arsenic and oxygen, was discovered by
                        Scheele. It may be obtained by dissolving metallic arsenic in nitric acid,
                        and evaporating the solution to dryness; or by mixing in a retort two parts
                        of muriatic acid of the specific gravity 1∙2, eight parts of arsenious acid,
                        and twenty-four parts of nitric acid of the specific gravity l∙25. The
                        arsenious acid, by the assistance of heat, dissolves with effervescence.
                        Evaporate the solution to dryness; what remains is arsenic acid.</p><p>Arsenic acid thus prepared is a white matter, having a weak but acid taste.
                        After exposure to a red heat, it dissolves very slowly in water. However, by
                        long digestion, a very concentrated solution may be obtained, which has an
                        intensely acid taste, and which remains liquid even when evaporated to the
                        consistence of a jelly. The constituents of this acid are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom arsenic</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.4∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∣- atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>7∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>so that its atomic weight is 7∙25. It is quite similar in its constitution to
                        phosphoric acid.</p><p>II. Arsenic combines with chlorine, and forms a com pound, to which the name
                        of <hi rend="italic">chloride of arsenic</hi> has been given. It was
                        formerly called <hi rend="italic">butter of arsenic.</hi> It is formed when
                        arsenic is introduced into dry chlorine gas. The metal takes fire
                        spontaneously, and is converted into chloride. But the easiest mode of
                        obtaining it is to mix together six parts of corrosive sublimate and one
                        part of arsenic, and distil, with a gentle heat, in a retort. A liquid
                        passes over into the rcceiver, which is <hi rend="italic">chloride of
                        arsenic.</hi> The following is also a very easy process for forming this
                        chloride. Put into a tubulated retort a quantity of arsenious acid, with ten
                        times its weight of concentrated sulphuric acid. Then throw in by the
                        tubular mouth fragments of common salt which have been recently fused to
                        expel all moisture. Chloride of arsenic passes slowly into the receiver. The
                        heat must be kept up, and additional portions of common salt gradually
                        added. Little or no muriatic acid is disengaged; but some hydrous chloride
                        of arsenic at last passes over, and swims on the surface of the anhydrous
                        chloride.</p><p>Chloride of arsenic is a transparent liquid, of the consistence of oil. It is
                        very volatile. It boils at 270°. Its specific gravity is greater than that
                        of water. When hot, it dissolves phosphorus or sulphur, but lets them fall
                        again on cooling. It likewise dissolves rosin, and combines with olive oil
                        and oil of turpentine. When mixed with water it is decomposed, arsenious
                        acid precipitating. It is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>lļ· atom chlorine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom arsenic</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>11∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>It is therefore asesquichloride, and its atomic weight is 11∙5. The specific
                        gravity of the vapour of this chloride is 6 ’ 4888.</p><p>No doubt a perchloride of arsenic exists, containing two and a half atoms
                        chlorine, analogous to arsenic acid; but it has not yet been subjected to
                        examination. It is solid and white.</p><p>HI. Bromide of arsenic may be formed by putting a quantity of bromine into a
                        tubulated retort, and throwing into it pulverized arsenic till the metal
                        ceases to burn, gently agitating the retort after every addition. When the
                        compound is formed, it may be distilled over into the receiver to get rid of
                        any excess of arsenic that may have been added.</p><p>This bromide becomes solid at 68°, and is liquefied when raised a few degrees
                        higher. It boils, and may be distilled over, at 428°. It has a very light
                        yellow colour. On solidifying it crystallizes in prisms. When mixed with
                        water it is immediately decomposed into hydrobromic acid and arsenious acid.
                        Hence its constituents are obviously</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1⅜ atom bromine</p><p>1 atom arsenic</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>15</p><p>4∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>19∙75</p></cell></row></table><p>It is therefore a sesquibromide, analogous to arsenious acid; and its atomic
                        weight is 19∙75.</p><p>IV. The best way of forming iodide of arsenic is to mix three parts of
                        arsenic in fine powder, ten parts of iodine, and a hundred parts of water,
                        and to digest the mixture till all smell of iodine disappears. The clear
                        liquid is to be poured off, and subjected to evaporation. At a certain
                        degree of concentration, red crystals of iodide of arsenic are deposited. To
                        obtain the iodide pure, we must evaporate the liquid to dryness, and heat
                        the dry residue till it melts. On cooling it has a brick-red colour, and a
                        crystalline texture. It has no smell. Jt may be sublimed. It dissolves in a
                        large quantity of water; but when mixed with a small <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351995" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1995-0384"/> quantity
                        it undergoes decomposition, being converted into hydriodic acid and
                        arsenious acid.</p><p>Hence it is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1⅜ atom iodine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>23∙625</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom arsenic</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>28∙375</p></cell></row></table><p>It is therefore a sesquiodide.</p><p>V. When a mixture of fluor spar, arsenious acid, and sulphuric acid, is
                        heated in a platinum or leaden retort, a fuming colourless liquid passes
                        over, which is a fluoride of arsenic. It smokes, and has a specific gravity
                        of 2∙73. When it comes in contact with water it is converted into fluoric
                        acid and arsenious acid. Hence it must be a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1⅜ atom fluorine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙375</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom arsenic</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8∙125</p></cell></row></table><p>It is therefore a sesquifluoride, analogous to the other compounds of
                        arsenic, with the simple supporters.</p><p>VI. Arsenic combines with hydrogen, and forms a compound which has been
                        called <hi rend="italic">arsenietted hydrogen gas.</hi> It maybe obtained by
                        dissolving in muriatic acid an alloy of arsenic and tin, or an alloy of
                        arsenic and zinc, or by heating arsenic in an alkaline ley. By whatever
                        process it is obtained it is always impure, .being mixed with a large
                        proportion of hydrogen gas. Its purity may be determined by exposing it to
                        the action of a saturated solution of sulphate of copper. The arsenietted
                        hydrogen is absorbed, while the pure hydrogen gas remains. Dumas found that
                        a hundred volumes of the purest gas which he could procure was a mixture of
                        from thirty to twenty-eight arsenietted hydrogen, and from seventy to
                        seventy-two hydrogen gas. Arsenietted hydrogen gas is colourless, has a
                        nauseous smell, is not sensibly absorbed by water, extinguishes flame, and
                        destroys life. It burns with a blue flame, and if the neck of the vessel
                        containing it be narrow, the arsenic is deposited. It explodes with oxygen
                        gas, water and arsenious acid being formed. Sulphuretted hydrogen occasions
                        no change in it; but if chlorine gas be added to the mixture, the bulk
                        diminishes, and yellow-coloured flakes are deposited. Thus these two gases
                        furnish a delicate test of the presence of arsenietted hydrogen gas.
                        Concentrated nitric acid, when suddenly mixed with this gas, causes an
                        evolution of red fumes, and an explosion accompanied with flame.</p><p>When tin is melted in this gas the arsenic is absorbed and the hydrogen set
                        at liberty. A volume of the gas, after this treatment, leaves one and a half
                        volume of hydrogen gas. For complete combustion, one volume of the gas
                        requires one and a half volume of oxygen gas. Of this 0∙75 volume went to
                        the formation of water. There remains 0∙75 (equivalent to one and a half
                        atom) to combine with the arsenic, indicating a volume of arsenic vapour,
                        equivalent to one atom of arsenic. Hence the gas is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1⅜ atom hydrogen</p><p>1 atom arsenic</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙1875</p><p>4∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙9375</p></cell></row></table><p>Hence the atomic weight must be 4∙9375. The weight of a volume of arsenic
                        vapour deduced from the atomic weight of arsenic is 2∙6888. Consequently the
                        specific gravity of the gas must be 2∙79305.</p><p>Nothing is known respecting the combinations of arsenic with azote, carbon,
                        boron, or silicon.</p><p>VII. Sulphur and arsenic combine in various proportions. Four of these
                        compounds are known, and have been subjected to analysis.</p><p>1. Sulphuret, or <hi rend="italic">realgar.</hi> When a mixture of sulphur

                        arsenious acid and sulphur. It is found native, and is then usually
                        distinguished by the name of realgar. It has a scarlet colour, and is
                        frequently crystallized in prisms. Its specific gravity is 3∙3384. It is
                        tasteless, and slightly poisonous. It is sometimes used as a paint. It is

                        its appearance. It is much less fusible than sulphur, and when fused its
                        colour becomes reddish. It sublimes unaltered, and forms a reddish-brown
                        mass, not the least crystalline. When it is boiled in alcohol, a little
                        sulphur dissolves and crystallizes as the alcohol cools. The alkaline

                        not present the broad plates of the antimony of commerce. It crystallizes in
                        octahedrons. It is easily reduced to a fine powder by pounding in a mortar.
                        Its specific gravity is 6 ’ 4366. It melts at 810°, or just at incipient
                        redness. When heated to whiteness before the blowpipe, and thrown on the
                        table, it burns with great splendour, giving out a white smoke, and rolling
                        on the table. It undergoes no change by exposure to the air, except a
                        diminution of its lustre. At a red heat it decomposes water, and is
                        oxydized.</p><p>I. Antimony combines with oxygen in three proportions, and forms three
                        compounds, two of which possess acid properties. The other is an oxide,
                        which constitutes the base of all the active medicinal preparations of this
                        metal.</p><p>1. Oxide of antimony may be obtained thus :—Dissolve antimony in muriatic
                        acid, and dilute the solution with water. A white curdy precipitate falls.
                        Wash it with water, and boil it for some time in a solution of carbonate of

                        converted into arsenious acid. In a retort it may be fused and distilled

                        nitric acid, evaporating to dryness, and exposing the residual matter to a
                        red heat. It has a snow-white colour, but becomes yellow when heated. It
                        cannot be fused nor sublimed at a red heat; nor is it so easily reduced to
                        the metallic state when heated with charcoal, as protoxide of antimony. When
                        heated with a mixture of charcoal and potash, it may be obtained in the
                        metallic state. It combines with bases, and forms sajts, to which the name
                        of <hi rend="italic">antimonites</hi> has been given. Antimonious acid is a

Antimonic acid may be obtained by dissolving anti mony in aqua regia,

                        heating it till that acid is expelled. - We must beware of raising the
                        temperature to redness, otherwise the antimonic acid will lose oxygen, and
                        be converted into antimonious acid.</p><p>It is a straw-coloured powder, tasteless, and insoluble in water. When heated
                        with alkaline carbonates in a crucible, the carbonic acid is driven off, and
                        antimoniates formed. It dissolves in boiling caustic potash. The acids
                        precipitate from this solution hydrated antimonic acid in the state of a
                        white powder.

                        It is therefore a sesquichloride composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1⅜ atom chlorine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom antimony</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>14∙75</p></cell></row></table><p>2. Perchloride of antimony may be formed by passing a current of chlorine gas
                        over heated metallic antimony. The metal burns vividly, emitting sparks,
                        while at the same time a volatile liquid is formed, which is the
                        perchloride. It is white, or has only a light-yellowish tinge. It has a
                        strong and disagreeable smell, and fumes in the atmosphere. Exposed to the
                        air it attracts moisture, and is converted into a white mass, in which
                        crystals form; these crystals afterwards dissolve without rendering the
                        solution milky. When mixed with water it is decomposed and converted into
                        antimonic acid and muriatic acid. Hence it must be a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2^ atoms chlorine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1I∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom antimony</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>19∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>Thus it is analogous in its composition to antimonic acid.</p><p>III. Sesquibromide of antimony may be obtained by putting some bromine into a
                        tubulated retort, and throwing on it antimony in powder as long as that
                        metal continues to take fire. It is then to be distilled over into the
                        receiver. It is much less fusible and volatile than the sesquibromide of
                        arsenic. It melts at about the temperature of 200°, and boils at 518°. It is
                        colourless, and crystallizes in needles. It attracts moisture from the
                        atmosphere. When mixed with water it is decomposed into oxide of antimony
                        and hydrobromic acid.

                        water, is converted into oxide of antimony and hydriodic acid. Hence its

                        sulphurets, analogous in constitution to the oxides of antimony.</p><p>1. Sesqnisulphuret of antimony is found native, and is met with in commerce
                        in the shape of cones, under the name of crude antimony. It has a
                        bluish-gray colour, and the metallic lustre; a foliated texture, and a
                        specific gravity of 4 ’ 62. It is more fusible than antimony, boils in a
                        high temperature, and may be distilled over without decomposition if air be
                        excluded. It dissolves in muriatic acid when assisted by heat, and is
                        converted into oxide of antimony and sulphuretted hydrogen gas. Hence it is

                        gas can be passed through it. It may be easily obtained by fusing together
                        four parts of carbonate of potash, five parts of crude antimony, and one
                        part of sulphur. The fused mass is to be dissolved in boiling water, and
                        precipitated by dilute sulphuric acid. It has a paler colour than bisulphide

                        with a little charcoal powder, and melted in a crucible, phosphuret of
                        antimony is formed. It is white, brittle, and laminated in its texture. When
                        melted, it emits a green flame, and oxide of antimony sublimes.</p><p>IX. Antimony forms with arsenic an alloy, which is brittle, hard, and very

                        chromium. The addition of ammonia throws down the green oxide, which being
                        washed and dried, and exposed to a violent heat in a charcoal crucible, is
                        converted into metallic chromium.</p><p>It is white, intermediate between the colour of tin and I steel. Its specific
                        gravity, as determined by Richter, is 5∙9. It is very brittle, and easily
                        reduced to powder. It is not acted on by the magnet. It requires a heat to
                        melt it, so high that we can obtain it only in small grains. It conducts
                        electricity. No acid dissolves it readily except the fluoric. When heated
                        with potash, soda, or their carbonates or nitrates, it is easily converted
                        into chromic acid.</p><p>I. Chromium combines with two proportions of oxygen, and forms two compounds,
                        which have received the names of green oxide and chromic acid.</p><p>1. Green oxide is easily obtained by digesting a mix∙&lt; ture of chromate of
                        potash and oxalic acid till it becomes’ green, and then throwing down the
                        oxide by means of ammonia. If it be dried without the application of heat,
                        it is a light-coloured greenish-blue powder, tasteless, very light, and
                        easily soluble in acids. When dried on a filter at a temperature not so high
                        as 212°, it is much darker, but still retains nearly half its weight of
                        water. A moderate heat expels the water, and leaves the oxide in the state
                        of a beautiful green powder. When heated nearly to redness, it suddenly <hi rend="italic">glows,</hi> or becomes red hot like burning tinder. After this
                        it is no longer soluble in acids; yet we may obtain a solution by digesting
                        it for a long time in sulphuric acid. The atomic weight of this oxide is 5.
                        It is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom chromium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p></cell></row></table><p>It combines with acids, and forms salts, which have a sweet taste, and a
                        green or blue colour, and none of them seems capable of crystallizing.</p><p>2. It is only lately that a method of obtaining pure chromic acid has been
                        discovered. It is at follows: Mix together four parts of chromate of lead,
                        three parts of pure fluor spar (previously ignited and pounded), and five
                        parts of sulphuric acid as concentrated as possible. Put this mixture into a
                        leaden or platinum retort, and apply a gentle heat by means of a lamp. A red
                        gas is formed, which appears in the air under the form of red or yellow
                        vapours. When this gas comes in contact with water, it is absorbed and
                        converted into fluoric and chromic acids. By evaporating the solution in a
                        platinum basin, the fluoric acid is driven off, and pure chromic acid
                        remains. It may be obtained in regular four-sided prisms by a very cautious
                        evaporation of its solution in water.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193352034" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2034-0387"/><p>Chromic acid, when dry, is almost black while hot, and of a deep red while
                        cold. It has no smell. Its taste is intensely sour, leaving a styptic
                        impression behind. It stains the skin yellow. It is soluble in alcohol, and
                        the solution is partially decomposed by heat, ether being evolved, and green
                        oxide precipitated. The atomic weight of this acid is 6∙5, and it is
                        composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom chromium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.: 4</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2⅛ atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>It is therefore analogous to phosphoric, arsenic, and antimonic acids in its
                        composition.</p><p>II. Chlorine and chromium probably unite in various proportions, few of
                        which, however, have been accurately examined.</p><p>1. Muriatic acid readily dissolves green oxide. The solution has a deep-green
                        colour, a sweet taste, and always contains an excess of acid. When
                        evaporated to dryness it assumes the form of red-coloured scales, which
                        constitute a <hi rend="italic">chloride of chromium.</hi> They readily
                        dissolve in water, with a deep-green colour and a sweet taste. When the heat
                        is raised sufficiently high to drive off all excess of acid, the chloride
                        becomes tasteless, and refuses to dissolve in water or acids.</p><p>2. There is another compound of chlorine and chromic acid, discovered by Dr
                        Thomson in 1824, and called by him <hi rend="italic">chlorochromic
                        acid.</hi> It may be thus obtained. Triturate together in a mortar 190
                        grains of dry bichromate of potash and 225 grains of. decrepitated common
                        salt, and pour upon the mixture 500 grains of concentrated sulphuric acid,
                        and take care to mix it with the powder into a magma. Apply the heat of a
                        lamp to this mixture, previously put into a small retort. An effervescence
                        takes place, and beautiful red fumes make their appearance. These condense
                        in the beak of the retort, and drop into the receiver in the form of a
                        red-coloured liquid, which has a sweetish, astringent, and acid taste. It
                        has an exceedingly intense smell of chlorine. It reddens vegetable blues.
                        Its specific gravity is 1*9134. When dropt into water it falls to the
                        bottom, and exhibits the appearance of a drop of oil; globules of chlorine
                        gas are given out copiously till the globule disappears, while at the same
                        time the liquid becomes yellow. When the red liquid is dropt .into oil of
                        turpentine or alcohol, it sets these combustible bodies on fire; and they
                        burn quietly, with a flame having a good deal of blue mixed with white.
                        Sulphur is also set on fire by the liquid. It burns with a fine red flame.
                        It acts very feebly on the metals. This liquid would appear, from the
                        analysis of Dr Thomson, to be a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom chlorine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom chromic acid</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>11</p></cell></row></table><p>The bromides and iodides of chromium are still unknown.</p><p>III. The red-coloured gas mentioned in this section is probably a fluoride of
                        chromium. It is permanent at the usual temperature of the atmosphere. When
                        mixed with ammoniacal gas it burns with explosion. It gradually corrodes and
                        dissolves resin.</p><p>Nothing is known respecting the compounds which chromium may be capable of
                        forming with hydrogen, azote, carbon, boron, and silicon.</p><p>IV. Sulphuret of chromium maybe obtained by various processes; as by passing
                        a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas over green oxide of chromium, heated
                        to redness in a porcelain tube, or by heating a mixture of equal weights of
                        chloride of chromium and sulphur in a glass tube to as high a degree as the
                        glass will bear. It is a blackish-gray solid body, unctuous to the touch,
                        and fri able. When heated in the open air it burns like pyropho-rus, leaving
                        green oxide of chromium. By digestion in nitric acid, it may be converted
                        into sulphate of chromium. It is clear from this that its constituents
                        are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom chromium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6</p></cell></row></table><p>V.

                        Vanadium.</hi></p><p>Vanadium was discovered during the year 1830, by Μ. Sefström, in a Swedish
                        iron remarkable for its ductility. It is the produce of the iron mine of
                        Taberg, not far from Jönköping. It exists also in an ore of lead, which
                        occurs at Zimapan, in Mexico which was analysed in 1801 by Del Rio, who
                        stated that it contained a new metal, to which he gave the name of
                        erythronium. But Descotils repeated the analysis, and announced that the
                        supposed new metal was chromium. The same ore of lead (vanadiate of lead)
                        occurs in an abandoned lead mine in the county of Wicklow. It has a dirty
                        orange-yellow colour, and is crystallized in tubes.</p><p>Sefström extracted vanadium from the scoriae of the iron of Taberg, which he
                        found richer in that metal than the iron itself. His method was as follows:
                        The scoriae are reduced to a fine powder, and mixed with their own weight of
                        nitre, and twice their weight of carbonate of soda. This mixture is strongly
                        heated for an hour. When cold, the mass is pounded and digested in water
                        till every thing soluble is taken up; the solution is neutralized with
                        nitric acid, and mixed with acetate of lead. A yellow precipitate falls,
                        which is vanadiate of lead, but not quite pure. While this precipitate is
                        still moist, it is decomposed by concentrated sulphuric acid. The liquid
                        assumes a dark-red colour. After half an hour’s digestion alcohol is added,
                        and the digestion continued. Ether is formed, and the vanadic acid being
                        reduced to the state of oxide, becomes <hi rend="italic">blue.</hi> The blue
                        solution is concentrated to a syrup, and then mixed in a platinum crucible
                        with a little fluoric acid, and heated to get rid of a quantity of silica,
                        which could not be otherwise separated. Then evaporate to dryness, and
                        ignite to drive off the excess of sulphuric acid. What remains is an impure
                        vanadic acid. Fuse it with nitre, added in small quantities at a time, till
                        a small quantity of the mass taken out, and allowed to cool, ceases to
                        become red. Then dissolve the mass in water, and filter. Into the filtered
                        liquor put a piece of sal ammoniac, so large that the whole will not
                        dissolve. A white powder falls, which is vanadiate of ammonia. Let it be
                        washed first in a solution of sal ammoniac, and then in alcohol of the
                        specific gravity 0∙86. Then dissolve it in boiling water, and allow it to
                        crystallize. From this salt, by heating it in an open vessel, we obtain
                        vanadic acid, and by heating it in a close vessel, oxide of vanadium.</p><p>To obtain metallic vanadium from vanadic acid, pass a current of chlorine gas
                        through an intimate mixture of vanadic acid and dry charcoal. A liquid and
                        volatile <hi rend="italic">chloride</hi> of vanadium is obtained. Put this

                        saturated, which takes place speedily, and with the disengagement of heat.
                        Then apply a spirit-lamp to the hollow ball, while the current of ammoniacal
                        gas still continues to flow. Sal ammoniac is disengaged, and the reduced
                        vanadium remains in the ball.</p><p>It is white, and resembles silver, or rather molybdenum, to the appearance of
                        which last metal it comes very near. It is not malleable, and is easily
                        reduced to powder in a mortar. It is a good conductor of electricity, and
                        strongly negative when compared to zinc. Its specific gravity is still
                        unknown. It dissolves easily in nitric acid and aqua regia. The solution has
                        a fine blue colour. Sulphuric, muriatic, and fluoric acids, do not act upon
                        it even at a boiling heat; nor is it oxydized when heated with the alkaline
                        carbonates. When heated rather under redness it takes fire, and burns with a
                        dull flame, and is converted into a black-coloured oxide.</p><p>I. Vanadium combines with three different proportions of oxygen, and forms
                        three compounds.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Bloch oxide,</hi> or protoxide. This oxide may be
                        obtained by passing a current of hydrogen gas through vanadic acid in a
                        state of ignition, or by fusing vanadic acid in a charcoal crucible. This
                        oxide is coherent, has a black colour, and is a conductor of electricity. It
                        does not seem capable of combining either with acids or bases. When heated
                        in the open air it takes fire and burns, leaving a black matter, which has
                        not been fused. Chlorine gas converts it into chloride and vanadic acid. Its

                        11⅜ of vanadic acid together, and to heat the mixture to whiteness in an
                        atmosphere of carbonic acid gas. This oxide is infusible at the temperature
                        at which glass softens. It is insoluble in water. When in the state of a
                        hydrate it absorbs oxygen rapidly from the air, becoming first brown, and
                        then green. It dissolves slowly but completely in acids. The solution is
                        blue, and the oxide acts the part of a base; but it combines also with
                        bases, and forms a genus of salts, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">vanadites</hi> may be given.

                        approaching to redness, stirring the mass from time to time. The vanadiate
                        is decomposed, and the residue is at first black, but in proportion as it
                        absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere it assumes a reddish-brown colour, which,
                        when the matter is cold, becomes similar to rust of iron. It is destitute of
                        taste and smell. It strongly reddens moist litmus paper. It melts at a red
                        heat, and may be heated tô whiteness without losing oxygen. When fused it
                        crystallizes on cooling; and though the temperature, before congealing, was
                        below redness, it becomes incandescent, and continues so during the whole
                        time that the crystallization is going on. The acid contracts much in
                        becoming solid, and is easily detached from the crucible. The acid, after

                        obtained from this.mineral by the following process: Roast the molybdena in
                        a moderate heat till it is reduced to a fine powder. Dissolve this powder in
                        ammonia, filter the solution, and evaporate to dryness. Heat the dry salt to
                        drive off the ammonia. A white powder remains, which is oxidc of molybdenum.
                        Mix this powder with a little oil, and expose it to a violent heat in a
                        charcoal crucible. The metal is reduced, but not fused. It may be obtained
                        still more readily by passing a current of dry hydrogen gas over molybdic
                        acid while in a state of incandescence in a porcelain tube.</p><p>. Molybdenum has a silvery white colour. Its specific gravity is 8∙636. It is
                        brittle. It is not altered though kept under water, nor is it liable to
                        alteration from exposure to tire air. Neither dilute sulphuric, nor
                        muriatic, nor fluoric acid dissolve it; but concentrated sulphuric acid
                        attacks it. Nitric acid dissolves it, forming either a nitrate of molybdenum
                        or molybdic acid, according to the proportion of acid employed. It dissolves
                        readily in aqua regia.</p><p>I. Molybdenum combines with three different propor tions of oxygen, and forms
                        three compounds, two of which are bases, and the third an acid.</p><p>1. The protoxide may be obtained in the following way: Dissolve a molybdate
                        in water, and add muriatic acid to the solution till the molybdic acid at
                        first thrown down is again dissolved. Then digest the solution with
                        distilled zinc. It becomes first blue, then reddish brown, and at last
                        black. After the digestion has been continued for some time, add a portion
                        of ammonia (taking care not to add enough to throw down the zinc), and a
                        black precipitate falls, which is the hydrated protoxide of molybdenum. It
                        dissolves with difficulty in acids. The solution is black and opaque, but
                        when very dilute it has <hi rend="italic">a</hi> grayish-brown colour. The
                        taste of these solutions is astringent. When heated in vacuo it parts with

                        incipient redness, it glows and scintillates. It is now insoluble in acids.
                        In the open air it burns faintly at a red heat, and is converted into

                        be found at the bottom of the crucible. It has a crystallized appearance, a
                        deep copper colour, and a specific gravity of 5∙666. If we mix dry molybdate
                        of soda with sal ammoniac, and heat it rapidly in a covered platinum
                        crucible till it ceases to exhale fumes of sal ammoniac, and after the
                        crucible cools we wash what it contains with water, the deutoxide of
                        molybdenum will remain in the state of a very dark-brown powder. Thus
                        prepared, it is insoluble in acids; but it dissolves in them readily while
                        in the state of a hydrate. In this state it is obtained by precipitating
                        chloride of molybdenum by ammonia. It has exactly the appearance of peroxide

                        digest the fused mass in water, which will dissolve the tungstate of potash

                        under the name of <hi rend="italic">potash.</hi> It is obtained by
                        lixiviating the ashes of vegetables which grow at a distance from the sea.
                        The common fern contains a good deal. The salt called <hi rend="italic">cream of tartar,</hi> which is deposited at the bottom of wine casks, when
                        burnt in a crucible, leaves a black matter, which, when lixiviated with
                        water, and the solution evaporated to dryness, constitutes carbonate of
                        potash in a state of purity. When this carbonate is dissolved in ten times
                        its weight of water, and boiled with its own weight of quicklime, it is
                        rendered caustic. When cream of tartar, after being ignited in a covered
                        crucible, is mixed with about one thirteenth of its weight of charcoal, and
                        the mixture is exposed to a strong heat in an iron bottle, with a very wide
                        tube fixed into it, and plunged into a receiver containing naphtha, the
                        potash is decomposed, and <hi rend="italic">potassium</hi> comes over into
                        the receiver in the metallic state. To obtain it pure, it must be distilled
                        over from a green glass retort, previously filled with naphtha, into a
                        receiver, also containing naphtha. The properties of potassium were first
                        determined by Sir H. Davy, to whom we are indebted for the discovery of the
                        composition of the alkaline bodies.</p><p>It is a white metal, like silver. At the temperature of 50° it is a soft and
                        malleable solid. It melts at 1361°, and at 32° it is hard and brittle, and
                        when broken in fragments exhibits a crystalline structure. Nearly a red heat
                        is required to convert it into vapour. Its specific gravity at 60° is
                        0∙86507. It is an excellent conductor of electricity<pb break="no" facs="nls:193352112" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2112-0393"/> and of
                        heat. When exposed to the air, it rapidly absorbs oxygen, and is converted
                        into potash. When thrown on the surface of water, it decomposes that fluid
                        with such rapidity that the metal takes fire, and burns with a red flarnc.
                        When heated in oxygen gas, it burns with a brilliant white light, producing
                        intense beat.</p><p>I. Potassium combines with two proportions of oxygen, and forms two
                        compounds, the first of which is an alkali, the second neutral.</p><p>1. Potassium is converted into potash when put into water. It is formed also
                        by burning potassium in oxygen gas, and continuing the heat to drive off any
                        surplus oxygen with which it may have combined. Its colour is grayish-white,
                        it melts at a red heat, and sublimes when the heat is raised a little
                        higher. The fused mass is hard, breaks with a conchoidal fracture, and has a
                        higher specific gravity than hydrate of potash. It combines with water with
                        such violence, that if only the requisite quantity has been employed, the
                        potash becomes red hot. After being combined with water, we cannot deprive
                        it of that liquid by heat; it always continues a hydrate composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom potash</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom water</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙125</p></cell></row></table><p>ſhe aqueous solution of potash may be crystallized.

                        medicine, and constitutes one of the most important of chemical
                        re-agents.</p><p>2. The peroxide of potassium may be formed by heating potassium in a glass
                        jar filled with oxygen gas. A vivid combustion takes place, and a great deal
                        of oxygen is absorbed. It is a solid body of a yellow colour. It fuses in a
                        high temperature, and on cooling crystallizes in plates. When put into water
                        it effervesces, and is reduced to the state of potash. When surrounded by
                        hydrogen and heated, the gas is absorbed without the appearance of light,
                        and much water is formed. When hydrate of potash is fused in an open silver
                        crucible, the peroxide of potassium is frequently formed, the oxygen of the
                        atmosphere being absorbed, and taking the place of the water. The
                        constituents of peroxide of potassium are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom potassium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8</p></cell></row></table><p>II. When potassium is introduced into chlorine gas, it burns with a brilliant
                        red flame, and is converted into a white salt. If potash be heated in
                        chlorine gas, the oxygen is driven off, and the chlorine takes its place.
                        The chloride thus formed has the taste of common salt. It dissolves readily
                        in water, and crystallizes in right four-sided prisms with square bases. It
                        is not altered by exposure to the air. Its constituents are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom potassium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom chlorine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙5</p><p>9∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>III. When potassium is exposed to the vapour of bromine, a combination takes
                        place. When ether impregnated with bromine is saturated with potash, cubic
                        crystals are obtained, which constitute bromide of potassium. Its taste is
                        sharp and rather disagreeable, but its appearance is very much that of
                        common salt. It fuses at a red heat without decomposition. It is decomposed
                        by sulphuric acid, and even by acetic acid, by the assistance of heat. It is
                        composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom potassium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom bromine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>10</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>15</p></cell></row></table><p>IV. When potassium comes in contact with iodine, it burns with a
                        violet-coloured flame, and is converted into iodide. The compound is white,
                        and similar to common salt. It melts and is volatilized at a temperature
                        below redness. On cooling it crystallizes and assumes a pearly lustre. It is
                        composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom potassium</p><p>1 atom iodine</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p><p>15∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>20∙75</p></cell></row></table><p>V. When potassium is heated in hydrogen gas, there is a certain temperature
                        at which the metal absorbs the gas and becomes a <hi rend="italic">hydret.</hi> In this state it has a gray colour, and is destitute of the
                        metallic lustre. It is infusible, and does not burn spontaneously either in
                        air or oxygen gas. In water it is converted into potash, the hydrogen which
                        it contains being disengaged along with what proceeds from the water
                        decomposed. From the experiments of Gay-Lussac and Thenard, it appears that
                        this hydret is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms potassium</p><p>1 atom hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p><p>0∙125</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5∙125</p></cell></row></table><p>VI. When potassium is prepared from cream of tartar, a black matter remains
                        in the retort after the distillation is over, which seems to be a compound
                        of potassium and carbon. When moistened with a little water it takes fire
                        and burns. When thrown into water it is decomposed with effervescence.</p><p>VII. Silicet of potassium is obtained when silica is decomposed by means of
                        potassium. It is a brown substance, without the metallic lustre. When put
                        into water, hydrogen gas is evolved and silica formed.</p><p>VIII. The sulphurets of potassium are no fewer than five.</p><p>1. When sulphate of potash is mixed with charcoal powder, and exposed to a
                        white heat in a covered crucible, it is converted into sulphurct of
                        potassium. We may obtain the same compound by passing a current of hydrogen
                        gas over sulphate of potash heated to redness in a porcelain tube. This
                        sulphuret has a dark-red colour like cinnabar, and is crystalline in its
                        texture. When heated before the blowpipe it burns for an instant, but is
                        speedily covered by a crust of sulphate of potash, which protects the
                        interior portion from the air. This sulphuret is composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom potassium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>7</p></cell></row></table><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Eisulphuret</hi> of potassium may be obtained by
                        dissolving sulphohydrate of potassium in alcohol, leaving the solution
                        exposed to the air till it begins to become muddy on the surface, and then

                        volatilize it than potassium does. When exposed to the air it rapidly
                        absorbs oxygen, and is converted into soda, but not so rapidly as potassium.

                        process: ‘Mix the mineral in fine powder with a quantity of fluor spar equal
                        to two and a half times the weight of the silica which the mineral contains.
                        Put this mixture into a silver crucible, and make it up into a paste with
                        sulphuric acid. Heat it at first gently, and when the greatest part of the
                        fluosiĭicic acid has made its escape, the heat has to be raised to redness
                        to drive off the excess of sulphuric acid, and to decompose the sulphate of
                        alumina. The dry mass being now lixiviated with water, a solution of
                        sulphate of lithia is obtained, mixed with a little sulphate of lime, which
                        may be separated by careful evaporation and crystallization, or by the
                        addition of a little oxalate of ammonia. The lithia may be thrown down from
                        this sulphate in the state of carbonate, by means of carbonate of ammonia or
                        carbonate of soda; or we may separate the sulphuric acid by adding barytes

                        has a taste fully as caustic as that of potash itself. At a red heat it
                        melts and becomes a transparent liquid. When exposed to the air it does not
                        deliquesce like potash, but remains dry; but it gradually absorbs carbonic
                        acid, and is converted into a carbonate. It is but little soluble in water,

                        powder, mix it with the eighth part of its weight of charcoal powder, and
                        keep it for some time red hot in a crucible, to convert it into sulphuret of
                        barium. Dissolve the sulphuret in water, and add nitric acid to the
                        solution. Filter and evaporate. Nitrate of barytes is obtained in octahedral
                        crystals. Expose these crystals to a red heat in a covered platinum
                        crucible: the nitric acid is driven off, and the barytes remains in a state
                        of purity.</p><p>It is a grayish-white porous body, having a harsh and more caustic taste than

                        Before the blowpipe on charcoal it fuses, bubbles up, and runs into
                        globules, which penetrate the charcoal. This only happens when the barytes
                        is in the state of hydrate. If it be anhydrous, it cannot be fused by means
                        of the blowpipe.</p><p>When a globule of mercury in contact with moistened barytes is connected with
                        the negative end of a galvanic battery, and the circle completed, the

                        amalgam in a glass tube, the mercury is driven off, and <hi rend="italic">barium</hi> obtained in a separate state. It is a white metal, of the

                        volatilized at a heat capable of melting plate glass. When exposed to the
                        air it rapidly absorbs oxygen, and is converted into barytes. It decomposes

                        boiling temperature) by carbonate of soda. The white precipitate, after
                        being washed, dried, and ignited, is pure magnesia.</p><p>Magnesia may be decomposed by the same process as the other alkaline earths,

                        Μ. Bussey has lately ascertained, that when the vapour of potassium is
                        passed over chloride of magnesium heated to redness in a porcelain tube, the
                        magnesium is disengaged, and may be collected on a filter. In this state it
                        is in brown flocks, which, when rubbed in an agate mortar, assume the
                        metallic lustre, and resemble lead in appearance. It is not attacked by
                        dilute nitric acid, but is dissolved in muriatic acid. When heated before
                        the blowpipe, it takes fire, and is converted into magnesia. It has not the
                        property of decomposing water, like the bases of the other alkaline

When heated in chlorine gas, magnesia parts with its oxygen, and is

                        salts.</p><p>III. No accurate experiments have hitherto been made upon the formation of
                        sulphuret of magnesium.</p><p>The oxides of the seven metals described in the preceding sections constitute
                        the most powerful alkaline bodies. They all combine readily with acids, and

                        and magnesia. But to this order there are some exceptions. For example, lime
                        unites to oxalic acid in preference to the other bases when they are all in
                        solution together.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193352177" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2177-0398"/><p>FAMILY SECOND. EARTHY BASES.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of Aluminum.</hi></p><p>Alumina, which is in fact an oxide of aluminum, is an essential constituent
                        of clay, and constitutes the basis of <hi rend="italic">alum,</hi> from
                        which it may be obtained in the following manner. To a solution of alum in
                        water add carbonate of soda, and digest for some time. Then filter, to
                        separate the precipitate that has fallen. Wash it well on a filter, and
                        dissolve it in muriatic acid. Precipitate the alumina from this solution by
                        carbonate of ammonia, and digest the precipitate in a solution of carbonate
                        of ammonia, to remove the muriatic acid as completely as possible. Then wash
                        it and dry it. Alumina may be obtained from ammoniacal alum by simple
                        exposure to a strong heat.</p><p>When dry alumina is intimately mixed with charcoal powder, and a current of
                        dry chlorine gas is passed over the mixture while heated to redness in a
                        porcelain tube, chloride of aluminum is gradually formed, which sublimes,
                        and at last obstructs the farther extremity of the porcelain tube. When this
                        chloride, which is a solid body, is mixed with about equal parts of
                        potassium in a platinum crucible, and after the lid is tied down with a
                        wire, the heat of a spirit-lamp is applied, the mixture becomes suddenly
                        intensely hot, and the potassium unites with the chlorine, leaving the
                        aluminum in a state of purity. When the crucible is cold it is to be plunged
                        into cold water, to dissolve out the potash, and prevent it from acting on
                        the aluminum. Then collect the aluminum on a filter; wash it and dry it.</p><p>. Aluminum obtained by this process has a considerable resemblance to
                        platinum. When burnished it assumes the metallic lustre, and splendour of
                        tin. The scales admit of compression, so that alumina seems to be a
                        malleable metal. It is not fusible at the temperature at which cast iron
                        melts. When exposed to a strong heat, surrounded by charcoal powder, it
                        undergoes no alteration. W hile in powder it is a non-conductor of
                        electricity; but this is the ease with iron also when in the same state. At
                        a red heat it burns with great splendour, and is converted into alumina. The
                        heat produced by the combustion is so intense that the alumina is fused into
                        a button hard enough to cut glass, almost as hard, indeed, as sapphire.
                        Aluminum is not altered by water at common temperatures, but when the water
                        is boiling hot it is very slowly decomposed. It is not attacked by sulphuric
                        or nitric acid while cold; but when heated it dissolves rapidly in sulphuric
                        acid, sulphurous acid being evolved. In dilute sulphuric acid, and in
                        muriatic acid, it dissolves with the evolution of hydrogen gas. It dissolves
                        also with the same evolution in very dilute solutions of potash, and even of
                        ammonia. When heated in chlorine gas it burns, and is converted into
                        chloride of aluminum.</p><p>I. So far as is known at present, aluminum unites with only one proportion of
                        oxygen, and forms the well-known base named <hi rend="italic">alumina.</hi></p><p>Alumina is a fine white powder, destitute of taste and smell, but adhering
                        strongly to the tongue. It is insoluble in water and alcohol. It dissolves
                        readily in caustic potash or soda while in the state of a hydrate. Even
                        liquid ammonia dissolves a small quantity of it in that state. Even after
                        ignition, it dissolves slowly in sulphurie and muriatic acids when assisted
                        by heat. If to the sulphuric acid solution of it we add some sulphate of
                        potash, octahedral crystals of alum are speedily deposited. At the violent
                        heat produced by the oxygen-hydrogen blowpipe, it may be fused into a white
                        semitransparent enamel. Its spceifie gravity is 4∙200. Alumina is a compound

                        Spinell is a compound of one atom magnesia and six atoms alumina. The
                        magnesia undoubtedly acts the part of the base in this mineral, so that
                        alumina is the acid. The affinity between alumina and magnesia is very
                        great. Hence in chemical analyses we sometimes get a compound of the two. It
                        is easily distinguished from pure alumina by theproperty which it has of
                        becoming hot when moistened with water.</p><p>II. The mode of obtaining the chloride of aluminum has been stated at the

                        feebly, and soon deliquesces. In water it dissolves with the evolution of
                        great heat. It is volatilized at a temperature not much higher than that of
                        boiling water. Though this chloride has not been analysed, there can be

                        combination takes place with a very vivid combustion. Sulphuret of aluminum
                        is black, semimetallic, and acquires lustre when burnished. When left in the
                        air it emits a strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen, and falls at last into
                        a grayish-white powder. When it is thrown into water, sulphuret of hydrogen
                        is given out rapidly, and alumina precipitates. Hence its constituents are

                        thing but the silica. Collect the silica on a filter, wash it well, and set
                        it aside. The liquid which passes through is to be reduced by evaporation to

                        by ammonia added in excess. It is a bulky, white powder, similar to hydrate
                        of alumina. The quantity of water which it contains has not yet been
                        determined.</p><p>II. Chloride of glueinum may be formed by passing a current of chlorine gas
                        over an intimate mixture of glucina and charcoal, heated to redness in a
                        porcelain or glass tube. The chloride sublimes in the form of white needles.
                        It is very volatile, and deliquesces speedily when exposed to the air.
                        Glueinum, when heated in chlorine gas, burns with splendour, and is
                        converted into the same chloride.</p><p>III. When glucinum is heated in the vapour of bromine, it takes fire, and is
                        converted into bromide. It is in long white needles, is very volatile and
                        fusible, and dissolves in water with the evolution of much heat.</p><p>IV. Iodide of glucinum may be formed by a similar process. It is also in long
                        white needles, and resembles the two preceding compounds.</p><p>V. When glueinum is heated in the vapour of sulphur, it burns with almost as
                        much splendour as in oxygen gas. The sulphuret is a gray mass, which has not
                        undergone fusion. It dissolves in water with difficulty, and without the
                        evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen gas; but when an acid is added, that gas
                        is given out abundantly.</p><p>VI. Seleniet of glucinum may be made by a similar process as the preceding.
                        The seleniet fuses into a gray mass having a crystalline texture. It
                        dissolves with difficulty in water, and the solution is red, from the
                        selenium disengaged.</p><p>VII. Glucinum burns when heated in the vapour of phosphorus. The phosphuret
                        is gray, and when put intoι water phosphuretted hydrogen gas is evolved.</p><p>VIII. When glucinum is heated along with arsenie, light, is evolved. The
                        arseniet formed is a gray powder, which has not undergone fusion, and which,
                        when put into water, disengages arsenietted hydrogan gas.</p><p>Tclluret of glucinum is similar in appearance to arseniet.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of Yttrium.</hi></p><p>Yttria, which constitutes the oxide of yttrium, is obtained from a scarce
                        mineral called <hi rend="italic">gadolinite, of</hi> a black colour, a
                        glassy lustre, and a specific gravity of 4∙2'37, which has hitherto been
                        found only in Sweden. The process is as follows: Digest the pounded mineral
                        in nitro-niuriatic acid till it is completely decomposed. When the solution
                        is filtered, the silica contained in the mineral is left behind. The
                        solution contains yttria, glucina, eerium, and oxide of iron. Evaporate it
                        to dryness, to get rid of all excess of acid, and dissolve it by digestion
                        in distilled water. To this solution add oxalic acid as long as any
                        precipitate continues to fall, and until the precipitate becomes of a
                        perfectly white colour. The yttria and oxide of cerium are precipitated,
                        while the glucina and oxide of iron remain in solution. The precipitate is a
                        beautiful white light powder. Let it be ignited to decompose the oxalie
                        acid; then dissolve the residual mass in muriatic acid, and put a quantity
                        of sulphate of potash into the solution, considerably greater than can be
                        dissolved. In twenty-four hours the cerium is precipitated in the state of a
                        white powder, while the yttria remains in solution. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352203" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2203-0400"/> yttria may
                        now be precipitated by pure ammonia, and washed and dried. Gadolinite yields
                        about <hi rend="italic">44ļ per cent, of</hi> yttria.</p><p>Yttria may be decomposed, and yttrium extracted from it, by precisely the
                        same process which furnishes aluminum and glucinum.</p><p>Yttrium thus obtained is in small scales, having the metallic lustre and the
                        colour of iron. It is brittle, and does not oxydize at the ordinary
                        temperature in the air or in water. When heated to redness, it burns, and is
                        converted into yttria. When the combustion takes place in oxygen gas, its
                        splendour can scarcely be surpassed. The yttria obtained is white, and
                        exhibits evident marks of having been fused. Yttrium dissolves readily in
                        dilute sulphuric acid, with the evolution of hydrogen gas. It dissolves with
                        more difficulty in potash ley, and not at all in ammonia.</p><p>I. So far as we know at present, yttrium combines with only one dose of
                        oxygen, and forms yttria, which is a fine white powder, destitute of taste
                        and smell. Its specific gravity is 4 ’ 842. It is insoluble in water, but,
                        like alumina, it retains a large quantity of that liquid. It is insoluble in
                        potash and soda leys, which distinguishes it from alumina and glucina; but
                        it dissolves in carbonate of ammonia, and in the other alkaline carbonates;
                        but glucina is much more soluble in carbonate of ammonia than yttria. Its
                        atomic weight appears to be 5∙5, and it is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom yttrium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>II. Chloride of yttrium is easily obtained by passing a current of dry
                        chlorine gas over a mixture of yttria and charcoal exposed to a red heat in
                        a porcelain or glass tube. It has a strong resemblance to chloride of
                        glucinum, being in white brilliant needles, which easily melt into a white
                        crystalline mass. It is volatile, dissolves in water with the evolution of
                        much heat, and speedily deliquesces in the air.</p><p>The bromide and iodide of yttrium still remain to be examined.</p><p>III. When yttria is heated in the vapour of sulphur, it takes fire, and forms
                        a gray powder, which is insoluble in water, and does not undergo spontaneous
                        decomposition. It dissolves in acids with the evolution of sulphuretted
                        hydrogen gas.</p><p>IV. When yttrium is heated with selenium till that substance fuses, a feeble
                        incandescence takes place. The seleniet formed is black, and does not
                        decompose water; but when put into dilute acids, selenietted hydrogen gas is
                        given out.</p><p>V. In the vapour of phosphorus yttrium combines with a lively combustion. The
                        phosphuret is a grayish-black powder, which gives out phosphuretted hydrogen
                        when put into water.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Of Cerium.</hi></p><p>This metal, or at least its oxide, exists in a reddish-coloured mineral found
                        in Sweden, and distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">cerite.</hi>
                        It may be obtained by digesting the pounded mineral in nitric aċid,
                        neutralizing the solution, and adding oxalate of ammonia. A white
                        precipitate falls, which is oxalate of cerium. When heated the oxalic acid
                        is destroyed, and oxide of cerium remains. When this oxide is converted into
                        chloride by a process similar to that described in the first section of this
                        family, while treating of chloride of aluminum, and afterwards decomposing
                        this chloride by potassium, cerium is obtained in the metallic state.</p><p>Thus obtained, cerium is a gray powder, having the metallic lustre; but its
                        peculiar properties have not yet been determined.</p><p>I. Cerium combines with two proportions of oxygen, and forms two oxides, both
                        of which possess the characters of bases. The <hi rend="italic">protoxide,</hi> when in the state of a carbonate, is white; the <hi rend="italic">peroxide</hi> is yellow or brownish-red.</p><p>1. The peroxide is obtained when the oxalate of cerium is heated to redness
                        in an open vessel. Thus obtained, it has a reddish-brown colour, is
                        tasteless, and may be exposed to a strong heat without undergoing any
                        alteration. When we digest it in muriatic acid, chlorine is disengaged, and
                        the solution becomes less and less coloured, till at last it has only a
                        slight flesh-red colour. The reason of this is, that the peroxide, by the
                        action of the muriatic acid, is gradually converted into protoxide. The
                        protoxide may be thrown down from the muriatic solution, by carbonate of
                        ammonia, in the state of a carbonate. It is then a white, soft, tasteless
                        powder, which dissolves readily in acids. The salts which it forms have a
                        sweet taste, like those of yttria. Indeed they resemble the salts of yttria
                        so closely in all their properties, that it is exceedingly difficult to
                        distinguish the one from the other. From the recent experiments of Dr Steel,
                        it would appear that the atomic weights of cerium and its oxides are as
                        follows:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Cerium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Atomic weights.</p><p>5∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Protoxide of cerium ..</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Peroxide of cerium....</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>7</p></cell></row></table><p>II. There are two chlorides of cerium, but they have not yet been carefully
                        examined. The protochloride is obtained when oxide of cerium is digested in
                        muriatic acid till the solution becomes almost colourless. It crystallizes
                        with difficulty in four-sided prisms. It deliquesces in the air, is very
                        soluble in water, and also in alcohol, and the alcoholic solution burns with
                        a yellow-coloured flame.</p><p>The perchloride is a reddish-yellow solution, which gelatinises by cautious
                        evaporation. It does not crystallize, and when heated is gradually converted
                        into protochloride.</p><p>The bromides and iodides of cerium are still unknown.</p><p>III. It would appear, from Laugier’s experiments, that cerium combines with
                        carbon. The carburet is obtained when protocarbonate of cerium is made into
                        a paste with oil, and heated in a retort surrounded by charcoal. It is a
                        black matter, which takes fire spontaneously when exposed to the air.</p><p>IV. Sulphuret of cerium may be formed by passing the vapour of bisulphide of
                        carbon over oxide of cerium heated to redness in a porcelain tube. It is
                        light and porous, and similar to red lead in colour.</p><p>When oxide of cerium is mixed with alkaline hepar in great excess, and
                        exposed to a white heat in a covered crucible, and the hepar afterwards
                        washed off with water, a sulphuret of cerium remains in brilliant scales,
                        like mosaic gold in appearance.</p><p>V. When a stick of phosphorus is put into a solution of cerium in muriatic
                        acid, and kept for some days on a stove, the bottom and sides of the vessel
                        are covered with a white precipitate. The phosphorus itself becomes coated
                        with a hard brown crust, which was tenacious, and shone in the dark., When
                        heated it took fire, and left a small quantity of oxide of cerium.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V.— <hi rend="italic">Of Zirconium.</hi></p><p>Zirconia, which constitutes, an oxide of zirconium, exists as a constituent

                        specific gravity of 4∙7. To obtain zirconia from this mineral, reduce it to
                        a fine powder, mix it with thrice its weight of potash, and fuse it in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352216" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2216-0401"/>
                        a platinum crucible. Digest the fused mass in water till all the potash is
                        abstracted; then dissolve it as far as possible in muriatic acid. Boil the
                        solution, to precipitate any silica that may have been dissolved; then
                        filter, and add a quantity of potash. The zirconia precipitates in the state
                        of a white powder.</p><p>Zirconia thus obtained may be dissolved in fluoric acid, and by the addition
                        of the requisite quantity of potash or fluoride of potassium, and
                        evaporation, we may obtain the salt called <hi rend="italic">potashfluate of
                        zirconia.</hi> Reduce this salt to powder, and render it anhydrous by
                        exposure to heat. Then mix it in an iron tube with potassium, the two
                        substances being introduced in alternate layers. Hcat the tube till the
                        potassium melts, and then mix the two substances by means of an iron wire.
                        Shut the mouth of the tube, and heat it over a spirit-lamp till it begins to
                        get red hot. The zirconia is reduced in the tube, and converted into
                        zirconium, which remains mixed with a quantity of fluate of potash. Allow
                        the tube to cool, and then wash out its contents with water. The fluate of
                        potash dissolves, and the zirconium falls to the bottom of the vessel in the
                        state of a black powder.</p><p>Thus obtained, it has a close resemblance to charcoal powder. Though rubbed
                        by a burnisher, it does not acquire the metallic lustre. To free it from
                        some hydrate of zirconia with which it is mixed, it may be kept for five or
                        six hours in dilute muriatic acid at the temperature of 100°. Then wash the
                        zirconium first in a solution of sal ammoniac, and afterwards in
                        alcohol.</p><p>Thus purified, zirconium has some resemblance to plumbago, being composed of
                        brilliant scales. It is a non-conductor of electricity. When heated in
                        hydrogen gas, or in vacuo, it is not altered. It does not fuse even in a
                        strong heat. When heated in the open air it takes fire long before it is red
                        hot, burns quietly, and is converted into zirconia, which is perfectly
                        white. When it contains hydrate of zirconia it burns with a kind of
                        explosion, which throws every thing out of the tube. When mixed with
                        chlorate of potash it takes fire when violently struck, but burns without
                        detonating. In fused nitre it does not burn at a heat below redness. When
                        mixed with carbonate of potash it burns at the expense of the carbonic acid
                        with a feeble disengagement of light. It burns also in melted borax, in
                        consequence of the water which the salt retains. For the same reason it
                        burns in the alkaline hydrates. At the ordinary temperature it is not acted
                        on by sulphuric or muriatic acid. Even when long boiled in these acids the
                        action is very small. Neither nitric acid nor aqua regia is capable of
                        dissolving it; but it dissolves readily in fluoric acid, with the
                        disengagement of hydrogen gas. A mixture ofnitric and fluoric acid dissolves
                        it with great rapidity. It does not dissolve in caustic alkaline leys.</p><p>I. We know only one compound which it is capable of forming with oxygen,
                        namely, <hi rend="italic">zirconia.</hi></p><p>Zirconia is a white powder, which feels somewhat harsh when rubbed between
                        the fingers. It has neither taste nor smell. It is infusible before the
                        blowpipe, but when heated violently in a charcoal crucible it undergoes a
                        kind of imperfect fusion, acquires a gray colour, and something of the
                        appearance of porcelain. In this state it is very hard, has a specific
                        gravity of 4*3, and is no longer soluble in acids. Zirconia, though
                        insoluble in water, has a considerable affinity for that liquid. When dried
                        in the open air, after precipitation, it retains about one third of its

                        in a black mineral from the neighbourhood of Christiania, in Norway, to
                        which the name of thorite has been given. It resembles obsidian, but has a
                        specific gravity of 4∙63. From this mineral it may be obtained by the
                        following process:</p><p>Reduce the mineral to powder, and digest it in muriatic acid till it is
                        dissolved. Evaporate the solution to dryness, and digest the residue in
                        muriatic acid, and filter to get rid of the silica. Caustic ammonia added to
                        the liquid rather in excess precipitates the thorina still contaminated with
                        various foreign bodies. Dissolve the precipitate while still moist in
                        muriatic acid, and pass a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas through the
                        liquid to throw down a little tin and lead which it contains. Evaporate
                        gently to dryness, redissolve in water, and precipitate again by caustic
                        potash added in excess to retain in solution a little alumina which is
                        present. Dissolve the new precipitate in muriatic acid, neutralize with
                        caustic ammonia, and then add as much sulphate of potash as the liquid is
                        capable of dissolving. A fine white powder falls. Collect it on a filter,
                        and wash it with a saturated solution of sulphate of potash. Dissolve this

                        in the state of a white powder, which may be washed and dried.</p><p>When thorina is mixed with charcoal powder and heated to redness in a
                        porcelain tube, while a current of chlorine gas passes over it, chloride of
                        thorium is obtained. When this chloride is mixed with potassium and heated
                        in a platinum crucible, a slight detonation takes place, heat, but no light,
                        being evolved. The thorium is reduced. By washing it with water the chloride
                        of potassium is separated, and thorium remains in the state of an iron-gray
                        coloured powder having the metallic lustre. Like aluminum, it appears to be
                        malleable. It is not oxydized by water, even when assisted by heat. When
                        gently heated in the open air it burns with much splendour, and is converted
                        into thorina. Sulphuric acid acts upon it very feebly, and nitric acid
                        exhibits still less energy; but muriatic acid dissolves it rapidly with the
                        evolution of hydrogen gas, if we assist the action by heat. It is not acted
                        on by caustic alkalies.</p><p>I. The only known compound of thorium and oxygen is <hi rend="italic">thorina,</hi> which may be obtained in the state of a hydrate by adding
                        caustic potash to the solution of thorina in an acid.</p><p>Hydrate of thorina is gelatinous, falls rapidly, and contracts much while
                        drying. While moist it dissolves rapidly in acids, but much more slowly when
                        dry. The salts which it forms have a styptic taste. The hydrate is insoluble
                        in the caustic alkalies; but it dissolves in the carbonates, and the
                        solubility increases with the concentration of these liquids. It is more
                        soluble in cold than in hot carbonate of ammonia. Ammonia does not
                        precipitate thorina from a saturated solution in carbonate of ammonia, as it
                        does zirconia. When this hydrate is strongly heated, it gives out its water,
                        and becomes very hard, and difficult to pulverize. In this state it is
                        soluble in no acid but the sulphuric. It is not rendered soluble in acids by
                        calcining it with a caustic or carbonated alkali. When the alkali is
                        extracted after such a calcination, the thorina cannot be washed with pure
                        water, but forms with it a milky liquid, which passes through the filter.

                        properties:</p><p>1. Its sulphate is precipitated from its solution by raising it to the
                        boiling temperature, and dissolves again, though slowly, in cold water. This
                        property is peculiar to thorina.</p><p>2. It is insoluble in caustic alkaline leys, which distinguishes it from
                        alumina and głucina.</p><p>3. It forms with potash a double sulphate, which is soluble in water, but
                        insoluble in a saturated solution of sulphate of potash. This distinguishes
                        it from yttria.</p><p>4. Zirconia forms a similar double sulphate with potash, but it is almost
                        wholly insoluble in cold water. This distinguishes it from thorina. Besides,
                        the salts of thorina are precipitated by prussiate of potash, which is not
                        the case with the salts of zirconia.</p><p>5. From the protoxide of cerium it is distinguished by not becoming reddish
                        brown, but continuing white, when it is calcined; and by not forming a
                        coloured bead before the blowpipe, either with borax or with biphosphate of
                        soda.</p><p>II. Chloride of thorium is formed by the process described at the beginning
                        of this section. We are still ignorant of its properties.</p><p>III. Sulphuret of thorium is formed when a mixture of the two constituents is
                        heated in a close vessel, and brilliant combustion accompanies the
                        combination. The sulphuret is brown, acquires brilliancy when burnished, but
                        never assumes the metallic lustre. When heated in hydrogen gas it undergoes
                        no alteration. In the open air the sulphur may be sublimed by heat, and the
                        thorium is converted into thorina. It is scarcely acted on by sulphuric,
                        nitric, or muriatic acids, even when the action is assisted by heat. Aqua
                        regia dissolves it completely by the assistance of heat, and converts it
                        into sulphate of thorina.</p><p>IV. Phosphuret is formed when thorium is heated in the vapour of phosphorus.
                        The combination is accompanied by the evolution of light. The phosphuret has
                        a gray colour, and the metallic lustre; and has some resemblance to
                        plumbago. It is not altered by water; but when heated it takes fire, and is
                        converted into phosphate.</p><p>THIRD FAMILY.—DIFFICULTLY FUSIBLE BASES.</p><p>This family includes some of the most useful bodies in existence.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of Iron.</hi></p><p>Iron is one of the seven metals with which the ancients were acquainted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These were gold, silver,

                        goodness of the ore. In general three and a fourth tons of raw ore arc

                        cone, from thirty-six to sixty feet in height. It is built of good fire
                        brick, and is double to keep in the heat. Limestone is used as a flux, to
                        separate the clay with which the ore is always contaminated. In general two
                        and a fourth tons of roasted ore require nineteen hundredweight of
                        limestone; or, in round numbers, three tons of raw ore require one ton of
                        limestone. About six tons of coal are required to make one ton of iron. But
                        the coal loses nearly half its weight in coking, so that uncoked coal must
                        go a good deal farther.</p><p>The furnace is always kept full, and after being lighted is never

                        tapped every twenty-four hours, and the melted iron is allowed to run into
                        sand moulds, and cast into ingots usually called <hi rend="italic">pngs.</hi> The scoriae flow out after the iron, and are thrown away. By

                        No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3. Of this No. 1 is the most, and No. 3 the least
                        valuable, while in the state of cast iron. These three qualities are easily
                        distinguished by the scoriae.</p><p>The scoriae of No. 1 are uniform in colour and appearance, glassy, and feebly
                        translucent.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193352242" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2242-0403"/><p>The scoriae of No. 2 are opaque, heavy, of a yellowish-green colour,

                        sulphuretted hydrogen gas.</p><p>When the cast iron is intended to be used in the state in which it is first
                        obtained, the object of the smelter is to form No. 1, though this is not
                        always in his power. But when the iron is to be converted into bar-iron, the
                        cast iron is always obtained in the state of No. 2. The composition of the
                        scoriae in that case is most commonly two atoms silicate of lime and one
                        atom silicate of alumina; but there is usually present also some silicate of
                        iron and silicate of magnesia.</p><p>To convert cast iron into bar-iron three successive processes are requisite.
                        The first of these is called <hi rend="italic">refining.</hi> By this
                        process it is converted into No. 3, or <hi rend="italic">white cast
                        iron.</hi> Six pigs of cast iron are put at once into the furnace, and
                        covered with coke above and below. They are fused, and kept in that state
                        for twenty-four hours. Much carbonic oxide gas is given out during this
                        process, and burns with a blue flame. It is drawn, cast into a cake, and
                        cooled by water. It is now white and very hard. Its fracture is fibrous, and
                        it is often filled with spherical cavities.</p><p>The scoriae from this process are obviously derived from impurities in the
                        cast iron, and from the ashes of the coke. They are black, metallic, often
                        fibrous, and crystallized. A specimen of these scoriae was found composed of
                        one atom phosphate of alumina, and eight and a half atoms silicate of iron.
                        The loss sustained during the process varies from twelve to seventeen per
                        cent. For every ton of cast iron refined, from two to two and a half tons of
                        coke are employed.</p><p>The second process, called <hi rend="italic">puddling</hi><hi rend="italic                         subscript"> i</hi> was contrived by Mr Cort of Gosport in 1785. It lasts
                        about two hours and a half. The <hi rend="italic">metal</hi> of the last
                        process is put into a reverberatory furnace, in which it is arranged round
                        the edges. Heat is applied by the flame of pit-coal, which is made to play
                        upon it. The metal softens; it is stirred, and gradually falls to pieces.
                        The fire is then lowered, and the stirring continued till the metal is
                        reduced to the consistence of sand. In this state much carbonic oxide is
                        given out; and when the evolution of the gas is over, the fire is raised,
                        and the stirring continued. The particles begin gradually to cohere, or to
                        <hi rend="italic">worh heavy</hi> as the workmen term it. The operator now
                        collects the iron into balls, and raises the heat to a welding temperature.
                        It is then taken out of the furnace, and either hammered or rolled into
                        bars. During this process the scoriae are squeezed out, and the iron left in
                        a state of purity.</p><p>The loss of weight sustained by the iron in this process varies from eight to
                        ten per cent. The scoriae formed are black, very heavy, and sometimes
                        crystallized in the form of pyroxene. Most commonly they consist of
                        scsquisili-cate of iron.</p><p>The bars of iron thus formed are called <hi rend="italic">mill bars.</hi> The
                        quality is so bad that this iron is scarcely fit for any purpose. To improve
                        it the bars are made to go through another process, called <hi rend="italic">welding.</hi> The bars are heated red hot, and cut in pieces by scissors.
                        Four of these bars are placed one above another in a reheating furnace. In
                        half an hour they begin to adhere. They are then drawn out into bars by
                        means of a cylinder. When very good iron is required, as for anchors, this
                        welding process is repeated.</p><p>Scoriae appear during this process. They are lamellar and steel gray. In
                        their cavities they contain crystals of pyroxene. They consist of
                        sesquisilicate of iron, with a little sesquisilicate of alumina.</p><p>Iron has a grayish colour and the metallic lustre, and when polished has a
                        good deal of brilliancy. Its hardness exceeds that of most metals, and when
                        in the state of steel it may be rendered harder than most bodies. Its
                        specific gravity is 7∙843 after hammering. It is attracted by the magnet,
                        and may be itself converted into a permanent magnet. It is malleable at
                        every temperature, and the malleability increases as the temperature
                        augments. It is very ductile, and may be drawn out into wires finer than a
                        human hair. When drawn out into wire, its strength is one and a half times
                        that of hammered iron. It begins to be elongated, or to lose its shape, when
                        subjected to a force amounting to two thirds of that which is capable of
                        breaking or bursting it. An iron wire 0Ό78 inch in diameter is capable of
                        supporting 449∙34 lbs. avoirdupois without breaking.</p><p>When iron is exposed to the air, especially to moist air, it soon tarnishes,
                        and becomes covered with a brownish-red matter, well known by the name of
                        <hi rend="italic">rush</hi> It is occasioned by the gradual combination of
                        the iron with oxygen. At a red heat it decomposes water rapidly, hydrogen
                        gas being given out, and the iron converted into an oxide.</p><p>I. Iron combines with two doses of oxygen, and forms &lt; two oxides. The <hi rend="italic">protoxide</hi> is blackish blue, the <hi rend="italic">peroxide</hi> red.</p><p>1. The protoxide of iron is formed whenever iron is dissolved in dilute
                        sulphuric or muriatic acid. The solution is light green, and when an alkali
                        is dropt into the liquid, the protoxide of iron falls in the state of
                        light-green flocks, which gradually collect at the bottom of the vessel, and
                        assume a black colour. Its tendency to absorb oxygen is so great that we
                        cannot collect it so as to allow it to retain its colour. When a current of
                        hydrogen gas is passed through peroxide of iron heated in a glass tube
                        considerably under redness, it is gradually converted into protoxide. In
                        this state it has a blackish-blue colour, appearing by reflected light
                        almost black. In the open air it burns with great splendour, and is
                        converted into peroxide.

                        smell, insoluble in water, but soluble in acids, especially the muriatic.
                        After exposure to a red heat, it loses much of its easy solubility in acids.

                        cast iron.</hi></p><p>1. Black cast iron is the softest of the three. Its specific gravity varies
                        from 6∙90102 to 6 ’ 836. It is imperfectly malleable, and admits of being
                        easily turned on the lathe and filed down. It melts at a comparatively low
                        heat. Its texture is granular. It is much used in this country for the
                        numerous purposes to which cast iron is applied.</p><p>2. Gray or mottled iron is so called from the inequality of the colour. Its
                        specific gravity is 7∙0683. It is harder than the black variety, but soft
                        enough to be cut, bored, and turned on the lathe. It is much used. For many
                        purposes it is found expedient to mix No. 1 and No. 2, and fuse them
                        together. Artillery is usually made of mottled cast iron.</p><p>3. White cast iron has a white colour like silver. Its texture is fibrous or
                        crystalline, and its specific gravity 7 ’ 6849. It is too hard to be filed,
                        bored, or bent, and it is very apt to break when suddenly heated or
                        cooled.</p><p>Black cast iron seems to be a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3 atoms iron</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>10∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>11∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>While white cast iron is composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms iron</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>14</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙75</p></cell></row></table><p>including in the carbon a little silicon, which is variable in quantity.
                        Mottled cast iron is intermediate between the white and black. It has not
                        yet been subjected to analysis.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Steel</hi> is a compound of iron of the utmost consequence,
                        because it is from it that all the cutting instruments and files are made.
                        The iron which answers best for being converted in to steel is that made at
                        Dannemora, in Sweden. The Russian iron, known by the name of old sable, is
                        also capable of being converted into good steel.</p><p>The furnace in which iron is converted into steel has the form of a large
                        oven or arch, terminating in a vent at the top. The floor of this oven is
                        flat and level. Immediately under it there is a large arched fire-place with
                        grates, which runs quite across from one side to the other, so as to have
                        two doors for putting in the fuel from the outside of the building. In the
                        oven there are two large and long cases or boxes built of good fire-stone,
                        and in these boxes the bars of iron are regularly stratified with charcoal
                        powder, ten or twelve tons of iron being put in at once, and the box is
                        covered at the top with a bed of sand. The heat is kept up, so that the
                        boxes and all their contents are kept red hot for eight or ten days. A bar
                        is then drawn out and examined, and if it be found sufficiently converted
                        into steel, the fire is drawn and the oven allowed to cool. This process is
                        called cementation.</p><p>The bars of steel formed in this way are raised in many places into small
                        blisters, by a gas evolved in the inside of the bar. On this account the
                        steel made in this way is usually called <hi rend="italic">blistered
                        steel.</hi> Its texture is not quite equable, but it is rendered so by
                        fusing it in a crucible, and then casting it into bars. Thus treated, it is
                        called <hi rend="italic">cast steel.</hi> When steel is to be cast it is
                        made by cementation in the usual way, only the process is carried somewhat
                        farther, so as to give the steel a whiter colour. It is then broken into
                        small pieces, and put into a crucible of good fire-clay, after which the
                        mouth of the crucible is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352268" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2268-0405"/> filled up with vitrifiable sand, to prevent
                        the steel from being oxydized by the action of the air. The crucible is
                        exposed for five or six hours to the most intense heat that can be raised,
                        by which the steel is brought into a state of fusion. It is then cast into
                        parallelopipeds about a foot and a half in length. To fuse a ton of steel
                        about twenty tons of coals are expended.</p><p>The specific gravity of good blistered steel is 7∙823; but by heating it to
                        redness, and then plunging it into cold water, the specific gravity is
                        reduced to 7∙747. The colour of steel is whiter than that of iron. Its
                        texture is granular, its fracture is whitish gray, and much smoother than
                        the fracture of iron. It is much harder and more rigid than iron, nor can it
                        be so much softened by heat without losing its tenacity, and flying to
                        pieces under the hammer. It requires more attention to forge it than to
                        forge iron; yet it is by its toughness, and capability of being drawn out
                        into bars, that good steel is distinguished from bad. Steel is more readily
                        broken by bending it than iron. If it be heated to redness, and then
                        suddenly plunged into cold water, it becomes exceedingly hard, so as to be
                        able to cut or make an impression on most other bodies; but when iron is
                        treated in the same way, its hardness is not in the least increased. When a
                        drop of nitric acid is let fall upon a smooth surface of steel, and allowed
                        to remain on it for a few minutes, and then washed off with water, it leaves
                        a black spot; whereas the spot left by nitric acid on iron is greenish
                        white. Steel is not so easily converted into a magnet as iron; but when once
                        converted it retains its magnetic virtue, whereas iron loses it immediately
                        when the exciting cause is withdrawn. Steel possesses great elasticity, and
                        the elasticity appears to be the same in all states of temper.</p><p>Steel, like cast iron, is a compound of iron and carbon, but it contains much
                        less carbon than even white cast iron. Cast steel would appear to be a

When iron filings and boracic acid are fused in a covered crucible, a
                        ductile mass of a silver colour is obtained, which is probably a <hi rend="italic">boruret</hi> of iron. A <hi rend="italic">silicet</hi> of iron
                        may be obtained by a similar process, substituting silica for boracic acid.
                        The properties of this silicet approach very nearly those of the
                        boruret.</p><p>VIII. There exists a strong affinity between iron and sulphur. Five
                        sulphurets of iron are known, and others may be discovered hereafter.</p><p>1. Sulphuret of iron may be formed by passing hydrogen gas over pyrites in
                        powder, and heated to redness in a glass tube. One half of the sulphur is
                        disengaged, and there remains a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom iron</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>The same sulphuret is obtained when iron is heated to whiteness, surrounded
                        by sulphur vapour. The union is accompanied by the fusion of the sulphuret,
                        and a good deal of heat is evolved. Its colour is that of bronze or black
                        when in powder, and it dissolves in sulphuric or muriatic acid with the
                        evolution of much sulphuretted hydrogen gas. It may be obtained also when
                        iron pyrites is distilled at a red heat; one half of the sulphur flies off
                        and leaves the sulphuret.</p><p>2. Sesquisulphuret of iron may be formed by passing a current of dry
                        sulphuretted hydrogen gas over peroxide of iron in a glass or porcelain tube
                        heated to the temperature of <hi rend="italic">212°.</hi> The gas must be
                        continued till all evolution of water is at an end. The sesquisulphuret
                        formed has the same form as the peroxide had. It has a gray colour, with a
                        slight shade of yellow, and acquires lustre under the burnisher. It is not
                        altered by exposure to the air. When distilled, sulphur is given out and
                        common sulphuret remains. When treated with acids, sulphuretted hydrogen gas
                        is evolved, iron is dissolved, and a quantity of bisulphurct of iron remains
                        undissolved. Its constituents are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom iron</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1⅜ atom sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>3.

                        brittle, and sufficiently hard to strike fire with steel. Its specific
                        gravity is about 4 ’ 5. It usually crystallizes in striated cubes. When
                        heated it is decomposed. In the open air the sulphur takes fire. In close
                        vessels filled with charcoal, part of the sulphur is volatilized, and a
                        black matter remains, which is common sulphuret. It is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom iron</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4</p><p>7∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>4. Disulphuretof iron may be obtained by passing a current of dry hydrogen
                        gas over anhydrous sulphate of iron heated in a glass tube. Sulphurous acid
                        and water pass over first, and at last sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The
                        disulphuret is a dark-gray agglutinated powder, strongly attracted by the
                        magnet. It dissolves in muriatic acid with the evolution of sulphuretted
                        hydrogen gas.

Tetrasulphuret of iron may be obtained by exposing anhydrous disulphated

                        tube. Sulphurous acid and sulphuretted hydrogen gas are evolved. The
                        sulphuret obtained resembles metallic iron. It is powerfully acted on by the
                        magnet, and is semiductile; but it dissolves in muriatic acid with the

When a mixture of selenium and iron filings is heated, a combination
                        takes place without any appearance of combustion. But if th^e selenium be
                        put into the bottom of a glass tube, and iron filings above it, and a
                        sufficient heat be applied to volatilize the selenium, the iron filings
                        absorb this vapour and become red hot, and this ignition continues as long
                        as any selenium is absorbed. The seleniet thus formed has the metallic
                        appearance, and a gray colour, with a shade of yellow. It does not melt, but
                        becomes agglutinated together into a coherent mass. It dissolves readily in

Iron combines with antimony by fusion, and forms a brittle, hard,
                        white-coloured alloy, the specific gravity of which is less than
                        intermediate. The magnetic quality of iron is much more diminished by being
                        alloyed with antimony than with most other metals.</p><p>XIII. When oxides of iron and of chromium are mixed together, and strongly
                        heated in a covered crucible lined with charcoal, they are reduced, and melt
                        together into an alloy. Its texture is crystalline, and it is whiter than
                        platinum.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of Manganese.</hi></p><p>Manganese is found usually in the state of a gray or black oxide, having
                        often considerable lustre, and giving out the eleventh of’ its weight of
                        oxygen gas when exposed to a red heat. It is seldom pure, being almost
                        always contaminated with oxide of iron. To purify it, the easiest process is
                        to roast the impure manganese ore, previously reduced to a fine powder, with
                        a quantity of charcoal powder. This brings the manganese to the state of
                        protoxide. It is now treated with a sufficient quantity of dilute sulphuric
                        acid, to dissolve almost, but not the whole of the manganese, and this acid
                        is mixed with muriatic acid. The solution takes place with the evolution of
                        much heat. The iron is peroxydized and thrown down by the excess of
                        protoxide of manganese present. The liquid, on standing, becomes transparent
                        and colourless. When sufficiently concentrated, abundance of crystals of
                        sulphate of manganese are obtained, contaminated merely with a little
                        chloride or bichloride of manganese. Dissolve these crystals in water, and
                        add to the solution carbonate of soda. A copious white precipitate falls,
                        which is pure carbonate of manganese. When this carbonate is mixed with
                        charcoal and exposed to an intense heat in a covered crucible, it is reduced
                        to the state of metallic manganese.</p><p>Manganese thus obtained is rather whiter than cast iron. Its texture is
                        granular, and it may be reduced to powder by pounding in a mortar. Its
                        specific gravity is 8 ’ 013. It is not attracted by the magnet. It gradually
                        absorbs oxygen from the atmosphere, and decomposes water; but when alloyed
                        with iron it loses that property, and may be kept without alteration.</p><p>I. Manganese has a strong affinity for oxygen. It is capable of forming at
                        least four oxides, and the existence of a fifth, containing less oxygen than
                        any of the rest, is far from improbable.</p><p>1. The protoxide constitutes the base of almost all the salts of manganese.

                        other oxides of manganese, heated in a glass tube, but not to redness. It is
                        a light-green powder, which becomes yellow, and then brown, when exposed to
                        the air.

                        carbonate of manganese in nitric acid, evaporate the solution to dryness,
                        and raise the dry mass by degrees to an incipient red heat. It is a black
                        powder, having considerable lustre. It is tasteless and insoluble in water,
                        but dissolves in sulphuric and muriatic acids, and the solution is red. It
                        occurs native both in the hydrous and anhydrous state. Its constituents
                        are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom manganese</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1⅜ atom oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p></cell></row></table><p>so that it corresponds in its constitution with peroxide of iron.</p><p>3. Binoxide of manganese exists native; its colour is: iron black, its lustre
                        metallic, and its texture fibrous. It is soft, rather sectile, and has a
                        specific gravity varying from 4∙94 to 4∙819. It constitutes the most
                        important of all the ores of manganese, from the property which it has of
                        giving out oxygen when heated. When a current of chlorine gas is passed
                        through water in which carbonate of manganese is suspended, this oxide is
                        formed. Carbonic acid is disengaged, part of the manganese is dissolved, and
                        part is converted into hydrated binoxide. By digesting the brown residue in
                        dilute nitric or acetic acid, any unaltered carbonate is dissolved, and the
                        binoxide remains pure. It is a very bulky and light-brown powder, which
                        retains its bulk when dried on the water bath, and adheres strongly to those

                        heat. By this process a light-green mass is obtained, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352294" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2294-0407"/> is
                        considered as a <hi rend="italic">submanganate of barytes.</hi> Reduce this
                        matter to a very fine powder, and mix it with thirty times its weight of
                        water. Through this mixture pass a current of carbonic acid gas till the
                        liquid assumes a violet colour, and till the sediment at the bottom has
                        changed from green to brown. Then boil the liquid for a quarter of an hour,
                        and add a drop or two of sulphuric acid to throw down any barytes that may
                        still remain in solution, taking care not to add any excess. The liquid now
                        consists of a solution of manganesic acid in water. By evaporation to
                        dryness in a gentle heat the acid may be obtained in a solid state.</p><p>Manganesic acid thus obtained is in very small needles. It is a hydrate,
                        composed of two atoms manganesic acid and one atom water. This water is
                        essential to the existence of the acid. When we attempt to drive it off, the
                        acid is decomposed. Manganesic acid has a dark carmine-red colour, and is
                        destitute of smell. It has a disagreeable taste, being a kind of mixture of
                        bitter and astringent. It is heavier than water. It is capable of being
                        converted into vapour by heat, and may be again condensed without
                        decomposition. When it is mixed with sulphuric acid the temperature rises to
                        at least 226°, and a violet vapour appears, which is said to be a compound
                        of manganesic and sulphuric acids. Manganesic acid is but little soluble in
                        water. It is gradually decomposed by exposure to light, and likewise by
                        heat. The aqueous solution soon loses its colour when kept boiling hot.
                        Oxygen, chlorine, and azote, have no action on it whatever. Iodine
                        decomposes it in consequence of its conversion into hydriodic acid.
                        Hydrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, and charcoal, decompose it. Most of the
                        metals have the same effect. It is decomposed by zinc, iron, bismuth,
                        copper, antimony, lead, mercury, and silver, in a longer or shorter time.
                        Sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, arsenic acid, chromic acid,
                        boracic acid, and carbonic acid, have no action on it. Sulphurous acid and
                        smoking nitric acid destroy it immediately without throwing down any
                        manganese. It is decomposed also by the hydracids. This acid, from the best
                        analysis of it hitherto made, is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom manganese</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2⅛ atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>•</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6</p></cell></row></table><p>Its atomic weight is six, and it agrees in its constitution with phosphoric,

                        heat, it gives out oxygen, and varies in colour according to the state of
                        the oxide subjected to heat. The usual colour is a brownish red or a
                        brownish black. The oxide formed by this process is usually called <hi rend="italic">red oxide</hi> of manganese by chemists. It is a compound

Perchloride of manganese may be formed in the following manner: Form
                        common green chameleon mineral, and change it to red chameleon by adding
                        sulphuric acid. When the solution is evaporated, a mixture of sulphate and
                        manganate of potash is obtained. Mix this matter with concentrated sulphuric
                        acid, and project into it common salt by small fragments at a time as long
                        as coloured vapours continue to arise. The perchloride of manganese is given
                        out in the form of a green vapour, which being made to pass through a glass

                        the solution to dryness, and subliming the residual salt.</p><p>III. When nickel and iodine are heated in a glass tube, a brown fusible mass

Nickel combines with carbon, and forms a carburet. Indeed, as usually
                        prepared, it is never destitute of carbon. It is always obtained when oxide
                        of nickel and charcoal powder are heated together in a covered crucible. The
                        quantity of carbon present is not great, but it has not been determined by
                        analysis.</p><p>V. We are acquainted with two combinations of nickel and sulphur.</p><p>1. Sulphuret of nickel exists native, and is known by the name of haarkies.

                        nitromuriatic acid, without any other residue than a little sulphur. It is

                        the magnet.</p><p>2. When a current of dry hydrogen gas is passed over anhydrous sulphate of

                        cubes or dodecahedrons, very heavy, and known by the name of <hi rend="italic">cobalt-glance.</hi> It is chiefly a compound of cobalt,
                        arsenic, and sulphur. The cobalt may be separated from it by the following
                        process: Reduce the ore to powder, and roast it in a moderate heat to drive
                        off a portion of the arsenic and sulphur. Then dissolve it in nitric acid,
                        and evaporate the solution to dryness, and digest the dry mass in water. A
                        quantity of arseniate of iron remains undissolved. Should the ore contain no
                        iron, a little of that metal should be added to the nitric acid solution.
                        Filter off the aqueous solution, and pour into it a quantity of binoxalate
                        of potash previously dissolved in water. In a few hours the whole cobalt
                        precipitates in the state of oxalate. Digest this oxalate in ammonia, which
                        will dissolve it, and set the solution aside in an open vessel till the
                        excess of ammonia has had time to be dissipated. The oxalate of nickel,
                        should any be present, will precipitate, and the oxalate of cobalt in a
                        state of purity will remain in solution. Evaporate to dryness, and expose
                        the oxalate of cobalt to a red heat in a covered vessel. The cobalt is
                        reduced to the metallic state, and by exposure to a violent heat, while
                        covered with a little borax, it may be fused into a mass.</p><p>. Cobalt has a gray colour, with a shade of red, and is by no means
                        brilliant. Its texture is usually granular. It is rather soft. Its specific
                        gravity is 8∙7. It is brittle, and easily reduced to powder. Like iron, it
                        is attracted by the magnet, and it may be converted into a magnet, which is
                        not quite so powerful as a magnet of iron. It dissolves very slowly in
                        dilute sulphuric and muriatic acids, with the evolution of hydrogen gas; but
                        nitric acid dissolves it readily. It may be kept either in the open air or
                        under water without undergoing any sensible alteration.</p><p>I. Cobalt, when kept red hot in the open air, is gradually oxydized. In a
                        violent heat it takes fire and burns with a red flame. Like iron and nickel,
                        it combines with two proportions of oxygen, and constitutes two distinct
                        oxides.</p><p>1. Protoxide of cobalt may be obtained by dissolving the metal in nitric
                        acid, and precipitating by potash. The precipitate has a blue colour, but
                        when dried in the open air gradually becomes greenish. When heated to a
                        cherry red, however, it again recovers its original blue colour. It
                        dissolves in acids without effervescence. The solution in muriatic acid,
                        when concentrated, is green, but when diluted red. The sulphuric and nitric
                        acid solutions are always red. It gives a fine blue colour to glass, and is
                        used for paintina blue on stoneware. It is soluble in caustic and carbonated
                        ammonia, and the solution has a brownish-red colour, and is not precipitated
                        by caustic potash. It dissolves in caustic potash, and the solution has a
                        blue colour. It is thrown down unaltered· by dilution with water. It is

When the protoxide of cobalt, newly precipitated from an acid, is dried in
                        the open air, it assumes a flea-brown colour, which gradually deepens, till
                        at last it becomes black. In this state it constitutes <hi rend="italic">peroxide of cobalt.</hi> It may be formed also by passing a current of
                        chlorine gas through water in which the protoxide is suspended, or by
                        agitating the protoxide in a saturated solution of chloride of lime. It
                        dissolves in none of the acids except the muriatic, and during its solution
                        in that acid much chlorine gas is evolved. Its specific gravity is 5∙322. It
                        is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom cobalt</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>l⅜ atom oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙75</p></cell></row></table><p>II. Cobalt burns when gently heated in chlorine gas. When protoxide of cobalt

                        mass remains. When this matter is heated in a retort, chloride of cobalt
                        sublimes in the form of a blue-coloured voluminous snow. It gradually

                        soon loses its metallic lustre. The phosphorus is separated by heat, and the
                        cobalt at the same time oxydized. This phosphuret is much more fusible than
                        pure cobalt.</p><p>VI. Arsenic and cobalt have a strong affinity for each other. Almost all the
                        ores of cobalt contain arsenic. It is found native, combined with arsenic in
                        three proportions, forming a sesquiarseniet, binarseniet, and terarseniet of
                        cobalt.</p><p>FOURTH FAMILY. EASILY FUSIBLE BASES.</p><p>Of the eight metals belonging to this family, five were known to the ancients
                        in the metallic state. Zinc in the metallic state was unknown to them; but
                        they were acquainted with its oxide, and with the alloy which it forms with
                        copper. Bismuth was unknown in Germany before the year 1500, while cadmium
                        was discovered by Stromeyer about the year 1817.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of Zinc.</hi></p><p>Zinc is found in the earth either in the state of an oxide combined with
                        carbonic acid or silica, when it is called <hi rend="italic">calamine,</hi>
                        or in the metallic state united with sulphur, when it is distinguished by
                        the name of blende. Metallic zinc is usually obtained by heating a mixture
                        of calamine and charcoal in earthen vessels shut above, and having a pipe
                        issuing from their bottom, and terminating in a bucket of water. The zinc is
                        reduced and volatilized. It enters the tube, and drops in small pieces into
                        the water. It is then cast into ingots.</p><p>Zinc has a white colour, with a shade of blue, and is composed of plates
                        adhering together. It is rather soft. Its specific gravity after fusion is
                        6∙896. By hammering it may be made as high as 7∙1908. At the common
                        temperature of the air it is scarcely malleable, yet it is too tough to be
                        reduced to powder by pounding in a mortar. When heated a little above 212°
                        it is very malleable, and may be rolled out into thin plates, which retain
                        their flexibility when cold. At the temperature of 400° it is so brittle
                        that it may easily be pounded in a mortar. It melts at about 680°, or before
                        it is quite red hot. It is very little altered by exposure to the air. When
                        kept under water it is said to become black, and to occasion the evolution
                        of hydrogen gas.</p><p>I. So far as is known at present, zinc unites with only one proportion of
                        oxygen. The oxide is easily formed by heating zinc to redness in the open
                        air. It takes fire and burns with a brilliant white flame, and emits a vast
                        quantity of white flakes somewhat like cobwebs. These constitute oxide of
                        zinc. This oxide may be obtained also by dissolving zinc in sulphuric acid,
                        and filtering and crystallizing the solution. The crystals are to be
                        dissolved in boiling water, and the solution mixed with carbonate of soda. A
                        white precipitate falls, which, when washed, dried, and∙ignited, constitutes
                        pure <hi rend="italic">oxide of zinc.</hi></p><p>Oxide of zinc is snow-white. When heated it assumes a yellow colour, but
                        becomes again white when allowed to cool. It is tasteless, and insoluble in
                        water; but it dis solves readily in acids, and the solution is colourless.
                        It dissolves also in concentrated caustic ammonia, but is partly
                        precipitated again when the solution is diluted with water. Barytes or lime
                        water also occasions a precipitate when poured into the same solution. The
                        affinity between oxide of zinc and alumina is considerable. When a solution
                        of oxide of zinc in ammonia, and of alumina in caustic potash, are mixed

                        with difficulty in muriatic acid, giving out sulphuretted hydrogen gas. Aqua

                        extracted by the following simple process. Digest the matter in dilute

                        down in the metallic state. It may be washed, dried, and fused.</p><p>Cadmium has a white colour, with a shade of bluish gray, and approaches
                        nearest to tin in its appearance. It is very malleable, and may be rolled
                        out into thin flexible plates, which have no elasticity, but retain any form
                        given them. Its specific gravity after fusion is 8∙6040. By hammering it may
                        be made as high as 8∙6944. It is very fusible, melting before it becomes red
                        hot. It is also volatile, being converted into vapour by a temperature not
                        much higher than that of boiling mercury. It is not altered by exposure to
                        the air.</p><p>I. Cadmium, like zinc, unites with only one proportion of oxygen. When heated
                        to redness in the open air it burns, and is converted into a brownish-yellow
                        powder, which is the oxide. The easiest mode of obtaining this oxide is to
                        dissolve cadmium in dilute sulphuric, muriatic, or even nitric acid, and
                        precipitating the solution, which is colourless, with an alkali. The
                        precipitate, when washed, dried, and ignited, is pure oxide of cadmium. This
                        oxide has a yellow colour, is fixed in the fire, and does not melt in a
                        white heat. It is insoluble in the fixed caustic alkalies, but dissolves
                        readily in ammonia. It is insoluble in carbonate of ammonia, which
                        distinguishes it from oxide of zinc. When sulphuretted hydrogen gas is
                        passed through its solution a fine yellow precipitate falls, which was at
                        first taken for orpiment. The specific gravity of oxide of cadmium is 8∙183.

                        small transparent rectangular crystals are obtained. When these crystals are

                        ore of it is galena, or sulphuret of lead; a heavy mineral, having the
                        metallic lustre, a great deal of brilliancy, a bluish-white colour, and a
                        specific gravity of 7∙568. It is soft and brittle, and crystallizes in
                        cubes, and sometimes in octahedrons. This galena is roasted, and then heated
                        on a hearth along with coal and a small quantity of limestone. The lead is
                        reduced and cast into large ingots or pigs. It usually contains silver. When
                        the quantity of that metal present is sufficient to defray the expense, it
                        is put upon a cupel made of bone ashes and a little potash, and exposed in a
                        reverberatory furnace to a blast of air from a bellows placed conveniently.
                        The lead is oxydized, and fused, and blown oft’ in yellow-coloured flakes
                        called <hi rend="italic">litharge,</hi> while the silver remains behind upon
                        the vessel. The litharge is again reduced to the state of lead by simply
                        heating it on a hearth along with coal.</p><p>Lead has a bluish-white colour, and a good deal of lustre; but it soon
                        tarnishes. It is very soft, and when drawn upon paper leaves a bluish
                        metallic stain behind it. Its specific gravity after fusion is 11∙351.
                        Muschenbroeck affirms that, when drawn out into wire, its specific gravity
                        is diminished. Guyton Morveau assures us, that by hammering lead into a
                        mould, he could increase the specific gravity. But Mr Crichton of Glasgow
                        tried this repeatedly without being able to succeed. Lead is very malleable;
                        it is also ductile, but the wire has but little tenacity. It melts when
                        heated to 606°. By exposure to a very strong heat it may be volatilized.</p><p>I. Lead combines with three different proportions of oxygen, and forms three
                        oxides, distinguished by their colour: the protoxide is <hi rend="italic">yellow,</hi> the sesquioxide <hi rend="italic">red,</hi> and the peroxide
                        <hi rend="italic">brown.</hi></p><p>1. Protoxide of lead is easily obtained by dissolving lead in nitric acid,
                        precipitating the solution by carbonate of soda, washing and drying the
                        white precipitate, and then exposing it to incipient ignition. We may form
                        it also by simply exposing good white lead to incipient ignition. It is a
                        light-yellow powder, which is destitute of taste, and insoluble in water,
                        but soluble in nitric and acetic acids, and likewise in potash or soda ley.
                        It melts in a strong red heat, and forms a semitransparent, brittle, hard,

                        this change. When these ashes are heated and agitated for a short time in an
                        open vessel, they assume the form of a greenish powder. By continuing to
                        expose this powder to heat it assumes a yellow colour, and is then known in
                        commerce by the name of <hi rend="italic">massico.</hi> This massico is
                        nothing else than protoxide of lead.</p><p>2. When massico is ground to a fine powder, put into a furnace, and kept
                        constantly stirred while the flame of burning coals plays on its surface, it
                        is gradually converted into a beautiful red powder known by the name of <hi rend="italic">minium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">red lead.</hi></p><p>Red lead is a tasteless powder, of a beautiful scarlet colour, and having a
                        specific gravity of 9∙096. It loses no sensible weight at a heat of 400°,
                        but when heated to redness it gives out oxygen gas, and is converted into
                        protoxide of lead. It does not combine with acids; but several acids
                        dissolve it by reducing it to the state of protoxide. This happens also when
                        it is dissolved in potash ley.</p><p>If we pour vinegar on red lead, and digest it for some time, a portion of
                        protoxide of lead is dissolved, the red lead loses its orange colour, and
                        acquires a dark brownish red hue. It is evident from this that red lead is a
                        mixture of protoxide of lead, which dissolves in the vinegar, and of

                        converted into a chloride. This chloride is easily obtained by mixing
                        together a solution of 20∙75 parts of nitrate of lead and 7∙5 parts of
                        common salt. A precipitate falls, consisting of small, white, silky
                        crystals. When heated to redness they melt without losing weight, and are

                        precipitate falls, having the crystalline appearance of chloride of lead.
                        When strongly heated this matter fuses into a red liquid, which gives out
                        white fumes, and which on cooling concretes into a beautiful yellow
                        substance. This bromide, while a powder, is decomposed by nitric and
                        sulphuric acids, bromine being disengaged; but after fusion it is not
                        attacked by nitric acid, though it may be still decomposed by boiling

Lead combines readily with iodine when the two substances are heated
                        together. The iodide of lead has a fine yellow colour. It is precipitated
                        whenever a hydriodate is dropt into a solution of lead. It is insoluble in
                        water, but dissolves in potash ley and undistilled vinegar at a boiling
                        temperature, and when the solution cools it falls down in yellow plates. It

There seem to be three combinations of sulphur and lead.</p><p>1. Sulphuret of lead may be formed by dropping sulphur into melted lead as
                        long as it continues to be absorbed. It exists abundantly native, and
                        constitutes common galena. It has the metallic lustre, and is much less
                        fusible than lead. It is composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom lead</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>13</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>I atom sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>15</p></cell></row></table><p>When exposed to a red heat in the open air it partly sublimes in the state of
                        sulphate of lead. When mixed with iron and heated, the lead is disengaged,
                        and the iron unites to the sulphur; but by this process it is not easy to
                        obtain the whole lead. A portion is apt to remain mixed with the sulphuret
                        of iron.</p><p>2. When a current of dry hydrogen gas is passed over sulphate of lead heated
                        to redness in a glass tube, the lead is reduced to the metallic state, while
                        all the oxygen and half the sulphur of the acid are disengaged. Thus a
                        disulphuret is formed, composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms lead</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>26</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>28</p></cell></row></table><p>3. Besides the common sulphuret of lead, there occurs another, occasionally,
                        lighter in colour and less brilliant, which burns in the flame of a candle
                        with a blue flame. It is a compound of twelve atoms lead and thirteen atoms
                        sulphur. The simplest view of this galena is to consider it as a compound of
                        eleven atoms sulphuret of lead and one atom bisulphuret of lead. If this
                        view be admitted, it is plain that a bisulphuret must exist, though it has
                        not yet been formed artificially.</p><p>VI. Lead and selenium readily unite, and heat is evolved during the
                        combination. The lead swells, and forms a porous mass of a gray colour,
                        which does not melt at a red heat, but is soft, easily polished, and has the
                        whiteness of silver.</p><p>VII. Phosphuret of lead is white, with a shade of blue, but soon tarnishes
                        when exposed to the air. It maybe cut with a knife, but separates into
                        plates when hammered.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193352372" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2372-0413"/><p>VIII. Arseniet of lead is brittle, dark coloured, and composed of plates.</p><p>IX. Lead is hardened by antimony, and the alloy (mixed with a little tin)
                        constitutes printers’ types.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Of Tin.</hi></p><p>Almost the only ore of tin which occurs native is a dark-coloured, brilliant
                        mineral, very hard and heavy, and known by the name of <hi rend="italic">tinstone.</hi> It consists of peroxide of tin, usually contaminated with a
                        little peroxide of iron. This ore, reduced to a fine powder, is mixed with
                        coal and some limestone, and heated strongly in a reverberatory furnace, so
                        as to bring the whole into a state of fusion, which is kept up for about
                        eight hours. The tin is reduced, and falls by its weight to the bottom,
                        where it accumulates, and at the end of about eight hours is let out by
                        tapping a hole in the furnace, which had been filled with clay.</p><p>To purify the tin thus obtained, it is put back into the furnace, and exposed
                        to a heat just sufficient to melt it. The pure tin flows out into a kettle,
                        while a quantity of impurities remains behind unmelted. The tin in the
                        kettle is kept in fusion and agitated, by which a quantity of impurity
                        accumulates on the surface. It is skimmed off, and the tin, now refined, is
                        cast into blocks.</p><p>Tin has a fine white colour, with a slight shade of blue, and has a good deal
                        of brilliancy. Its hardness is between that of gold and lead. Its specific
                        gravity after fusion is 7∙285∙,∙by hammering it may be made as high as
                        7∙299. It is very malleable: tin-leaf, or <hi rend="italic">tinfoil</hi> as
                        it is called, is about γ0 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> 00th of an inch
                        thick, and it might be made much thinner if requisite. It is ductile, but
                        its tenacity is small compared to iron, or even copper or silver. Tin is
                        very flexible, and produces a remarkable crackling noise when bended. It
                        melts when heated to 442°; but a very violent heat is necessary to cause it
                        to evaporate. It soon tarnishes in the air, but undergoes no farther
                        change.</p><p>1. Tin combines with two different proportions of oxygen, and forms two
                        oxides, distinguished by their colours, the protoxide being <hi rend="italic">blach</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and the
                        peroxide <hi rend="italic">yellow.</hi></p><p>1. The protoxide of tin may be obtained by the following process: Digest tin
                        in muriatic acid till a saturated solution is obtained. Precipitate the
                        liquid by means of carbonate of soda; collect the precipitate on a filter,
                        wash it, and press it between folds of blotting paper, and dry it in a
                        temperature not exceeding 180°. By this process a hydrated protoxide is
                        obtained in the state of a white powder. Put it into a small retort, which
                        must (as well as the receiver) be filled with hydrogen or carbonic acid gas;
                        then raise the retort gradually to an incipient red heat. The water will be
                        driven off, and the protoxide remains in an anhydrous state. It is a black
                        powder, without lustre, tasteless, and insoluble in water. When kept dry it
                        is not liable to alter by keeping, but in a moist place it gradually absorbs
                        oxygen, and is converted into peroxide. When heated in the open air it burns
                        brilliantly, and is converted into peroxide. It dissolves in acids without
                        effervescence, and the hydrate more easily than the anhydrous oxide. It
                        dissolves in the fixed alkaline leys, but is insoluble in caustic ammonia
                        and in carbonate of potash, in both which the peroxide dissolves. It is a
                        compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom of tin</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>7∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom of oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>2. The peroxide of tin exists abundantly native, though scarcely ever free
                        from an admixture of iron. It has a yellow colour, and is translucent, or
                        almost transparent, and is crystallized in octahedrons having a square base,
                        or in modifications of that form. Its specific gravity is about 6∙6, and it
                        is as hard as felspar. It is insoluble in acids till it has been fused with
                        an alkali.</p><p>It may be obtained artificially by-raising tin to a white heat in the open
                        air. The metal takes fire, and is converted into peroxide. It may be
                        obtained also by treating tin with moderately concentrated nitric acid. A
                        violent effervescence ensues, and the tin is converted into a powder,
                        usually gray; but when heated till the acid is all driven off it becomes
                        yellow. When tin filings and red oxide of mercury are heated together, the
                        peroxide of tin is obtained of a white colour. Peroxide of tin is not
                        soluble in muriatic acid, but it forms with it a combination which is
                        soluble in water. It combines also with sulphuric acid, but the compound
                        does not dissolve. After exposure to a red heat it loses the property of
                        combining with acids.

                        colour, a resinous lustre and fracture, and takes fire when heated in
                        chlorine gas, and is converted into perchloride. It melts (if air be
                        excluded) rather below a red heat, and does not undergo decomposition. It is

                        and was on that account called <hi rend="italic">fuming liquor of
                        Libavius.</hi> It is formed when six parts of tin, one part of mercury, and
                        thirty-three parts of corrosive sublimate are mixed together, and distilled
                        by a moderate heat. It is a colourless liquid, like water. When exposed to
                        the air it smokes violently, in consequence of its great avidity for
                        moisture. One part of water and three of the liquid, when mixed, constitute
                        a solid mass. Hence the reason why crystals appear round the cork when
                        fuming liquid is kept in a phial shut with a common cork. It acts with great
                        violence on oil of turpentine. It usually contains an excess of chlorine.

Iodine combines readily with tin when the melted metal is brought in

                        black-lead crucible. Mosaic gold sublimes. It is in light scales, which
                        readily adhere to other bodies, and which have the colour of gold. When
                        heated it gives out sulphur, and is converted into common sulphuret. It is
                        insoluble in water and alcohol, and is not acted on by nitric or muriatic

                        and dissolve it. Potash ley dissolves it when assisted by heat, and the

                        metallic lustre. It is a compound of copper, iron, and sulphur. This ore is
                        roasted to drive off the sulphur. It is then brought into fusion, which
                        occasions a combination of the oxide of iron in the ore, with a quantity of
                        silica, which is almost always present, or if not, it must be added
                        artificially. This compound separates under the form of slag. What remains

                        furnace at a high temperature. The heat is gradually raised to the melting
                        point, and after from twelve to twenty-four hours it is cast into pigs,
                        known by the name of <hi rend="italic">blistered copper.</hi> This copper is
                        again roasted, then melted, the surface covered with charcoal, and a birch
                        pole is plunged into the melted mass. This is repeated till the metal
                        þecomes ductile, and acquires the requisite toughness and closeness of
                        grain.</p><p>Copper has a rose-red colour, and a great deal of brilli ancy. Its specific
                        gravity, after being rolled out into plates, is 8∙953. When granulated by
                        pouring it into water while in fusion, the specific gravity is 8 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 895. Its malleability is great, and its ductility
                        very considerable. A bar of cast copper a quarter of an inch thick requires
                        1192 lbs. to break it; while a bar of hammered copper of the same diameter
                        requires 2112 lbs. to break it. So that hammering almost doubles the
                        tenacity of this metal. It melts when heated to 2548° of Fahrenheit’s
                        thermometer; and if the heat be increased it evaporates in visible fumes.
                        While in fusion its surface is bluish green. It is not much altered by
                        exposure to the weather, and it may be kept under water without
                        alteration.</p><p>I. Copper has the property of combining with oxygen∣ in three proportibns,
                        and forms three oxides, two of which occur native; the third is not a
                        permanent compound.</p><p>1. Oxide of copper is easily obtained by keeping plates of copper red hot in
                        the open air. Scales gradually form and fall off. When these are collected,
                        reduced to powder, and kept for some time red hot in an open vessel, they
                        are converted into a black powder, which is oxide of copper. We obtain the
                        same oxide by dissolving sulphate of copper in water, and throwing down the
                        copper by carbonate of soda. When the green precipitate is well washed and
                        dried, and then exposed to a red heat, it becomes pure oxide of copper.
                        Oxide of copper is a tasteless black powder, destitute of lustre. It has no
                        taste, and is insoluble in water; but dissolves readily in acids. The
                        solution is blue or green according to the acid employed. Its <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352398" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2398-0415"/> specific
                        gravity is 6∙40L When exposed to a very high temperature it melts, and
                        assumes ä crystalline texture. When the solution of it is dropt into an
                        alkaline ley, ablue precipitate falls, which is a sesquihydrate of the
                        oxide. It is insoluble in the fixed alkaline leys; but when fused with fixed
                        alkalies, or alkaline earths, a combination takes place, which is either
                        blue or green according to circumstances. It even displaces carbonic acid at
                        a red heat, but the combination is destroyed by digesting it in water.
                        Caustic ammonia dissolves this oxide, or at least its salts; and the
                        solution has a fine blue colour.

There is another oxide of copper, which exists native. It has a
                        brownish-red colour, and is crystallized in octahedrons. Its specific
                        gravity is 5 ’ 992. This oxide may be formed artificially by mixing together
                        57∙5 parts of black oxide and fifty parts of copper in very fine powder. The
                        mixture is put with muriatic acid into a stoppered phial, after having been
                        rubbed in a mortar. Heat is disengaged, and a dark, opaque, brown solution
                        is obtained, from which potash precipitates the oxide in the state of a
                        yellow powder. This oxide is a compound of eight parts, by wcight, of
                        copper, and one part of oxygen.

                        hydrogen at the temperature of 32°, the hydrate assumes first a greenish
                        colour, and becomes at last yellowish brown, which is the colour of peroxide
                        of copper. As soon as this oxide is formed, it begins to give out oxygen. It
                        must be separated as quickly as possible from the liquid, pressed between
                        folds of paper, and dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid. When heated to 212°
                        it is decomposed. On a red-hot coal it detonates, and the copper is reduced.

                        copper. When the solution of suboxide of copper in muriatic acid is
                        sufficiently concentrated, a white salt is obtained, which, when cautiously
                        heated in close vessels, is converted into the same substance. Dichloride of
                        copper has an amber colour, and a certain degree of translucency. It melts
                        at a heat just below redness. It is insoluble in water, but dissolves in
                        nitric acid with effervescence. In muriatic acid it dissolves without
                        effervescence, and is again precipitated when water is added to the
                        solution. Potash throws down suboxide of copper. It may be heated to redness

When a current of selenietted hydrogen gas is passed through a solution of

The most important of all the alloys of copper is brass, which is a
                        combination of that metal and zinc. The metals are capable of uniting in
                        various proportions, and according to them the colour and other qualities of
                        the brass vary also. Brass is made by mixing granulated copper, calamine,
                        and charcoal in a crucible. The heat is kept up for five or six hours, and
                        then raised sufficiently high to melt the compound. It is afterwards poured
                        into a mould of granite, edged round with iron, and cast into plates. The
                        most intimate and complete alloy consists of two atoms of copper and one
                        atom of zinc. What is called old Dutch brass is a compound of four atoms
                        copper and one atom zinc.</p><p>Brass is much more fusible than copper. It is malleable while cold, unless
                        the proportion of zinc be excessive, but when heated it becomes brittle. It
                        is ductile, may be drawn into fine wire, and is much tougher than copper.
                        The specific gravity varies very much, according to the proportion of zinc
                        which it contains.</p><p>X. Tin unites very readily with copper, and forms various useful alloys,
                        differing in name and in properties, according to the proportions of the two
                        metals united.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Bronze</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">metal of cannons</hi>
                        are composed of from eight to twelve parts of tin combined with a hundred
                        parts of copper. This alloy is brittle, yellow, heavier than copper, and has
                        much more tenacity. It is much more fusible, and less liable to be altered
                        by exposure to the air. The term <hi rend="italic">brass</hi> is often
                        applied to this alloy, though in a strict sense it means a compound of
                        copper and zinc.</p><p>Bell-metal is usually composed of three parts of copper and one part of tin.
                        Its colour is grayish white; it is very hard, sonorous, and elastic. The
                        greater part of the tin may be separated by melting the alloy, and then
                        pouring a little water on it. The tin decomposes the water, is oxydized, and
                        thrown on the surface.</p><p>The alloy used for the mirrors of telescopes was employed by the ancients for
                        the composition of their mirrors. It consists of about two parts of copper
                        united to one part of tin. Mr Mudge ascertained that the best proportions
                        are thirty-two parts of copper to 14∙5 of tin, or</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms copper</p><p>1 atom tin</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>16</p><p>7∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>23∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>Vessels of copper, especially when used as kitchen utensils, are usually
                        covered with a thin coat of tin, to prevent the copper from being oxydized,
                        and to prevent the food which is prepared in them from being mixed with any
                        of that poisonous metal. Such vessels are said to be tinned. Their inner
                        surface is scraped very clean with an iron instrument, and rubbed over with
                        sal ammoniac. The vessel is then heated, and a little pitch thrown into it,
                        and allowed to spread over the surface. Then a bit of tin is applied all
                        over the hot copper, which instantly assumes a silvery whiteness. The coat
                        of tin thus applied is exceedingly thin.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI.— <hi rend="italic">Of Bismuth.</hi></p><p>The most common ore of bismuth is what is called <hi rend="italic">native
                        bismuth,</hi> in which the metal exists in an uncombined state. The most
                        abundant ores occur in Germany, where the metal seems to have been first
                        discovered. What of that metal exists in commerce is procured by simply
                        melting the metal out of its gangue, by exposing it to a moderate heat in
                        contact with burning fuel. The metal obtained in this way is never quite
                        pure, but it may be rendered so by the following process: Dissolve it in
                        nitric acid, taking care to render the solution as neutral as possible, and
                        then dilute it with a good deal of water. A white curdy matter falls down,
                        which must be well washed and dried in the open air. When this matter is
                        mixed with black flux, and heated in a crucible, it is reduced to pure
                        bismuth.</p><p>Bismuth has a reddish-white colour, and is composed of broad plates adhering
                        to each other. It is rather softer than copper. Its specific gravity is
                        9∙833. By cautious hammering it may be increased to 9 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8827. It is not very brittle, yet it breaks when struck smartly
                        with a hammer. It is therefore not malleable, neither can it be drawn out
                        into wire. It melts at the temperature of 497°. When exposed to the air it
                        becomes slightly tarnished, but not sensibly oxydized. But it is oxydized
                        more rapidly when it is exposed to the air in a state of fusion. When raised
                        to a strong red heat it takes fire, and burns with a faint blue flame, and
                        emits a yellowish smoke, which is an oxide of the metal.</p><p>I. So far as is known at present, it combines with only one proportion of
                        oxygen, and forms a yellow-coloured oxide. This oxide is best obtained by
                        dissolving bismuth in nitric acid, and mixing the solution with water. A
                        white matter falls, known formerly by the name of <hi rend="italic">rnagis∙

                        insoluble in water, but soluble in nitric acid. In a strong red heat it
                        melts into a dark-yellow, opaque glass, which on cooling assumes its
                        original colour. It is soluble in caustic fixed alkaline leys, and even
                        somewhat soluble in caustic ammonia.

When bismuth in powder is heated in a glass tube with a great excess of
                        bromine, yellow vapours appear and condense on the sides of the tube, while
                        a solid bromide remains at the bottom of the tube. It has a steel-gray
                        colour, having the aspect of iodine, fused into a solid mass. It melts when
                        heated to 392°, and assumes a hyacinth colour; but on cooling recovers its
                        original colour. When exposed to the air it absorbs moisture rapidly, and
                        assumes a fine sulphur-yellow colour. Water decomposes it into hydrobromic
                        acid and oxide of bromine, still retaining bromine.</p><p>IV. Iodine readily combines with bismuth when assisted by heat. The iodide
                        has an orange colour, and is insoluble in water; but it may be dissolved in
                        a solution of caustic potash without occasioning any precipitation.</p><p>V. Sulphur combines readily with bismuth by fusion. The sulphuret has a
                        bluish-gray colour, and crystallizes in beautiful tetrahedral needles, which
                        cross one another. It is very brittle and fusible, and bears a strong
                        resemblance to sulphuret of antimony, but is rather lighter coloured. It

                        weight of bismuth, one part of lead, and one part of tin. It melts when
                        heated to 200° ∙75. What is called Newton’s fusible metal is a compound of
                        eight parts by weight of bismuth, five of lead, and three of tin. It melts
                        at 212°.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII.— <hi rend="italic">Of AIercury.</hi></p><p>By far the most abundant ore of mercury is cinnabar, in which the metal is
                        combined with sulphur. The cinnabar is mixed with half its weight of lime,
                        or of scales of iron, and distilled in an iron retort, or a kind of oven
                        constructed for the purpose. It comes over for sale in large iron bottles;
                        and while in its original package, the metal may be considered as quite
                        pure.</p><p>. Mercury has a white colour, similar to that of silver. It possesses great
                        brilliancy. Its specific gravity is 13∙56846 at the temperature of 60°. When
                        in a solid state the specific gravity is 14∙465. At the common temperature
                        of the atmosphere it is always in a state of fluidity, but it becomes solid
                        when cooled down to — 38° ∙66. Solid mer cury may be subjected to the blows
                        of a hammer, and may be extended without breaking. It boils when heated to
                        656° on the common thermometer, but the true boiling point is 660°. The
                        specific gravity of its vapour is 6∙9747. Mercury is not altered by exposure
                        to the air, nor by being kept under water; but when kept heated in the open
                        air, or when agitated for a long time in air, it is oxydized.</p><p>1. Mercury, so far as we know at present, unites with∣ two proportions of
                        oxygen, and forms two oxides. The suboxide is <hi rend="italic">black,</hi>
                        the oxide <hi rend="italic">red.</hi></p><p>1. The suboxide was formed by Boerhaave, by putting a little mercury into a
                        bottle, and tying it to the spoke of a mill-wheel. It is a black powder,
                        without any lustre, has a coppery taste, and is insoluble in water. When
                        calomel is digested in an alkaline ley the same suboxide is obtained, but it
                        is very apt to be mixed with globules of running mercury. The best way is to
                        throw a little calomel in fine powder into a considerable quantity of potash
                        ley. It has the property of combining with acids, and forming salts. Its
                        specific gravity is 10∙69. It is very easily reduced to the metallic state.
                        Indeed it almost always contains globules of mercury, which maybe rendered
                        visible under a magnifying glass.

                        converted into <hi rend="italic">oxide</hi> of mercury. The easiest mode of
                        obtaining this oxide is to dissolve mercury in nitric acid, to evaporate the
                        solution to dryness, and to expose the dry residue to heat in a crucible
                        till all fumes of nitric acid cease to exhale. When thus formed it is
                        usually distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">red

                        acts as an escharotic when applied to any part of the skin. Its specific

                        oxygen, and the mixture assumes various colours, according to the
                        proportions of the ingredients. When heated along with zinc or tin filings
                        it sets these metals on fire. When heated to redness it becomes black. It is

Mercury is said to take fire when it is heated in chlorine gas. It
                        combines with chlorine in two proportions, and forms two important compounds
                        known by the names of <hi rend="italic">corrosive sublimate</hi> and <hi rend="italic">calomel.</hi></p><p>1. Corrosive sublimate maybe formed by dissolving red oxide of mercury in
                        muriatic acid, and evaporating the solution to dryness. The common method of
                        forming it is to mix together nitrate of mercury, decrepitated common salt,
                        and anhydrous sulphate of iron. One third of a matrass is filled with this
                        mixture. The vessel is gradually heated to redness, when cold corrosive
                        sublimate is found sublimed in the upper part of the matrass. It is a
                        beautiful white translucent mass, composed of small prismatic needles. It is
                        soluble in cold water to the extent of rather more than five per cent, and
                        the solubility increases with the temperature. By evaporation it yields
                        small crystals, the primary form of which is a right rhombic prism, with
                        angles of 93° 44' and 86° 16'. Its specific gravity is 5∙1398. Its taste is
                        acrid and caustic, and it leaves for a long time a disagreeable styptic
                        metallic impression on the tongue. When taken internally, it acts as a
                        virulent poison<pb break="no" facs="nls:193352437" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2437-0418"/>, producing violent pain, nausea, and
                        vomiting, and corroding the stomach and intestines. Alcohol of 0∙816
                        specific gravity dissolves about half its weight of this chloride; sulphuric
                        ether dissolves the third of its weight. It is soluble in muriatic acid, but
                        insoluble in sulphuric and nitric acids. The fixed alkalies decompose it,
                        throwing down the oxide of mercury in the state of a yellow powder, which
                        soon becomes brick red.

                        terminated by pyramids. The primary form seems to be a square prism. It is
                        tasteless, does not act as a poison, but possesses the properties of a
                        purgative. It is by far the most useful and important of all the medicinal
                        preparations of mercury. Its specific gravity is 7T758. It is not sensibly
                        soluble in cold water. When exposed to the air it becomes deeper coloured.
                        When rubbed in the dark it phosphoresces. It requires a stronger heat for
                        sublimation than corrosive sublimate. When mixed with one part of common

                        mortar, the mercury gradually disappears, and a black powder is formed,
                        formerly called <hi rend="italic">ethiops mineral.</hi> It is scarcely
                        possible to unite all the mercury with the sulphur by this process. We
                        succeed better by heat. When mercury is added slowly to its own weight of
                        melted sulphur, constantly stirring the mixture till the excess of sulphur
                        is driven off, we form a more intimate compound. When a current of

                        or small prisms. This cake is distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">cinnabar,</hi> and when in powder it is called <hi rend="italic">vermilion.</hi> Sulphuret of mercury thus formed has a specific gravity of
                        10. It is tasteless, insoluble in water and in muriatic acid, and not
                        altered by exposure to the air. When heated it takes fire, and burns with a
                        blue flame. When mixed with iron filings, and heated in a stoneware, retort,
                        it is decomposed, sulphuret of iron is formed, and running mercury is
                        distilled over. Cinnabar, when in powder, has a scarlet colour, and is well
                        known as a paint.

Selenium and mercury, when heated together, combine without the evolution
                        of light. Seleniet of mercury is a tin-white, coherent mass. It does not
                        mplt, but sublimes, when heated in thin plates which have the metallic
                        lustre. It is scarcely attacked by nitric acid; but when long boiled in that
                        acid, it is at length converted into seleniate of mercury. In this state it
                        is decomposed by muriatic açid, selenium being left in the slate of a red
                        powder. Nitromuriatic acid dissolves the seleniet rapidly, even without the
                        assistance of heat.</p><p>VII. Phosphuret of meŗcyry is black, .of a pretty solid consistence, and

                        amalgams. Mercury easily dissolves gold, silver, zinc, cadmium, bismuth,
                        tin, and lead. With rather more difficulty it may be united to copper and
                        platinum. With arsenic and a,ntimpny it. may be united by trituration,
                        assisted by heat. With, iron it cannot be united directly; accordingly

                        a metal of a fine white colour, with a slight shade of yellow. It has a
                        great deal of brilliancy and beauty when polished. It is softer than copper,
                        but harder than gold. When melted, and cooled slowly, its specific gravity
                        is 10-3946; when hammered and rolled, it becomes as high as 10∙1S12. It is
                        very malleable and ductile, but its tenacity is inferior to that of copper.
                        It melts when exposed to a strong red heat, and while in fusion its
                        brilliancy is much increased. Its melting point, as determined by Princeps,
                        is 1830°. It is not altered by exposure to the air, unless fumes of sulphur
                        or sulphuretted hydrogen gas happen to exist in the atmosphere. Water
                        produces no alteration on it.</p><p>I. Silver seems capable of combining with three doses of oxygen, and of
                        forming three oxides, two of which are neutral bodies, while the third
                        possesses the characters of an alkaline body on base.</p><p>1. When silver is dissolved in nitric acid, and a fixed alkali added to the
                        solution, a brown-coloured powder falls, which becomes darker when dried. It
                        is tasteless and insoluble in water, nor is it capable of forming a hydrate.
                        Its specific gravity is 7∙143. When exposed to the direct rays of the sun it
                        gives out oxygen, and becomes black. Caustic ammonia, when digested on it,
                        dissolves it partially, leaving a black powder, which is fulminating silver.

                        octahedrons. Its colour is white, but when exposed to the air it gradually
                        assumes a purple colour. At the temperature of about 500° it melts, and on
                        cooling assumes the form of a light-brown, translucent glass, having some
                        resemblance to horn in point of toughness. Inaveryhigh temperature

                        to the metallic state. It is converted into metallic silver also when heated
                        to redness, surrounded with common potash of commerce in a crucible; or we

When nitrate of silver is dropt into a solution of a hydrobromate, a
                        bromide of silver falls down in light-yellow curds. When exposed to the
                        light it blackens, but not so readily as chloride of silver. It is insoluble
                        in water and in nitric acid, but soluble in ammonia. Boiling sulphuric acid
                        disengages some vapours of bromine from it. When heated it melts into a
                        reddish liquid, which on cooling recovers its original colour, and assumes
                        the appearance of horn. Nascent hydrogen decomposes it as it does chloride.

Sulphur has a strong affinity for silver. When thin plates of silver and
                        sulphur are laid alternately in a crucible, they melt readily at a low red
                        heat, and constitute a sulphuret. It is black, or at least of a very deep
                        violet colour, capable of being cut with a knife; often crystallized in
                        small needles, and much more fusible than silver. By heat the sulphur may be
                        slowly volatilized, and the silver left pure. This compound frequently
                        occurs native. It has a dark-gray colour, the metallie lustre, and the
                        softness, flexibility, and malleability of lead. Its specific gravity is
                        about 7∙'2.

Selenium and silver seem capable of combining in two proportions. When
                        the two substances are heated together, they unite with the evolution of
                        heat, and a very fusible compound is formed, from which the excess of
                        selenium may be separated by distillation. This seleniet is gray, and while
                        in fusion its surface is brilliant, like a mirror. It melts long before it
                        is heated to redness. It possesses some malleability, and may be a
                        biselenict.</p><p>When silver is precipitated by selenietted hydrogen, it falls in the state of

Arseniet of silver is steel-gray, brittle, and fine granular.</p><p>IX. There are few of the alloys of silver of much consequence. It would
                        appear from the experiments of Stodart and Faraday, that the quality of
                        steel is improved by the addition of a little silver. Silver readily unites
                        with copper by fusion, and the colour of the silver is not sensibly altered,
                        even when the copper amounts to half the weight of the silver. The standard
                        sterling silver of Great Britain is an alloy of 12^ by weight of silver, and
                        one of copper. This is very nearly a compound of three and a half atoms
                        silver and one atom copper. The specific gravity of this alloy, after simple
                        fusion, is 10∙200. When stamped into coin its specific gravity is 10∙3121.

                        platinum, and because the other four metals belonging to it are usually
                        associated with native platinum.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> L— <hi rend="italic">Of Gold.</hi></p><p>Gold always occurs in the metallic state, seldom pure, but usually alloyed
                        with silver or copper, or with both, and sometimes, it is said, with
                        platinum. From copper it may be freed by cupellation, and from silver by
                        solution in aqua regia, and mixing the solution, which contains only the
                        gold, with a recent solution of sulphate of iron. The pure gold is thrown
                        down in the state of a fine powder, which has only to be washed and
                        fused.</p><p>. Gold has a beautiful yeljow colour and considerable lustre, which it
                        retains, not being liable to tarnish by exposure to the air. It is rather
                        softer than silver. After fusion it has a specific gravity of 19∙2, but by
                        hammering it may be made as high as 19*361, or perhaps 19∙4. It is the most
                        malleable of all metals, and may be beaten out into leaves no thicker than

                        silver. It melts, according to Davies, when heated to 2590° Fahrenheit. It
                        is not soluble in any acid; neither sulphuric, nitric, nor muriatic have any
                        action on it, but it dissolves with great ease in aqua regia. The solution
                        has a yellow colour, an acrid taste, and is very poisonous.</p><p>Į. We are acquainted at present with only two oxides of gold, which, however,
                        are not easily obtained in a separate state.</p><p>1. The peroxide of gold may be obtained by the following process: Dissolve
                        gold in an aqua regia composed of a mixture of one part of nitric and four
                        parts of muriatic acid. Render the solution as neutral as possible by
                        evaporation ,∙ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> then add potash, and heat the
                        liquid. ..A voluminous precipitate gradually falls, which must be carefully
                        washed and dried. It is now peroxide of gold, but not quite free from
                        potash. If we add magnesia to the solution of gold in aqua regia, a
                        precipitate falls, consisting of oxide of gold united to magnesia. When this
                        precipitate is washed and digested in nitric acid, the magnesia is
                        diśsolved, together with part of the gold, and pure öxidb of gold remains
                        undissolved. Peroxide of gold, when in the state of hydrate, is a
                        light-yellow powder;, but when anhydrous it is brown or black. It dissolves

When the solution of gold in muriatic acid is heated till it ceases to

                        cold water. When this substance is treated with caustic potash, a
                        green-coloured powder is separated, which is suboxide of gold. In a short
                        time it divides itself into two parts; one third deprives the other two
                        thirds of the whole of their oxygen, and becomes peroxide, while the other

                        was first brought to the form of an ingot by Dr Wollaston. The process
                        followed was the following: The crude platina must be. digested in dilute
                        aqua regia till the acid is as nearly saturated with platinum as possible.
                        Then draw off the liquid, and allow it to stand till a fine powder of ore of
                        iridium has subsided. Then mix it with sal ammoniac previously dissolved in
                        five times its weight of water. A yc!low precipitate falls, which must be
                        thoroughly washed, and ultimately pressed to remove the last remnant of the
                        washings. It is next to be heated with extreme caution in a blâck-lead
                        pot,'just sufficiently high to drive off the sal ammoniac, and to oéc’asion
                        the particles of platinum to adhere together as little as possible. The gray
                        product of platinum is now to be rubbed between the bauds to reduce it to a
                        powder fine enough to pass through a lawn sieve. The coarse parts are then
                        to be ground in a wooden bowl with a wooden pestle, till the whole is
                        reduced to powder. They must not be touched with any thing hard enough to
                        burnish their surface, otherwise the process is spoilt. The powder is now to
                        be put into a brass mould filled with water, taking care that no vacuities
                        are left. The top of the powder is first covered with a circle of paper, and
                        then with one of cloth; and it is then pressed, first by the hand with a
                        wooden instrument, and afterwards by’ means of a powerful press. It is then
                        placedin a çharcoaľ fire, and there heated to redness. It is now covered
                        with á crucible, not touching it, and exposed for about twenty' minutes to

                        of platinum, a black precipitate'falls, which is sulphuret of platinum.
                        Wash it, and dissolve it in nitric acid; evaporate the solution, and
                        continue the heat till all the nitric acid is driven off. Sulphate of

                        retort. The heat must be gradually raised to redness, and kept at that point
                        till every thing volatile is expelled. It has a dark,, iron-gray colour,

                        much importance. With antimony it combines readily, and forms a brittle
                        alloy. An alloy ol seven parts platinum, sixteen copper, and one zinc, has
                        much the appearance of pure gold. Platinum is not easily amalgamated with
                        mercury, but the combination may be accomplished by triturating a little
                        powder of platinum with mercury in a mortar, adding each constituent by
                        small quantities at a time, as required.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of

                        The precipitate has a pale-yellow colour. When washed, dried, and exposed to
                        a red heat, palladium remains in powder. It may be fused with sulphur into
                        an ingot, and by cautious roasting the sulphuris driven off, and the
                        palladium may be hammered into a solid mass. Much patience and perseverance
                        is necessary before the cake can be made to bear hard blows.</p><p>Palladium is a white metal, which, when polished, bears a very strong
                        resemblance to platinum. It is rather harder than wrought iron. Its specific
                        gravity, after ignition, is 10-972, but by hammering it may be made as high
                        as 12∙148. It is very malleable and ductile, possesses but little
                        elasticity, and is not altered by exposure to the air while cold. At a red
                        heat it speedily acquires a blue colour on the surface, but loses it when
                        exposed to a still higher temperature. The best solvent of it is aqua regia.
                        The solution has a rcddish-brown colour, somewhat similar, but darker, than
                        that of chloride of platinum.</p><p>I. It seems to be capable of uniting with two proportions of oxygen, and of
                        forming two oxides. &gt;</p><p>1. The protoxide may be obtained by fusing palladium in powder with potash
                        and a little nitre, or by dissolving palladium in fuming nitric acid,
                        evaporating to dryness, and exposing the residual salt to a heat approaching
                        ignition, to drive off the nitric acid. It is a black, tasteless pow <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> der, which is insoluble in water. It does not
                        readily dissolve in acids, and requires boiling before we can obtain a
                        complete solution in muriatic acid. When precipitated from nitric acid by

                        by means of sal ammoniac, a plate of clean zinc was immersed in the liquid,
                        which precipitated a black powder. It was washed and digested in dilute
                        nitric acid, to dissolve some copper and lead which it contained. It was
                        then dissolved in nitromuriatic acid. Common salt being added to the
                        solution, the whole was evaporated to dryness, and the-residual salt washed
                        with alcohol by small quantities at a time, till it came off nearly
                        colourless. There remained chloride of rhodium united to common salt. When

                        borax it becomes white, and assumes the metallic lustre.</p><p>Rhodium has a white colour, like that of platinum. Its specific gravity is
                        10∙649. It is brittle, and requires a much higher temperature to fuse it
                        than any; other ímétal, unless iridium be excepted. It has the remarkable
                        property of being insoluble in all acids, even in aqua regia. It is
                        exceedingly hard, being in this respect superior to any other metal. Dr
                        Wollaston employed those persons who in London were accustomed to cut and
                        polish diamonds, to cut it into pieces fit for being applied to the nibs of
                        pens. They assured him that it spoiled their instruments much more than the

                        colour, and is never free from the precipitating alkali. When strongly
                        heated it becomes black; but whether this change is accompanied with the
                        evolution of oxygen has net been ascertained. There is reason to suspect
                        that this oxide (for it has not been analysed) is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom rhodium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1⅜ atom oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>2.

                        alloys. With steel it may be united in almost any proportion. Faraday and

                        concentration, yields octahedral crystals of chloride of iridium. A plate of
                        zinc throws down a black powder from the solution of these crystals. When
                        heat is applied to the powder it becomes white, and assumes the metallic
                        lustre. In this state it is pure iridium.</p><p>. Iridium has the appearance of platinum. It has only been obtained in the
                        state of powder, so that we do not know whether it be malleable or brittle;
                        neither has its specific gravity been determined, though there is reason to
                        believe that it is as high, if not higher, than that of platinum. It resists
                        the action of all acids, even the nitromuriatic, almost completely, more
                        than 300 parts of that acid being necessary to dissolve one part of
                        iridium.</p><p>I. The affinity between iridium and oxygen seems to be considerable. It has
                        been conjectured by Berzelius that it combines with four doses of oxygen,
                        and forms four oxides, though hitherto these four oxides have not been
                        obtained in a separate state.</p><p>1. The protoxide may be obtained by boiling the protochloride with
                        concentrated solution of caustic potash. The protoxide separates in the form
                        of a black powder, which is scarcely acted on by acids, though it
                        communicates to them a light-green colour. The hydrate of this oxide,
                        obtained by precipitating protochloride of iridium with carbonate of potash,
                        is a bulky greenish-gray matter, which is rc-dissolved by an excess of
                        carbonate of potash. The hydrate dissolves in acids when assisted by heat,
                        and forms salts of iridium.

Sesquioxide of iridium may be obtained by mixing bichloro-iridiate of

                        mixture in a close vessel to incipient ignition, taking care not to elevate
                        the temperature too high, which would occasion the expulsion of the carbonic
                        acid, and the combination of the acid with the alkali. When the saline mass
                        is dissolved in boiling water and filtered, it leaves on the filter a
                        blackish-blue powder, which is the sesquioxide. When washed with pure water
                        it passes through the filter. It should therefore be washed with a solution
                        of sal ammoniac, the last traces of which may be driven off by heat. It is a

                        yellow or greenish, and so similar to the hydrated oxide of rhodium that it
                        is impossible to distinguish them from each other by their appearance. This
                        oxide dissolves in muriatic acid, and when the solution is concentrated it
                        becomes red. It has not been analysed, but from analogy it is probably a

                        mixture heated to incipient redness in a stream of chlorine gas, part of the
                        iridium enters into combination. The saline mass is separated by water from
                        the metallic iridium, and aqua regia being added to the liquid, it is
                        evaporated to dryness. The excess of chloride of potassium may be washed out
                        with a little water. The salt may then be dissolved in boiling water
                        containing a little aqua regia, and crystallized. Black octahedrons are

                        of iridium. It is therefore a bichloro-iridiate of potassium. The bichloride
                        of iridium has not been obtained in a separate state, but it is obviously a

                        olive-green colour. The additional weight corresponds with an atom of
                        chlorine.

Terchloride of iridium has been obtained in combination with chloride of
                        potassium. When ore of iridium, after fusion with nitre, has been treated
                        with aqua regia, and then dried, small quantities of water, cautiously
                        added, dissolve out the excess of the chloride of potassium; after this,
                        water digested on it acquires a red colour. Dissolve off as much as can be

With arsenic it does not seem to combine.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193352528" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2528-0425"/><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI.— <hi rend="italic">Of Osmium.</hi></p><p>This metal is always found combined with iridium. The method of separating it
                        from the black powder which remains undissolved when the crude ore of
                        platinum is digested in aqua regia, has been stated at the beginning of the
                        last section. When the alkaline solution of osmium is mixed with muriatic or
                        nitric acid and distilled, oxide of osmium passes over into the receiver,
                        dissolved in water. To obtain the osmium from this liquid, agitate a
                        quantity of mercury in it, after having added as much muriatic acid as is
                        capable of converting the mercury into chloride. Most of the osmium forms an
                        amalgam with the mercury, but a little still remains in solution. To obtain
                        it, saturate the liquid with ammonia, evaporate the whole, to dryness, and
                        beat the dry mass in a retort. Metallic osmium remains, while the mercury
                        and sal ammoniac sublime. The chloride of mercury, amalgam of osmium and
                        running mercury from this process, is to be heated in a glass tube, while a
                        current of hydrogen gas is made to pass over it. Mercury and chloride of
                        mercury sublime, and metallic osmium remains. It has the form of a black
                        powder, which acquires the metallic lustre when burnished.</p><p>Osmium has a strong metallic lustre and a white colour, similar to that of
                        ore of iridium. Its specific gravity is ten. It dissolves slowly in nitric
                        acid. In aqua regia it dissolves rapidly, and so does it in fuming nitric
                        acid when assisted by heat. When in a state of great division, it takes
                        fire, and burns at a red heat. The metal is not altered by exposure to the
                        air at common temperatures. Having been obtained only in the state of
                        powder, we do not know whether it be a malleable or brittle metal.</p><p>I. It is capable of combining with various proportions of oxygen, though the
                        number of its oxides has not yet been determined with accuracy.</p><p>1. The protoxide may be obtained by treating the <hi rend="italic">eliloro-osmiate of potassium</hi> with caustic potash. In a few hours the
                        hydrated protoxide is deposited, of a deep-green colour, almost hlack. It
                        dissolves slowly in acids, communicating a blackish-green colour, like the
                        salts of iridium. Nitric acid dissolves it without the application of heat,
                        and when evaporated to dryness leaves a green-coloured transparent varnish.
                        The sulphate becomes almost black when dried. Muriatic acid dissolves it,
                        and assumes a deep greenish-brown colour. It detonates with combustibles. It
                        is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom osmium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>125</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>I atom oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>—- </p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>13∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>2, The existence of a sesquioxide of osmium has been conjectured, but it has
                        not been obtained in a separate state.</p><p>3. Binoxide of osmium may be obtained by treating bichloro-osmiate of
                        potassium with carbonate of soda. After some time the liquid becomes muddy
                        and black, and allows the hydrated binoxide of osmium to fall. When
                        collceted on the filter it is black, and contains alkali, which cannot be
                        removed by washing. After exposure to a red heat it ceases to be soluble in
                        acids, though its composition is not changed. It is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom osmium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>12∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>145</p></cell></row></table><p>4. The volatile oxide which comes over dissolved in water in the process
                        described at the beginning of this section, appears to be a quatcroxide. It
                        is obtained when osmium is burnt, or when we treat oxide of osmium with
                        nitric acid. When pure it is white, with a slight tint of yellow, and may be
                        obtained in crystals. It dissolves slowly in water, and forms a colourless
                        solution. It dissolves also in alcohol and ether, but' is gradually reduced
                        and deposited in the metallic state. This oxide has a strong and peculiar
                        smell. It is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom osmium</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>12∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>16∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>When gallic acid is dropt into the aqueous solution of quateroxide of osmium,
                        the liquid gradually assumes a deep-blue colour. This colour is owing to the
                        formation of a blue oxide of osmium, the constitution of which has not yet
                        been determined.</p><p>II. The number of chlorides of osmium is fully as great as that of the
                        oxides.</p><p>1. When chlorine gas is passed over osmium at the ordinary temperature of the
                        atmosphere, there is no apparent action; but if we heat the metal, there
                        instantly rises from it a dark-green sublimate, which is <hi rend="italic">cldoride of osmium.</hi> If we continue the passage of chlorine gas and the
                        heat, a red pulverulent sublimate gradually makes its appearance, which is
                        the <hi rend="italic">bichloride</hi> of osmium. If the chlorine gas be
                        moist the bichloride becomes yellow, and gradually crystallizes. When the
                        bichloride is dissolved in water, it assumes a yellow colour; on adding a
                        new portion of water the colour changes to green, and the smell of the
                        volatile oxide becomes apparent.</p><p>2. The sesquichloride and terchloride have not been obtained in a separate
                        state, but they have been formed in combination with chloride of
                        potassium.</p><p>III. Osmium has a strong affinity for sulphur, and forms as many sulphurets
                        as it does chlorides. -Sulphuretted hydrogen throws it down from all its
                        solutions, and the nature of the sulphuret formed depends upon the state of
                        the osmium before its decomposition.</p><p>The remaining combinations into which osmium enters have not yet been
                        investigated.</p><p>DIVISION. II.— OF PRIMARY COMPOUNDS.</p><p>Having finished the history of the simple substances, we now proceed to give
                        an account of the compounds which they form with each other. By <hi rend="italic">primary compound</hi> is meant a combination of two or more
                        simple bodies with each other. Thus <hi rend="italic">potash</hi> is a
                        primary compound, being composed <hi rend="italic">of potassium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oxygen</hi> united together. <hi rend="italic">Cyanogen</hi>
                        is another of these compounds, being composed of <hi rend="italic">carbon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">azote</hi> united in definite
                        proportions. Almost all of these primary compounds have been noticed in the
                        last division of this article; but we must here treat of the most important
                        of them in greater detail than could be done with propriety while treating
                        of the simple substances, and give an account of several important bodies
                        which were of necessity omitted. Now all the primary compounds naturally
                        divide themselves into three classes; namely, <hi rend="italic">acids,
                        alkalies</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bases,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">neutrals.</hi> These three classes will be treated in succession in the
                        three following chapters.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP. I.—OF ACIDS.</hi></p><p>By <hi rend="italic">acid</hi> is understood, in the present language of
                        chemists, a substance which has the property of combining with and
                        neutralizing alkalies or bases, Formerly it was considered as requisite that
                        bodies, in order to belong to the class of acids, should have a sour taste,
                        should be soluble in water, and should have the property of reddening
                        vegetable blues; and these properties do indeed belong to some of the most
                        common and powerful acids. But there <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352541" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2541-0426"/> are
                        various acids that have no taste, and which are not sensibly soluble in
                        water, and some which are not capable of altering the colour of the most
                        delicate vegetable blues. All the acids with which we are acquainted are
                        compounds. Lavoisier was of opinion that oxygen constituted an essential
                        constituent of them all; and this opinion holds good with the greater number
                        of acids hitherto examined by chemists. But it is now known that not only
                        oxygen, but all the other simple supporters, namely, chlorine, bromine,
                        iodine, and fluorine, are capable of forming acids by uniting with several
                        of the acidifiable bases, and indeed also when they unite with several of
                        the alkaline bases, especially those described under the name of <hi rend="italic">noble metals.</hi> Besides the supporters, <hi rend="italic">cyanogen, sulphur, selenium,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tellurium,</hi>
                        have also the property of forming acids when they unite with the acidifiable
                        bases. Indeed it is not improbable that this property will be ultimately
                        found to belong to the greater number, if not the whole of the acidifiable
                        bases. Thus the acids at present known may be divided into nine classes,
                        namely,</p><list rend="numbered" type="basic"><item n="1"> Oxygen acids. </item><item n="2"> Chlorine acids. </item><item n="3"> Bromine acids. </item><item n="4"> Iodine acids. </item><item n="5"> Fluorine acids. </item><item n="6"> Cyanogen acids. </item><item n="7"> Sulphur acids. </item><item n="8"> Selenium acids. </item><item n="9"> Tellurium acids. </item></list><p>Let us take a view of each of these nine classes in succession.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CLASS. I.—OXYGEN ACIDS.</hi></p><p>The acids which contain oxygen as an essential constituent have been longer
                        known and more carefully studied than those which belong to the other eight
                        classes. This is the reason why at present they are so much more numerous
                        than all the other acids put together. The oxygen acids are of two kinds.
                        Some consist of oxygen united to a single base or a single supporter. Thus
                        <hi rend="italic">sulphuric acid</hi> is a compound of <hi rend="italic">sulphur</hi> and oxygen, and <hi rend="italic">carbonic acid</hi> of <hi rend="italic">carbon</hi> and oxygen. But there are a considerable number of
                        oxygen acids, in which the oxygen is united at once with two, and sometimes
                        with three bases. Thus <hi rend="italic">acetic</hi> acid is a compound of
                        oxygen, <hi rend="italic">carbon,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hydrogen,</hi>
                        while <hi rend="italic">uric</hi> acid is a compound of oxygen, carbon,
                        hydrogen, and azote. This second set of acids is very numerous. They either
                        exist ready formed in the vegetable or animal kingdom, or they are formed
                        from vegetable and animal bodies by certain chemical processes. Thus the
                        oxygen acids require to be subdivided into two sets, namely,</p><p>1. Acids with a simple base.</p><p>2. Acids with a compound base.</p><p>The first of these divisions includes the most important of those acids that
                        are employed as instruments of chemical investigation, yet there are several
                        acids with a compound base that can scarcely be dispensed with in a

                        which constitute the bases of these acids. We therefore refer the reader for
                        information to that part of the article.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Set</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Oxygen Acids with a Compound
                        Base.</hi></p><p>The oxygen acids with a compound base are very numerous, and are daily
                        augmenting as chemists extend their researches into the animal and vegetable
                        kingdoms of nature. The double base consists most frequently of carbon and
                        hydrogen, sometimes of carbon, hydrogen, and azote; and there are a few of
                        them into which sulphur enters likewise as a constituent.</p><p>Many of these acids exist ready formed in the vegetable kingdom; some are
                        formed by a species of fermentation, to which vegetable substances are
                        liable; others are formed during the distillation of certain bodies; and
                        nitric acid, and even sulphuric acid, have the property of converting
                        various vegetable and animal bodies into acids.</p><p>We shall, in the first place, give a list of all the compound oxygen acids at

                        known amount to sixty-two. Many of these, however, have been but
                        superficially examined, and are so scarce that it has not been possible
                        hitherto to apply them to any useful purpose; while others are abundant, and
                        possess qualities that render them precious in the arts, or indispensable in
                        the laboratory of the practical chemist. We shall satisfy ourselves here
                        with a few observations on the most important.</p><p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Acetic acid,</hi> or vinegar (as it is called in
                        common language), is a well-known liquid, formed during a peculiar
                        fermentation, to which wine and beer are liable when kept in a high
                        temperature, while at the same time air has access to them. They become
                        sour, and all (or almost alD the alcohol which they previously contained
                        disappears. For the full development of the acetic acid in these liquids, a
                        temperature of about 84° is requisite. The beer to be converted into vinegar
                        is put into stoves kept at that temperature, placed in casks with their
                        bungs out. When the vinegar thus made is distilled at a low temperature, a
                        transparent colourless liquid passes over called <hi rend="italic">distilled
                        vinegar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">acetous acid.</hi> When this distilled
                        vinegar is saturated with soda or its earbonate, and the solution evaporated
                        to dryness, a white transparent salt is obtained called <hi rend="italic">acetate of soda.</hi> This salt may be rendered anhydrous by exposure to a
                        temperature of about 500°. If ten parts and a quarter of this anhydrous salt
                        be mixed in a retort with six and an eighth parts of concentrated sulphuric
                        acid of commerce, and heat applied, there passes into the receiver a very
                        strong acetic acid, having an exceedingly pungent smell, similar to that of
                        vinegar, but so strong as to be too powerful for the organs of smell. Its
                        action upon the skin is so strong that it is capable of inflaming and even
                        blistering any part of the body to which it may be applied. The acid, when
                        of this strength, is liquid during summer, but whenever the temperature
                        sinks below 40°, it congeals or crystallizes. It is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom acetic acid</p><p>1 atom water</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙25</p><p>1∙125</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>7∙375</p></cell></row></table><p>The acetic acid cannot be deprived of this proportion of water unless by
                        combining it with some other substance. In an isolated state it is not
                        capable of existing. Its specific gravity at 60° is 1∙06296. When diluted
                        with water it becomes heavier, and its specific gravity is a maximum. When
                        the liquid is a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom acetic acid</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms water</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>10∙75</p></cell></row></table><p>it is then 1∙07T32.</p><p>When acetic acid is exposed to a strong red heat, as by passing it through a
                        narrow porcelain tube in a state of ignition, it is decomposed; but this
                        does not happen unless the temperature be very high. If we fill the tube
                        with pieces of charcoal, the decomposition is complete at a much lower
                        temperature.</p><p>Acetic acid combines with all the bases, and forms a set of salts, to which
                        the name of <hi rend="italic">acetates</hi> has been given. All the
                        acetates, without exception, so far as we know at present, are soluble in
                        water. One of the most insoluble of them all is the acctated suboxide of
                        mercury. It crystallizes in silvery plates, and requires about 600 times its
                        weight of water to dissolve it. The acetate of silver is also very little
                        soluble, requiring about 100 times its weight of water to dissolve it.
                        Several of the acetates are deliquescent. This is the case with the acetate
                        of potash. The acetate of ammonia is very deliquescent, and so volatile that
                        it cannot, without particular contrivances, be obtained in crystals. Some
                        acetates lose a portion of their acid by keeping. This is the case with the
                        acetate of zinc.</p><p>Acetic acid has been analysed by mixing a quantity of an anhydrous acetate
                        with black oxide of copper, and heating it to incipient ignition. The acetic
                        acid is decomposed, and, combining with the oxygen of the black oxide, is
                        converted into water and earbonic acid. The water is collected in a tube
                        filled with chloride of calcium, the weight of which has been previously
                        determined; while the earbonic acid is collected in a glass jar standing
                        inverted over mercury in a mercurial trough. By determining the weight of
                        water formed, and the quantity of carbonic acid evolved, the proportion of
                        hydrogen and carbon in the acetic acid employed is ascertained. What is
                        wanting to complete the weight of the acetic acid is considered as oxygen.
                        In this way the constituents of acetic acid have been found</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3 atoms oxvgen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>Thus making the atomic weight of the acid 6∙25. And this, in fact, agrees
                        with the weight of acid necessary to saturate an atomic proportion of the
                        bases.</p><p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lactic acid</hi> is the acid formed when milk is
                        allowed to become sour. It is formed also during a kind of fermentation
                        which starch (especially oatmeaD undergoes when kept dissolved, or mixed
                        with water. The characters of this acid approach those of acetic acid so
                        nearly, that many chemists have been induced to consider them as the same.
                        However, there are several remarkable differences between them. Lactic acid
                        is not nearly so volatile as acetic, and its smell is quite different, and
                        not nearly so agreeable. The salts of laetic acid, like the acetates, are
                        all soluble; but hitherto they have been but superficially examined.</p><p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Caseic acid</hi> is a name which has been given to
                        the acid formed when the curd of milk is exposed to the putrefactive
                        fermentation. It is a yellow, syrupy liquid, which seems to owe its acid
                        properties to a quantity of acetic acid which it contains, and which had
                        been formed during the putrefaction of the curd</p><p>4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fγbric acid</hi> was extracted in crystals from the
                        fresh muscle of an animal, by digesting it in cold water, evaporating the
                        liquid to the consistence of a syrup, and mixing the syrup with strong
                        alcohol After some days standing in a close vessel, the alcohol deposits
                        needle-formed crystals, which have acid properties; but their nature has not
                        been accurately ascertained.</p><p>5. <hi rend="smallcaps">Formic acid</hi> may be obtained by digesting the <hi rend="italic">formica rufa,</hi> or red ant, in hot water. Döbereiner
                        discovered that if we mix together in a large retort one part of crystals of
                        tartaric acid, two and a half parts of deutoxide of manganese, and two and a
                        half parts of concentrated<pb break="no" facs="nls:193352567" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2567-0428"/> sulphuric acid, previously diluted with twice
                        its weight of water, and apply heat, much carbonic acid is disengaged, and
                        the matter in the retort swells and has a great tendency to run over. After
                        the disengagement of gas is at an end, if we distil over the liquid, we
                        obtain dilute formic acid. This process succeeds equally well if we
                        substitute starch for tartaric acid.</p><p>This acid has a strong resemblance to the acetic; but the differences are
                        also decided. It cannot be made to crystallize, its specific gravity is
                        higher, and the salts which it forms have different properties. When mixed
                        with concentrated sulphuric acid, it is converted into water and carbonic
                        oxide. Its constituents are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙125</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell></row></table><p>So that it differs from acetic acid by containing only half the quantity of
                        carbon and hydrogen that exist in that acid. Were we to suppose the carbon
                        and hydrogen in these acids to be combined together, and to constitute a
                        base, to which the oxygen afterwards united in order to convert it into an
                        acid, the base of acetic acid would be a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙25</p></cell></row></table><p>while the base of formic acid would be</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms carbon</p><p>1 atom hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙5</p><p>0∙125</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙625</p></cell></row></table><p>The ratio of the carbon is the same in both, but the absolute quantity is
                        double in acetic acid to what it is in formic acid.</p><p>6. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mellitic acid</hi> existá as one of the constituents
                        of a honey-yellow mineral, crystallized in octahedrons, found among the
                        layers of wood-coal in Thuringia, and called from its colour <hi rend="italic">mellite.</hi> This mineral is a compound of mellitic acid and
                        alumina. Mellitic acid has a very strong resemblance to oxalic acid, and,
                        like it, is not liable to decomposition when kept in solution in water. Its
                        atomic weight is 6∙5, but it has not yet been subjected to an analysis to
                        determine its constituents.</p><p>7. <hi rend="smallcaps">Tartaric acid</hi> is one of the constituents of <hi rend="italic">cream of tartar,</hi> a salt which encrusts the sides and
                        bottoms of winceasks, being gradually deposited from the wine. This salt is
                        now called bitartrate of potash, being a compound of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms tartaric acid</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>16∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom potash</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>22∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>This salt is decomposed by lime, which separates the tartaric acid from
                        potash, forming with it an insoluble and tasteless white powder. Sulphuric
                        acid, when digested over this powder, gradually combines with the lime, and
                        sets the tartaric acid at liberty. It dissolves in the water, and may be
                        obtained in crystals by concentrating the liquid. This acid is prepared in
                        large quantities for the calico-printers, who employ it to discharge the
                        turkey-red dye by means of bleaching powder. It has a very sour taste, and
                        is very soluble in water. The aqueous solution, when kept, becomes full of
                        mucus, and the acid is gradually destroyed. It has the property of combining
                        in two proportions with most bases, forming tartrates and bitartrates. The
                        bitartrate of potash is very little soluble in water. Hence if we drop
                        carbonate of potash by degrees into a solution of tartaric acid, a copious
                        precipitate of small acidulous crystals gradually falls down. This
                        precipitation is characteristic of tartaric acid. Carbonate of soda cannot
                        be substituted for potash, because the bitartrate of soda is much more
                        soluble in water than bitartrate of potash. When tartaric acid is added to a
                        solution of a metal in an acid, it in general prevents the metallic oxide
                        from being thrown down by an alkali. This it does by forming with the
                        metallic oxide a soluble double salt. The atomic weight of tartaric acid is
                        8∙25, and the crystals are composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom tartaric acid</p><p>1 atom water</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8∙25</p><p>1∙125</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>9∙375</p></cell></row></table><p>The acid itself has been analysed by means of oxide of copper, and found

                        found in cream of tartar. It therefore exists as a constituent of the juice
                        of grapes, and appears in the fruit to be in a state of biracemate of
                        potash. It may be separated and purified precisely in the same way as
                        tartaric acid. The Germans (for it was first noticed in Germany) have given
                        it the name of <hi rend="italic">traubensaure</hi> (grape acid). This
                        appellation not being suitable to the idiom of the English language, the
                        French chemists who first described it gave it the name of racemic, acid. It
                        crystallizes in doubly oblique prisms, the lateral faces of which are
                        inclined to each other at angles of 68° and 112°, and the inclination of the
                        base to the lateral faces is about 75°. It resembles tartaric acid in many
                        of its properties; but it precipitates lime from a solution of chloride of
                        calcium, which is not the case with tartaric acid. The salts also which it
                        forms differ from those of tartaric acid. Its constitution and atomic
                        weight, according to Berzelius, are precisely the same as those of tartaric

                        in the following way: Pieces of linen or hemp cloth were left in contact
                        with concentrated sulphuric acid. They were converted into a pulp. This pulp
                        being diluted with water, a great deal of it dissolves, leaving a black
                        matter. Filter, saturate the solution with carbonate of lead, filter again,
                        and precipitate the lead from the solution by a current of sulphuretted
                        hydrogen. The liquid, thus freed from lead, when cautiously concentrated,
                        leaves a transparent substance like gum arabic. This gum being boiled for
                        some time in very dilute sulphuric acid, is partly converted into a
                        crystallizable sugar, and partly into the acid called vegeto-sulphuric. It
                        may be separated from the sugar by digestion in rectified spirits,
                        evaporating to the consistence of a syrup, and digesting the syrup in ether.
                        The pure acid only is dissolved, and may be obtained in a separate state by
                        evaporating off the ether. It is a strong, colourless acid, decomposed by

Azulmic acid</p><p>We shall give as brief an accountof these important bodies (all of which are
                        not acids) as is consistent with perspicuity.</p><p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrocyanic acid,</hi> long known by the name of <hi rend="italic">prussic acid,</hi> may be obtained by the following process:
                        Fuse the yellow-coloured salt usually known by the name of <hi rend="italic">prussiate of potash,</hi> or ferruginous prussiate of potash, in a vessel
                        to which atmospherical air has not access. By this process the cyanodide of
                        iron which it contains is decomposed, and an inflammable gas comes over. The
                        iron is converted into a carburet, which may be separated by dissolving the
                        fused salt in water. If we evaporate the filtered solution, we obtain a
                        white salt, distinguished by the name of cyanodide of potassium. Put this
                        cyanodide into a retort or flask slightly moistened with water, and add
                        muriatic acid by a little at a time. The hydrocyanic acid is disengaged.
                        Cause it to pass through a tube filled with fragments of dry chloride of
                        calcium, and receive it into a small flask, kept as cool as possible by
                        being surrounded with a mixture of snow and salt. Here the hydrocyanic acid
                        condenses into a liquid.</p><p>It is a colourless liquid, having a strong smell similar to that of peach
                        blossoms. Its taste is sharp, at first it appears cooling, but it soon
                        excites a burning sensation in the mouth. It is very asthenic, indeed a
                        virulent poison. At 64° its specific gravity is 0∙6969. It boils when heated
                        to 79° ∙7, and congeals when cooled down to 5°. At 80° it assumes the
                        gaseous form. Its specific gravity is 0∙9375, and it is a compound of one
                        volume cyanogen gas and one volume hydrogen gas united together, without any
                        condensation whatever: hence its specific gravity is the mean of that of its
                        two constituents.</p><p>This acid cannot be kept. It speedily undergoes spontaneous decomposition,
                        even when kept in the dark and in a cool place. This seems to be owing to
                        its containing muriatic acid. It is one of the most virulent poisons known.
                        A single drop of it applied to the eye of a middle-sized dog occasions
                        violent convulsions, terminated speedily by death. Ammonia in some measure
                        counteracts its poisonous effects; but from the experiments of Simeon it
                        appears that chlorine constitutes a much more certain and complete antidote.
                        Being put into the throat of the poisoned animal it speedily relieves the
                        symptoms; and the animal, after the interval of some hours, again recovers
                        its health. It is used in medicine, and possesses considerable efficacy as a
                        remedy in dyspepsia. The strength of the acid usually sold by apothecaries
                        is from one to two parts of hydrocyanic acid in ninety-nine or ninety-eight
                        of water. Of this, eight drops in a glass of water are administered thrice
                        a-day. When given in large doses it diminishes the frequency of the pulse,
                        and even throws the patient into a state of lethargy, from which, however,
                        he gradually recovers.</p><p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyanic acid</hi> may be formed by the following
                        process: Mix anhydrous prussiate of potash with about its own weight of
                        black oxide of manganese, and heat this mixture in a silver crucible to
                        incipient ignition; then boil it in alcohol of the specific gravity 0∙832.
                        As the alcoholic solution cools, it deposits crystals of cyanate of potash
                        in small scales. Dissolve these crystals in water, and add nitrate of silver
                        to the solution. Cyanate of silver precipitates in a white powder, which is
                        nearly insoluble in water. Mix it with water, and pass through the solution
                        a current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The silver is thrown down, and the
                        cyanic acid remains in solution. The liquid now contains only cyanic acid.
                        It has a sour taste. Its smell has some resemblance to that of acetic acid.
                        In a few hours it undergoes spontaneous decomposition, being converted into
                        carbonate of ammonia. It combines with bases and forms salts, and its atomic

                        its true nature was first ascertained by Wohler and Liebig. It may be formed
                        by dissolving perchloride of cyanogen in hot water, and boiling the solution
                        for some time. By evaporating the liquid muriatic acid is driven off, and
                        cyanuric acid is deposited in crystals. It is a white solid, which
                        crystallizes in brilliant transparent rhombs. When heated it sublimes, and

                        of mercury arc dissolved by means of heat in a measured ounce and half of
                        nitric acid of the specific gravity 1∙3, and the solution is poured into two
                        measured ounces of alcohol. Heat being applied to the mixture, an
                        effervescence takes place, and a white matter in small crystals is
                        precipitated, which is to be collected and washed on a filter. It
                        constitutes fulminating mercury, or a compound of fulminic acid and oxide of
                        mercury. From this powder fulminic acid may be obtained by the following
                        process: Put fulminating mercury into a phial with a ground stopper,
                        together with twice its weight of clean zinc filings, and about three
                        quarters of a fluid ounce of water for every twenty grains of fulminating
                        mercury employed. If the bottle be kept in the temperature of 80°, and
                        occasionally agitated, the fulminating mercury is soon decomposed, and a
                        solution of fulminate of zinc obtained. Filter this liquid into another
                        phial, and add to it one third of its bulk of a saturated solution of
                        barytes in water. The oxide of zinc is precipitated, and fulminate of
                        barytes formed. To this fulminate add just the quantity of dilute sulphuric
                        acid that is necessary to saturate the barytes. Sulphate of barytes falls,
                        and there remains a solution of fulminic acid in water.</p><p>It is colourless and transparent. Its taste is at first sweet, which is
                        followed by a peculiar astringency. Its smell is pungent and disagreeable.
                        It is very poisonous; even exposure to its fumes excites headach. It is
                        volatile. It combines with the different bases, and forms á set of salts,

                        following process: Fill a bottle capable of holding sixty cubic inches with
                        chlorine gas, and then put into it ninety grains of cyanodidc of mercury.
                        Introduce as much water as-will reduce the cyanodide to a magma, but not
                        dissolve it. Put the bottle into a dark place. In ten hours a double
                        decomposition takes place. Corrosive sublimate is formed, and the cyanogen,
                        combined with chlorine, will fill the vessel in the state of a gas. Surround
                        the flask with a mixture of snow and salt. The gas is converted into solid
                        crystals, which attach themselves to the inside of the flask. Absorb all the
                        water by introducing chloride of calcium, while the flask is in the freezing
                        mixture, and letting it remain in the flask for two or three days; then
                        exposing it again to the freezing mixture to congeal the chloride of
                        cyanogen, withdraw the chloride of calcium, and fill the flask with mercury
                        previously cooled down to zero. Introduce a bent tube into the mouth of the
                        flask, plunge the end of this tube into a mercurial trough, then heat the
                        flask gently. The chloride of cyanogen melts and effervesces, and passes
                        over in the state of a gas.</p><p>At zero, chloride of cyanogen is a transparent solid, which crystallizes in
                        long needles. It liquefies when heated to 16°. At the ordinary temperature
                        of the air it is gaseous, but the gas liquefies at 68° when subjected to the
                        pressure of four atmospheres. Its smell is extremely offensive and
                        deleterious. At 68° water absorbs twenty-five times its bulk of this gas,
                        sulphuric ether about fifty times its bulk, and alcohol about a hundred
                        times its bulk. These solutions may be kept for any length of time without
                        undergoing decomposition. It has not been proved that it combines with
                        bases, so that we have no evidence that it possesses the characters of an
                        acid. It is a compound of one volume cyanogen gas and one volume chlorine
                        gas united together without any alteration of volume. Hence the specific
                        gravity of chloride of cyanogen in the gaseous state is 2 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 1527.</p><p>6. <hi rend="smallcaps">Perchloride of cyanogen</hi> may be obtained in the
                        following manner: Fill a bottle capable of containing sixty-five cubic
                        inches with dry chlorine gas, and after putting into it about fifteen grains
                        of pure liquid hydrocyanic acid, shut up the mouth of the phial with aground
                        stopper, and expose it to the direct rays of the sun. A solid matter
                        gradually attaches itself to the inside of the bottle, while the colour of
                        the chlorine disappears. Blow out the muriatic acid formed with a,pair of
                        bellows, then introduce a little water and a few fragments of glass, in
                        order, by agitation, to detach the solid matter from the inside of the
                        vessel. Agitate well, then throw the whole contents into a dish. Pick out

                        with a freezing mixture, pour on the cyanodide one part of bromine. A
                        violent action takes place, and much heat is evolved. Bromide of mercury and
                        bromide of cyanogen are formed, which last substance crystallizes in long
                        needles in the upper part of the tube. Adapt a small receiver to the tube,
                        and by a gentle heat drive the bromide of cyanogen into it, where it
                        crystallizes. The crystals are either small transparent cubes or long

                        a heat gradually increased till the cyanodide of mercury begins to undergo
                        decomposition; then the phial is to be taken up in a pair of pincers and
                        placed under a glass jar standing inverted on a glass plate. White vapours
                        issue rapidly from the mixture, and condense on the glass disc like flocks

                        it by the following process: Saturate alcohol with ammoniacal gas at 50°,
                        mix it with 0 ’ 4 of its original volume of alcohol, and with 0T6 of that
                        volume of bisulphuret of carbon. The mixture should be made in a phial which
                        should be completely filled with it. Let the phial be well stopped, and kept
                        at the temperature of 60°. In an hour and a half a salt falls in crystals.
                        It is a combination of sulphuret of ammonia and bičarburet of sulphur.

                        weight of bichloride of sulphur. Shut the vessel, and expose it for a
                        fortnight to the action of light. A number of small crystals are gradually
                        deposited on the upper part of the glass, while at the bottom of the glass
                        there remains corrosive sublimate mixed with a yellow-coloured matter. The
                        crystals may be purified by mixing them with carbonate of lime, and then
                        subliming them.</p><p>These crystals, when thus purified, are rhomboidal plates, like chloride of

Fixed oils.</p><p>7. Bitumens.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of Water.</hi></p><p>The properties and composition of water have been already explained in a
                        preceding part of this article. A few observations on it as a chemical body
                        still remain to be made.</p><p>It has the property of dissolving and combining with almost all the acids,
                        and with several of the alkaline bodies; and as it shows an equal
                        disposition to combine with either, and does not destroy nor conceal their
                        acid and alkaline qualities, it is obvious that it is a neutral body. It
                        dissolves also a considerable number of the salts, which are compounds of an
                        acid and base. The quantity of each of these bodies which water can dissolve
                        has a limit, and it is very various with respect to different salts. When
                        water has dissolved as much of a salt as it can take up, we say that it is
                        <hi rend="italic">saturated</hi> with salt.</p><p>The power which thus limits the solvent property of water is the attraction
                        which exists between the particles of the salt. When a salt is dissolved in
                        water its particles must be equally dispersed through every part of the
                        liquid. They must of course be arranged in regular rank and file; and the
                        greater the quantity dissolved the smaller must the distance be between
                        every two particles of the salt. It would appear that the greater the number
                        of particles of salt which are dissolved by the water, the smaller is the
                        force by which the salt and water are united.</p><p>, Water not only dissolves many salts and other bodies, but it has the
                        property of entering into combination with a great many bodies in a solid
                        state, constituting compounds, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">hydrates</hi> has been given. There are few or none of the simple bodies
                        that form hydrates. The supporters of combustion are soluble in it to a
                        trifling extent; and the same remark applies to hydrogen and azote; but none
                        of the other bases, whether acid or alkaline, are capable of uniting with
                        it. Most of the acids are capable of forming hydrates. Such hydrates are
                        usually called <hi rend="italic">crystals of the acid.</hi> Sometimes they
                        are in the state of powders, and sometimes they constitute jellies. Most of
                        the alkaline bases, in like manner, constitute hydrates, some of them in
                        crystals, but a much greater number in the state of dry powders.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of Ardent
                        Spirits.</hi></p><p>The term <hi rend="italic">ardent spirits</hi> in this country is usually
                        applied to the liquid obtained by distillation from different fermented
                        liquors. But of late years two distinct species of liquid have been
                        discovered, bearing a close resemblance to the spirits from fermented
                        liquors usually called alcohol. These are obtained not by fermentation, but
                        by heat. They have been called <hi rend="italic">pyroacetic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pyrolig-nic spirits.</hi> We shall treat of all the three in
                        this section.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Alcohol.</hi></p><p>Fermented liquors are either the expressed juices of fruits or the hot
                        infusions of malt. The former are called <hi rend="italic">wines,</hi> the
                        latter <hi rend="italic">beer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ale.</hi> The
                        distillation of either of these liquors furnishes alcohol, and the alcohol
                        is always the same, whatever the liquor be from which it was obtained. When
                        these spirits, distinguished by .the names of brandy, rum, whisky, gin,
                        arrack, &amp;c. according to the liquid which yields them, are redistilled,
                        the first portion that comes over is a fine, light, transparent liquid,
                        known in ' commerce by the name of <hi rend="italic">rectified spirits,</hi>
                        and usually sold under the name of <hi rend="italic">spirit of wine.</hi>
                        "When dry carbonate of potash or chloride of calcium is mixed with this
                        liquor in a retort, in the requisite proportion, and heat applied, there
                        comes over a quantity of spirit as strong as it is possible to make it. When
                        in this state it is called <hi rend="italic">alcohol.</hi></p><p>Alcohol thus procured is a transparent liquid, colourless as water, having a
                        well-known smell, rather strong, but not unpleasant. Its taste is hot and
                        biting, but generally considered as agreeable; and when taken internally in
                        considerable quantities it produces intoxication. Its specific gravity at
                        60° is 0∙79460. WTιen mixed with water a liquid is obtained, whose specific
                        gravity increases with the quantity of water; but as the two liquids undergo
                        mutual condensation, the specific gravity is always higher than the mean.
                        The condensation is greatest when one atom of alcohol combines with three
                        atoms of water. The specific gravity of such a combination, supposing no
                        condensation to take place, would be 0∙89373; but its actual specific
                        gravity is 0∙92662, so that the increase amounts to 0Ό3289. The following
                        table exhibits the specific gravities of different atomic mixtures of
                        alcohol and water, the specific gravity supposing no increase of density,
                        and the amount of the condensation. It was drawn up by Dr Steel from his own

It has
                        never yet been frozen, though it has been exposed to a temperature as low as
                        — 90°. The boiling point, however, varies with the'strength of the liquid.
                        If the alcohol be of the specific gravity 0∙818, it boils at 174° ∙2; when
                        of the specific gravity 0∙903, it boils at 179° ∙96; and when of the
                        specific gravity 0*980, it boils at 195° ∙8. The specific gravity of the
                        vapour of alcohol is L6000, if we reckon the specific gravity of air

                        it produces a great deal of heat. By combustion it is totally converted into
                        water and carbonic acid gas. When alcohol is passed through a red-hot
                        porcelain tube, it is in a great measure resolved into water and olefiant
                        gas. By determining the quantity of water and olefiant gas formed, when a
                        given weight of alcohol was decomposed in this way, Saussure concluded that
                        alcohol in the state of vapour is a compound of one volume olefiant gas and

The analysis of Saussure has been
                        confirmed by the subsequent analyses of Dumas and Boullay, who obtained 3∙07
                        atoms hydrogen, 2Ό17 atoms carbon, and 1 atom oxygen, constituting a very
                        near approximation to the truth.</p><p>Alcohol dissolves bromine and iodine, and forms very deep-coloured solutions.
                        Chlorine is absorbed by it in considerable quantity, but the alcohol
                        undergoes an alteration. Phosphorus and sulphur are dissolved by it in small
                        proportions. Alcohol dissolves a considerable number of acids, several but
                        not many of the alkaline bodies, and a considerable number of salts. But
                        these points will bebest noticed when treating of the substances themselves
                        which dissolve in this liquid.</p><p>Mr Graham has shown that several salts, when dissolved in alcohol, are
                        capable of crystallizing, and of retaining a quantity of alcohol essential
                        to the crystalline form of the salt. Such crystals he calls <hi rend="italic">alcoates.</hi></p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Pyro-acetic Spirit.</hi></p><p>This liquid was discovered in 1807 by Derosne, during the distillation of
                        verdigris. When the acetates of lead, zinc, or manganese, or still better of
                        potash or soda, are distilled in a retort with as low a heat as possible,
                        there comes over acetic acid and pyro-acetic spirit. By saturating the
                        liquid in the receiver with an alkali, and distilling again, the pyro-acetic
                        acid is obtained in a separate state. It is a colourless, limpid liquid,
                        having an acrid and hot taste, but leaving a cooling impression in the
                        mouth. Its smell is peculiar, and has been compared to that of a mixture of
                        oil of peppermint and bitter almonds. Its specific gravity is 0∙7864. It
                        burns with a flame, white exteriorly, and of a fine blue within, and it
                        leaves no residue. It boils at the temperature of 165°. It mixes with water,
                        alcohol, and volatile oils, in any proportion. According to the analysis of
                        Macaire and Marcet, it is composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙375</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2</p><p>5∙375</p></cell></row></table><p>Thus it contains two atoms of carbon and one atom of oxygen more than
                        alcohol.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Pyroxylic Spirit.</hi></p><p>This liquid is obtained when wood is distilled. The products of the
                        distillation are water, acetic acid, pyroxylic spirit, empyreumatic oil, and
                        a black matter like tar. When the watery portion, freed as well as possible
                        from the other ingredients, is distilled at a low heat, the first portion
                        that comes over is pyroxylic spirit. It may be freed from acetic acid by
                        agitation with lime or magnesia, and distillation at a low temperature. It
                        is still contaminated with oil, from which, however, it may be nearly freed
                        by mixing it with its own weight of sulphuric acid, and distilling
                        again.</p><p>It is transparent and colourless, having a pungent and somewhat ethereal
                        smell. Its taste is hot, pungent, and very disagreeable from the
                        empyreumatic oil which it holds in solution. Its specific gravity is 0∙8121.
                        It boils at 150°. It burns with a very pale yellow flame inclining to blue,
                        and leaves no residue. It dissolves in alcohol in any proportion. With water
                        it becomes milky, obviously from the empyreumatic oil which it contains. It
                        dissolves readily in oil of turpentine and in liquid potash. Camphor
                        dissolves in it readily, but it does not dissolve olive oil. With sulphuric
                        ether it unites in all proportions. According to the analysis of Marcet and
                        Macaire, its constituents are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>But as the spirit is always contaminated with empyreumati( oil, no conclusion
                        can be drawn from this result. A por∙ tion of the hydrogen and carbon is
                        undoubtedly owing to the presence of that oil.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— Of <hi rend="italic">Sulphuric

                        volatile liquids formed by the action of acids on alcohol. But these liquids
                        are divisible into two sets, exceedingly different from each other in their
                        characters. One set is quite free from any portion of the acid employed in
                        its preparation, and consists of the very same constituents as alcohol,
                        though the proportions are different; the other set consists of the acid
                        employed in the formation of the ether, saturated with a peculiar volatile
                        and combustible substance, which appears to be the same in all. The first of
                        these shall occupy our attention in this section, and the second set in the
                        following section.</p><p>Sulphuric ether is made in the following manner: A mixture of equal parts of
                        alcohol and sulphuric acid is put into a retort, to which a large receiver
                        is luted; and the receiver .should be surrounded with ice, or at least with
                        cold water. Heat is applied, and as soon as the mixture boils, the ether
                        comes over, and runs in large striae down the sides of the receiver. As soon
                        as the ether amounts to one half of the alcohol used, the process must be
                        stopped. To free it from <hi rend="italic">alcohol</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sulphurous acid,</hi> with which it is always contaminated, it
                        is agitated in a close phial with a little water and slaked lime, till the
                        smell of sulphurous acid is destroyed; then decant off the ether into a
                        retort, and distil it over.</p><p>Ether is a limpid, colourless liquid, having a fragrant smell, and a hot,
                        pungent taste. It is so volatile that it can scarcely be poured from one
                        vessel to another without losing a considerable portion by evaporation.
                        Wlιen poured out in the open air it disappears in an instant During its
                        evaporation a considerable degree of cold is produced. It boils in metal
                        vessels at the temperature of 96°. The specific gravity of the vapour is
                        2∙5694∙ It does not freeze, according to Thenard, though cooled down to —
                        58°. When admitted to a gas it increases its volume very considerably', and
                        even doubles it if the temperature be not too low. When one volume of the
                        vapour of ether is mixed with six volumes of oxygen gas, and an electric
                        spark passed through the mixture, a violent detonation takes place, and the
                        whole ether is converted into carbonic acid gas and water. The residue,
                        after the combustion, consists of four volumes of carbonic acid gas. From
                        this experiment it follows, that a volume of ether is a compound of four
                        volumes carbon vapour and four volumes hydrogen gas, condensed into one
                        volume, and combined with a volume of the vapour of water; so that its
                        constituents are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙625</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1</p><p>4∙625</p></cell></row></table><p>Thus ether is a compound analogous to alcohol.

                        when agitated with water, is freed of its alcohol; but a portion of the
                        ether is lost, which augments according to the proportion of water employed.
                        In alcohol it dissolves in any proportion whatever. Ether dissolves
                        phosphorus, sulphur, iodine, potash, and many other bodies, especially the
                        acids, a considerable number of which are taken up by it.</p><p>Much light has been thrown upon the theory of etherification by the late
                        experiments of Mr Hennell. When equal weights of alcohol and sulphuric acid
                        are mixed together without the application of any heat, about one half of
                        the sulphuric acid is converted into theiovinic, which is a compound of two
                        atoms sulphuric acid and one atom tetarto-carbo-hydrogen. When this mixture
                        is distilled, ether is formed, and passes over into the receiver, while the
                        theiovinic acid disappears. The ether seems to originate from the
                        tetarto-carbo-hydrogen in the theiovinic acid. That substance is induced by
                        the action of heat to quit the sulphuric acid with which it was previously
                        combined, and to unite with an atom of water. The sulphuric acid thus set at
                        liberty acts upon a new portion of the alcohol, and converts it into
                        theiovinic acid, which the heat afterwards decomposes.</p><p>In preparing ether, if we change the receiver after the ether ceases to come
                        over, and continue the heat, sulphurous acid comes over in abundance, and a
                        yellowish liquor quite different from ether. If we purify this liquid by
                        means of a weak solution of carbonate of potash, it constitutes what is
                        called <hi rend="italic">sweet oil of wine.</hi> It has a yellow colour, a
                        fragrant smell, a bitterish and pungent taste, and a specific gravity of 1 ’
                        060. It does not mix with ether, but combines with alcohol. Mr Hennell has
                        shown that it is a compound of two atoms sulphuric acid and two atoms
                        tetarto-carbo-hydrogen. When it is kept, one half of the
                        tetarto-carbo-hydrogen separates in a crystalline form, and the sweet oil of
                        wine becomes theiovinic acid. If we agitate this oil of wine with a
                        sufficient quantity of water, it is converted into theiovinic acid, and the
                        excess of tetarto-carbo-hydrogen is separated in the form of a bright
                        ambercoloured oil of the consistency of castor oil. Its specific gravity is
                        0 ’ 9. It is insoluble in water, very soluble in ether, and somewhat less so
                        in alcohol. It burns with a brilliant flame, throwing off* some carbon.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Of Acid

                        not because they have acid properties, which is not the case, but because
                        they contain an acid as one of their constituents. They are twelve in
                        number, and naturally divide themselves into two sets; namely, those that
                        contain a <hi rend="italic">hydra-cid</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chlorine</hi> as a constituent, and those which contain an oxygen acid. The

                        ethers are made by distilling mixtures of alcohol and the acid which enters
                        into each as a constituent. Scarcely any of them has been applied to any
                        use, if we except nitric ether and acetic ether; the former of which is
                        frequently employed in medicine, and the letter occasionally, though much

                        prevent violent agitation in boiling. Let a tube luted to the beak of the
                        retort enter a Woulfe’s bottle double the size of the retort, half filled
                        with water, and furnished with a tube of safety. From this bottle a tube
                        passes to collect the muriatic ether in the state of gas in proper vessels.
                        When heat is applied the muriatic ether passes over as a gas.</p><p>This gas is colourless: it has a strong ethereal smell, and a sweetish taste.
                        Its specific gravity is 2 ’ 219, that of air being one. At 64° water
                        dissolves its own bulk of this gas. When cooled down to 52° it is condensed
                        into a liquid. In its liquid form it is colourless and transparent. At 41°
                        its specific gravity is 0∙874. It is much more volatile than sulphuric

                        precipitated to the bottom, the quantity of which is increased when the
                        liquid swimming over this oil is saturated with potash. This oily-looking
                        substance is chloric ether.</p><p>It is a thin oily-looking fluid, having a specific gravity of 1∙134. It is

                        ether, and an aromatic, hot, and somewhat bitter taste. It is very little
                        soluble in water. It has not yet been analysed.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Hydroibromic ether</hi> was formed in this manner. Forty

                        eight parts of bromine were poured in by little at a time. Every time that
                        bromine came in contact with the phosphorus, a rapid combination took place,
                        and hydrobromic and phosphorous acids were formed. The mixture was now
                        distilled by a gentle heat, and the product mixed with water. The ether
                        separated and sunk to the bottom. It is colourless and transparent, heavier
                        than water, has a strong ethereal smell, a sharp taste, and is very

                        with a saturated solution of salt in water. From this bottle a tube passes
                        to the bottom of a second Woulfe’s bottle half filled with the same liquid.
                        Join in this way five Woulfe’s bottles, and surround each with a mixture of
                        snow and salt, to keep it as cool as possible. Heat being applied to the
                        retort, a violent effervescence takes place, which must be moderated by
                        withdrawing the fire and moistening the belly of the retort with cold water
                        applied by a sponge or a wet cloth. Gaseous matter passes off with rapidity,
                        carrying with it the ether which is deposited on the surface of the liquids
                        in the Woulfe’s bottles, chiefly in the first bottle. To free it from
                        uncombined acid, put it into a well-stopped phial, and agitate it with a

                        When liquid, it is lighter than water, and requires forty-eight parts of

                        names.</p><p>Spermaceti was purified by repeated solutions in alcohol, which frees it from
                        a yellow oil which it contains. So purified, it has been called <hi rend="italic">cetine.</hi> The cetine is converted into a soap by mixing a
                        hundred parts of it with a hundred parts of potash dissolved in two hundred
                        parts of water, and keeping the solution in a temperature between 122° and
                        194°, agitating it frequently. When the saponification is complete, an
                        excess of tartaric or phosphoric acid is added, and the heat kept up till
                        the whole fatty matter collects on the surface. This fatty matter is a
                        mixture of ethal and margaric and oleic acids. When heated with barytes
                        water, the acids are removed, and the excess of barytes is afterwards
                        removed by boiling the ethal in distilled water. Absolute alcohol now
                        dissolves the pure ethal from the purified fatty matter. Heat drives off the
                        alcohol, and leaves the ethal pure.</p><p>. Ethal is a solid, colourless body, having the translucency of wax. It melts
                        at about 118°. When cooled slowly it crystallizes in brilliant plates. It
                        has no smell, and scarcely any taste. It may be volatilized. Alcohol of
                        0∙812 dissolves it in any proportion at the temperature of 129°; but it is
                        deposited partly in crystals as the solution cools. It is insoluble in
                        water. It does not combine with potash nor form soap when pure, but it forms
                        a soap when mixed with a small quantity of margaric or oleic acids. It burns
                        like wax. According to the analysis of Chevreul, which, however, cannot be

                        semitransparent, or give it what is called a <hi rend="italic">greasy</hi>
                        stain. These bodies are very numerous, and have been divided into <hi rend="italic">volatile ĩcrA fixed oils.</hi><hi rend="italic">Volatile,</hi> called also <hi rend="italic">essential</hi> oils, possess
                        the following properties:</p><p>1. Liquid; often as liquid as water; sometimes viscid or solid.</p><p>2. Very combustible.</p><p>3. An acrid taste, and a strong fragrant odour.</p><p>4. Volatilized with water at a temperature not higher than 212°</p><p>5. Soluble in alcohol and ether, and slightly so in water.</p><p>6. Evaporate without leaving any stain upon paper. By this last test we can
                        easily discover whether they have been fraudulently mixed with fixed oils.
                        Let a drop of the suspected oil fall on a leaf of writing paper, and then
                        apply a gentle heat. If the oil evaporate without leaving a stain, it is
                        pure; if it leaves a stain it has been mixed with a fixed oil.</p><p>Volatile oils exist in great abundance in plants. All the fragrance of the
                        vegetable kingdom is owing to them. They are usually obtained by putting the
                        part of the vegetable containing them into a still with water, and
                        distilling the liquid over. The oil passes over with the water, on which it
                        usually swims.</p><p>The specific gravity of volatile oils is commonly less than that of water.
                        Oils of sassafras, of cinnamon, and of cloves, are heavier than water. Oil
                        of turpentine, the lightest of the volatile oils, has a specific gravity of
                        0∙792.</p><p>Volatile oils do not combine with alkalies and form soaps. By the action of
                        light many of them are converted into resinous bodies, which combine readily
                        enough with alkalies.</p><p>Sulphuric acid acts upon them with considerable energy, converting them first
                        into a resinous substance, and at last to the state of charcoal. Muriatic
                        acid has but little action on them. When nitric acid is thrown upon them
                        suddenly, it sets them on fire.</p><p>A variety of these oils have been analysed by burning them in oxygen gas, and
                        ascertaining the quantity of oxygen consumed, and the volume of carbonic
                        acid formed. What prevents the results of these experiments from being
                        depended on, is the difficulty of obtaining volatile oil free from all
                        admixture of foreign bodies. They are almost all mixtures of various
                        volatile oils, differing in their volatility, &amp;c., which it has been
                        impossible hitherto to separate so as to obtain each in an insulated state.
                        They consist chiefly of hydrogen and carbon, sometimes with a little oxygen,
                        and sometimes without any. The atoms of carbon are always more numerous than
                        those of hydrogen; sometimes twice as numerous, as in solid anise oil;
                        sometimes as three to two, as in liquid anise oil and oil of rosemary;
                        sometimes approaching equality, as in oil of roses.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII.— <hi rend="italic">Of Fixed Oils.</hi><hi rend="italic">Fixed oils</hi> are distinguished by the following

                        0∙8795.</p><p>They do not begin to evaporate till they have been heated above the boiling
                        point of water. As the heat increases, a pretty abundant vapour may be seen
                        to rise from them; but they do not begin to boil till heated up to about
                        600°. At that temperature, or a little above it, they may be distilled over;
                        but they are always somewhat altered by the process. The distilled oil is
                        darker coloured, much more liquid, and much more volatile, than before.</p><p>When they are exposed to the open air they have the property of absorbing
                        oxygen gas, and gradually become solid. Now there are some oils which remain
                        transparent, when thus solidified, and which no longer possess the
                        characters of oil, but are become quite hard, and incapable of staining
                        other bodies. There arc others which assume the appearance of tallow, easily
                        melt when heated, and, when thus melted, possess all the characters of oily
                        bodies, the same as before they underwent the change of state. This has
                        occasioned the division of the fixed oils into <hi rend="italic">drying

                        they are boiled for some time in an iron pot. By this process they arc
                        partly decomposed, abundance of watery vapour and of carburetted hydrogen
                        gas being separated from them. They become deeper coloured, and acquire
                        greater consistency'. It is common for some purposes to set them on fire, to
                        allow them to burn for some time, to extinguish them by covering up the
                        vessel in which they are contained, and to continue the boiling till they
                        acquire the proper degree of viscidity. By this process they lose much of
                        their unctuous quality, so as not to leave a greasy stain upon paper.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Eat Oils.</hi></p><p>The principal fat oils are the following:</p><p>1.

                        and the second liquid. Stearine may be obtained by heating hog’s lard in
                        boiling alcohol. When the liquid cools it deposits white crystalline
                        needles, which are stearine, or we may obtain it from olive oil by freezing
                        the oil, and while in that state subjecting it to pressure between numerous
                        folds of blotting paper. The paper takes up the elaine and leaves the
                        stearine. It is white, brittle, and has somewhat of the appearance of wax.
                        It has little or no taste or smell. When heated to about 109° it melts into
                        a liquid oil. It is somewhat soluble in alcohol, but the solubility varies
                        in the stearine from different substances. When digested with alkaline

                        the top. This alcoliolic liquid being distilled, leaves an acid oil of the

                        into a granular substance, consisting of stearine, not quite free from the
                        oily bodies, and a liquid, consisting of the two oils, still retaining
                        stearine in solution. This liquid is yellow, and has a taste like butter.
                        Its specific gravity is 0∙922. Digest it repeatedly in absolute alcohol till
                        the whole is dissolved. Set the solution aside; a portion of oil gradually
                        separates. Distil the alcoholic solution by a moderate heat. What remains is

                        with water, and then dissolving them in boiling alcohol. As the solution
                        cools, the cholesterine is deposited in crystalline plates.</p><p>It is solid, white, and possessed of considerable lustre. It melts at 278°,
                        and, when cooled, slowly crystallizes in radiated plates. It has no taste
                        and little smell. At 680° it may be volatilized. It is insoluble in water. A
                        hundred parts of alcohol of 0∙816 dissolve eighteen parts of cholesterine.
                        Weaker alcohol dissolves less. It gives out no water when heated with
                        protoxide of lead. It cannot be converted into soap, nor does it undergo any
                        alteration when digested with potash ley. Its constituents, as determined by

                        mixtures of various oily bodies, which we have it not in our power to

                        When pure it is as fluid as oil of turpentine, and very volatile. Its
                        specific gravity varies from 0∙730 to 0 ’ 878. It has a peculiar smell. It
                        may be distilled over without alteration. When pure it is called <hi rend="italic">naphtha.</hi> The oil obtained by distilling pit coal, when
                        properly rectified, seems to be identical with natural naphtha. It burns
                        very brilliantly, giving out at the same time much smoke; It is insoluble in
                        water, though it communicates its smcíl to that liquid. Alcohol dissolves
                        about one fifth of its weight of it. Sulphuric ether, petroleum, fat oils,
                        pitch, and volatile oils combine with naphtha in any proportion. It

                        a solid substance, found first on the banks of the Baikal Lake, in Siberia.
                        It is white, melts when heated, and on cooling assumes the consistence of a
                        white cerate, almost as hard as wax. It dissolves readily in alcohol, and in
                        other respects resembles the characters of the volatile oils. It burns with
                        a bluish-white flame, and gives out much smoke. This substance has been
                        found repeatedly in the Highlands of Scotland. What is called <hi rend="italic">hatchettine,</hi> found in Wales, is merely a variety of
                        mineral tallow.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Proper Bitumens.</hi></p><p>The true bituminous substances may be distinguished by the following
                        properties:</p><p>1. They are either solid or of the consistence of tar.</p><p>2. Their colour is usually brown or black.</p><p>3. They have a peculiar smell, or at least acquire it when rubbed. This smell
                        is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">bituminous</hi> odour.</p><p>4. They become electric by friction, though not insulated.</p><p>5. They melt when heated, and burn with a strong smell, a bright flame, and
                        much smoke.</p><p>6. They are insoluble in water and alcohol, but are commonly soluble in ether
                        and the fixed and volatile oils.</p><p>7. They do not combine with alkaline leys, nor form soaps.</p><p>8. Acids have little action on them; the sulphuric scarcely any; the nitric,
                        by long and repeated digestions, dissolves them, and converts them into a
                        yellow substance, soluble both in water and alcohol, and similar to the
                        product formed by the action of nitric acid on resins.</p><p>There are three bitumens, namely, asphaltum, mineral tar, and mineral
                        caoutchouc.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Asphaltum</hi> is solid, and is found abundantly in a lake
                        in Trinidad, in Albania, and on the shores of the Dead Sea. It was one of
                        the principal ingredients in the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Greek

                        resemblance which it has to Indian rubber or common caoutchouc. It is soft
                        and elastic, but in other respects possesses the characters of
                        asphaltum.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Pit coal,</hi> so abundant in this country, and
                        constituting so valuable a portion of our mineral riches, is intimately
                        connected with bitumen. Hardly any doubt can be entertained that it is of
                        vegetable origin, though it must have been deposited before the present race
                        of inhabitants existed on the earth. There are five different kinds of pit
                        coal which exist in Great Britain. They have been distinguished by the
                        following names:</p><p>1. Kilkenny coal.</p><p>2. Caking coal.</p><p>3. Splint coal.</p><p>4. Cherry coal.</p><p>5. Cannel coal.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Kilkenny coal</hi> has a semimetallic lustre, is black,
                        and does not soil the fingers. Its specific gravity is 1*4354. It consumes
                        without flame, and leaves about four per cent, of light-brown ashes,
                        composed principally of silica and iron. It consists of about thirty-five
                        atoms of carbon united to two atoms of oxygen.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Caking coal</hi> is so called because when heated it
                        melts into a kind of bituminous mass, in consequence of which all the pieces
                        of coal, however small, adhere together into a cake. Its colour is velvet

                        candle when lighted, and is often employed as a substitute for candles. It
                        abounds at Wigan, occurs near Coventry, in the Marquis of Anglesey’s park,
                        is found in Ayrshire, and at Lesmahago in Lanarkshire. Colour dark-grayish

                        good polish, and is often cut into ornaments like jet. Fragments sometimes
                        cubic, sometimes wedge-shaped, and sometimes amorphous, but most commonly
                        sharp edged. About as hard as caking coal. Brittle. Not nearly so easily

                        coking is Kilkenny coal, or Welsh culm, which seems to agree with it. Caking
                        coal comes next, and cannel coal is the worst of all.</p><p>DIVISION III.—OF SECONDARY COMPOUNDS.</p><p>By secondary compounds is meant the compounds formed by the union of the
                        primary compounds with each other. Now, as the neutral primary compounds
                        enter into but few combinations, it is obvious that the secondary compounds
                        must consist chiefly of combinations of the acids with bases. Such compounds
                        are called <hi rend="italic">salts.</hi> They constitute a very'· numerous
                        and important set of bodies, which it is of great consequence to understand
                        well.</p><p>The word <hi rend="italic">salt</hi> was originally confined to <hi rend="italic">common salt,</hi> a substance which was known and in common
                        use from the remotest ages. It was afterwards generalized by chemists, and
                        employed by them in a very extensive and not very definite sense. Every body
                        which is sapid, easily melted, soluble in water, and not combustible, was
                        called a salt.</p><p>In process of time the term salt was restricted to three classes of bodies;
                        namely, <hi rend="italic">acids, alhalies,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">compounds</hi> which acids form with alkalies, earths, and metallic oxides.
                        The first two of these classes were called <hi rend="italic">simple
                        salts.</hi> The salts belonging to the third class were called <hi rend="italic">compound</hi> or <hi rend="italic">neutral.</hi> This last
                        appellation originated from an opinion that acids and alkalies, of which
                        they are composed, were of a contrary nature, and that they counteracted one
                        another, so that the resulting compounds possessed neither the properties of
                        acids nor of alkalies, but properties intermediate between the two.</p><p>The term <hi rend="italic">salt</hi> is now still further restricted.
                        Acidsand alkalies are no longer considered as <hi rend="italic">salts.</hi>
                        The term is applied only to the combinations of acids with alkalies, earths,
                        and metallic oxides. Now as there are nine classes <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352788" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2788-0445"/> of acids,
                        it is obvious that there must be as many different classes of salts.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CLASS</hi> I.—OXYGEN ACID SALTS.</p><p>This class of salts has been longest known and most completely investigated;
                        of course the salts belonging to it are by far the most numerous. The genera
                        of these salts are named from their acids. Thus, if the acid which a salt
                        contains be the sulphuric, it is called a <hi rend="italic">sulphate,</hi>
                        if it be nitric, it is called a <hi rend="italic">nitrate,</hi> and so on.
                        The species are distinguished from each other by adding the name of the
                        base. Thus <hi rend="italic">sulphate of soda</hi> is a salt composed of
                        sulphuric acid and soda; <hi rend="italic">oxalate of lime</hi> is a salt
                        composed of oxalic acid and lime. When the salt is a compound of one atom of
                        acid and one atom of base, it is distinguished simply by its name. If the
                        salt contains two atoms of acid united to one atom of base, the Latin
                        numeral <hi rend="italic">bis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bi</hi> is prefixed.
                        Thus <hi rend="italic">bisulphate of potash</hi> is a salt composed of two
                        atoms of sulphuric acid and one atom of potash. When there are three, four,
                        &amp;c. atoms of acid, the numeral adverbs <hi rend="italic">ter,</hi><hi rend="italic">quater,</hi> &amp;c. are prefixed. Thus <hi rend="italic">qziateroxalate of potash</hi> means a compound of four atoms of oxalic acid
                        and one atom of potash. When there exists a compound of an atom and a half
                        of acid united to one atom of base, the Latin term <hi rend="italic">sesqui</hi> (one and a half) is prefixed. Thus <hi rend="italic">sesquicarbonate of soda</hi> is a compound of one and a half atom of
                        carbonic acid and one atom of soda.</p><p>When there exists a combination of two atoms of base with one atom of acid,
                        this is denoted by prefixing the Greek numeral adverb <hi rend="italic">dis.</hi> Thus <hi rend="italic">diphosphate of potash</hi> means a
                        compound of two atoms of potash with one atom of phosphoric acid. The
                        prefixed ⅛⅛ <hi rend="italic">tetrahis,</hi> &amp;c. indicate three, four,
                        &amp;c. atoms of base with one atom of acid.</p><p>The arranging of the salts according to the bases is attended with such
                        considerable advantage that it has been generally adopted by modern
                        chemists. Now there arc fifty-one bases known to be capable of combining
                        with acids. If therefore we divide the oxygen acid salts according to their
                        bases, we shall have fifty-one genera. A minute description of all the salts
                        belonging to these genera, which are very numerous, would be inconsistent
                        with the limits to which an article of this kind ought to extend. We refer
                        the reader who wishes for a detailed description of each of these bodies, so
                        far as they have been examined, to the second volume of Dr Thomson’s work on
                        the <hi rend="italic">Chemistry of Inorganic Bodies,</hi> where they occupy
                        no less a space than 566 closely printed pages. Here we shall give the
                        characters of the different genera, and point out the number of each which
                        have been examined; for it is scarcely necessary to observe, that in
                        consequence of the difficulty of procuring various acids and bases, many of
                        the saline substances have been hitherto but superficially examined.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 1. <hi rend="italic">Salts of Ammonia.</hi></p><p>The salts of ammonia, with a very few exceptions, are all soluble in
                        water.</p><p>1. When potash or lime is mixed with an ammoniacal salt, a smell of ammonia
                        is emitted.</p><p>2. If to an ammoniacal salt dissolved in water a little solution containing
                        magnesia be added, and afterwards some phosphate of soda dropt in, a white
                        precipitate falls.</p><p>3. When an ammoniacal salt is exposed to heat it is completely dissipated in
                        vapours, except when the acid has a fixed metal, or phosphorus, or boron,
                        for its base, in which case the acid alone remains behind, the ammonia being
                        dissipated.</p><p>4. The ammoniacal salts are not precipitated by infusion of nutgalls or
                        prussiate of potash.</p><p>5. When a solution of chloride of platinum is dropt into an ammoniacal salt,
                        a yellow-coloured precipitate falls in very small crystals.</p><p>This genus of salts has been long known, and pretty completely investigated.
                        The number of ammoniacal salts at present known amount to seventy-seven.
                        Besides these, there arc sixty-eight double salts containing ammonia. Thus
                        the whole ammoniacal oxygen acid salts at present known, single and double,
                        amount to 145.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Salts of Potash.</hi></p><p>The salts of potash, a very few excepted, are soluble in water; but in
                        general they are less soluble than those of ammonia.</p><p>1. Many of them can be obtained in the state of crystals, but a number of
                        them likewise refuse to crystallize. In general they have a less tendency to
                        form regular crystals than the salts of soda.</p><p>2. If tartaric acid dissolved in water be dropt into an aqueous solution of a
                        salt of potash, the liquid speedily deposits a white granular sediment. This
                        sediment has a sour taste, and consists of small crystals of <hi rend="italic">cream of tartar,</hi> or bitartrate of potash.</p><p>3. If a solution of sulphate of alumina be dropt into a salt of potash,
                        octahedral crystals of alum are soon deposited.</p><p>4. The salts of potash may be exposed to a red heat without being volatilized
                        like the salts of ammonia. If the acid contained in the salt be combustible,
                        it is decomposed, and carbonate of potash, mixed with a little charcoal,
                        remains behind. If the acid is not combustible the salt usually fuses, and
                        its nature is not altered, though to this there are some exceptions. Thus
                        the <hi rend="italic">nitric</hi> acid is gradually decomposed at a red
                        heat, sulphurous acid lets sulphur sublime, phosphorous acid allows
                        phosphuretted hydrogen to escape, and chloric acid gives out abundance of
                        oxygen gas.</p><p>5. The salts of potash are not precipitated by infusion of nutgalls, nor by
                        prussiate of potash.</p><p>6. They are not affected by sulphuretted hydrogen gas, nor by the addition of
                        a sulphohydrate, except when their acid contains a metal for its base, in
                        which case the acid may be decomposed and precipitated, and the potash left
                        behind.</p><p>7. When a solution of chloride of platinum is dropt into a salt of potash, an
                        orange, or yellow-coloured precipitate falls.</p><p>Sulphate of alumina and chloride of platinum are precipitated likewise by
                        salts of ammonia. We must therefore, in order to know whether a salt so
                        precipitated contains ammonia or potash for its base, expose it to a red
                        heat. If it be an ammoniacal salt, it will be dissipated or decomposed,
                        leaving the acid (if fixed); but a potash salt will either not be altered,
                        or it will leave potash, usually in the state of carbonate, behind.</p><p>A salt with base of potash may be distinguished by the blowpipe in the
                        following manner: Fuse before the blowpipe a little borax to which a small
                        portion of oxide of nickel has been added. A yellowish glass is obtained.
                        Fuse this bead with a little of the salt under examination. If it contain
                        potash the bead will assume a <hi rend="italic">bluish</hi> colour.</p><p>The salts of potash known and described amount to ninety-nine, besides,
                        eighty-three double salts into which potash enters as a constituent. Thus
                        the potash salts at present known and examined amount to 182.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Salts of Soda.</hi></p><p>In general the salts of soda are much more soluble in water than the
                        corresponding salts of potash. Many of the salts of potash contain no water
                        of crystallization, but <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352801" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2801-0446"/> the greater number of the soda salts contain
                        a good deal of water.</p><p>1. When exposed to a red heat they usually speedily melt into a liquid, in
                        consequence of the great quantity of water which they contain. If the heat
                        be continued, the water is driven off, and the salt converted into a white
                        powder. When the heat is further urged, if the acid be of a combustible
                        nature it is destroyed; if it be volatile it is driven off; but if it be
                        fixed the salt melts again at a red heat, and continues in a liquid state as
                        long as the temperature is kept up. The salt on cooling is in the state of
                        an opaque white mass, and is usually destitute of water.</p><p>2. No precipitate is produced in salts of soda by tartaric acid or chloride
                        of platinum; nor does sulphate of alumina when added occasion the
                        precipitation of octahedral crystals of alum; nor is any precipitate
                        produced by infusion of nutgalls or prussiate of potash, except when the
                        basis of the acid happens to be a metal.</p><p>3. One of the easiest methods of determining whether the base of a given salt
                        be potash or soda, is to determine the shape of the crystals which it forms.
                        If it does not shoot into regular crystals, separate the acid by means of
                        sulphuric or nitric acid, and let the new-formed salt crystallize. Sulphate
                        of potash crystallizes in right rhombic prisms; but commonly from
                        truncations it puts on the form of a pyramidal dodecahedron composed of two
                        sixsided pyramids applied base to base. Sulphate of soda crystallizes in
                        oblique, rhombic prisms; but it is usually in long six-sided prisms
                        longitudinally striated. Sulphate of potash when exposed to the air
                        undergoes no change, but sulphate of soda soon falls to powder. Nitrate of
                        potash crystallizes in long six-sided prisms, but nitrate of soda in
                        rhomboids, the faces of which meet at angles of 106° 30' and 73° 30'.</p><p>The salts of soda known and described amount to ninety-one, besides
                        twenty-six double salts into which soda enters as a constituent; thus the
                        whole soda salts at present known amount to 117.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">Salts of Lithia.</hi></p><p>Lithia has been known only for a short time, and is scarce. This is the
                        reason why its salts have been but superficially examined.</p><p>1. They are all soluble in water (as far as is known), and in this respect
                        resemble the salts of potash and soda. But the carbonate of lithia is much
                        less soluble than either the carbonate of potash or of soda.</p><p>2. When carbonate of potash is dropt into a concentrated solution of a salt
                        of lithia, a white precipitate falls. This precipitate maybe dissolved again
                        by diluting the liquid with a sufficient quantity of water, or by raising it
                        to the boiling point.</p><p>3. Chloride of platinum occasions no precipitate when dropt into a salt of
                        lithia.</p><p>4. Several of the salts of lithia melt at a very low temperature.</p><p>5. When the salts of lithia are heated to redness in a platinum vessel, they
                        act with considerable energy upon that metal.</p><p>6. Neither prussiate of potash nor infusion of nutgalls occasion any
                        precipitate in the salts of lithia.</p><p>7. Salts of lithia are not precipitated by caustic potash.</p><p>8. If to a salt of lithia we add a quantity of phosphate of soda, and
                        evaporate, the solution becomes muddy. If we evaporate to dryness, and pour
                        water on the residue, a white powder remains undissolved, which falls slowly
                        to the bottom of the vessel.</p><p>9. When an alcoholic solution of a lithia salt is set on fire, it burns with
                        a purple-red colour.</p><p>10. If we mix together one part of fluor spar and one and a half part of
                        sulphate of ammonia, and add to the mixture a little of any lithia salt, and

                        less soluble than the salts of lime.</p><p>1. The greater number of them are capable of assuming a crystalline form,
                        though they are not more given to crystallize than the salts of barytes.</p><p>2. Solutions of strontian arc prccipitated by the sulphates, phosphates, and

                        when dropt into a salt of strontian.</p><p>3. We can distinguish a salt of strontian from a salt of barytes by means of
                        succinate of ammonia. When we drop this salt into a neutral solution of
                        strontian no precipitate falls, but a precipitate immediately appears if we

                        solution of carbonate of potash, a white powder remains, which is soluble,
                        with effervescence, in nitric acid, and which possesses all the characters

                        tartrate of ammonia does not occasion an immediate precipitate, though
                        racemate of ammonia does.</p><p>3. The salts of lime are not precipitated by prussiate of potash; but some of

                        of crystallizing.</p><p>1. When any of the fixed alkalies or their carbonates is dropt into a salt of
                        magnesia, a white flocky precipitate falls.</p><p>2. No precipitate appears when sulphate of soda is dropt into a salt of
                        magnesia, because sulphate of magnesia is a very soluble and crystallizable
                        salt.</p><p>5. If phosphate of soda be dropt into a salt of magnesia, no precipitate
                        appears; but if any ammonia be added, a white precipitate falls, which is a
                        double salt, composed of phosphoric acid, magnesia, and ammonia. This
                        precipitate furnishes the best method yet discovered for detecting the
                        presence of magnesia, and even for separating it from other bodies.</p><p>4. Prussiate of potash occasions no precipitate in a salt of magnesia, unless
                        the acid happen to have a metal for its base.</p><p>5. Magnesia has a great tendency to enter into double combinations,
                        especially with ammonia and potash.</p><p>6. When a salt of magnesia is tinged with a little nitrate of cobalt, and
                        fused before the blowpipe with a strong blast, it assumes a fine flesh
                        colour, the tint of which is very feeble, and not easily distinguished till
                        the assay is perfectly cold. When the acid of the salt is combustible or
                        volatile, we are not able to accomplish the fusion of it before the
                        blowpipe; in such cases we must add borax or biphosphate of soda.</p><p>The salts of magnesia which have been examined and described amount to

                        capable of crystallizing.</p><p>1. They are distinguished by a sweet and astringent taste. In this respect
                        they resemble the salts of glucina, yttria, and chromium, though they are
                        much less sweet; and the salts of chromium want the astringency which
                        characterizes the aluminous salts.</p><p>2. They are not precipitated by oxalate of ammonia nor tartaric acid, which
                        sufficiently distinguishes them from salts of yttria.</p><p>3. They are not precipitated by prussiate of potash nor by tincture of
                        nutgalls, in which respect they differ both from salts of yttria and of
                        glucina.</p><p>4. Phosphate of ammonia, when dropt into an aluminous salt, occasions a white
                        precipitate.</p><p>5. Hydriodate of potash occasions a white flocky precipitate in a solution of
                        alumina, which speedily becomes yellow, and continues permanent. This is not
                        owing to the excess of acid which the salts of alumina usually contain; for
                        the yellow colour does not disappear on the addition of carbonate of
                        ammonia.</p><p>6. If sulphuric acid, and then sulphate of potash, be added to a salt of
                        alumina, and the liquid be set aside, octahedral crystals of alum soon make
                        their appearance in it.</p><p>7. When nitrate of cobalt is mixed with a mineral containing alumina, and the
                        mixture is exposed to the action of the blowpipe, it acquires a fine blue
                        colour, which becomes deeper without altering its nature on the addition of
                        more cobalt. This colour is only seen distinctly by daylight, and after the
                        assay is cold. This method of proceeding may be followed with most of the
                        salts of alumina.</p><p>8. Most of the salts of alumina are decomposed by a red heat, the acid being
                        dissipated and the alumina left. The only exceptions consist of those salts
                        which contain a fixed acid, as borate, phosphate, tungstate, &amp;c.</p><p>The salts of alumina which have been examined and described amount only to
                        thirty-nine; of these, eleven have been subjected to analysis. There are
                        also eleven double salts containing alumina. Thus the whole aluminous salts

                        yttria, and a smaller number of them seem susceptible of crystallizing.</p><p>2. They are not precipitated by oxalate of ammonia or tartrate of potash,
                        which sufficiently distinguishes them from salts of yttria.</p><p>3. Prussiate of potash occasions a white precipitate when dropt into a
                        solution of a salt of glucina.</p><p>4. Infusion of nutgalls occasions a yellowish precipitate, which acquires a
                        purplish tint if any iron be present.</p><p>5. The sulphate of glucina does not crystallize, nor do crystals of alum form
                        in it when sulphate of potash 'is mixed with the solution.</p><p>6. When a salt of glucina is mixed with a little nitrate of cobalt, and

                        potash.</p><p>4. The alkaline carbonates throw down a white precipitate when dropt into
                        solutions of yttria in acids; but the precipitate is redissolved by adding
                        an excess of the carbonate. In this property yttria agrees with glucina.</p><p>5. The salts of yttria have fully as sweet a taste as those of glucina, but
                        they are also astringent. The taste is nearly similar to a mixture of a

                        the manganese is thrown down black and very bulky. This precipitate consists
                        of deutoxide of manganese. Chloride of lime also throws down manganese in
                        the state of deutoxide, but it is combined with a portion of lime.</p><p>8. Ammonia throws down a white precipitate, which gradually becomes black if
                        air have access to it. If we add some sal ammoniac to the solution, ammonia
                        becomes incapable of throwing down the protoxide of manganese. A solution of
                        sal ammoniac immediately dissolves the precipitate thrown down by ammonia;
                        but on leaving the liquid exposed to the air the precipitate again

                        acid, and the solution is transparent and colourless.</p><p>1. When potash is dropt into a salt of red oxide of mercury, a yellow
                        precipitate falls, not soluble in an excess of the potash; but if to the

                        prussiate of potash. 'The prussiate of potash precipitate after some time
                        becomes blue.</p><p>4. Sulphohydrate of ammonia added in very small quantity produces a black
                        precipitate, which, when the liquid is shaken, becomes white, and remains
                        long suspended. When sulphobydrate of ammonia is added in excess, the
                        precipitate is black, and is not altered by agitation. It is insoluble in
                        ammonia, but dissolves in potash. Sulphuretted hydrogen acts in the same

                        added.</p><p>3. When ammonia, in very small quantities, is poured into a salt of silver, a
                        brown precipitate falls, which dissolves at once when a little more ammonia

                        occasions a white precipitate.</p><p>6. Sulphohydrate of potassium throws down a black precipitate.</p><p>7. Muriatic acid, or the chlorides of the alkaline bases, occasion a heavy

                        of re-agents on this solution is as follows :—</p><p>1. Potash added in excess produces no change at first, but by degrees the
                        liquid assumes a greenish colour, and a little black matter falls down.</p><p>2. Ammonia throws down a dirty-yellow precipitate, which is fulminating gold,

                        and throws down a brown-coloured precipitate when the solution is more
                        concentrated.</p><p>8. Sulphohydrate of ammonia throws down a dark-brown precipitate, which is

                        acids; but it dissolves when heated in an excess of potash, and does not
                        again precipitate when the liquid cools.</p><p>3. With ammonia the phenomena are exactly the same as with potash.</p><p>4. Carbonates of ammonia and potash produce a similar effect. But the
                        precipitates are not redissolved when heated in an excess of the alkaline
                        carbonates.</p><p>5. Neither soda nor its carbonates throw down any precipitate.</p><p>6. Nitrated suboxide of mercury throws down a yellowish-red precipitate.</p><p>7. Neither oxalic acid nor phosphate of soda occasions any precipitate.</p><p>8. Sulphuretted hydrogen changes the colour to brown, and by degrees a brown
                        precipitate falls, which becomes gradually black. Sulphohydrate of ammonia
                        produces the same effect, but the precipitate is redissolved when an excess
                        of the sulphohydrate is added.</p><p>9. A plate of zinc precipitates platinum from its solution in the state of a

                        to absorb oxygen as the salts of deutoxide of molybdenum, and may therefore
                        be concentrated without so much risk of alteration. Sometimes (especially
                        when they have an excess of acid) they assume a purple colour, precisely
                        like the salts of sesquioxide of manganese in the same circumstances. Eleven
                        of these salts have been formed, but they have been all very superficially

                        superficially. The difficulty of procuring the deutoxide in sufficient

                        are acidified by nitric acid, this acid dissolves molybdic acid; and when
                        the solution is di luted with water it has a yellow colour; but it soon be-:
                        comes muddy, and deposits molybdic acid in the form of a white powder. When
                        this precipitate is washed and dried it is a white matter, which, when
                        ignited, gives out about one per cent, of water. The ignited mass is soft to
                        the touch, and may be spread upon the skin. In this state it dissolves
                        easily in acids, and forms a genus of salts which have not been much
                        examined. About nine of them have been examined, though rather

                        through the filter. When the solution contains zirconia, the whole titanic

                        so strong, that we believe all chemists are at present disposed to consider
                        it as by far the most probable opinion. At all events, the genera of salts

                        cyanogen is not only itself derived from the animal kingdom, but it is
                        liable to undergo changes quite analogous to those which puzzle us so much
                        at present when we attempt to obtain definite views respecting the organic

                        They are of exceedingly easy decomposition, and constitute the prussiates
                        long ago formed and examined by Scheele. It excited at that time great

                        found its place among the oxygen acid salts. We have placed them here
                        because, in the present state of our knowledge, it is better that all the
                        salts containing cyanogen should be placed together. The cyanates consist of
                        combinations of the cyanic acid with bases. The number of them hitherto
                        formed is only nine, and none of them possesses any remarkable
                        properties.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Cyanurates.</hi></p><p>This genus consists of combinations of cyanuric acid with bases. The acid has
                        been so recently discovered, and obtained in so small quantities, that

                        general very loudly when struck upon an anvil, or when heated. They owe this
                        property to the fιιl-minic acid which they contain, the nature and
                        constitution of which has been explained in a preceding part of this
                        article. These fulminates are easily obtained, by double decomposition, from
                        the fulminate of mercury. Mr E. Davy has described no fewer than twenty-four
                        of them. The most formidable of thfem is fulminate of silver, originally
                        discovered by Mr Howard.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 5. <hi rend="italic">Sulphocyanodides.</hi></p><p>This genus consists of combinations of the hydrosulphocyanic acid originally
                        discovered by Mr Porrett with bases. It is at present the opinion that this
                        acid loses its atom of hydrogen, while the oxides give out their oxygen, and
                        are converted into simple bases. Hence the name <hi rend="italic">sulphoey∙

                        are known, most of which were first examined by Mr Porrett. The most
                        remarkable of them is the hydrosulphoeyanated peroxide of iron, which has a
                        beautiful crimson colour, and is very deliquescent.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 6. <hi rend="italic">Bisulphocyanodides.</hi></p><p>This genus of salts is still almost unknown. Four of them have been formed by

                        thrown down by the action of a solution of ferroprussiate of potash on a
                        metallic solution. They consist in general of two cyanodides united
                        together; and it is to this double combination that they are indebted for
                        their greater permanency than the simple cyanodides. The most important of
                        them all is the <hi rend="italic">ferrocyanodide of 1)otassium,</hi> which
                        used to be called <hi rend="italic">ferroprussiate,</hi> or simply <hi rend="italic">prussiate of potash.</hi> It is a fine yellow salt,
                        crystallized in octahedrons composed of two four-sided pyramids with square
                        bases, applied base to base, and the apexes of both pyramids truncated. Its
                        taste is very strong and disagreeable. It loses its water when gently
                        heated. A red heat decomposes the cyanodide of iron which it contains; and
                        by throwing down the iron from its solution, and afterwards evaporating, we
                        obtain cyanodide of potassium.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193352944" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2944-0457"/><p>The ferrocyanodides at present known amount to twenty-nine, but the greater

                        species.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CLASS</hi> VII. SULPHUR ACID SALTS.</p><p>It has been already stated that sulphur, when it combines with the
                        acidifiable bases, converts many of them into acids, while its compounds,
                        with the alkalifiable bases, constitute alkalies or salifiable bases. The
                        acid compounds of sulphur we call <hi rend="italic">sulphides,</hi> the
                        alkaline <hi rend="italic">sulphureis.</hi> A sulphide has the property of
                        combining with a sulpliuret, without decomposition, and of forming a salt;
                        but when it comes in contact with an oxide, chloride, bromide, or iodide,
                        decomposition takes place. Hence all the sulphur-salts contain as a base a
                        sulphuret. The genera of sulphur-salts will increase much when the general
                        attention of chemists is turned towards them. Hitherto only a few have been
                        investigated.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 1. <hi rend="italic">Sulphohydrates.</hi></p><p>The acid of this genus has been long known under the name of sulphuretted
                        hydrogen gas, and its acid properties are well determined. But as the term
                        sulphuretted hydrogen is not well adapted for the generic name of a class of
                        salts, it has been deemed requisite to change it to sulphohydrogen, from
                        which <hi rend="italic">sulphohydrate,</hi> a term analogous to the generic
                        names of the oxygen acid salts, is easily derived. In a similar way all the
                        genera of the sulphur-salts are formed. What we call <hi rend="italic">sulphohydrates,</hi> then, is the same as the salts formerly called <hi rend="italic">hydrosulphurets,</hi> and first imperfectly described by
                        Berthollet. Eight of these sulphohydrates have been particularly examined,
                        namely, those which have for their bases ammonia, potassium, sodium,
                        lithium, barium, strontium, calcium, and magnesium.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">Eisulphocarbonate.</hi></p><p>The acid of this genus is the transparent liquid composed of two atoms of
                        sulphur and one atom of carbon, formerly distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">bisulphuret of carbon,</hi> and now called bisulphide of
                        carbon. It combines with many of the sulphurets, and forms salts, many of
                        which are insoluble powders; while others are soluble, and capable of
                        crystallizing. Twenty-seven such combinations have been examined, though not
                        with much care. They may be frequently formed by placing bisulphide of
                        carbon in contact with an alcoholic solution of a sulphuret. A good many are
                        easily procured by double decomposition.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Sulpho-arseniates.</hi></p><p>Arsenic and sulphur combine, as has been already explained, in three
                        proportions, and all the three possess acid characters. By suĭpho-arseniates
                        we mean those sulphur-salts that have the <hi rend="italic">sulphide of

It is analogous to arsenic acid.</p><p>The sulpho-arseniates may be formed in various ways.</p><p>1. By digesting a sulphuret with sulphide of arsenic.</p><p>2. By treating a sulphohydrate with sulphide of arsenic.</p><p>3. When an arseniate is decomposed by sulphide of hydrogen, the oxygen salt
                        is destroyed, and an equal number of atoms of sulphur enter into the salt in
                        place of the oxygen. This decomposition proceeds at first slowly, but
                        becomes at last more rapid; and it is the best method of obtaining in a
                        state of purity those salts that do not crystallize. The decomposition is
                        completed when the salt is no longer rendered muddy by chloride of barium or
                        calcium. Those arseniates which are soluble in muriatic acid (though
                        insoluble in water) may be decomposed, if their basis consists of a metal
                        which is thrown down by sulphide of hydrogen, for example arseniate of
                        copper.</p><p>4. When sulphide of arsenic is dissolved in caustic ammonia, or by means of
                        an earthy hydrate: but in that case the sulpho-arseniate is mixed with an
                        arseniate, and the sulphide of arsenic is driven off by acids without any
                        smell of sulphide of hydrogen.</p><p>5. When sulphide of arsenic is boiled with the carbonates. The carbonic acid
                        may be completely driven off; but in this case also there is a mixture of
                        arseniate present.</p><p>6. When sulphide of arsenic is fused in the dry way with a hydrate or a
                        carbonate, which is present in excess. In that case we obtain a
                        sulpho-arseniate, mixed with a sulphate and an arseniate, while metallic
                        arsenic sublimes.</p><p>7. When sulphide of arsenic is digested with a solution of quatersulphuret of
                        potassium. All higher sιιlphurets produce the same salts, while at the same
                        time sulphur is precipitated.</p><p>8. When an arseniate is mixed with a sulphohydrate of ammonia. Ammonia and
                        the excess of the sulphohydrate are distilled off, and the sulpho-arseniate
                        remains in the retort. This method answers only with those salts whose bases
                        are not precipitated by ammonia.</p><p>The colour of the sulpho-arseniates having an alkaline metal for a base is
                        yellow when anhydrous. The aqueous solutions are nearly colourless. The
                        colour of the metalline salts varies. The taste of these salts is hepatic,
                        and at the same time a very nauseous bitter. When decomposed by an acid,
                        they give out a peculiar hepatic odour, like the smell of orpiment in
                        linseed-oil varnish. Most of them are insoluble in water. Those containing
                        the bases of the alkalies and alkaline earths, and a few others, constitute
                        exceptions. They have a strong tendency to form subsalts, consisting of an
                        atom of the acid combined with an atom and a half of the base. These
                        subsalts crystallize very readily, while this is frequently not the case
                        with the neutral salts; hence the difficulty of obtaining the neutral
                        salts.</p><p>When alcohol is mixed with a concentrated solution of these salts, it
                        occasions a peculiar alteration in them. A subsalt containing two thirds of
                        the sulphide of arsenic is precipitated, commonly in a crystalline state,
                        and the liquid becomes yellow. It now holds in solution a
                        bisulpho-arseniate, sometimes mixed with a small portion of the subsalt held
                        in solution. From this spirituous liquid the bisulpho-arseniate may be
                        obtained by hasty evaporation in a flat glass. It leaves a solid matter, of
                        a lemonyellow colour, which is decomposed by water, leaving sulphide of
                        arsenic. If the spirituous solution in considerable quantity be concentrated
                        on the sand-bath it gives, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352957" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2957-0458"/> by slow cooling, a light-yellow striated or
                        sealymass, and at the bottom of the retort is deposited a fine red or
                        reddish-yellow powder. The yellow, crystallized mass is <hi rend="italic">persulphuret of arsenic,</hi> and the red substance deposited <hi rend="italic">sulphide of arsenic.</hi></p><p>The sulpho-arseniates are decomposed by acids with the evolution of sulphide
                        of hydrogen. If the solution be dilute, no effervescence takes place, the
                        liquid merely smells of sulphide of hydrogen. Even carbonic acid gas passed
                        through the solutions of these salts throws down sulphide of arsenic.</p><p>The sulpho-arseniates have a great tendency to form double salts with each
                        other, and this disposition is most remarkable in those which have a
                        tendency to unite when in the state of oxygen salts. Thus sulpho-arseniate
                        of sodium and ammonia unite into a crystallized double salt.</p><p>When these salts are heated to redness in an open vessel they are easily
                        decomposed, sulphurous acid and arsenious acid are given out, and a sulphate
                        remains without any trace of an arseniate.</p><p>The sulpho-arseniates hitherto examined amount to thirty-seven. Of these,
                        five have been subjected to analysis. For the investigation of these salts
                        we are indebted to Berzelius.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">Sulpho-arsenites.

                        sesquisulphide of arsenic, and the alkaline sulphurets. They may be obtained
                        in the samewayas the sulpho-arseniates, substituting for arsenic acid and
                        sulphide of arsenic, arsenious acid and orpiment. They are formed
                        exclusively in the dry way, and cannot be obtained by means of the alkaline
                        sulphurets.</p><p>Alkaline sulphohydrates dissolve orpiment only till the solution contains a
                        bisulpho-arseniate. The sulphurets of barium, calcium, and magnesium, take
                        up a very inconsiderable excess of orpiment.</p><p>These salts (when their bases are colourless), whether neutral or in the
                        state of subsalts, are colourless, or have only a slight tint of yellow. The
                        salts with coloured bases have in general the same colours with the
                        sulpho-arseniates; their taste and smell are also similar.</p><p>They are best obtained either in a solid form or in a dilute solution. The
                        subsalts may be kept better than the neutral or supersalts. When a solution
                        of tìiese salts is evaporated, it begins, at a certain degree of
                        concentration, to assume a brownish-yellow colour. It then deposits a brown
                        powder, which increases till the salt dries, when it is in a great measure
                        decomposed into sulpho-arseniate and subsulpho-arsenite. Water dissolves
                        only the first of these salts, leaving the second, which, however, may be
                        taken up by boiling water. Alcohol produces a similar deposition.</p><p>Orpiment dissolves easily in caustic potash or soda. The cold solution is
                        nearly colourless. When boiled it assumes a dark-brown colour, and at last
                        deposits a dark-brown powder, which when dry is almost black.</p><p>The sulpho-arsenites with an alkaline basis are not decomposed at a red heat
                        in a retort. The others lose more or less of their orpiment. By alcohol they
                        are decomposed in the same way as the sulpho-arseniates. The subsalts, which
                        are thrown down by alcohol, are obtained only when the solution is not fully
                        saturated with orpiment. By acids they arc altered in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> way analogous to the sulpho-arseniates. Easily reducible oxygen
                        bases or oxides form with them, in the cold, arsenites, and when boiled with
                        them, arseniates, while the reduced metal unites with the sulphur, producing
                        a sulpho arseniate.</p><p>Thc sólptlons, when exposed to the air, undergo similar alterations with the

                        earthy bases are soluble in water. Most of the others are insoluble.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 5. <hi rend="italic">Hyposulpho-arsenites.</hi><hi rend="italic">Realgar,</hi> which is a compound of one atom sulphur and
                        one atom arsenic, has likewise the property of combining with alkaline
                        sulphurets. These salts may be called <hi rend="italic">hyposulpho-arsenites,</hi> from analogy with the hyposulphites and
                        hypophosphites, which exhibit analogous combinations among the oxygen acid
                        salts.</p><p>This combination does not take place directly, for when realgar is digested
                        with sulphuret of potassium, or with caustic potash, it is decomposed, and
                        gives a dark-brown powder, consisting of arsenic combined with a minimum of
                        sulphur. When sulpho-arsenite of potassium is melted with an additional
                        quantity of arsenic, we form hyposulpho-arsenite of potassium, which easily
                        swells up, and the excess of arsenic makes its escape. In water the salt is
                        decomposed, just as when realgar is dissolved in potash.</p><p>If orpiment be boiled with carbonate of potash or soda in a tolerably
                        concentrated solution, and be filtered while boiling hot, a colourless
                        liquid passes through, which, after cooling, deposits (within twelve hours)
                        a copious precipitate, quite similar to kermes mineral. This is a
                        hyposulpho-arsenite of potassium or sodium. It is soluble in water, but not
                        so while the liquid contains sulpho-arsenite of potassium in solution. Let
                        it be collected on the filter, and when the liquid has been drained from it,
                        a little pure water must be poured on it once or twice. It soon swells out,
                        becomes gelatinous, and the liquid passes through pure yellow. The salt
                        precipitates again if the liquid holding it in solution be mixed with more
                        water. It dries into a translucent red mass.</p><p>On the filter remains a dark-brown powder, insoluble in water, which is a
                        bihyposulpho-arsenite of potassium. It melts easily when heated, gives out
                        nothing volatile, and leaves a translucent red mass, insoluble in water.
                        Caustic potash dissolves it with the same phenomena as realgar. When the
                        neutral sulpho-arsenites of the bases of the alkalies and alkaline earths
                        are exposed to spontaneous evaporation, they leave dark-red insoluble
                        compounds, which are <hi rend="italic">bihyposulpho-arsenites.</hi></p><p>With glucinum, yttrium, and aluminum, such compounds are not formed. The red
                        solutions give light-coloured precipitates, with the evolution of sulphide
                        of hydrogen.</p><p>With sulphuret of zirconium realgar unites to a darkbrown precipitate, which
                        sinks slowly. With manganese, zinc, and cerium, are obtained red or
                        dark-yellow precipitates, not like the sulpho-arseniates or
                        sulpho-arsenites; but the remaining metals give precipitates quite similar
                        to the sulpho-arsenites.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 6. <hi rend="italic">Sulphomolybdates.</hi></p><p>The sulphomolybdates consist of combinations of the alkaline sulphurets with
                        tersulphide of molybdenum, which is analogous in its constitution to
                        molybdic acid. The sulphomolybdates are most easily obtained when an oxygen
                        salt is decomposed by sulphide of hydrogen. The decomposition goes on with
                        difficulty in’ dilute solutions, but rapidly in concentrated ones. The
                        liquid becomes red, like a bichromate, or (if it contain iron) reddish
                        brown. These salts, when pure, have a red colour; a shade of brown indicates
                        the presence of iron. An excess of tersulphide of molybdenum likewise
                        renders the colour darker. During evaporation the liquid emits the smell of
                        sulphide of hydrogen, but no precipitate falls, at least at first.</p><p>When burnt they are decomposed. Those which contain the basis of an alkali or
                        alkaline earth are changed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352970" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2970-0459"/> into quatersulphurets of the base, and into
                        bisulphide of molybdenum. The salt of potassium is decomposed to the amount
                        of two thirds, the salt of sodium farther, and the rest altogether. The
                        sulphomolybdates, with weaker bases, give out sulphur, and leave a compound
                        of the base with bisulphide of molybdenum. When the solutions of these salts
                        are left exposed to the air, they are but little altered when in the state
                        of bisulphomolybdates; but the subsalts are oxydized rapidly even in a solid
                        form, and a molybdate with a subsulphite and sulphite is formed, leaving a
                        neutral sulphomolybdate. A grayish-brown matter is gradually deposited,
                        during which the beautiful colour of the solution is altered. It becomes
                        opaque and dark brown, then greenish brown, and at last pure blue. The
                        liquid contains a solution of sulphate and molybdate of potash, together
                        with molybdate of molybdenum.</p><p>Thirty-two of these sulphomolybdates have been formed and examined. Several
                        of these crystallize and form very beautiful salts.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 7. <hi rend="italic">Eypersulphomolybdates.</hi></p><p>These salts are combinations of the quatersulphide of molybdenum with the

                        water, and form crystals of a ruby-red, or sometimes of a fine-yellow
                        colour. Many of them are insoluble powders, of a yellow or brownish-yellow
                        colour.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 9. <hi rend="italic">Sulphotellurates.</hi></p><p>These salts consist of combinations of sulphide of tellurium with the

                        the tellurates or the salts in which oxide of tellurium acts the part of a
                        base, by a current of sulphide of hydrogen. A brown flocky precipitate
                        falls, which is sulphide of tellurium. When heated in close vessels the
                        sulphur is driven off, and pure tellurium remains. Eighteen species have
                        been described, several of which dissolve in water and crystallize. The
                        colour of these salts is usually yellow, sometimes very dark.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Genus</hi> 10. <hi rend="italic">Sulpho-antimoniates.</hi></p><p>There are three sulphides of antimony, namely, persulphide, analogous to

                        analogous to oxide of antimony. Each of these is capable of combining with
                        the sulphurets and forming a genus of sulphur-salts. These may be
                        distinguished by the names of sulpho-antimoniates, sulpho-antimonites, and
                        hyposulpho-antimonites, according to the mode of naming which we adopted for
                        the sulphosalts of arsenic. The antimonial sulphur salts have not yet been

                        two, three, or four different simple substances, are somehow or other united
                        so as to constitute an integrant particle of the organic matter.</p><p>The electrical theory of affinity, which is at present prevalent in
                        chemistry, necessarily leads to the notion that union can take place only
                        between two atoms in different' states of electricity. The compound atoms or
                        particles thus formed may be conceived to be in opposite states of
                        electricity, though undoubtedly these opposite states must be weaker than in
                        the simple substances before union. One atom combined with one atom makes a
                        binary compound. If two binary compounds be in opposite electrical states
                        they will combine and form a quaternary compound, or a compound containing
                        four atoms. Should these quaternary compounds be in different electrical
                        states, they may combine two and two and make an octonary com<pb break="no" facs="nls:193352983" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2983-0460"/>pound, or a
                        compound of eight atoms. Two of these uniting would make a particle
                        containing sixteen atoms. Two of these united would make a particle
                        containing thirty-two atoms. In this way we might suppose compounds to
                        unite, containing, any number of particles whatever, as long as the electric
                        states continued different. But it is evident that the intensity of the
                        electricity must diminish after every new combination; consequently the
                        intimacy of the combination must become less and less, and hence it must
                        happen that they are much more easily decomposed than inorganic bodies,
                        which, containing fewer atoms, or, what comes to the same thing, consisting
                        of a much smaller series of combinations, must be united by a much greater
                        difference in the electric state of the combining bodies.</p><p>It is probably the consequence of this little intensity with which the
                        constituents of organic bodies are united, that they are all capable of
                        being decomposed by heat, which is but rarely the case with inorganic
                        bodies. To the same cause probably we are to ascribe the combustibility
                        which almost all of them possess. Even when the constituents of an organic
                        and inorganic body are the very same, we find the organic body combustible,
                        and the inorganic incombustible. Thus oxalic acid and carbonic acid are
                        composed each of carbon and oxygen; oxalic acid of two atoms carbon and
                        three atoms oxygen, and carbonic acid of one atom carbon and two atoms
                        oxygen.</p><p>Oxalic acid is combustible, and easily decomposed by heat; while carbonic
                        acid is incombustible, and not decomposed by heat, unless assisted by
                        affinity. Thus, if we pass carbonic acid through red-hot charcoal, it is
                        decomposed and converted into carbonic oxide, which is capable of burning.
                        It is in this way that carbonate of lime is deprived of its acid. The coal
                        with which it is mixed deprives it of an atom of oxygen; and the whole, thus
                        converted into carbonic oxide, occasions, by its combustion, the intense
                        heat which continues for so long a period in a well-constructed lime-kiln.
                        We conceive that most of the peculiarities which distinguish organic bodies
                        are derived from their very complicated structurc, which necessarily
                        involves a feeble affinity. How far their formation and properties depend
                        upon the principle of <hi rend="italic">life,</hi> we have no means of
                        determining; but till the inadequacy of the former cause to produce all the
                        peculiarities of organic bodies be proved, we are disposed to rest satisfied
                        with it.</p><p>Organic bodies naturally divide themselves into two great branches, according
                        as they belong to the vegetable or animal kingdom. We shall treat of each of
                        these kingdoms in succession.</p><p>DIVISION I. OF VEGETABLE BODIES.</p><p>Vegetables are too well known to require any definition. They are perhaps the
                        most numerous set of bodies belonging to this globe. The species already
                        known amount to at least 60,000; and as great additions are daily making to
                        this number, and vast tracts of country remain yet unexplored, the
                        probability is, that the whole species of plants on the globe are not fewer
                        than 120,000. The nature of the substances which belong to the vegetable
                        kingdom has attracted the attention of chemists almost from the commencement
                        of the science. Their number has increased as analytical chemistry improved,
                        and very great accessions have been made to that number during the course of
                        the present century.</p><p>The principles of vegetables, or the different substances which may be
                        extracted from the vegetable kingdom, naturally divide themselves into three
                        sets, namely, <hi rend="italic">acids, alhalies,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">neutral bodies.</hi> These three sets will constitute the subject of the
                        three following chapters.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP</hi>. I. OF VEGETABLE ACIDS.</p><p>The acids which exist in the vegetable kingdom, oı which may be obtained by
                        certain processes from vegetable principles, amount to about fifty-eight. We
                        thoughl it better to describe them in a former part of this article, while
                        treating of primary compounds. We refer the reader who wishes to make
                        himself acquainted with these acids to that part of our article.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP</hi>. II. OF VEGETABLE ALKALIES.</p><p>Ammonia probably occurs in the vegetable kingdom, but certainly rarely, and
                        rather as a product in certair decompositions which vegetable bodies
                        containing azote are apt to undergo, than as a real constituent of vegetable
                        substances. Potash and soda occur in small quantities ir vegetables, always
                        or almost always in combination with acids. Lime is also a pretty common
                        constituent; but it occurs only in small quantity, and, like potash and
                        soda, is almost always in combination with an acid. Lithia has never been
                        found in the vegetable kingdom; and barytes, strontian, and magnesia, are
                        exceedingly rare. These substances have been described in a preceding part
                        of this article, and are not usually considered as belonging to the
                        vegetable kingdom. But there are a considerable number of vegetable
                        principles, which may be extracted by chemical processes, and obtained in a
                        separate state, and which possess alkaline properties; for they are capable
                        of combining with and neutralizing acids; These in general act with great
                        energy on living beings. Some of them are narcotics; others violent
                        stimulants, and as such very active poisons; while there are others which
                        act as emetics, or cathartics, or tonics. We shall devote this chapter to
                        the description of these important bodies, all of which have been made known
                        to chemists since the beginning of the present century,—with very few
                        exceptions, indeed, since the year 1810. The investigation was begun by
                        Sertürner, an apothecary at Eimbeck, in Hanover, who extracted <hi rend="italic">morphin</hi> from opium, and pointed out its alkaline
                        characters in 1817. The subject was taken up by Pelletier and Caventou, who
                        made known a variety of these vegetable alkalies. Of late years Dumas and
                        Boullay, and Liebig, have particularly distinguished themselves in these
                        investigations.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of</hi><hi rend="italic">Morphin.</hi></p><p>Opium is a milky juice obtained by incisions from the unripe seed vessels of
                        the <hi rend="italic">papaver somniferum.</hi> It speedily becomes solid,
                        and assumes the dark-brown colour by which opium is characterized. It has a
                        peculiar smell, and a particular but bitter taste. It has been long used as
                        a narcotic and a powerful antispasmodic. It is a very complicated substance;
                        but the most important of its constituents are two acids and two alkalies.
                        The acids are the <hi rend="italic">meconic</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">codeic.</hi> The first of these has been described in the former part of
                        this article, but the <hi rend="italic">codeic</hi> has never yet been
                        obtained separate, so that its existence is still problematic. The two
                        alkaline bodies have received the names of <hi rend="italic">morphin</hi>
                        and <hi rend="italic">narcotin,</hi> the latter of which was discovered by
                        Derohne in 1803. Morphin, in opium, is believed by Robinet to~be in
                        combination with <hi rend="italic">codeic acid.</hi></p><p>Morphin maybe extracted from opium by the following process; Digest opium in
                        water till every thing soluble is taken up, then evaporate the solution to
                        the state of an extract. Three parts of this extract are agitated with one
                        part and a half of water, and then mixed in a retort with twenty parts of
                        ether, and heated. The retort is attached to a receiver, and boiled till
                        five parts of the ether are distilled off. The ether remaining in the retort
                        has <pb break="no" facs="nls:193352996" xml:id="kp-eb0706-2996-0461"/> by this time extracted the narcotin salt from
                        the extract. The process is now interrupted, and the ether in the retort,
                        hot as it is, is decanted into a separate vessel, and the rest of the
                        narcotin salt is washed out of the extract by the five parts of ether that
                        have been distilled over. The thin extract now remaining is allowed to cool,
                        and then mixed with a very little water, and after standing an hour is
                        decanted from a crystalline precipitate, which consists likewise of the
                        narcotin salt. It is now diluted with more water, and then precipitated by
                        caustic ammonia. The precipitate is collected on the filter. When the
                        filtered liquid is heated, a little additional portion of morphin separates,
                        which is added to the former quantity in the filter. After washing it well
                        with cold water, it is dried, and then boiled with alcohol of the specific
                        gravity 0∙84, amounting to three times the weight of the opium employed, and
                        the solution mixed with <hi rend="italic">a</hi> little ivory-black, to
                        deprive the morphin of its colouring matter. Being now filtered while
                        boiling hot, the morphin is deposited in white crystals as the liquid cools.
                        By this process the morphin is obtained pure, but the whole portion which
                        exists in the opium is not extracted. Opium yields at an average about one
                        sixteenth of its weight of pure morphin.</p><p>. Morphin forms white crystals in prisms, sometimes terminated by four-sided
                        pyramids. When heated cautiously it melts, without undergoing decomposition,
                        into a yellowliquid not unlike melted sulphur, which on cooling becomes
                        white and crystallizes. When heated more strongly in an open vessel it
                        smells like resin, smokes, and burns with a lively red flame, giving out
                        much smoke, and leaving an unburnt charcoal.</p><p>Its taste is very bitter and astringent, and when taken into the stomach in a
                        state of solution it acts very powerfully; but in a solid state its action
                        is, comparatively speaking, very trifling. It is insoluble in cold water,
                        and but slightly soluble in boiling water; and the portion dissolved, not
                        exceeding <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜θth of the weight of the water,
                        separates as the solution cools. It dissolves in forty times its weight of
                        cold, and in thirty times its weight of boiling alcohol. It is hardly
                        soluble in ether. It dissolves also in fixed and volatile oils, and may be
                        fused with camphor.</p><p>• Morphin has been repeatedly analysed by means of oxide of copper. The most
                        accurate of these analyses seem to be those made by Pelletier and Dumas, and
                        by Liebig. The following little table shows the constituents according to

                        But the analysis of the chloride of morphin gave only 34 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 17 for the atomic weight of morphin. The mean of
                        these two quantities is 35∙33. Now the number of atoms of carbon, hydrogen,

                        the atomic weight of morphin nearest to 35∙33, is the following·:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>34 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>25∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>18 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom azote</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6</p><p>35∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>It would appear from this analysis that the atomic weight of morphin is 35∙5,
                        and that it is a compound of no fewer than fifty-nine atoms; but of the way
                        in which these atoms are combined we have at present no distinct idea.</p><p>The salts of morphin are formed by dissolving morphin; in the dilute acids
                        till they are saturated, and then evaporating the liquid. They are
                        colourless, and the greater number of them crystallize. They have a very
                        sharp and disagreeably bitter taste. The alkalies precipitate the morphin
                        from the solutions of these salts. But when very dilute solutions of these
                        salts are mixed with caustic ammonia, either no precipitate falls, or it is
                        again taken up; but it appears again when the liquid is heated. They are
                        thrown down by the infusion of nutgalls; and this re-agent is so delicate
                        that it indicates the presence of a morphin salt in solution, containing no
                        more than <hi rend="strikethrough">oõ</hi> Ţįth of its weight of it; but as
                        this property is not peculiar to morphin salts, it cannot serve to detect
                        them. The most characteristic property of these salts is, that when they are
                        mixed with a little of a salt of peroxide of iron, they strike a fine blue
                        colour. This colour is destroyed by heat, by alcohol, and acetic ether, but
                        not by sulphuric ether. Sulphate of morphin contains three atoms of water;
                        of these, two atoms may be driven off by heat, but the remaining atom cannot
                        be separated without destroying the salt. Morphin acts most powerfully upon
                        the animal economy when combined with acetic acid. It is the opinion of some
                        that the patent medicine called the <hi rend="italic">black drop,</hi> which
                        is known to be more powerful than laudanum, is an infusion of opium in
                        acetic acid.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of Narcotm.</hi></p><p>The other alkaline constituent of opium, detected originally by Derohne, is
                        <hi rend="italic">narcotin,</hi> called <hi rend="italic">opian</hi> by some
                        modern German chemists. It may be extracted from opium by means of ether in
                        combination with an acid, hitherto unknown, by the process described in the
                        last section. This salt is to be dissolved in hot water, and digested with
                        some ivory-black, to deprive it of its colouring matter. From the filtered
                        liquid the narcotin is to be precipitated by caustic ammonia. If the
                        precipitate is not colourless, it must be dissolved in muriatic acid,
                        digested again with ivory-black, filtered, and finally precipitated by
                        ammonia.</p><p>Narcotin is obtained in white loose flocks, but when it is dissolved in hot
                        alcohol or ether it shoots into rhombic prisms, usually larger than the
                        crystals of morphin. It falls also in scales having a pearly lustre. When
                        the temperature is elevated a little, it melts, and loses about three per
                        cent, of its weight. When cooled very slowly, it crystallizes from a variety
                        of points, but when rapidly cooled it becomes translucent, and splits in all
                        directions. Its behaviour when heated is similar to that of morphin. Cold
                        water does not dissolve it, and hot water not more than 3⅛0th part of its
                        weight of it. Cold alcohol dissolves <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛θth, and
                        hot alcohol ⅛th of its weight of it. Ether dissolves it in considerable
                        quantity, and much more abundantly when hot than when cold. It dissolves
                        likewise in volatile and fixed oils. It is distinguished from morphin <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353009" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3009-0462"/>

                        know the weight of an atom of this substance; but the smallest number of
                        atoms of each constituent, corresponding with Liebig’s analysis, is the
                        following:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>60∙5 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>45∙375</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>31 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙875</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom azote</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>19 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>19-00</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>70</p></cell></row></table><p>This would make the atomic weight as high as 70; but, from the very small

                        committed in that part of the analysis. The analysis of Pelletier and Dumas
                        gives us</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>22 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>16∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>11 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙375</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom azote</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4</p><p>23∙625</p></cell></row></table><p>so that the two analyses are irreconcilable. Liebig’s being the latest, and
                        made apparently with much care, is probably the nearest to the truth.</p><p>The salts of narcotin are obtained by dissolving that principle in the
                        diluted acid, and then concentrating the solution sufficiently. Their taste
                        is more bitter than that of the morphin salts. They dissolve readily in
                        water, and redden litmus paper. The narcotin is thrown down both by the
                        alkalies and by the infusion of nutgalls. The precipitate by nutgalls has
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> light-yellow colour. Several of them are soluble in
                        alcohol, and still more soluble in ether.</p><p>The action of narcotin is not nearly so violent upon the animal economy as
                        that of morphin. It may be taken to the extent of a couple of drachms in the
                        day, without any sensible effect whatever. Orfila found that half a drachm
                        of it dissolved in oil very soon destroyed the life of a dog. In smaller
                        doses it occasioned a stupor, from which the animal could not be roused.
                        Acetate of narcotin was found almost without action on dogs.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of
                        Strychnin.</hi></p><p>Strychnin was discovered in 1818 by MM. Pelletier Caventou, in the fruit of
                        three different species of <hi rend="italic">strychnos,</hi> namely, <hi rend="italic">nux vomica, ignatia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">columbrvna.</hi> The first of these fruits has been long known in this
                        country under the name of nux vomica, the second under that of St Ignatius’
                        bean, and the wood of the tree which bears the third species of fruit has
                        been long known under the name of <hi rend="italic">snakewood.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">upas</hi> tree of Borneo, and the <hi rend="italic">woorora,</hi> with which the South American Indians poison their arrows,
                        owe their poisonous qualities to the presence of strychnin in them.</p><p>Strychnin may be obtained from nux vomica in the following manner: Digest nux
                        vomica, previously reduced to powder, in alcohol, and evaporate the
                        alcoholic solution, which is very deep coloured, to dryness. Dissolve the
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> dry residue in water, and drop into the
                        solution Goulard’s extract as long as a precipitate continues to fall. By
                        this means a variety of substances, particularly the colouring matter of the
                        nux vomica, are thrown down; while the strychnin remains in solution,
                        combined with the acetic acid of the extract <hi rend="italic">(diacetate
                        of</hi><hi rend="italic">lend').</hi> A current of sulphuretted hydrogen is
                        passed through to throw down the lead. To the filtered liquid add magnesia,
                        and boil. The magnesia displaces the strychnin, which is precipitated. Wash
                        the precipitate in cold water, and then digest it in alcohol. The strychnin
                        will be dissolved, while the magnesia (in excess) remains behind. By
                        evaporating the alcoholic solution, the strychnin separates either in powder
                        or in small crystals. The strychnin thus obtained usually contains some
                        brucin, and some other impurities, from which it may be freed by digestion
                        in spirits of the specific gravity 0 ’ 88. The strychnin remains
                        undissolved. It may now be dissolved in boiling alcohol, and left to
                        crystallize.</p><p>It crystallizes in very small four-sided prisms; but when the alcoholic
                        solution is rapidly cooled, it falls down in small white grains. It has no
                        smell, but its taste is excessively bitter, leaving a kind of metallic
                        impression in the mouth. It is not altered by exposure to the air. When
                        heated it does not melt, like morphin and narcotin; it gives out no water,
                        but undergoes decomposition when heated to the temperature at which olive
                        oil boils, or about 600°. When strongly heated it swells, blackens, gives
                        out a little empyreumatic oil, some water containing acetate of ammonia, and
                        leaves a very bulky charcoal behind. It requires 2500 times its weight of
                        boiling water, and 6667 times its weight of cold water, to dissolve it. When
                        the cold solution is diluted with a hundred times its weight of water, it
                        still retains a distinctly bitter taste. In alcohol it is exceedingly
                        soluble, even when the spirit is not quite free from water; but it is
                        scarcely soluble in ether. It is soluble in volatile oils, and more soluble
                        when they are hot than when cold. In fixed oils it dissolves only in minute
                        quantity, yet it gives them a bitter taste. When heated with sulphur it
                        undergoes decomposition at the melting point of the sulphur, and
                        sulphuretted hydrogen gas is given out.</p><p>Strychnin has been analysed by Pelletier and Dumas, and by Liebig. The
                        following table exhibits the constituents according to their

                        muriatic acid which it is capable of absorbing. A hundred parts of strychnin
                        absorbed 15*02 parts of this gas. This would make the atomic weight 30∙79.
                        The number of atoms which agrees best with the preceding analysis, and with
                        this atomic weight, are the following:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>31 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>23∙25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>16 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>2∙00</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom azote</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3⅜ atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3∙50</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p/></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>30∙5</p></cell></row></table><p>This would make the atomic weight 30∙5.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193353022" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3022-0463"/><p>Strychnin acts with great violence on living beings. About half a grain of it
                        is sufficient to destroy the life of a rabbit: convulsions are induced, and
                        the animal dies in about five minutes, in consequence of a violent attack of
                        tetanus. The same effects take place when strychnin is introduced into a
                        wound. Morphin diminishes the violence of its action, but does not
                        neutralize it or destroy its effects.</p><p>Strychnin appears to be one of the strongest of the compound vegetable
                        alkalies, and it precipitates many organic bodies from their solution in
                        acids. The salts of strychnin have an excessively bitter and disagreeable
                        taste. They are precipitated by tannin. When treated with nitric acid they
                        assume a red colour, provided they were in a solid state when the acid was
                        applied. Twelve species of salts of strychnin have been formed and examined.
                        The nitrate and sulphate of strychnin crystallize, and act with more
                        violence when taken internally than strychnin itself. With both nitric and
                        sulphuric acid strychnin combines in two proportions, forming neutral and
                        bisalts. All the salts of strychnin are more poisonous than strychnin
                        itself.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Of Prucin.</hi></p><p>Brucin was discovered in 1819, by Pelletier and Caventou, in the bark of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Pritcea antidysenterica,</hi> usually distinguished by the
                        name of false <hi rend="italic">angustura bark.</hi> It exists also in the
                        nux vomica. The easiest method of obtaining it is the following: Macerate
                        the brucea bark in water, mix the infusion with some oxalic acid, and
                        evaporate to the consistence of an extract. Digest this extract at the
                        temperature of 32° with absolute alcohol, which will dissolve every thing
                        except the oxalate of <hi rend="italic">brucin.</hi> Boil this oxalate with
                        magnesia and water, and then dissolve the precipitated brucin in boiling
                        alcohol. When the solution cools, brucin is separated in crystals.</p><p>. Brucin thus obtained is white, and crystallized in foursided oblique
                        prisms. Its taste is very bitter, with a certain degree of acridity, which
                        remains long in the mouth. When rapidly precipitated, it falls in pearly
                        scales, similar in appearance to boracic acid. The crystals constitute a
                        hydrate of brucin. If they be heated a little above 212°, they melt and give
                        out about 19 per cent, of water. The fused mass has the appearance of wax.
                        When pulverized and put into water, it recovers in a few days its chemically
                        combined water. In the open air it behaves when heated like the preceding
                        bodies. It requires 850 times its weight of cold, and 500 times its weight
                        of boiling water to dissolve it. It dissolves very easily in alcohol, even
                        as weak as 0∙88. It is insoluble in ether and in the fixed oils, but the
                        volatile oils dissolve it in small quantity. Its most characteristic
                        property is the red or yellow colour which it assumes when treated with
                        nitric acid. The protochloride of tin strikes with it a fine violet colour,

                        brucin may be separated from morphin when they happen to be mixed.</p><p>Brucin has been analysed by Pelletier and Dumas, and by Liebig. The following

                        Vauquelin and by Gomes in 1811; but it was in 1820 that Pelletier and
                        Caventou pointed out its alkaline character, and showed how it might be
                        obtained in a separate state. Since that period sulphate of quinin has been
                        introduced into medicine, and has almost superseded the administration of
                        bark. Quinin may be extracted from the yellow bark, the cinchona cordifolia,
                        by the following process:</p><p>Let the yellow bark be coarsely pulverized, and boiled in eight times its
                        weight of water, containing five per cent, of sulphuric acid. Let this
                        boiling be repeated with an additional dose of acidulated water. Filter and
                        squeeze out the liquid portion from the undissolvea bark. Mix the liquid
                        thus obtained with unslaked lime amounting to a fourth of the weight of
                        yellow bark employed. Agitate well, and as soon as it begins to exhibit
                        alkaline characters, let it be passed through the filter. The lime remaining
                        is to be washed with a little cold water, exposed to pressure, and then
                        dried. It is then to be boiled three times in succession in different
                        portions of alcohol of the specific gravity 0∙836. Mix the filtered
                        alcoholic liquors with a little water, and distil. The quinin remains, but
                        not in a state of absolute purity. To free it from the colouring matter with
                        which it is still combined, we must dissolve it in an acid, and digest the
                        solution with ivory·black. When now thrown down by an alkali, it is white.
                        The following method is said to yield pure quinin:</p><p>The yellow bark is digested in water holding one per cent, of muriatic acid.
                        The acid liquor is concentrated till it acquires the specific gravity of
                        1∙109. It is then precipitated by the protochloride of tin, after which the
                        liquid remains only slightly yellow. A current of sulphuretted hydrogen gas
                        is passed through the liquid, to throw down any excess of tin which it may
                        contain. The quinin is now precipitated by means of a caustic alkali.</p><p>Quinin crystallizes with great difficulty, but is obtained by precipitation
                        by an alkali in white curdy looking flakes, which, when dried, rarely
                        preserve their white colour. When dissolved in alcohol of 0∙8l5 to full
                        saturation, and left during winter in a dry place to spontaneous
                        evaporation, it shoots into small crystals, the form of which, according to
                        Pelletier, is different from that of cinchonin. Both the crystals and flocks
                        are in the state of hydrate. By gentle heating, about four per cent, of
                        water is driven off, and the quinin melts into a translucent liquid, which
                        when cold assumes the appearance of resin, and, like resin, becomes strongly
                        electrified negatively when rubbed. When the melted matter is put into water
                        it gradually absorbs the chemically combined water.</p><p>The taste of quinin is <hi rend="superscript">;</hi> excessively bitter,
                        similar to that of the bark from which it has been extracted. It is <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353035" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3035-0464"/>

                        boiling water being capable of dissolving one part of quinin. It is very
                        soluble in alcohol, which, after evaporation by heat, leaves a soft viscid
                        mass. It dissolves also in ether; and, when assisted by heat, it is soluble
                        in the fixed and volatile oils.</p><p>Quinin has been analysed by Pelletier and Caventou, and by Liebig. The

                        Liebig’s analysis have been preserved, excepting a small addition to the
                        oxygen. It is only 1*86 instead of two atoms. We believe that the quantity
                        of azote has been slightly underrated.</p><p>The salts of quinin are distinguished by an excessively bitter taste, like
                        that of the bark itself. They are soluble in water, and some of them in
                        alcohol and ether. Their solutions are precipitated by oxalic acid, tartaric
                        acid, and gallic acid, and by the salts containing these acids. They are
                        thrown down also by the infusion of nutgalls. Of these salts, by far the
                        most important is the sulphate, which has been introduced into medicine as a
                        substitute for bark, of which it possesses the medicinal virtues, with this
                        great advantage, that a few grains of it go as far as an ounce of bark.
                        Quinin unites with sulphuric acid in three proportions. The neutral sulphate
                        is deposited by cautious evaporation in long small plates or needles, having
                        a pearly lustre. It is very difficultly soluble in cold water, but dissolves
                        very readily in boiling water. It dissolves easily in alcohol, but is little
                        soluble in ether. When heated it melts, and assumes the appearance of wax.
                        In a higher temperature it assumes a fine red colour, and burns all away
                        without leaving any residue. The water which it contains amounts to 15∙254
                        per cent, of the weight of the salt. Of this it loses three fourths in a
                        gentle heat. The remainder adheres obstinately to the salt.</p><p>Bisulphate of quinin crystallizes in four-sided rectangular prisms. It
                        reddens litmus paper, but its taste is not sensibly sour. At the temperature
                        of 54° it dissolves in eleven times its weight of water. It is very soluble
                        in rectified spirits, but scarcely soluble in absolute alcohol. It
                        effervesces when exposed to the air. The water of crystallization in it
                        amounts to 24∙66 per cent. The composition of these two salts, according to
                        Baup, is as follows:</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Neutral Salt.</hi></p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Sulphuric acid</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8-474</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Quinin</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>76-272</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Water</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>15∙254</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>100-000</p></cell></row></table><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Bisulphate.</hi></p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Sulphuric acid</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>13∙698</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Quinin</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>61-644</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Water</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>24-658</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>100-000</p></cell></row></table><p>The disulphate of quinin is obtained when a boiling-hot solution of sulphate

                        excess. The solution being filtered while boiling hot and left to cool,
                        deposits the disalt in crystals, which may be purified by washing them in
                        cold water. Few of the remaining salts of quinin crystallize, and none of

                        then dissolve it in boiling alcohol. When the solution cools, the cinchonin
                        is deposited in crystals.</p><p>The crystals are small four-sided prisms. Its taste is similar to that of
                        quinin; at first it seems slight, but it becomes very strong, and remains
                        long in the mouth. When heated it loses no weight, and does not melt until
                        it begins to undergo decomposition, at which temperature a portion sublimes
                        unaltered. It is almost insoluble in cold water, and it requires 2500 times
                        its weight of boiling water to take it up. It is much less soluble in
                        alcohol than quinin, and is almost insoluble in ether. In fixed and volatile

                        it from the seeds of the veratrum sabadilla, the following process may be
                        employed: Boil the seeds in water, and mix the filtered solution with
                        acetate of lead, which throws down the colouring matter. Filter and
                        precipitate the excess of lead by a current of sulphuretted hydrogen. Drive
                        off the excess of sulphuretted hydrogen by heat. Then boil the liquid with
                        magnesia, which throws down the veratrin. Dissolve the veratrin thus thrown
                        down, by digesting the undissolved magnesia in boiling alcohol. From the
                        alcohol it is thrown down by evaporation, or dilution with water. Veratrin,
                        when obtained in this way, is usually yellow coloured. It may be deprived of
                        its colouring matter, either by repeated solutions, or by digesting it with
                        ivoryblack.</p><p>&gt;. It is a white powder, which does not seem capable of being obtained in
                        crystals. It has no smell, but when introduced into the nostrils in very
                        minute quantity it produces violent and long-continued sneezing. Its taste
                        is exceedingly acrid, without any mixture of bitterness. When given
                        internally in very minute quantities, it produces excessive vomitings, and
                        irritates the mucous membranes. This irritation proceeds along the
                        intestines when the dose is a little stronger, and a very few grains are
                        sufficient to occasion death.</p><p>It is very little soluble in cold water. Boiling water dissolves a hundredth
                        of its weight of it, and acquires a sensible acridity. It dissolves in great
                        abundance in alcohol. Ether dissolves it also, but not in such quantity. It
                        melts when heated to the temperature of about 122°. In this state it
                        resembles wax. On cooling it congeals into an amber-coloured and translucent
                        mass. When strongly heated it swells up, and is decomposed, producing a
                        great deal of oil, water, &amp;c. and leaves a bulky charcoal, which, when
                        incinerated, leaves scarcely any residue. It restores the blue colour of
                        litmus paper reddened by acids.</p><p>It was analysed by Pelletier and Dumas, and found by them composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>66∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8∙54</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Azote</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5∙04</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>19∙60</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>99∙93</p></cell></row></table><p>The atomic weight, if any confidence can be put in the analysis of sulphate

                        analysis of muriate of veratrin gives only 107 for the atomic weight. The
                        number of atoms which agrees best with the preceding analysis, and with this

                        compound of three atoms veratrin and one atom sulphuric acid.</p><p>The salts of veratrin have a sharp and burning taste. Veratrin dissolves in
                        concentrated solutions of acids to saturation, and the solutions do not
                        redden litmus paper; but when they are diluted with water they lose their
                        neutral state, a portion of the veratrin separating. These salts cannot be
                        crystallized; when evaporated they assume the form of gummy-like masses. The
                        only one in which traces of crystallization have been observed is the
                        supersul-phate of veratrin; but it must be acknowledged that these salts
                        have been only superficially examined.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VIII.— <hi rend="italic">Of</hi><hi rend="italic">Emetin.</hi></p><p>This substance was discovered in 1817, by Pelletier and Majendie, in the root
                        of the plant used as an emetic, and generally known by the name of
                        ipecacuanha. It may be extracted in the following manner:</p><p>The root, previously reduced to powder, is digested in the first place in
                        ether, which separates an oily matter having a strong smell. It is then
                        boiled in alcohol. The alcoholic solution is filtered, mixed with a little
                        water, and the alcohol is distilled off. The residue being mixed with a
                        little more water, is filtered from a fatty matter, which separates. This
                        liquid is now boiled with caustic magnesia, which precipitates the emctin.
                        The undissolved magnesia mixed with the emetin is washed with cold water,
                        and then digested in boiling alcohol, which dissolves the emetin. By
                        evaporating the alcohol, the emetin is precipitated, still mixed with a
                        little colouring matter. To purify it, let it be dissolved in an acid, and
                        mixed and agitated with ivory-black. The liquid being now filtered and
                        precipitated by an alkali, the emetin is obtained in a state of purity.</p><p>Emetin thus obtained is in white scales, which become yellowish by exposure
                        to the air. It has a very slight bitter taste, and no smell. It is scarcely
                        soluble in cold water, but boiling water is a better solvent of it. When
                        heated it melts very easily, and sublimes in a temperature hardly so high as
                        122°. It dissolves very readily in alcohol, but is almost insoluble in ether
                        and oils. It combines with acids like an alkali, though the salts which it
                        forms always redden vegetable blues. It acts very powerfully as an emetic:
                        half a grain taken into the stomach occasions violent vomiting, followed by
                        sleep, and the animal awakes in a state of health. Twelve, or even six
                        grains, occasioned vomiting, followed by death. A violent inflammation of
                        the lungs and intestinal canal appears to be the proximate cause of the
                        death which in this case ensues.</p><p>Emetin has been analysed by Pelletier and Dumas, who found its

                        Nitric acid dissolves it, and forms a fine red-coloured solution, which
                        gradually passes into yellow, while nitrous gas exhales, and crystals of
                        oxalic acid are formed. Muriatic, phosphoric, and acetic acids combine with
                        it readily, and may be saturated with it. Gallic acid throws it down in the
                        state of a dirty-white precipitate. It is precipitated equally by the
                        infusion of nutgalls.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IX.— <hi rend="italic">Of Delphinin.</hi></p><p>This alkaline body was discovered in 1819, by Lassaigne and Feneulle, in the
                        seeds of the delphinium staphisagria, or <hi rend="italic">stavesaere,</hi>
                        which is occasionally employed externally to destroy vermin. It may be
                        obtained in the following manner:</p><p>Digest the seeds in water acidulated with sulphuric acid. Then precipitate
                        the acid liquid by an alkali or magnesia. Wash and dry the precipitate, and
                        boil it in alcohol, which dissolves the delphinin. To free it completely
                        from foreign matter, it may be obtained from the alcohol by evaporation, and
                        dissolved in an acid. Let the solution be digested with ivory-black, and
                        after filtration let it be mixed with an excess of caustic ammonia. The
                        precipitate is gelatinous, not unlike newly precipitated alumina. If we
                        dissolve it in alcohol, and evaporate the solution, it falls in the state of
                        a crystalline powder, which when dried becomes translucent.</p><p>Its taste is fecbly bitter, and it restores the blue colour of litmus paper
                        reddened by acids. When heated it melts like wax, and on cooling assumes the
                        appearance of resin. It appears, from the experiments of Brandes, to be
                        insoluble in water, though it communicates its taste to that liquid; but it
                        dissolves very easily in alcohol and ether. When these liquids at a boiling
                        heat are saturated with delphinin, it falls down again in flocks as they
                        cool. It is soluble both in fixed and volatile oils.</p><p>With acids it forms salts which rarely afford crystals; their taste is bitter
                        and sharp. According to Feneulle, it forms both neutral salts, bisalts, and
                        disalts. Neutral sulphate of delphinin, according to him, is composed of,
                        sulphuric acid 3∙116 or 5, delphinin 100 or 160.</p><p>If any confidence could be put in this analysis, the atomic weight of
                        delphinin would be 160. No attempt has hitherto been made to analyse it.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> X.— <hi rend="italic">Of Solanin.</hi></p><p>This alkaline substance was discovered in 1822, by Desfosses, in the berries

                        been since discovered in the stalks, leaves, and berries, of the solanum
                        dulcamara, and likewise of the <hi rend="italic">tuberosum.,</hi> or common
                        potato. To obtain it, we have only to press out the sap of the ripe berries,
                        filter it, and mix it with caustic ammonia. From the unripe berries it may
                        be obtained also, but it is then impure, and of a green colour. The gray
                        precipitate from the ripe berries is to be well washed and dried, and then
                        dissolved in boiling alcohol. By slow evaporation the solanin is deposited
                        in a white powder, having somewhat of a pearly lustre. It has a weakly
                        bitter and nauseous taste. It melts when heated a little above 212°, and on
                        cooling concentrates into a lemon-yellow mass. It restores the blue colour
                        of litmus paper reddened by an acid. It is insoluble in cold water, and
                        requires 8000 times its weight of boiling water to dissolve it. It is very
                        soluble in alcohol, but little so in ether. In the oils it is insoluble.
                        With acids it forms neutral salts which have a bitter taste. The sulphate,
                        nitrate, and muriate, when dry, have a gummy-like appearance, and are easily
                        reduced to powder. According to Desfosses, 100 parts of solanin neutralize
                        10∙981 parts of sulphuric acid. This would make its atomic weight 45∙5.</p><p>From trials made upon a cat, it would appear that solanin is highly emetic
                        and narcotic. Upon dogs it acted as an emetic, but did not induce sleep. In
                        large doses it is poisonous. No attempt has been made to analyse it.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> XI.— <hi rend="italic">Of

                        the liquid be concentrated into an extract. Digest this extract in alcohol
                        of the specific gravity 0 <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> 827. Filter the
                        alcoholic solution, and leave it for some days in a cool place: drops of a
                        solid crystalline fatty matter are gradually deposited on the sides of the
                        vessel. Decant off the clear liquid, and distil it in a retort till the
                        alcohol is abstracted. To the extract remaining in the retort add a little
                        water. Mix it well with about one sixth of its weight of caustic magnesia,
                        and thefi dry the mixture. The extract contains much uncombined acid, and
                        more of the fatty matter formerly mentioned, which now combines with the
                        magnesia and becomes insoluble. Let the matter be now boiled with alcohol of
                        the specific gravity 0∙87, as long as anything dissolves. Mix this liquid
                        with ivory-black, which will deprive it of most of its colouring matter.
                        Filter and evaporate; picrotoxin not quite pure separates during the
                        evaporation. Being again dissolved in spirits, and left to spontaneous
                        crystallization, i t shoots into groups of small, colourless, oblique,

                        and boiling water one twenty-fifth part of its weight of it. It is still
                        more soluble in water containing a little alkali. Boiling alcohol of 0 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8 dissolves one third of its weight of it. Ether
                        of 0∙716 specific gravity dissolves four tenths of its weight of it, but it
                        is insoluble both in fixed and volatile oils.</p><p>It dissolves in acids, but the saturated solutions still possess acid
                        qualities. Several of its salts are capable of crystallizing. They have a
                        very bitter taste, and are but little soluble. According to Boullay, 100
                        parts of picrotoxin saturate 11∙1 parts of sulphuric acid. This would make

                        MM. C. G. Gmelin and Baer.</p><p>If an infusion of the bark of daphne mezereum be made in boiling water, and
                        if the filtered solution be mixed with magnesia, and distilled in a retort
                        as completely as can be done without burning, we obtain a sharp-tasted
                        liquid, acting strongly as an alkali, and having the smell and taste of the
                        bark. If this matter be saturated with an acid, and the solution
                        concentrated, a crystalline salt is obtained. If we dissolve this salt in a
                        little water, mix the solution with magnesia, and distil, we obtain the
                        alkaline substance in a concentrated state. To this substance the name of

                        colourless. Its taste is bitter and disagreeable. When heated it melts,
                        swells up, becomes black, and gives out an acid liquid. By nitric acid it is
                        destroyed, and partly converted into oxalic acid. It is but little soluble
                        in cold, but very soluble in hot water. When mixed with a little potash,
                        carbonate of potash, bąrytes water, or lime water, it becomes golden yellow,
                        and loses its property of crystallizing. It is easily soluble in alcohol and

                        weak acetic acid. A dark-coloured solution is obtained, which is filtered,
                        mixed with caustic ammonia, and well agitated. A granular powder

                        rhubarb, in six gallons of water acidulated with two and a half fluid ounces
                        of sulphuric acid. Strain the decoction, and submit the residue to a second
                        ebullition in a similar quantity of acidulated water, and submit it again to
                        a third boiling. Unite all the three decoctions, and add by small portions
                        recently powdered lime, constantly stirring it to facilitate its action on
                        the acid decoction. When the decoction has , become slightly alkaline, it
                        deposits a red, flocculent precipitate, which is to be separated by
                        straining through a linen cloth. It is to be washed and dried, and digested
                        in alcohol for several hours in the water bath. The rhabarbarin is taken up,
                        while the gypsum, &amp;c. remains. Separate the alcoholic solution, and
                        distil off three fourths of the alcohol. There remains a strong solution of
                        rhabarbarin. Add as much sulphuric acid as will exactly neutralize it, and
                        evaporate the solution to dryness in a low heat. A brownish-red coloured

                        styptic taste, soluble in water, and having the smell of native rhubarb.

                        from it the cathartic principle to which that plant owes its introduction
                        into medicine. To this principle they gave the name <hi rend="italic">of
                        cathartin.</hi> It was obtained by the following process: The decoction of
                        the dried leaves of senna was precipitated by acetate of lead, and the
                        filtered solution was treated with sulphuretted hydrogen gas, to throw down
                        all excess of lead that might have been added. The liquid was now evaporated
                        to dryness, and the residue treated with alcohol, which dissolved the
                        cathartin, together with some acetate of potash. The alcoholic solution was

                        the open air, it gradually attracts humidity. Its aqueous solution is
                        precipitated in brown flocks by the infusion of nutgalls; and the diacetate
                        of lead occasions a precipitate having the same shade of colour. The

                        not throw it down from its aqueous solution. Whether it possess alkaline
                        properties has not been examined, but it is probable that it does, because
                        in senna it seems to exist in the state of malate. It possesses the pure

                        afterwards investigated by Posselt and Reiman in 1828. It may be obtained by
                        the following process:</p><p>Distil a mixture of dry tobacco with water and hydrate of potash. Pour on the
                        residue twice its weight of water, and distil again. Neutralize the
                        distilled liquid (containing nicoin and carbonate of ammonia) with sulphuric
                        acid, and evaporate in a moderate heat not quite to dryness. Digest the
                        residue with absolute alcohol, which will leave sulphate of ammonia
                        undissolved. To the alcohol solution add a little water, and then distil off
                        the alcohol. Mix the residue with an excess of potash ley, and distil. An
                        oily, almost colourless liquid comes over, which is to be agitated with
                        ether, renewed repeatedly till the whole nicoin is separated from the water.
                        By exposing the ethereal solution to the heat of a water bath, the ether may
                        be distilled off, and the nicoin remains,</p><p>Nicoin thus obtained is a colourless liquid, which does not congeal at 21°.
                        Its specific gravity is greater than that of water. It stains paper like
                        grease, and in twelve hours the spots assume a yellowish colour. At 295° it
                        may be distilled slowly over. It boils at 464°. It has a strong smell,
                        especially when heated similar to that of tobacco. It is a strong poison,
                        and acts as a narcotic. A single drop introduced into the mouth of a dog
                        occasioned death.</p><p>It dissolves readily in water, alcohol, and ether. This last liquid is
                        capable of separating it from water. It is soluble in fixed and volatile
                        oils. It combines readily with the acids and forms salts. These salts are
                        soluble in water, and the solutions may be evaporated to dryness in a
                        moderate heat without the loss of any nicoin. When mixed with a fixed
                        alkali, the smell of nicoin becomes sensible. When mixed with iodine they
                        strike a kermes red colour. This is characteristic of these salts. The
                        phosphate, sulphate, oxalate, tartrate, and acetate of nicoin have been
                        formed and examined. They all dissolve in water. The phosphate, oxalate, and
                        tartrate crystallize; the sulphate and acetate can be obtained only in the
                        state of a syrup. There is some reason for suspecting that the atomic weight

                        matter, is left to spontaneous evaporation in the open air, by which the
                        gentianin speedily separates. The residue is again digested in alcohol, and
                        the yellow tincture evaporated. The residual matter is again washed with
                        very dilute alcohol, which takes up the gentianin, and leaves an oily matter
                        behind. This last solution being evaporated, there remains behind gentianin,
                        acid, and odorous matter. .When this mixture is boiled with some magnesia
                        and water, and the liquid is evaporated to dryness, the odorous principle is
                        driven off. Ether being boiled in the residue, dissolves pure gentianin, and
                        lets it fall when distilled off.</p><p>Gentianin thus obtained is in yellow needles, destitute of smell, but has an
                        aromatic and bitter taste. It is not poisonous, and does not restore the
                        blue colour of litmus paper reddened by an acid. It dissolves slightly in
                        cold water, but sufficiently to communicate its bitter colour to that
                        liquid. Boiling water dissolves it rather more abundantly. It is very
                        soluble in alcohol and ether, and is deposited in crystals when these
                        solutions are evaporated. It combines with the mineral acids, and forms
                        compounds which are slightly coloured, and have a more bitter taste than
                        gentianin itself. The sulphate and phosphate of gentianin are almost
                        colourless. The acetate has a yellow colour. The fixed alkalies deepen the

                        a minute quantity of it. It is very soluble in absolute alcohol, but the
                        solubility is diminished the more the alcohol is diluted with water. The
                        solution has a greenish-yellow colour. It dissolves also in ether, and with
                        a similar colour. It dissolves and neutralizes acids. From these solutions
                        it is thrown down white by alkalies, and yellowish white by tincture of
                        nutgalls. The sulphate, muriate, nitrate, and acetate of corydalin have been
                        formed and examined. The last of these salts may be obtained in the state of

                        fruits of different species of orange and lemon trees. To obtain it, the
                        white portion of the unripe orange is freed by a silver knife from the green
                        rind and the innermost part of the fruit. It is then digested in water of a
                        temperature between 75° and 86°, filtered and concentrated to three fourths
                        of its original bulk. A little albumen precipitates, which must be
                        separated. The malic acid which it contains must now be saturated with lime,
                        and the liquid must be evaporated to the consistency of a syrup. This syrup
                        being digested in alcohol of the specific gravity 0∙817, gum, albumen, a
                        brown bitter matter, and malate of lime, are left undissolved. Let the
                        solution be filtered and evaporated, and let the granular extract remaining
                        be mixed with twenty times its weight of water or distilled vinegar, and
                        often agitated. Being left undisturbed for eight days, the hesperidin is
                        deposited in small crystals.</p><p>It has the form of soft, silky needles, without smell, and at first appearing
                        tasteless, but leaving a bitter impression in the mouth. It is almost
                        insoluble in cold water, but it dissolves in sixty times its weight of
                        boiling water. When the solution cools most of it is deposited in white
                        flocks. In cold alcohol it is very little soluble, but it dissolves
                        abundantly in hot alcohol. In ether, fixed and volatile oils, it is
                        insoluble. It is insoluble in dilute sulphuric and muriatic acids, but
                        dissolves in alkaline leys. When the aqueous solution is mixed with
                        sulphated peroxide of iron, a brownish-red precipitate falls. It is very

                        heat the dry residue. Guaranin sublimes, first in the state of yellowish
                        white, and then of white feathery crystals. When heated it gives out a

                        Oerstedt in 1819, and afterwards more minutely examined by Pelletier in
                        1821. It may be obtained in the following way:</p><p>Boil pepper in alcohol. Evaporate the tincture to dryness, and wash the
                        residue with water. What remains undissolved by the water is to be dissolved
                        in hot alcohol. Set the solution aside for a few days, that it may have time
                        to deposit crystals. These crystals, by washing in cold alcohol, and
                        subsequent solution in hot alcohol or ether, and crystallization, are to be
                        freed from a greenish-white resin. Such is the process of Pelletier: other
                        processes have been proposed by Buehner, Mcli, Pfeil, Henkenius, and
                        Winkler.</p><p>It crystallizes in oblique four-sided prisms, whose faces are inclined to
                        each other at angles of about 85° and 95°. When heated to about 212° it
                        melts into a light-yellow transparent oil, which hardens on cooling into a
                        light-yellow, translucent, resinous-like matter. It has very little taste,
                        and what it has is probably derived from a little of the oil of pepper, of
                        which it is not easy to free it. It is insoluble in cold, and only slightly
                        soluble in boiling water. It is very soluble in alcohol, less so in ether;
                        but dissolves better in these two liquids when hot than while cold. Acetic
                        acid is also a good solvent of it. Dilute sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic
                        acids do not act sensibly on it; but when these acids are concentrated they
                        alter its nature. Concentrated sulphurie acid gives it a blood colour, but
                        the colour disappears if the acid be diluted with water. Muriatic acid acts
                        in the same way, only the colour produced is not red, but an intense yellow.
                        Nitric acid renders it first greenish yellow, then orange, and at last red.
                        By long continued action oxalic acid and a bitter matter are formed. When
                        distilled it produces water, acetic acid, oil, carburetted hydrogen gas, but
                        no ammonia. Though, from the experiments of Oerstedt, we have placed piperin
                        among alkaline bodies, there is reason to believe, from the subsequent
                        researches of Pelletier, that its properties are not alkaline, but that it
                        approaches nearer to resins. If so, it is rather an acid than an alkaline
                        body.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> XXV.— <hi rend="italic">Of Plumbagm.</hi></p><p>This substance was discovered by Dulong, in the root of the <hi rend="italic">plumbago Europcea</hi> in 1828. It may be obtained by the following
                        process:</p><p>The roots, not too woody, are digested in lukewarm ether. After separating
                        the solution, distil off the ether, and boil the dry residue in water.
                        Plumbagin and gallic acid will be taken up. Filter the liquid boiling hot;
                        on cooling, flocks of plumbagin are deposited. Decant the liquid off these
                        flocks, and boil it again on the black residue. The liquid being again
                        filtered while boiling hot, and allowed to cool, deposits more plumbagin.
                        This process is to be repeated several times, till the residue is exhausted
                        of plumbagin. By dissolving the plumbagin two or three times successively in
                        cther, or in alcohol mixed with ether, it is deprived of the gallic acid
                        with which it is at first contaminated.</p><p>It crystallizes in soft, oblique, lemon-yellow needles, when the ethereal or
                        alcoholie solution is concentrated. From a saturated aqueous solution it
                        falls in flocks. When gently heated it melts, and concentrates on cooling
                        into a yellowish, fibrous mass. It may be partly volatilized without
                        decomposition.' Its taste is sharp and hot, though, according to Derohne and
                        Henry, the first impression is that of sweetness.</p><p>It is very little soluble in cold water. In hot water it is more soluble,
                        communicating a lemon-yellow colour to the liquid, and being again deposited
                        in crystalline flocks when the liquid cools. It is soluble in alcohol both
                        cold and hot, and is precipitated in flecks by the addition of water. It is
                        soluble also in ether. It dissolves in sulphuric acid with a lemon-yellow
                        colour; the addition of water throws it down in yellow flocks, but an
                        additional dose of water takes them up again. The same phenomena take place
                        with nitric acid.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193353113" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3113-0470"/><p>The addition of a little ammonia or fixed alkali increases the solubility of

                        aqueous solution of plumbagin occasions a kermes red precipitate, and leaves
                        the liquid of a red colour. Sulphate of copper communicates a reddish
                        colour, and very dilute perchloride of iron strikes a dirty-red colour.

                        sulphuretted hydrogen gas. Filter the liquid, and add a little sulphuric
                        acid to it. Sulphate of Ĵamaicin falls in small grains. Concentrate the

                        consistence of an extract. Expose the extract to pressure between folds of
                        blotting paper, and expose the dry matter remaining to the action of alcohol
                        of the specific gravity 0 ’ 837. Filter and concentrate by distilling off
                        the alcohol. The salicin precipitates in crystals having a pearly
                        lustre.</p><p>The taste is very bitter, and there is also something aromatic, like that of
                        the bark of the willow. A hundred parts of water at the temperature of 67°
                        dissolve 5 ’ 6 parts of salicin. Hot water is a much better solvent, and
                        boiling water dissolves it in any proportion whatever. It is soluble also in
                        alcohol; but ether and oil of turpentine do not take up the smallest
                        quantity of it.</p><p>Concentrated sulphuric acid, poured on salicin, gives it a very beautiful red
                        colour, very similar to that of bichromate of potash. It dissolves in nitric
                        and muriatic acids without acquiring any colour. The solution is not
                        precipitated by nutgalls, gelatine, acetate or diacctate of lead, alum, or
                        tartar emetic.</p><p>When boiled in excess with lime water, no combination takes place; nor is it
                        capable of dissolving'oxide of lead. When heated a few degrees above the

Braconnot, in the bark of the <hi rend="italic">populus tremula.</hi> He found afterwards that the leaves of
                        that tree furnish it in greater abundance. It may be extracted by the
                        following process:</p><p>Boil the leaves in water, and pour into the solution diacetate of lead. A
                        fine yellow precipitate falls. Filter the liquid, and evaporate it to the
                        consistence of a syrup. When it cools, the populin separates under the form
                        of a very bulky crystalline precipitate. Expose it to strong pressure
                        between folds of linen cloth; then heat it with a hundred and sixty times
                        its weight of water and a quantity of ivory-black, and filter the liquid
                        while boiling hot. On cooling it deposits abundance of very fine silky
                        needles. When dried on blotting paper it is a very light matter, having a
                        snow-white colour.</p><p>Populin has a swect taste, not unlike that of liquorice. It requires about
                        two thousand times its weight of cold water to dissolve it. The aqueous
                        solution is not affected by most of the metalline salts; but chloride of
                        sodium throws it down unchanged, and in the form of crystals. It is soluble
                        in seventy times its weight of boiling water. Boiling alcohol dissolves it
                        in much greater proportion, and when the liquid cools it is totally
                        converted into a crystalline magma. It is very soluble in acetic acid and
                        nitric acid, and it may be precipitated from these solutions by the
                        alkalies. Phosphoric acid dissolves it also; but when that acid is too
                        concentrated, it converts it at once into a resin. The weak mineral acids,
                        when hot, act upon it as they do on salicin; they convert it into a white
                        resinous powder, perfectly similar to that produced from salicin. Like
                        salicin, it gives a purple-red solution with concentrated sulphuric
                        acid.</p><p>When treated with nitric acid it furnishes, as salicin does, a great quantity
                        of crystallized carbazotic acid, but no oxalic acid. When heated
                        sufficiently with potash it is converted into oxalic acid, as is the case
                        with all organic bodies. When heated, it first melts into a transparent and
                        colourless liquid; it then burns with a strong flame, giving out at the same
                        time an aromatic odour. By distillation it would seem to yield an
                        empyreumatic oil and benzoic acid.</p><p>How far this substance is alkaline has not been examined, but its ready

                        Mudarin.</hi></p><p>This substance has been recently detected by Dr Duncan, in the bark of the
                        root of the <hi rend="italic">calotropis mudarii,</hi> or mudar. Its
                        alkaline qualities have not been made out, but we place it here in
                        consequence of its bitter taste, which assimilates it to many of these
                        bodies. It may be obtained by the following process:</p><p>Digest the powdered root in cold rectified spirits. When the greater part of
                        the spirit has been distilled off, the liquid becomes darker coloured, but
                        retains its transparency. As it cools, a white granular resin is deposited.
                        Let the liquid evaporate spontaneously to dryness, and digest the dry matter
                        in cold water, which dissolves the coloured portion, and leaves the resin.
                        This solution consists chiefly of mudarin.</p><p>When evaporated spontaneously to dryness, it forms a transparent
                        brown-coloured matter, not crystalline, but cracking in all directions, and
                        not adhering to the vessel in which it formed. It has no smell, but an
                        intensely bitter and nauseous taste. It is very soluble in cold water, but
                        much less soluble in that liquid while hot. It dissolves also in alcohol,
                        and the solubility increases with the temperature. In ether, oil of
                        turpentine, and olive oil, it does not dissolve.</p><p>When a saturated solution in cold water is heated to 74°, it becomes slightly
                        opal. At 90° the transparency is nearly gone, and the liquid assumes the
                        form of a jelly; but if allowed to cool, it becomes, in a day or two, as
                        liquid and transparent as ever. At 95°, a soft, brownish coagulum begins to
                        separate from a liquid nearly colourless, and the coagulum contracts in size
                        as the heat increases; so that at 212° it has the consistency of pitch. This
                        matter dissolves very slowly in water; yet that liquid takes it upas
                        completely as at first, if time be allowed for its action.</p><p>No trials seem to have been made respecting the solubility of this substance
                        in acids. Indeed we have no evidence that the mudarin, as examined by Dr
                        Duncan, was pure.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP.</hi> III. OF NEUTRAL VEGETABLE PRINCIPLES.</p><p>These substances exist in great abundance in plants, and may be considered as
                        the principal ingredients of which they arc composed. It has not yet been
                        ascertained that they possess either the characters of acids or of alkalies.
                        This ignorance of any definite compounds into which they can enter stands,
                        very much in the way of the attempts which have been made to determine their

                        weight quite uncertain. It is not unlikely that not a few of these bodies
                        will be arranged hereafter either among acids or alkalies, when they come to
                        be more completely investigated. Sugar, gum, and several of the resins,
                        appear to be acids; while starch and lignin bear a closer'relation to
                        alkaline bodies. But till these analogies be more closely investigated, we
                        must be satisfied with arranging them under the name of neutral or
                        indifferent substances. These substances will occupy our attention in the

                        called sugar, there can be no doubt that substances possessed of very
                        different properties have been confounded together under the same name. The
                        most important of all the species of sugar is that extracted from the
                        sugar-cane, employed in this country as a common article of food. We shall
                        therefore describe it in the first place, and afterwards point out the

                        seems to be a native of India and China, but has been long cultivated to a
                        great extent in the West Indies. Good sugar-canes give about half their
                        weight of juice, by boiling which, the sugar is obtained in small grains or
                        crystals. It is afterwards refined in this country, and converted into the
                        beautiful white crystalline mass known by the name of loaf sugar. Its taste,
                        is a strong and agreeable sweet. Its colour is white, and when properly
                        crystallized it is translucent or semitransparent. The crystal is an oblique
                        four-sided prism, whose base is a rhomb, the length of which is to its
                        breadth as ten to seven, and whose height is a mean proportional between the
                        length and breadth of the base. These crystals contain water, and appear to

                        concentrated solution is called syrup. It is thick and adhesive, and may be
                        employed to agglutinate pieces of paper together. It is soluble in eighty
                        times its weight of absolute alcohol; but as the solution cools, the greater
                        part of the sugar is deposited in crystals. It is soluble in four times its
                        weight of boiling alcohol of the specific gravity 0 ’ 830, and the
                        solubility increases with the weakness of the spirits.</p><p>It is not altered by exposure to the atmosphere; if the air be damp, however,
                        it is apt to absorb moisture.</p><p>When heat is applied to sugar, it melts at 250°, then swells, becomes
                        brownish black, emits air bubbles, and exhales a peculiar smell known by the

Sugar dissolves in potash ley, and forms a liquid
                        having not the least sweetness. When boiled to the thickness of a syrup, it
                        is not miscible with alcohol; but if the potash be neutralized by sulphuric
                        acid, boiling alcohol is capable of again extracting sugar from it.</p><p>3rZ, Saccharate of Strontian. When equal quantities of strontian and sugar
                        are dissolved in hot water, the solution has a light-yellow colour and a
                        caustic taste. On cooling it deposits crystals which absorb carbonic acid
                        from the atmosphere. These crystals are probably nothing else than hydrate
                        of strontian.</p><p><hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> Saccharate of Lime. Lime dissolves in syrup in
                        far greater quantity than in pure water. When the solution is slowly
                        evaporated, it deposits four-sided prisms. It has a bitter and alkaline
                        taste, but no sweetness. It would appear from Daniel’s observations that
                        lime has the property of gradually decomposing sugar, and of converting it
                        into a substance analogous to gum.</p><p><hi rend="italic">ĩ&gt;th,</hi> Saccharate of Lead. When a solution of sugar
                        is digested on oxide of lead, the oxide is gradually dissolved; but after a

                        of figs may be seen in a concrete state on the outside of that fruit as it
                        is commonly sold in this country. When we dissolve this fruit in boiling
                        alcohol, and set the solution aside with a small piece of wood or a quill in
                        it, we readily obtain the sugar in crystals. As the shape of these crystals
                        is quite different from that of common sugar, it obviously constitutes a
                        peculiar species; but its characters have not yet been determined.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Sugar of Grapes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This
                        sugar is obtained from the juice of ripe grapes, which in a good year
                        contain from thirty to forty per cent, of solid matter, the most of which
                        consists of sugar. The acid which it contains must be, in the first place,
                        saturated with chalk. Draw off the clear juice, mix it with 'white of egg,
                        and boil. The scum which collects on the surface is to be taken off, and the
                        liquid boiled till its specific gravity becomes l∙32. It is then set aside
                        for two or three days, when a granular mass of sugar is deposited. The
                        liquid portion is poured off. The crystals are a mixture of three parts
                        solid sugar and one part syrup, and this syrup cannot be separated. By means
                        of ivory-black it may be made white.</p><p>. Grape sugar crystallizes so imperfectly, that the shape of its crystals has
                        not been made out in a satisfactory manner; but it is different from that of
                        common sugar. It is usually in very minute needles, collected together in
                        small spheres. Its taste resembles that of honey. It contains much more
                        water than common sugar. It melts at 212°, or a little higher, and loses
                        about eight per cent, of its weight. On cooling it constitutes a yellowish
                        translucent mass, which attracts moisture from the atmosphere.</p><p>It is not so soluble in cold water as common sugar, requiring once and a
                        third of its weight of that liquid dissolve it. In Boiling water it is very
                        soluble; but the syrup has not the same consistence as common sugar, and
                        cannot be drawn into threads. The solution is sweeter than the sugar itself.
                        It may be kept without alteration; but if we mix it with yeast it ferments,
                        and the sugar is gradually decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid. It is
                        much less soluble in alcohol than common sugar.</p><p>Its affinity for salifiable bases is much weaker than that of common sugar,
                        yet it unites with them, and forms compounds having a bitter taste. If we
                        add an excess of the base, and heat the liquid to 140° or 160°, the sugar
                        becomes brown, and gives out the smell of caramel; When saturated with lime
                        it is converted into a slimy matter, from which alcohol throws down white
                        curdy flocks.

But
                        no confidence can be put in this estimate till satisfactory experiments have
                        been made to determine its atomic weight.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Sugar of Starch.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> When
                        starch is boiled in water acidulated with sulphuric acid, employing one part
                        of starch for every four of water, replacing the water as it evaporates, and
                        continuing the boiling till it is found that when a few drops of the liquid
                        are mixed with twice its volume of alcohol no precipitate falls, the starch
                        is converted into sugar. The length of time necessary for this conversion
                        depends upon the proportion of sulphuric acid present. If it amount to one
                        per cent, of the water, thirty-six hours’ boiling will be required. Two and
                        a half per cent, of acid reduces the time to twenty hours, while ten per
                        cent, reduces it to seven or eight hours. The boiling may take place in a
                        copper or wooden vessel. To obtain the sugar from this liquid, we must
                        saturate the acid with chalk, and filter. The liquid is to be then boiled to
                        a thin syrup, and afterwards allowed to shoot into crystals. In three days
                        it is generally all converted into a yellowish granular mass, without any
                        mother liquid. We may obtain it quite white if we digest the liquid before
                        concentrating it with ivory-black.</p><p>During this process nothing is abstracted, from the atmosphere nor from the
                        water. The process goes on equally well in close vessels as in open vessels.
                        The acid is not altered, and the weight of the sugar exceeds that of the
                        starch employed. Saussure found that 100 parts of starch became 110∙14. The
                        shape of the crystals, according to Saussure, is a small table, or cube. The
                        properties of starch sugar, so far as known, are the same as those of sugar
                        of grapes. The presence of gluten seems to prevent starch from being
                        converted into sugar by boiling it in dilute sulphuric acid, for neither
                        flour nor meal can in this way be converted into sugar. Yet, when barley
                        meal is infused in hot water, it is well known that the infusion becomes
                        sweet; for it can be fermented into beer. Malt (which is barley germinated)
                        is converted into sugar by simple infusion in hot water. It has not been
                        made out yet by decisive experiments that this sugar is the same with starch
                        sugar; but it is very probable that it is. Starch, in its conversion into
                        sugar by sulphuric acid, seems to pass through the state of gum. The
                        constituents of starch sugar, according to the analysis of' Saussure, are
                        the following:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbon...,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>37∙29</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙84</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>55-87</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>100-00</p></cell></row></table><p>These numbers agree best with</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>10 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>7∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>11 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙375</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>lli atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>11-25</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>20-125</p></cell></row></table><p>But whether the difference between this analysis and that of sugar of grapes,
                        which lies chiefly in the oxygen, results from an error in the analysis, or
                        from a real difference in the constitution of the two sugars, cannot at
                        present be determined.</p><p>The crystallizable sugar of <hi rend="italic">honey</hi> is considered at

                        several other mushrooms. It crystallizes in rectangular prisms with square
                        bases. It has such a disposition to crystallize, that when a very <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353165" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3165-0474"/>

                        immediately sprinkled with small acicular crystals. When heated this sugar
                        melts, swells, and takes firc, giving out the odour of caramel. There
                        remains a small quantity of charcoal, which is destitute of alkali. Acids do
                        not deprive this sugar of the power of crystallizing, as they do common
                        sugar. When digested with nitric acid it produces abundance of oxalic acid.
                        It is capable of undergoing the vinous fermentation.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">Manna.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Manna is the
                        produce of a great variety of trocs, and even of other plants; but the manna
                        to be met with in apothecaries’ shops is chiefly the produce of the <hi rend="italic">fraxinus ornus,</hi> a species of ash which grows abundantly
                        in Sicily and Calabria. It flows out during summer in the state of a clear
                        sap, which gradually concentrates into drops, and then constitutes manna. A
                        good deal exudes from the larch, but so mixed with turpentine that it cannot
                        be employed.</p><p>• Pure manna is very light, and appears to consist of a congcrics of fine
                        capillary crystals. Its taste is sweet, but rather nauseous, in consequence
                        of a foreign matter with which it is contaminated. It is easily obtained
                        pure by dissolving it in hot alcohol to saturation, and setting the solution
                        aside. The pure manna is deposited in a white spongy crystalline mass,
                        bearing some resemblance to camphor. Its taste is agreeably sweet, and it
                        melts on the tongue like snow.</p><p>The crystals arc fine translucent four-sided needles. It dissolves very
                        readily in alcohol, and crystallizes on cooling. When digested in nitric

                        substance is obtained from the roots of the <hi rend="italic">glycirrhyza
                        glabra,</hi> or common liquorice, a plant cultivated in the south of Europe,
                        and cven in England. The decoction of these roots inspissated by boiling is
                        known by the name of black sugar, or liquorice sugar. To obtain pure
                        liquorice sugar, the following process may be followed:</p><p>Macerate liquorice roots in boiling water, and concentrate the liquid in a
                        very gentle heat. Then mix it with sulphuric acid, which will occasion a
                        white precipitate, consisting of liquorice sugar mixed with albumen. Let the
                        precipitate be washed in water acidulated with, sulphuric acid, and at last
                        .with a small quantity of pure water. Alcohol will now dissolve the sugar,
                        and leave the albumen behind. To the solution add cautiously carbonate of
                        potash til] the liquid loses its acid, characters. Then filter and
                        evaporate. The sugar remains under the brm of a yellow translucent brittle
                        mass, which does not ιdhere to the vessel. In nearly the same way may it be
                        extracted from the common <hi rend="italic">black sugar oĩ</hi>
                        commerce.</p><p>When in powder it resembles pounded amber. Its taste s sweet, with a peculiar
                        flavour which is well known to characterize liquorice. It dissolves readily
                        both in water and alcohol. It cannot be deprived of its yellow colour by
                        ivory-black. When heated it swells like borax; and taking fire it burns with
                        a clear flame, emitting much smoke.</p><p>Its most remarkable characters are the strong affinity which it has for
                        acids, bases, and even for several salts.</p><p>With acids it forms compounds, which are nearly insoluble in water; hence the
                        addition of an acid throws it down from its aqueous solution. Sulphate of
                        liquorice sugar is a glutinous, resinous-looking substance, which, when
                        dried, becomes yellow and translucent. Its taste is simply swcet, like that
                        of the sugar; but it dissolves much more slowly in the saliva. It dissolves
                        in boiling water, and is deposited in a gelatinous state as the liquid
                        cools. It is soluble in alcohol; and when the solution is evaporated it
                        leaves an opaque, straw-yellow matter. It burns precisely like the pure
                        sugar, and leaves no ashes.</p><p>Acetate of liquorice sugar is pretty similar to the sulphate, but much more
                        soluble in boiling w ʹ ater.</p><p>So great is the tendency of liquorice sugar to unite with bases, that we must
                        take care not to add more of a base than is just necessary to saturate the
                        acid with which il was in combination, otherwise the sugar will be sure t(
                        unite with the excess. When a solution of liquorice su gar is digested with
                        a carbonate, the carbonic acid is giver off, and the sugar combines with the
                        base. M hen the suga is exactly saturated, the taste is simply sweet. The
                        com pounds thus formed are soluble in water, and likewise iι alcohol, though
                        in less quantity. None of these com pounds crystallizes. . ∣</p><p>Sulphate of potash, nitrate of copper, acetate of lead sulphated peroxide of
                        iron, chloride of tin, &amp;c. may b( combined with liquorice sugar; but it
                        occasions no preci pitate in a solution of corrosive sublimate.</p><p>No attempts have yet been made to determine the ato mic weight, or to analyse

                        hitherto observed; but the rest have been so imperfectly studied, that we
                        cannot as yet describe them. About fifteen years ago a sweet substance like
                        manna was brought from Botany Bay. It had been gathered in a plain covered
                        with wood, and doubtless had been an exudation from some plant. Its
                        solubility in alcohol was the same as that of manna, but the shape of its
                        crystals did not agree with that of manna, nor did it make so cooling an
                        impression on the tongue. It was probably a variety of manna; but the small
                        quantity brought to London did not permit any thing like a rigid
                        examination.</p><p>The substance found by Petroz and Robinet in the ca-nella alba, to which they

                        species of sugar; but the description is too imperfect to enable us to give
                        any account of it here.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of Starch.</hi></p><p>This principle is one of the commonest in the vegetable kingdom. It
                        constitutes a portion of the seeds of almost the whole tribe of grasses, and
                        of many other plants, besides almost all the bulbs, as potatoes, iatroplia
                        manjhot, helianthus tuberosus, &amp;c. It exists also in the pith of various
                        palms, as the sagus rumpbii, cycus revoluta, and circinalis, but seldom in
                        the pith or stems of bicoyledonous plants. The leaves also of plants very
                        frequently contain it. There are several varieties of it, but the type of
                        the whole is common starch, whether extracted from wheat or from
                        potatoes.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Common Starch.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Common
                        starch is usually made from wheat by the following process: Good wheat is
                        allowed to steep in water till it becomes soft, and yields a milky juice
                        when squeezed. It is then put into coarse linen sacks, and subjected to
                        pressure in a vat filled with water; a milky juice exudes, and mixes with
                        the water in the vat. This process is repeated so long as the wheat will
                        yield any milky juice. The sack and its contents are then removed.
                        Fermentation takes place, alcohol and an acid are generated, which dissolve
                        all the impurities, leaving nothing behind but pure starch. The starch,
                        after being washed, is dried. In drying, it splits into small columnar
                        masses, which have considerable regularity. Very pure starch may also be
                        obtained from the potato, simply by grating down the potato, and washing it
                        on a seirce: the water carries the starch with it, leaving the fibrous part
                        of the potato behind.</p><p>. Starch is a beautiful white matter, composed of small grains, having
                        considerable lustre, and probably a crystalline structure. It is insoluble
                        in cold water, but when boiled with water it is converted into a translucent
                        jelly. If this jelly be thin, and set aside for some time, it begins to
                        subside, and falls very slowly to the bottom. If infusion of nutgalls be
                        poured into this jelly, a light brownish-red precipitate falls. If the
                        liquid be heated up to 120°, this precipitate dissolves; but it appears
                        again when the liquor cools. This properly characterizes starch, and enables
                        us to detect its presence.</p><p>Starch is insoluble in alcohol and ether. When boiled in dilute sulphuric
                        acid it is converted into sugar. The same change takes place partially when
                        the infusion of starch in water is left to spontaneous evaporation. When
                        digested in nitric acid, starch is converted into malic and oxalic acids,
                        without the least trace of mucic acid.</p><p>The aqueous infusion of starch is precipitated by diacetate of lead.</p><p>When heated so high as to change its colour a little, without being burnt, it
                        acquires the smell of new bread, and becomes completely soluble in water.
                        When the aqueous solution is evaporated, a substance so like gum is
                        obtained, that it may be used by the calico-printers, and is known in
                        commerce by the name of British gum.</p><p>When heated rapidly, starch undergoes a kind of semifusion; it is charred,
                        smokes, and burns with a lively flame.</p><p>Starch absorbs chlorine gas, and assumes at the same time a brown colour.
                        With bromine it combines and forms an orange-coloured precipitate. With
                        iodine it strikes a deep blue, and is in consequence a very delicate
                        re-agent for discovering the presence of that substance.</p><p>The dilute acids dissolve starch, and the solution is clear and quite liquid.
                        By long boiling the starch is converted, first into gum, and then into
                        sugar.</p><p>It has a stronger affinity for the bases than for acids. When triturated with
                        caustic potash, it is converted into a transparent jelly, soluble both in
                        water and alcohol, and from this solution the starch is precipitated by
                        acids. When the jelly is diluted with much water it becomes opal. When the
                        infusion of starch is mixed with barytes or starch water, a precipitate
                        falls, consisting of these bodies united with starch. In the same way we may
                        obtain a compound of starch and oxide of lead, by mixing diacetate of lead
                        with the infusion. The precipitate is white, curdy, and heavy. According to
                        the analysis of Berzelius, it is composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Starch</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>72</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxide of lead</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>28</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>100</p></cell></row></table><p>We know little of the action of salts upon starch.

                        dissolves a portion of that salt. There is a light-blue compound of prussian

                        dried at 212°, and in the other in a vacuum over sulphuric acid. Prout dried
                        starch at 212°, and obtained nearly the same results. Had the oxygen been a
                        little higher than it is in Berzelius’ analysis, it would be evident that by
                        the temperature of 212° two atoms of water had been driven off. As it is
                        doubtful whether this water existed in the starch in that state, or whether

                        in the present state of our knowledge, form an adequate idea of the

                        current of water in the same way as wheat flour, in order to extract the
                        gluten, instead of that principle there remains a great quantity of matter,

                        is a yellow granular powder, like saw-dust. As it is not soluble in water,
                        it may be freed from starch by boiling the residue of washed barley-meal
                        (about 80 per cent.) in water. The residuary hordein amounts to about
                        fifty-five per cent, of the barleymeal from which it was extracted. When
                        distilled it yields, together with gaseous bodies, acetic acid, and an
                        empyreumatic oil, and leaves the fifth part of its weight of charcoal. When

                        of this substance is converted into starch. It exists also in maize. The

                        discovered by Valentine Rose in the root of the inula helenium, or
                        elecampane. It has been since found in the roots of angelica arcbangelica,
                        anthémis pyrethrum, Colchicum autumnale, georgina (dahlia) purpurea,
                        helianthus tubcrosus, and it probably exists in the roots of all the <hi rend="italic">asters.</hi> It has been called <hi rend="italic">helenm,
                        alantin, datiscin</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dahlin.</hi> It exists most abundantly in the root of the
                        georgina; but it may be easily extracted from the roots of elecampane or
                        arti choke. Grate down the root and boil it with water. Filter the decoction
                        while boiling hot. If it is not clear iι may be clarified by white of egg.
                        Let it now be evaporated till a film collects on the surface. On cooling,
                        the inulin precipitates in the form of a powder. Let it be col lected on a
                        filter, and well washed and dried. From th&lt; georgina we can extract ten
                        per cent, and from the artichoke three per cent, of inulin.</p><p>It constitutes a light and very white powder, withoul taste or smell, and
                        having a specific gravity of 1∙356 When heated a little higher than 212°, it
                        loses water and melts. On cooling it assumes the appearance of a grayish
                        sealymass, which may be easily reduced to powder. Its characters are now
                        very nearly the same as those of starch Iodine gives it a yellow colour, and
                        makes it soluble in cold water.</p><p>It is very little soluble in cold water, a hundred parts of that liquid
                        dissolving only two of inulin; but boiling water dissolves it abundantly.
                        The solution is mucilaginous, but has not the property of pasting pieces of
                        paper together. When the solutiorr is boiled the inulin forms a crust on the
                        surface, and on cooling it falls in the form of a powder. When inulin is
                        roasted, it is converted inte hard translucent lumps like sago.</p><p>It is insoluble in cold alcohol, and precipitated by il from water; but
                        boiling alcohol dissolves a little of it and allows it to fall again on
                        cooling.</p><p>It is dissolved readily by dilute acids. When boiled with dilute sulphuric
                        acid, it is more readily converted into sugar than starch itself. Nitric
                        acid converts it inte malic and oxalic acids. It combines'with the bases
                        precisely as starch does. The action of the infusion of nutgalls is
                        precisely the same on inulin as on starch.</p><p>No attempt has been made to analyse inulin; but its constitution cannot
                        differ much from that of starch.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Lichen Starch.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Different
                        species of lichens contain a starch very similar to common starch, except
                        that it has nothing of the powdery form which common starch so readily
                        assumes. Iceland moss, the cetraria islandica of Acharius, contains it in
                        greatest abundance; but it is found also in the lichen plicatus and
                        barbatus. From Iceland moss it may be obtained in the following way:</p><p>Let the moss be chopt fine, and digested in eighteen times its weight of
                        water having about the thirtieth part of its weight of potash dissolved in
                        it. Let this mixture remain for twenty-four hours, often stirring it during
                        that time. The alkali dissolves a bitter matter, nearly insoluble in pure
                        water, and the liquid acquires a dark-brown colour. The lichen is now laid
                        upon a linen cloth, to allow the lcy to run off. It is afterwards well
                        washed with water till it is quite freed from every trace of the alkali. We
                        must not apply pressure, otherwise we would lose <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                        good deal of the starch. The lichen is now to be boiled in nine times its
                        weight of water, till the liquid be reduced to two thirds of its original
                        bulk. Filter while boiling hot, and subject the residue to pressure. The
                        filtered liquor is transparent and colourless. As it cools, a skin forms on
                        its surface, and it at last assumes the form of a translucent-grayish jelly,
                        which gradually contracts and cracks, and lets the water ooze out. If we
                        suspend it in a linen bag the water drops out, and it gradually hardens.
                        When fully dried it is black, hard, and breaks with a glassy fracture. When
                        put into water, it swells and loses its black colour, which proceeds from an
                        extractive matter that does not dissolve. If it be now dissolved in boiling
                        water, it gives after cooling a colourless, translucent jelly.</p><p>It is destitute of taste, but has a slight smell of the lichen from which it
                        was procured. It is insoluble in alcohol and ether. It contains no azote,
                        and yields, when distilled or burnt, the same products as potato starch.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193353204" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3204-0477"/><p>It is slightly soluble in cold water. When the solution of it in hot water is
                        concentrated by boiling, it separates under the form of a skin on the
                        surface of the liquid, which puts an end to the evaporation. One part of
                        this starch forms a jelly with twenty-three parts of water. Chlorine does
                        not alter it. Iodine gives it a colour between brown and green.</p><p>The weak acids dissolve it, and when boiled in dilute sulphuric acid, it is
                        converted into sugar like common starch. Nitric acid acts on it as on common
                        starch. It dissolves in caustic potash. It is not precipitated by barytes
                        water, but by the disalts of lead. With the infusion of nutgalls it behaves
                        like common starch.</p><p>The lichen fastigiatus and plicatus yield a starch differing in some of its
                        characters from the starch of the lichen islandicus. *</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Amylin.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> When the infusion
                        of starch in water is left to spontaneous decomposition, nearly one fourth
                        of the starch disappears, sugar is'formed, and gum, and another substance
                        intermediate between sugar and gum, to which Saussure has given the name of
                        <hi rend="italic">amylin</hi> or <hi rend="italic">amidin.</hi> It is
                        obtained from the residue, after every thing soluble in cold water is
                        removed. Boiling water takes up the amylin, and leaves it in a state of
                        purity, when it is evaporated to dryness.</p><p>It is semitransparent and brittle, and very soluble in water of the
                        temperature 144°. This solution becomes blue when it comes in contact with
                        iodine. It is coagulated by diacetate of lead, and copiously precipitated by
                        barytes water, but not by lime water nor infusion of nutgalls. It dissolves
                        in the aqueous solution of potash, and the solution has no viscidity. It is
                        thrown down by acids and by alcohol.</p><p>There are some other substances obviously connected with starch. The <hi rend="italic">fibrous starchy</hi> matter of the potato, for example, may be
                        mentioned. Arrow root seems very nearly the same as potato starch. Sago and
                        tapioea are also closely allied to the same substances. They owe their chief
                        differences probably to the way in which they have been dried. The very
                        nutritious article of food known in Scotland by the name of sowans consists
                        chiefly of a starch from the seeds of oats.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of Gum.</hi></p><p>This principle is still more abundant in the vegetable kingdom than starch;
                        but hitherto the chemical properties of gum have been but imperfectly
                        investigated. Hence it is not unlikely that different substances are at
                        present confounded together under the name of gum. The principal characters
                        are solubility in water, and the solution being possessed of a glutinous
                        property, and being capable of pasting pieces of paper together, and
                        stiffening linen. From the aqueous solutions the gum is precipitated by the
                        addition of water. We know at least three distinct substances at present
                        confounded together under the name of gum. We shall give a short account of
                        each of these in the present section.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Gum Proper.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Gum exudes
                        from a variety of trees in the form of a mucilage, and gradually dries on
                        the bark in the form of a clear yellow or brown, hard, brittle concretion.
                        Almost all plants contain some gum, which may be extracted by water; and
                        when the liquid has been sufficiently concentrated, the gum may be thrown
                        down by alcohol, though it seldom falls in a state of purity, but usually
                        mixed with some other of the principles which the plant contains. Almost all
                        the chemical properties of gum have been determined in <hi rend="italic">gum-arabic,</hi> which is a gum under the form of small light
                        amber-coloured and translucent tears, hard and brittle, and having a
                        vitreous lustre. It exudes from the acacia vera.</p><p>It is destitute of smell, and has but little taste. Its specific gravity
                        varies from 1∙32 to 1 ’ 48. It contains naturally no chemically-combined
                        water; but when an aqueous solution of gum is evaporated to dryness, it
                        retains about seventeen per cent. of water, which may be driven off by
                        heating it in vacuo over sulphurie acid, in a temperature of 212°. When it
                        is exposed to heat it softens and swells, but does not melt. It emits air
                        bubbles, blackens, and at last, when nearly reduced to charcoal, it emits a
                        low blue flame.</p><p>It dissolves slowly but completely in water, and more rapidly in boiling than
                        in cold water. The solution is called <hi rend="italic">mucilage.</hi> It is
                        thick, and adheres, and is often used as a paste, to give stiffness and
                        lustre to linen. It may be kept for a great length of time without
                        undergoing spontaneous decomposition, but it becomes at last acid.</p><p>It is insoluble in alcohol and ether. Alcohol throws it down from water, but
                        not completely. The acids dissolve gum if they be dilute; the more powerful
                        acids, if they be concentrated, decompose it. If the powder of gum be
                        triturated with concentrated sulphurie acid, a combination takes place, and
                        we obtain a slightly coloured mass, which in twenty-four hours becomes
                        darker. If we dilute it with water and saturate the acid with chalk, we
                        obtain the gum precisely in the state that sawings of wood assume when
                        treated with the same acid. When sulphuric acid and gum are boiled, the gum
                        is decomposed, sulphurous acid is given out, and a charry matter remains,
                        weighing only <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> 0∙29 of the gum. It is said,
                        that by boiling gum in dilute sulphuric acid, sugar may be formed in the
                        Same way as by boiling starch.</p><p>When gum is heated gently in nitric acid, and then allowed to cool, mucic
                        acid is deposited, amounting to nearly one fourth of the weight of the gum.
                        When the digestion is continued, malic and oxalic acids are formed.
                        Vauquelin affirms that chlorine gas converts gum into citric acid. Iodine
                        produces no change on gum.</p><p>It combines readily with the saline bases. The solution of potash converts it
                        first into a substance not unlike curd, and then dissolves it. Alcohol
                        throws down the gum in white flakes, but it obstinately retains a portion of
                        the potash, and is more brittle than when pure. Lime water, and the other
                        alkalies and alkaline earths, likewise unite with gum, and form compounds
                        which are soluble in water. Silicated potash, when mixed with a solution of
                        gum, though even much diluted, occasions a flaky precipitate. An abundant
                        precipitate falls when the solutions of gum and diacetate of lead arc mixed
                        together. It is like curd; and after being washed and dried it remains
                        white, and is easily reduced to powder.

                        cheaper, has almost superseded the use of gum-arabic in this country. It is
                        darker coloured and in larger pieces; and the mucilage which it forms with
                        water is not so adhesive and thick: in other respects it resembles
                        gum-arabic in its properties.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Bassorm.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This variety of
                        gum was first particularly described by Vauquelin under the name of <hi rend="italic">bassora gum.</hi> John gave it the names of <hi rend="italic">cerasin</hi> and jtmwztn; and Bucholz called it <hi rend="italic">tragacanthin,</hi> because the properties of gum tragacanth are the same;

                        mucus.</hi></p><p>It is a solid substance, having exactly the external appearance of gum. It is
                        usually harder than gum, and not so easily reduced to powder. In general it
                        is nearly white; but some varieties of it are yellowish, and others
                        reddish-brown and deep. When put into water it does not dissolve like gum,
                        but gradually imbibes that liquid, swells up very considerably, and becomes
                        transparent and gelatinous, but does not dissolve. It dissolves in boiling
                        water, but again partially precipitates in a gelatinous form as the solution
                        cools. It is insoluble in alcohol and ether. It dissolves readily in
                        solutions of ammonia, potash, and soda, especially when assisted by
                        heat.</p><p>Its aqueous solution is not completely precipitated by alcohol. When mixed
                        with diacetate of lead an immediate precipitate does not fall, but in
                        twenty-four hours it makes its appearance. It is not coagulated by sulphated
                        peroxide of iron, as is the case with common gum; nor is it precipitated
                        like gum by silicated potash. But with perchloride of tin it forms a
                        coagulum, having the form of a stiff jelly. It is not precipitated by the
                        infusion of nutgalls.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Gum Kuteera.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This gum is
                        the produce of the ster-culio urens, a tree which grows in Hindustan. It is
                        in large roundish lumps, having a brownish-red colour, much lighter than
                        cherry-tree gum, and is not hard, but soft and elastic. When put into water
                        it gradually imbibes that liquid, and swells into a transparent and almost
                        colourless jelly. But none of it dissolves in that liquid. In this respect
                        it agrees with bassorin. But if we boil the jelly for some hours, we obtain
                        a complete solution, from which no precipitate falls when the liquid cools.
                        The solution, even when much concentrated, possesses very little of the
                        mucilaginous qualities which characterize the aqueous solution of gum; nor
                        can it be employed for pasting together pieces of paper or stiffening linen.
                        Large quantities of this gum were brought to this country about thirty years
                        ago from India, for the use of the calico printers, but it was found not to
                        answer. A tea-spoonful of its powder gives to water the consistence of
                        capillaire. In India it enters into the composition of some varnishes.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Cherry-tree Gum.-</hi> —The prunus avium, the common
                        cherry and plum trees, and the almond and aprico, likewise yield a gum,
                        which exudes in abundance from natural and artificial openings in the stem.
                        It is in large, dark, reddish-brown masses, at first soft and elastic like
                        gum kuteera; but by keeping it becomes exceedingly hard, and breaks with a
                        glassy fracture. When put into water it swells like bassorin into a jelly;
                        but a portion dissolves in cold water, while the gelatinous portion does not
                        dissolve even by several hours boiling. The portion dissolved is similar in
                        its characters to gum kuteera. When treated with nitric acid it yields mucic
                        acid.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Vegetable Mucus.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This
                        substance exists in many plants, and seems to be nearly identical with
                        bassorin. lt may be obtained abundantly from linseed, by simply infusing the
                        seeds in ten times their weight of water. The mucilage obtained is similar
                        to that of gum, but it is not adhesive. It is precipitated by alcohol in
                        flocks, but the liquid does not become opaque and milky, like mucilage of
                        gum-arabic when treated in the same manner. Diacetate of lead throws down a
                        copious dense precipitate. No change is produced by infusion of nutgalls.
                        Salep, from Caventou’s experiments, seems to contain a great deal of
                        mucus.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">Calendulm.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This substance
                        may be obtained from the calendula officinalis, and was first described by
                        Geiger in 1818. The leaves and blossoms of the calendula are digested in
                        alcohol. The infusion is evaporated to the consistence of an extract. This
                        extract is first treated with ether, which separates a green-coloured
                        vegetable matter, and afterwards with water. There remains a bulky
                        mucilaginous matter, almost insoluble in water, whether cold or boiling hot.
                        When dried it is yellow, translucent, and brittle. In water it again swells
                        out into a mucus. The great distinction between it and mucus is its
                        solubility in alcohol. It is insoluble in dilute acids, but dissolves in
                        concentrated acetic acid. The dilute solutions of caustic alkalies dissolve
                        it, but not the alkaline carbonates, nor lime water. It is not precipitated
                        by the infusion of nutgalls. It is insoluble in ether, and in the fixed and
                        volatile oils.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Of Gluten and
                        Albumen.</hi></p><p>The <hi rend="italic">gluten</hi> of wheat was first obtained by Beccaria in
                        1742. To procure it we have only to make, a quantity of good wheat flour
                        into dough, and knead it between the fingers, while a small stream of water
                        falls slowly on it. We continue the kneading as long as the water passes off
                        milky. What remains in the hand is the gluten.</p><p>It is a gray, tenacious, ductile mass, which may be extended to twenty times
                        its original length without breaking. It adheres very tenaciously to other
                        bodies, and has often been employed to cement together pieces of broken
                        porcelain. In this state it is a mixture of vegetable gluten and albumen,
                        rarely free from some bran and a little starch. To obtain pure gluten and
                        albumen from this matter, it must be digested in boiling alcohol till that
                        liquid ceases to become muddy on cooling. The alcohol dissolves the gluten
                        and leaves the albumen.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The albumen thus obtained was called <hi rend="italic">ŵno¶ĩe</hi> by
                        Taddei.</p></note></p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Gluten.</hi> —The gluten precipitates when the alcoholic
                        solution is mixed with water, and the alcohol is distilled off. &gt; In the
                        liquid which remains the gluten swims inadhesive flocks. A small portion of
                        it is united to gum, and held involution in water. Gluten thus obtained has
                        a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353230" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3230-0479"/> light-yellow colour; and when the liquid is
                        stirred it collects altogether into an adhesive mass, which sticks to the
                        fingers, is elastic, and recovers its form after being forcibly drawn out.
                        It is destitute of taste, but has a peculiar smell. When left to itself in a
                        dry place, it assumes a darker yellow colour, and dries into a translucent
                        brittle matter, resembling a dried animal substance. It dissolves in alcohol
                        with a light-yellow colour; and if the solution be evaporated, the gluten
                        remains in the state of a yellow translucent varnish. When cold alcohol is
                        poured on gluten, it becomes white, a glutinous matter separates in plates,
                        and the liquid becomes milky. The substance which thus separates is not
                        gluten, though its properties approach those of that substance. Boiling
                        alcohol takes it up, but when a concentrated solution cools it becomes
                        glutinous.</p><p>If gluten be dissolved in boiling spirits, it is deposited, on cooling, with
                        the whole of its glutinous characters. It is insoluble in ether, and in
                        fixed and volatile oils. When steeped moist in acetic acid it swells out,
                        becomes adhesive, loses its yellow colour, and assumes a half-liquid
                        appearance. If in this state it be mixed with water, glutinous flocks remain
                        undissolved, and the liquid has the appearance of water mixed with some
                        drops of milk. Boiling does not alter the appearance of this liquid. In this
                        case the gluten dissolves in the acid; but the other substance with which it
                        is mixed, which is difficultly soluble in alcohol, is insoluble in the acid,
                        becomes glutinous, and separating from the liquid very slowly, occasions its
                        milky appearance.</p><p>The solution of the gluten in acetic acid, freed as much as possible from the
                        glutinous substance, which is insoluble in the acid, dries to á colourless
                        translucent varnish. When caustic ammonia or its carbonate is added in such
                        quantity as not to saturate the acid completely, it falls down in flocks,
                        which in about an hour collect together, and assume the usual appearance of
                        vegetable gluten. In this state, when treated with warm water, a small
                        portion of it dissolves, for the liquid is slightly precipitated by infusion
                        of nutgalls.</p><p>When gluten is covered with a dilute organic acid, and agitated in it, no
                        solution takes place; but the gluten combines with a portion of the acid. If
                        wq now pour off the dilute acid and digest the gluten a couple of times in
                        water, the gluten dissolves; but the peculiar glutinous substance already
                        mentioned remains.</p><p>The compound of gluten and sulphuric acid is very difficultly soluble in pure
                        water, but it dissolves very readily in nitric or muriatic acid. It is
                        soluble also in boiling alcohol; and if a little carbonate of lime be added
                        to the boiling hot liquid, the gluten may be obtained from the alcohol
                        afterwards, quite free from acid.</p><p>When dilute caustic potash is mixed with gluten in water, it becomes slimy,
                        and dissolves the gluten into a muddy liquid, which cannot be made
                        transparent by filtering. When more gluten is added than the alkali can
                        dissolve, so as to saturate the potash, the liquid loses its alkaline taste,
                        but acquires an astringent flavour, and is almost colourless. When
                        evaporated at a temperature not exceeding 100°, a portion of the dissolved
                        matter precipitates, and then dries into a white opaque mass, which twists
                        itself up, and does not adhere to the vessel. When water is poured upon this
                        substance, the gluten dissolves, while the other matter remains in the form
                        of a slime.</p><p>Ammonia, even when concentrated, has little dissolving power on gluten in its
                        solid state; but when a solution of’ it in an acid is dropt into caustic
                        ammonia, the precipitated gluten is almost immediately re-dissolved. Lime
                        water acts in the same way.</p><p>The compounds of gluten with the other bases are all insoluble in water, and
                        precipitate when glutinate of potash in a neutral state is mixed with an
                        earthy or metallic salt. These precipitates have the usual colour which
                        characterizes the salts of the bases employed.</p><p>Gluten is not dissolved by the alkaline carbonates, which throw it down from
                        its solution in acids the more completely the more of the precipitant we
                        add, and the more concentrated the solution is. If the alkaline liquid be
                        poured off, the precipitate may be dissolved in pure water, constituting a
                        muddy liquid.</p><p>The solutions of gluten are precipitated white by corrosive sublimate. The
                        solution of gluten in acetic acid is not precipitated by acetate or
                        diacetate of lead, nor by sulphated peroxide of iron; but it is readily
                        precipitated by infusion of nutgalls.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Albumen.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The albumen
                        remains undissolved when Beccaria’s gluten is boiled in alcohol. It is
                        considerably reduced in volume, has lost all its glutinous characters, and
                        is easily dried into a white or gray hard mass. When digested in a very
                        dilute alkaline ley, it swells and becomes moist, and then dissolves into a
                        clear colourless liquid, leaving the bran and the starch with which it had
                        been mixed. If the alkaline solution be saturated, and quite free from
                        carbonate, it has no alkaline taste whatever; and when evaporated, it lets
                        fall at first a little coagulated albumen, and then leaves a white mass,
                        which is attached to the glass, and which is again soluble in water, with
                        the exception of the portion which had coagulated during the evaporation. By
                        mixing this saturated alkaline solution of albumen with the different earthy
                        and metallic salts, we may obtain combinations of albumen with the other
                        bases. These compounds are generally insoluble in water. The albuminate of
                        peroxide of iron is dark red after being dried; that of protoxide white, but
                        it becomes yellow when exposed to the air. The albuminate of copper is
                        bluish-green, the albuminates of mercury and lead snow-white.</p><p>Albumen is soluble in water before coagulation; but it is insoluble in
                        alcohol, and it is coagulated by the action of that liquid. When dried it
                        becomes white, gray, brown, or black. It dissolves easily in caustic alkali,
                        and neutralizes the taste. From this solution it is precipitated by acids,
                        provided they be added in excess. Such an excess of acid as gives a
                        perceptibly sour taste, and causes the liquid to redden vegetable blues, may
                        be added without occasioning any precipitation. The liquid becomes merely
                        milky, and recovers its transparency when heated. When a considerable excess
                        of acid is added, the albumen is thrown down, and the precipitate is a
                        compound of the albumen and the precipitating acid, scarcely soluble in
                        acidulated water, but easily soluble in pure water.</p><p>One of the most remarkable characters of albumen is, that itfe combination
                        with an acid, if in solution in water, is precipitated <hi rend="italic">white</hi> by prussiate of potash.</p><p>Einhof, to whom we are indebted for the establishment of most of the
                        preceding facts, examined also the gluten and albumen of rye, oats, and
                        peas, and showed that they possessed various peculiarities, which he
                        minutely details. For these investigations the reader is referred to the
                        different volumes of Gehlen’s Journal, where Einhof’s papers originally
                        appeared.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V.— <hi rend="italic">Of Lignin.</hi></p><p>What is at present called <hi rend="italic">lignin</hi> by chemists, is the
                        peculiar substance of trees called <hi rend="italic">wood,</hi> after it has
                        been deprived of all foreign matter. It is very different in different
                        trees, in its colour, hardness, specific gravity, &amp;c. It probably also
                        differs in its constitution, though this has not been ascertained by
                        experiment. Its texture is always porous, inconsequence of the numerous
                        vessels which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353243" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3243-0480"/> pervade it. In 100 parts of dried wood there
                        exists about ninety-six parts of lignin and four parts of foreign matter,
                        which may be removed by digestion in water and alcohol.</p><p>To obtain pure lignin, the method followed is to take a portion of wood, or
                        rather of saw-dust, and to digest it first in water, then in alcohol, and
                        successively in ether, muriatic acid, dilute potash ley, and even in
                        chlorine, so long as these menstrua continue to dissolve anything.</p><p>It is white, opaque, and of a fibrous texture, and these fibres have
                        different directions in different species of trees. Its specific gravity
                        varies, as is evident from the following little table.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Maple</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙4599</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Poplar</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙4854</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Fir</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙4621</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Elm...,</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙5l86</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Lime</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙4846</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Beech</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙5284</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Birch</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙4848</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oak</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙5344</p></cell></row></table><p>Lignin is destitute of taste and smell, and is of course insoluble in all the
                        menstrua employed in purifying it.</p><p>When heated it becomes brown, and gives out moisture. When heated during four
                        days in an oven, it was charred, and gave out a bituminous matter, insoluble
                        in water and alcohol, but soluble in ether, though with difficulty. By this
                        treatment it was deprived of more than half its weight. When distilled in a
                        retort it becomes black, without melting, softening, or altering its shape.
                        It gives out carbonic acid and carburetted hydrogen gas, water, acetic acid,
                        pyroxylic spirit, empyreumatic oil, and resin.</p><p>Nitric acid gradually acts upon lignin, transforming it into a kind of
                        starch, while malic acid is evolved. By long continued boiling the lignin is
                        dissolved, and a quantity of oxalic acid formed.</p><p>Lignin heated in concentrated sulphuric acid is charred, and the residual
                        charcoal amounts to 0∙4375 of the original weight of the lignin. If it be
                        boiled with dilute sulphuric acid, it is converted first into gum, and
                        afterwards into sugar, while at the same time a peculiar acid is evolved.
                        When mixed with potash ley, and pretty strongly heated, it is converted into
                        oxalic acid.</p><p>A good many experiments have been made to deter· mine the composition of
                        lignin from various kinds of wood. The following little table shows the

                        possesses the following characters:</p><p>1. It is insoluble in water, alcohol, ether, and oils.</p><p>2/ It is destitute of taste and smell.</p><p>3. Its Structuré is peculiar, being full of pores.</p><p>4. It is soluble in nitric acid, and when treated with a sufficient quantity
                        of that acid it yields oxalic acid.</p><p>5. When distilled it yields a considerable quantity of ammonia, and leaves a
                        charcoal having a metallic appearance, and a colour similar to bronze.</p><p>All these characters, except the last, so far as they arc chemical, apply to
                        lignin as well as medullin. The last character shows that medullin contains
                        azote as a constituent. It must, therefore, differ essentially from lignin,
                        though, so far as it has been examined, there is a great similarity between

                        treated it with water in his silver digester till that liquid was capable of
                        dissolving nothing more. He obtained an aromatic principle and a little
                        acetic acid, which passed over into the receiver. The extract formed by the
                        water contained two colouring matters, the one yellow, the other red; an
                        acid, the nature of which was not determined; gallic acid, ůn astringent
                        substance; a substance containing azote; a substance soluble in water, and
                        insoluble in alcohol; gallate of iron, lime, and traces of magnesia. Twenty
                        parts of cork thus treated left 1745 parts of insoluble matter.</p><p>This undissolved matter being treated a sufficient number of times with

                        were considered as pure <hi rend="italic">suberin.</hi></p><p>The properties of suberin have been imperfectly examined. It is insoluble in
                        all the re-agents hitherto tried, except the strong mineral acids. Sulphuric
                        acid readily chars it. Nitric acid gives it a yellow colour, corrodes,
                        dissolves, and decomposes it, suberic acid being formed, and a peculiar
                        dark-coloured variety of wax.</p><p>There is some reason for suspecting that the chemical <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353256" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3256-0481"/> characters

                        the mucor scepticus, &amp;c.</p><p>The mushroom is subjected to pressure, to drive out every thing liquid. The
                        residue is treated first with water, then with alcohol, and finally with a
                        dilute solution of potash. What remains undissolved is the fungin.</p><p>It is a white, fibrous, soft, insipid substance, possessing but little
                        elasticity, and dividing easily between the teeth. It is insoluble in water,
                        alcohol, ether, oils, and diluted acids. When put into the infusion of
                        nutgalls it absorbs the greater part of the tannin contained in the liquid,
                        and assumes a fawn colour.</p><p>Alkalies have but little action on it; yet when boiled in a concentrated
                        alkaline ley, fungin is partly dissolved, and a saponaceous liquidis
                        obtained, from which the acids throw down a flocky matter. Ammonia also
                        dissolves a little of it.</p><p>Concentrated sulphuric acid chars it, acetic and sulphurous acids being
                        evolved. Muriatic acid acts on it very slowly, converting it into a jelly
                        which is soluble in water. Dilute nitric acid disengages azote from it. When
                        distilled with six times its weight of nitric acid, it becomes yellow,
                        swells up, and effervesces; but the violent action is soon over. Hydrocyanic
                        acid is evolved, and oxalic acid formed, together with two fatty bodies
                        resembling tallow and wax. When mixed with water, and left to spontaneous
                        decomposition, it emits at first the smell of putrid cheese; but this smell
                        soon goes off', and the putrefactive process stops, or goes on very
                        slowly.</p><p>These characters show that fungin, though resembling lignin in many of its
                        characters, yet differs from it in others; and that it contains azote as one
                        of its constituents. In this respect it agrees with medullin, though it
                        differs from that principle in others of its characters.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Pollen'm.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This name was
                        given by Dr John to a substance found in the pollen of the pinus abies,
                        pinus sylvestris, and lycopodium clavatum, and supposed by him to constitute
                        a characteristic constituent in every pollen. •It was first recognised by
                        Bucholz in 1806, in the pollen of the lycopodium. Fourcroy and Vauquelin
                        showed it to exist also in the pollen of the phoenix dactilifera.</p><p>Pollenin is yellow, and destitute of taste and smell. It is insoluble in
                        water, alcohol, ether, fixed and volatile oils, and naphtha. It is insoluble
                        also in alkaline leys. It appears to be soluble in muriatic acid, and to be
                        precipitated by ammonia. When distilled it yields ammonia, showing that,
                        like medullin and fungin, it contains azote as a constituent.</p><p>It is exceedingly combustible, burning with a kind of explosion. It is well
                        known that the pollen of the lycopodium clavatum is used on the stage to
                        imitate flashes of lightning, by throwing it through the flame of a
                        candle.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI.— <hi rend="italic">Of Tannin.</hi></p><p>The term <hi rend="italic">tannin</hi><hi rend="italic                         smallcaps"> xvsls</hi> first applied by Seguin to the vegetable principle
                        which possesses the property of converting the skins of animals into leather
                        by combining with them. It exists in all those vegetable bodies which are
                        distinguished by their astringent taste. There are doubtless various species
                        of it, distinguished from each other by their properties; but the tannin
                        from oak bark and from nutgalls, a concretion which appears upon different
                        species of oak, but the best of which are brought to this country from the
                        Levant, is considered as constituting the purest kind of it. We shall
                        therefore, in the first place, describe the characters of tannin from
                        nutgalls.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Tannin from Nutgalls.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                        Nutgalls are excrescences of the oak (quercus robur), occasioned by a small
                        insect called <hi rend="italic">cynips querci</hi><hi rend="italic">folii,</hi> which deposits an egg in the substance of the leaf, by making a
                        small perforation through the under surface. The ball presently begins to
                        grow, and the egg in the centre changes to a worm; the worm gradually
                        changes into the perfect insect, which, by eating its way out, leaves a
                        round hole. The best galls come from Aleppo; they are bluish, and dark on
                        the surface, hard and thick. Two of them are considered equivalent to three
                        of the galls from the south of Europe. Their taste is exceedingly
                        astringent. They contain gallic acid and tannin, and a considerable quantity
                        of lignin. Sir H. Davy endeavoured to show that, besides these substances,
                        there exists also a considerable quantity of extractive matter. But his
                        reasons for that opinion are far from satisfactory; and nobody has been able
                        to obtain any such extractive matter from nutgalls in a separate state. To
                        obtain pure tannin from nutgalls, we may adopt the following process:</p><p>Reduce the nutgalls to small pieces, but not to powder, and digest them for
                        two or three days in a sufficient quantity of water. A dark-brown infusion
                        is obtained, which must be strained through a cloth, to separate the
                        insoluble portion of the galls. Saturate this infusion nearly, but not
                        completely, with caustic ammonia, taking care that it still possesses
                        decided acid characters. Now add a solution of chloride of barium as long as
                        any precipitate falls. Leave the liquid to become clear in a bottle well
                        corked and filled with the mixture; for when left in the open air, gallate
                        of barytes precipitates green. Decant oft' the clear liquid from the tannate
                        of barytes, and wash that residue on the filter with cold water, taking care
                        not to employ too much of that liquid, as the precipitate is somewhat
                        soluble in water. It is now to be dissolved in acetic acid, which will leave
                        a little green gallate of barytes (proceeding from the action of the air on
                        the liquid) undissolved. Filter the solution, and mix it with acetate of
                        lead. Ą yellowish precipitate falls, which, when washed, becomes grayish
                        green. This compound is decomposed while still moist, by a current of
                        sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The lead is thrown down, and a solution of pure
                        tannin is obtained, which by cautious evaporation leaves the tannin in a
                        state of purity. . ·. ∙</p><p>While in solution in water it is nearly colourless, but it becomes yellow
                        when obtained in a dry state. It has no smell, but a purely and intensely
                        astringent taste, and strongly reddens litmus paper. It does not imbibe
                        moisture from the atmosphere, and is very easily reduced to powder. When
                        heated on platinum foil it decrepitates, softens, swells, chars, and burns
                        with a bright flame, leaving a charcoal which is easily consumed by
                        continuing the heat. . <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi></p><p>When distilled it gives off, in the first place, a thick smoke and
                        inflammable gas, which is followed by a yellowish oil, and by a liquid which
                        on cooling deposits colourless crystals. These crystals seem, at first
                        sight, to consist chiefly of gallic acid; but they do not strike a black
                        with the salts of peroxide of iron, but give them a yellowish-green colour,
                        while a precipitate falls having a grayish-green colour. Very little ammonia
                        is found among the products of distillation.</p><p>Tannin dissolves easily both in water and alcohol. Absolute alcohol, however,
                        does not dissolve it without the assistance of heat. It dissolves also in
                        ether of the spcci-fìc<pb break="no" facs="nls:193353269" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3269-0482"/> gravity 0∙72. The ethereal solution is
                        colourless, and after spontaneous evaporation the tannin is left very nearly
                        colourless and translucent. When the tannin is now digested in ether, there
                        usually remains undissolved a yellowish-brown portion, which does not
                        dissolve in ether, and which even water does not take up completely. Tannin
                        is insoluble ip oils, both fixed and volatile.</p><p>When a solution of tannin in water is left to the influence of the air, it
                        becomes gradually darker coloured; and if it be evaporated to an extract, it
                        hardens to a brittle mass, which, when digested in water, leaves a brown
                        sub-stance undissoļved. We s ’ ceherd a gradual decomposition of the tannin,
                        the insoluble portion being kept in solution by the unaltered tannin. It is
                        in this altered state that tannin exists in the infusion of nutgalls and of
                        oak bark. When this altered tannin is precipitated by a lead salt, and the
                        tannate of lead is decomposed by sulphuretted hydrogen, only the pure
                        unaltered tannin is dissolved by the water, while the altered tannin remains
                        mixed with the sulphuret of lead. It may be partially removed from this
                        sulphųret by boiling water, and still better by ammonia, which forms with it
                        a dark-brown liquid. This liquid bcing evaporated, leaves a dark-brown
                        substance, almost destitµte of taste, and which does not precipitate lime
                        water unless an acid be added, when a brown coagulum is formed, (Containing
                        lime. ,</p><p>A solution of tannin mixed with chlorine water becomes brown aryl muddy, and
                        undergoes an alteration similar to what takes place when it is left to
                        evaporate spontaneously in the open air.</p><p>With acids tannin unites readily, and most eagerly of all with sulphuric
                        acid. When this acid is put into’the infusion of nutgalls, it forms two
                        different combinations. What falls first is agglutinated together, and when
                        stirred becomes glutinous, and finally translucent and yellowish brown. When
                        agitated in cold water it dissolves in small quantity, but the liquid
                        acquires a yellow colour and an astringent taste. After being repeatedly
                        treated with cold water, a light-gray powder remains undissolved. In
                        boiling-hot water it dissolves with a dark-brown colour, and the liquid
                        becomes muddy on cooling. A brown powder precipitates, leaving the solution
                        of a lighter colour, but retaining a quantity of sulphated tannin. It is
                        readily soluble in' alcohol, with a dark-yellow colour, leaving a small
                        residue of powder.</p><p>Nitric acid occasions a precipitate when poured into a solution of tannin;
                        but an excess of the acid speedily diminishes the precipitate, while nitrous
                        gas is evolved, and the solution becomes yellow. When caustic ammonia is
                        added to,the liquid, a precipitate falls, at first reddish, then
                        grayish-grecn, and finally brown. A sufficient quantity of nitric acid
                        evolves malic and oxalic acids. Tannin is precipitated more completely by
                        muriatic, phosphoric, arsenic, oxalic, tartaric, and malic acids. A little
                        boracic acid may be dissolved by the solution of tannin when assisted by
                        heat. On cooling, the whole liquid assumes the form of a jelly, ŵhich, after
                        being dried, is a bulky snow-white.'substance, soft to the touch, like the
                        finest talc. Tarihin is not precipitated by acetic acid. All these
                        precipitates are combinations of tannin with the precipitating acid. They
                        are insoluble in an excess of the acid, but soluble in pure water. When
                        acids are dropt into the infusion of nutgalls two precipitates fall. The
                        first, which contains the dark-coloured and altered tannin, is difficultly
                        soluble in water; but the other, containing the unaltered tannin, dissolves
                        easily.</p><p>Tannín exhibits a marked affinity for the saline bases. With potash it,forms
                        a white pulverulent compound, difficultly soluble in water. It precipiíates
                        when a strong solution of tannin is mixed with hydrate of potash, with
                        carbonate or with bicarbonate of potash. If the tannin was pure, the tannate
                        of potash is formed. The compound is white and earthy looking, and undergoes
                        no change when exposed to the air. When dissolved in the smallest quantity
                        of boiling water it forms a yellow liquid, which on cooling assumes the form
                        of a gelatinous mass, and after spontaneous drying, it recovers its original
                        earthy appearance. If it be dissolved in a large quantity of water, it
                        remains in solution after cooling. This solution has neither an alkaline
                        taste, nor does it re-act as an alkali. Its taste is simply astringent. It
                        constitutes a neutral salt, which maybe distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">tannate of potash.</hi> When it is mixed with lime water no
                        precipitate falls till the potash be saturated with an acid. An excess of
                        potash causes this salt to dissolve in water. The solution is yellow; but if
                        too great a quantity of potash be added, the tannate falls down if the
                        liquid be left to spontaneous evaporation.</p><p>Tannin gives with soda a much more soluble salt. It does not fall unless the
                        solutions be very concentrate, and even then but imperfectly. When the
                        compound is as nearly neutral as possible, and left to spontaneous
                        evaporation, it gives a greenish-yellow half crystallized mass. Cold water
                        dissolves a portion of this matter, and leaves a matter which remains
                        undissolved, like tannate of potash. This being dissolved in boiling water,
                        and left to spontaneous evaporation, a white powder falls, which is quite
                        neutral. The crystallized portion, soluble in cold water, is insoluble in
                        alcohol. It contains ån excess of alkali.</p><p>With ammonia tannin combines, exhibiting similar phenomena as with potash.
                        Tannate of barytes is very little soluble in cold water. It precipitates
                        white when tannate of potash or ammonia is mixed with chloride of barium.
                        Hot water dissolves it in considerable quantity. Tannate of strontian is
                        similar to that of barytes. When hydrate of lime is added in excess to a
                        solution of tannin, almost the whole is thrown down, and a subsalt formed;
                        but neutral tannate of lime is soluble in water, and the liquid assumes a
                        yellow colour. The dry salt is yellowish brown, and translucent, and soluble
                        both in water and spirits.</p><p>When a solution of tannin is digested with hydrate of magnesia, or with
                        magnesia alba, the earth acquires a yellow colour, and a subsalt is formed,
                        almost all the tannin being removed from the liquid. When the infusion of
                        nutgalls is employed, the liquid becomes green from the gallate of
                        magnesia.</p><p>Tannin combines with the metallic oxides, and forms difficultly soluble
                        compounds. These salts may be obtained by mixing tannate of potash dissolved
                        in water with a solution of the metalline salts. Indeed several of the
                        metallic salts are precipitated by the solution of tannin in water, viz. the
                        salts of lead, copper, protoxide of tin, silver, mercury, peroxide of
                        uranium, protoxide of chromium, &amp;c. The colour of most of these
                        précipitâtes is similar to that which infusion of nutgalls strikes with the
                        same salts.</p><p>With protoxide of iron tannin gives no precipitate. When mixed with it in a
                        very concentrated state, a white gelatinous magma is formed, which, when
                        diluted, dissolves. With the peroxide of iron tannin forms a black compound,
                        which is the colouring matter in our common ink.</p><p>With the protoxide of lead tannin unites in various proportions. When a
                        solution of tannin is mixed with acetate of lead, a white precipitate falls,
                        which darkens when exposed to the air. It must therefore, if we wish to
                        preserve its white colour, be dried in vacuo, over sulphuric acid. This

                        distinguished by a white colour. They may be separated from many other
                        precipitates which tannin forms with vegetable bpdies, in consequence of the
                        property which they have of being soluble in alcohol. These tannates may be
                        freed from tan-nin if an alcoholic solution of them be dropt into an aqueous
                        solution of acetate pf lead. The oxide of lead precipitates in combination
                        with tannin,, while the vegetable alkaline base remains in solution combined
                        with acetic acid. Several of the salts have the property of precipitating

                        species of wood, from a tree which grows in the mountainous parts of India.
                        This colouring matter is insoluble in water, but it is easily extracted by
                        alcohol, after the evaporation of which it remains under the form of a red
                        resin, which melts at 212°. It may be obtained also by digesting the wood in
                        a dilute solution of caustic ammonia. The colouring matter may be thrown
                        down by saturating the ammonia with muriatic acid., This colouring matter is
                        easily destroyed both by sulphuric acid and nitric acid. It is readily
                        soluble in acetic acid,· and the saturated solution is precipitated by the
                        addition of water. When the alcoholic solution is mixed with protochloride
                        of tin, a fine purple precipitate falls. With salts of lead the precipitate
                        is violet. Green sulphate of iron is thrown down dark violet, corrosive
                        sublimate scarlet red, and nitrate of silver reddish brown. From all these
                        precipitates alcohol separates a portion of the colouring matter.</p><p>A saturated solution of red saunders in alcohol is dark red or brown, but
                        when much diluted it becomes yellow. Ether dissolves red saunders more
                        easily than alcohol, and acquires first a yellow, then a red, and finally a
                        brown colour. Water precipitates almost all the colouring matter from the
                        alcoholic solutions, but does not alter the ethereal solution. Oil of
                        lavender dissolves four per cent, and oil of rosemary somewhat less, of the
                        colouring matter. Oil of turpentine does not dissolve it cold, but when
                        heated takes up one and a third per cent. of it. Fat oils are slightly
                        coloured by it. Red saunders is employed by apothecaries to colour
                        tinetures.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Colouring Matter of Brazil Wood.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This colouring matter, called <hi rend="italic">Ecrnambouc∙by</hi>
                        the French, and <hi rend="italic">Birzil</hi> in Scotland, both from the
                        parts of South America from which it is usually imported, is obtained from
                        the wood of various species of Caesalpinia, particularly the <hi rend="italic">echinata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sapan,</hi> trees which
                        grow in South America and in India. It contains a very delicate and easily
                        altered red colouring matter, which is rendered yellow by acids and violet
                        by alkalies. This colouring matter may be obtained pure by the following
                        process:</p><p>The wood is rasped down, and then treated with water. The solution which
                        contains uncombined acetic acid is evaporated to dryness, and when the acid
                        is dissipated it is redissolved in water, and agitated with oxide of lead in
                        order to get rid of another free and not volatile acid. It is then
                        evaporated to dryness a second time, dissolved in alcohol, filtered, and
                        concentrated. It is next mixed with water, and a solution of glue is added
                        so long as tannin continues to be precipitated. It is afterwards filtered,
                        evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in alcohol to get rid of any excess
                        of glue that may have been added. Finally, it is filtered and evaporated to
                        dryness. In this state it is the pure colouring matter.</p><p>It is soluble in water and alcohol, and the solutions never exhibit their
                        fine red colour till all acid which they may contain is neutralized. Aeids
                        render it yellow. Sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids give a dirty yellow.
                        With fluoric acid it becomes first yellow, and then greenish gray.
                        Phosphoric and citric acids give it a very fine yellow, which may be fixed
                        on woollen and silk. Sulphurous acid, sulphohydrogen, and boracic acid,
                        blacken and destroy the colour. The alkalies added in slight excess change
                        the colour to violet or blue; hence the infusion of Brazil wood is a
                        delicate re-agent for alkalies.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Colouring Matter of Logwood.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This colouring matter is obtained from the wood of the Haematoxylon
                        Campeehianum, a tree which grows in America, particularly round the Bay of
                        Campeachy. This colouring matter has a considerable resemblance to that of
                        Brazil wood. It may be obtained from logwood by the following process:</p><p>Digest the raspings of logwood in water of the temperature of about 125°,
                        evaporate the solution to dryness in a gentle heat, and treat the residue
                        with alcohol of the specific gravity of 0∙843. The colouring matter is
                        dissolved, but a brown residue remains, which, however, is not quite free
                        from colouring matter. Filter the solution, and distil off the alcohol, till
                        it is reduced to the state of a thin syrup. Mix this with a little water,
                        and leave it to spontaneous evaporation. A number of small crystals are
                        deposited. Decant off the mother ley, and wash these crystals with a little
                        alcohol. These crystals constitute the colouring matter of logwood to which
                        Chevreul has given the name of hematin.</p><p>Hematin has considerable lustre, and exhibits a play of colours, varying from
                        rose-red to yellow. When reduced to powder the colour is yellow. The taste
                        is slightly astringent, bitter, and acrid.</p><p>Boiling water dissolves it with facility, and acquires an orange-red colour,
                        which becomes yellow when the liquid cools; but heat again restores the
                        original colour. When this liquid is evaporated the hematin crystallizes.
                        The addition of an acid renders it first yellow and then red. Sulphurous
                        acid, however, gradually destroys the colouring matter if it be left long
                        enough in contact with it. Potash, soda, and ammonia give it a purplish-red
                        colour, and with a considerable excess of these alkalies the colour becomes
                        violet blue, then reddish brown, and finally yellowish brown. By this action
                        the hematin is destroyed, for the colour cannot be again restored. Barytes,
                        strontian, and lime water produce the same effect; but they gradually
                        precipitate hematin from its solution.</p><p>When a current of sulphohydrogen gas is passed through an aqueous solution of
                        hematin, it assumes a yellow colour, which disappears in the course of a few
                        days. The oxides of lead, tin, iron, copper, nickel, zinc, antimony, and
                        bismuth, unite with hematin, and give it a blue colour with a shade of
                        violet. Peroxide of tin acts on it as the mineral acids do. Glue throws it
                        down in reddish flocks.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Colouring Matter of Lichens.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> What the French call <hi rend="italic">orseille</hi> is a
                        preparation from the lichen roceella, and probably from other species. The
                        lichen is reduced to powder, and mixed with putrid urine, or still better
                        with ammonia distilled from it. By this process the whole is converted into
                        reddish-blue matter, which is employed in dyeing red. What is called in this
                        country <hi rend="italic">cudbear</hi> is prepared by a similar process from
                        the <hi rend="italic">lichen tartareus.</hi> The manufacture began in Leith
                        under the firm of Messrs M‘Intosh and Cuthbert Gordon, from the last of
                        whom, who had the management of the work, the dye-stuff was called <hi rend="italic">cudbear.</hi> It was transferred to Glasgow, where it is still
                        carried on by Charles MTntosh and Company. The ammonia employed was
                        originally procured from urine, but now it is obtained from the liquor which
                        conies over during the manufacture of coal gas. The process is the same as
                        for the manufacture of orseille, but the lichen employed is different.</p><p>There is a similar dye-stuff manufactured in Germany, under the name Persio.
                        Cudbear is a bluish-red powder, which does not readily dissolve in water. It
                        dissolves more readily in alcohol. The solution is red. In caustic ammonia
                        it dissolves with great readiness, and the solution is purple. When this
                        solution is spread on paper, and the paper allowed to dry, it becomes red.
                        The smallest portion of alkali applied to this paper renders it purple;
                        hence .cudbear is by far the most delicate, test of alkalies which we have
                        it in our power to apply.</p><p>In Holland there is a preparation of lichen made in small blue cakes, which
                        is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">laernus.</hi> In this country it
                        is called <hi rend="italic">litmus,</hi> and the aqueous solution of it is
                        called by the 1Tenelι <hi rend="italic">infusion of turnsole.</hi> This <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353308" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3308-0485"/>
                        solution is blue, but the smallest addition of an acid renders it red. It is
                        one of the most delicate tests of acids, and is usually employed by chemists
                        for that purpose.</p><p>Cudbear does not constitute a fast colour, though it is a beautiful one. It
                        is chiefly used as a ground on which other colours are to be applied. Thus
                        blue cloth is often dyed with it before the application of the indigo.
                        Cudbear is also employed generally in the dyeing of the red cloth employed
                        in this country for making coats to the common soldiers. There is a
                        manufacture of cudbear also in Liverpool.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Yellow Colouring Matters.</hi></p><p>These colouring matters are rather numerous, but they have scarcely drawn any
                        of the attention of chemists; we cannot, therefore, say much respecting
                        their chemical properties. We shall merely point out a few of them as
                        subjects deserving to be studied by future chemists.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Quercitron Bark.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This is
                        the bark of the quercus tinctoria and nigra, trees which grow in North
                        America. It was introduced as a dye stuff* by Bancroft in 1775. It contains
                        a yellow-colouring matter, seemingly nearly the same with what occurs in
                        other vegetables; but when impure, it has a greater tendency to pass into
                        brown than most other yellow dyes.</p><p>Heat seems prejudicial to this colouring matter, for the decoction does not
                        dye a good yellow. In this respect <hi rend="italic">wοαd</hi> has the
                        superiority. The method of using it is to make an infusion of the bark in
                        water at the temperature of80°. The bark being now removed, the liquid may
                        be heated to 200°, and at this temperature employed for dyeing without
                        inconvenience.</p><p>. Water dissolves the colouring matter of quercitron bark with facility, and
                        acquires a brownish-yellow colour. If the decoction be left exposed to the
                        air, a white precipitate falls, consisting of resinous matter. The acids
                        render the yellow colour brighter, unless they be too much concentrated,
                        when they destroy it altogether. The alkalies, on the other hand, deepen the
                        shade. Alumina put into the decoction of quercitron assumes a golden-yellow
                        colour. Oxide of tin assumes a still deeper shade of colour. If cotton
                        previously treated with silicate of potash be put into an infusion of
                        quercitron, it assumes a Nankin colour.</p><p>Alum thrown into the infusion of quercitron occasions a slight precipitate of
                        a deep-yellow colour. Cloth impregnated with nitrate of alumina acquires a
                        finer colour from quercitron than those impregnated with alum. With sulphate
                        of lime it gives a Nankin yellow, and with muriate of lime a buff colour,
                        which is preferable to that obtained by means of iron. With salts of iron
                        quercitron gives olive colours. The effects of various other salts have been
                        determined; but the colouring matter has not yet been obtained in a separate
                        state, nor its properties determined.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Woad.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Woad consists of the
                        stems and leaves of the reseda luteola, a plant which grows wild in this
                        country. When boiled in water, it gives a yellowish-brown decoction, which,
                        when much diluted, becomes greenish yellow. Acids render it lighter
                        coloured, and alkalies darker, while at the same time, if they have been
                        added in considerable quantity, a dark-yellow precipitate falls. Alum throws
                        down a fine yellow precipitate, and so does protochloride of tin.
                        Protosulphate of iron throws down a dark gray, and the sulphate of copper a
                        greenish-brown precipitate.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Turmeric,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Turmeric is the
                        root of the <hi rend="italic">curcuma lοnga,</hi> a plant which is a native
                        of India. It is very rich in a fine yellow-colouring matter, which, however,
                        is fugitive, and cannot be fixed by mordants. The colouring matter is not
                        given but readily to water, but abundantly to alcohol. Alkalies render this
                        colouring mattér reddish brown, and dissolve a portion of it. On this
                        account it is employed as a. re-agent for detecting the presence of alkaline
                        bodies; but it is not very delicate. Most acids render the yellow colour of
                        turmeric lighter, except the boracic, which renders it reddish brown, as the
                        alkalies do. The salts of uranium, of iron, and the supersalts of tin,
                        bismuth, and antimony, give it a brown colour. It is employed occasionally
                        by apothecaries to give a yellow colour to their draughts. It constitutes
                        also an ingredient in curry powder.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Saffron.</hi> —Saffron is composed of the stigmata of
                        the crocus sativus, a plant which is cultivated in England. It was examined
                        by Bouillon-la-Grange and Vogel in 1811, who extracted from it a colouring
                        matter, to which they <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> gave the name of <hi rend="italic">polychroite.</hi> This substance may be obtained by the
                        following process:</p><p>Digest saffron in water, and evaporate the infusion to the consistence of
                        honey. Digest this yellow residue in alcohol of 0∙800, filter the solution,
                        and distil off the alcohol. The yellow matter which remains is
                        polychroite.</p><p>Its colour is intensely yellow. When exposed to the air it absorbs moisture,
                        and becomes a viscid liquid. It is very soluble in water and alcohol, but
                        insoluble, or nearly so, in ether. When the aqueous solution is exposed to
                        the direct rays of the sun, it becomes colourless, and the yellow colour
                        cannot be restored. Sulphuric acid gives it a deep indigo-blüe colour, which
                        becomes gradually lilac. The same change is produced by sulphuric acid on
                        the alcoholic solution. Nitric acid causes these liquids to assume a green
                        colour. The addition of a little water causes the colour to disappear.
                        Sulphate of iron throws'down a dark-brown precipitate, lime water a yellow
                        precipitate, barytes water a red precipitate. Acetate of lead has no effect,
                        diacetate of lead throws down a yellow, and nitrate of mercury a red
                        precipitate. Polychroite is insoluble in oils. It seems to contain no azote
                        in its composition, if we are to judge from the products of its
                        distillation. ’</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Green Colouring Matters.</hi></p><p>From the universal prevalence of a green colour in the leaves of plants, one
                        would naturally expect a vast variety of green colouring matters in the
                        vegetable kingdom; ÿet there is not so much as a single vegetable substance
                        known capable of dyeing a green colour. The green colour of leaves resides
                        usually in a kind of resinous or waxy substance, which is not soluble in
                        water.</p><p>What is called <hi rend="italic">sap green,</hi> used as a water colour, is
                        obtained from the expressed juice of the berries of the rhamnus infectoria,
                        which is mixed with a little alum, and evaporated to an extract. Alkalies
                        change'this colour into yellow, and acids into red.</p><p>To dye green, the method is to give the cloth first a yellow colour, and then

                        cloth; but there is one of tĥèse so superior to all the rest, that it has
                        superseded them all, and is alone used by the dyers. That substance is <hi rend="italic">indigo.</hi></p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Indigo.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This valuable
                        pigment was known to the ancients. It is prepared from a variety of plants;
                        various species of indigofera, the arg <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> entea,
                        disperma, and tínċto-ria, and even others; the nerium tinctorium, marsdenia
                        tinctoria, ascleþias tingens, isatis tinctoria, &amp;c. The plants are cut
                        down with sickles, and laid in strata in the steeper, a large cistern
                        containing water. Here they' ferment, and the utmost attention is required
                        to the process. It goes on best at the temperature of 80°. The water soon
                        becomes opaque, and aśšumes a green colour, while gases are extricatéd. When
                        this fermentation has proceeded far <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353321" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3321-0486"/> enough,

                        blue flocculi are. allowed to subside. The water is drawn off, and the
                        pigment put to be drained in small linen bags; after which it is put into
                        little square boxes, and allowed to dry in the shade, , <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> if f <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>, r</p><p>Indigo, as it comes to this country, is a fine, light, friable substance, of
                        a deep-blue colour. Its texture is compact, and the tints on the,surface of
                        the lumps vary according to the mode of preparation; being copper, violet,
                        and blue. The,lightest indigo is considered as the best,‘but it always
                        contains more than half its weight of foreign matter, partly earthy, but
                        chiefly vegetable. ļ From the late experiments of Berzelius, it appears that
                        it contains at least four different vegetable substances, which he has
                        distinguished by the names of <hi rend="italic">indigo-gluten,</hi><hi rend="italic">indigo-brown, indigo-red, and imdigĢ-blue,</hi>--∙ <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>, &gt;ı, ’ t ĩ</p><p>1. Indigo-gluten is obtained when indigo in fine powder is digested with a
                        dilute acid. A yellow solution ⅛ obtained, but the water employed to wash
                        the undissolved indigo contains most of the gluten, as the acid compound of
                        it is much more soluble in water than in acid. If we employ dilute sulphuric
                        acid, we have only to saturate the acid with pulverized marble, filter, and
                        evaporate to dryness; the indigo-gluten (almost pure) remains. ' It may be
                        dissolved in alcohol, and the alcohol may be distilled off. The gluten
                        remains in the form of a translucent shining varnish. It is soluble in
                        water, and tastqs not unlike beef tea. When heated on platinum foil it
                        melts, and burns with flame, and leaves a very small quantity of white
                        ashes. When distilled it swells, and gives out a brown oil, and a water
                        strongly impregnated with ammonia. Its aqueous solution is precipitated by
                        the same substances which precipitate, gluten, namely, tannin, corrosive
                        sublimate, prussiate of potash, acetate of lead, and sulphated peroxide of
                        iron. These precipitates are white, or have a shade of yellow, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> An excess of acid prevents the precipitate by
                        tannin and .corrosive sublimate; but prussiate of potash does not occasion a
                        precipitate unless an excess of acid be present. It combines readily both
                        with acids and alkalies. Sulphuric acid dissolves it without becoming black.
                        Nitric acid makes it yellow; a fatty matter is formed, and a quantity of
                        oxalic acid. These properties make this substance approach to gluten; but it
                        is distinguished from gluten by its solubility in water, and by its wanting
                        the glutinous and adhesive qualities which distinguish gluten. From albumen
                        it is distinguished by its solubility in alcohol, and by its not coagulating
                        at a boiling temperature.</p><p>2. Indigo-brown constitutes a much greater proportion of common indigo than
                        the gluten. It is occasionally united in indigo with lime, from which it may
                        be separated by acids; occasionally it is combined with a vegetable acid.
                        Indigo-brown is dissolved when the indigo, previously treated with a dilute
                        acid, is mixed with a concentrated potash ley gently heated. The mass
                        becomes immediately black, and swells up to a loose magma, in proportion as
                        the alkali dissolves the indigo-brown. , The liquid passes with difficulty
                        through the filter, and is very dark and opaque, unless in very thin layers.
                        From this liquid acids throw down a blackish-brown matter in a half
                        gelatinous state. If the alkaline liquid be mixed with sulphuric acid till
                        it acquires a sour taste, and then filtered, indigo-brown remains in
                        the-filter. The.dark colour is owing to indigo-blue being held in solution.
                        It is exceedingly difficult to obtain the indigo-brown in a pure state. If
                        the precipitate with sulphuric acid be digested with newly precipitated
                        carbonate of barytes, the greater part of the acid is separated, but not the
                        whole. ,The liquid being evaporated, leaves a translucent, brown varnish,
                        which is not completely soluble in water, and the dissolved portion contains

                        very difficultly soluble in alcohol, and requires the solvent to be boiling
                        hot; and repeated portions of alcohol ought to be used in succession. The
                        alcohol at first acquires a dark-red colour; hut iţ at last becomes light
                        blue, showing that indigo-blue, is beginning to be taken up. ∣,The alcoholic
                        solution is,yery deep coloured. It is not precipitated by water. If the

                        in vacuo. It is now snow-white, and consists of very small needles. It is
                        insoluble in water, and destitute of taste and smell. It is soluble with
                        difficulty both in alcohol and ether. The solution is of a yellowish-brown
                        colour (perhaps from a mixture of indigored), and by spontaneous evaporation
                        gives very small translucent and colourless crystals. Sulphuric acid
                        dissolves it with difficulty, and assumes a fine lemon-yellow colour.
                        Concentrated muriatic acid unites with it, giving it a yellow colour, and
                        becoming itself yellow. Acetic acid dissolves a trace of it, but does not
                        acquire any colour. Dilute nitric acid converts it into ihdigo-red.
                        Concentrated nitric acid dissolves it with a purple colour, and decomposes
                        it. Dilute nitric acid is a very delicate test of it, assuming a red colour
                        when acted on by a very minute quantity of it. In alkalies it is insoluble
                        even when assisted by a boiling heat.</p><p>4. Indigo-blue, or the true colouring constituent of indigo, remains after
                        the indigo of commerce has been treated with alcohol, not however in a state
                        of purity, some of the preceding substances still remaining, and likewise
                        not unfrequently sand and gravel. To obtain the indigo pure, let it be
                        mixed, while still wet, with twice its weight of lime which had been slaked
                        just before mixing it with the indigo. Put this mixture into a flask capable
                        of holding about 150 times its weight of water. Fill the flask with boiling
                        water, and shake it well. To this add two thirds of the weight of the lime
                        of protosulphate of iron in the state of a fine powder, or just previously
                        dissolved in a little hot water; then cork the flask and shake it well. Let
                        it remain a couple of days in a warm place. By degrees the mixture becomes
                        green. The protoxide of iron, precipitated by the lime by little and little,
                        is converted into peroxide at the expense of the indigo. The indigo thus
                        deprived of a portion of its oxygen combines with the lime, and forms a
                        compound soluble in water. The consequence of this is, that the liquid
                        assumes a deep-yellow colour. Draw off the transparent liquid with a syphon,
                        and pour hot water on the residue, to dissolve out all the compound of
                        indigo and lime.</p><p>As soon as this yellow liquid is exposed to the air the indigo absorbs oxygen
                        from the atmosphere, becomes insoluble, and precipitates in the state of a
                        blue powder, which is pure indigo-blue. To prevent the foreign substances
                        which may be present from falling with the blue powder, the best way is to
                        pour the yellow indigo solution into water acidulated with muriatic acid.
                        This acid keeps the foreign substances in solution, and requires a yellow
                        colour. First wash the precipitated indigo with water till it becomes a fine
                        blue, then collect it on the filter, and wash it clean and allow it to
                        dry.</p><p>The colour has now a shade of purple, with somewhat of a metallic lustre
                        almost like copper. When pulverized it becomes again a fine blue. It is
                        destitute of smell and taste, and re-acts neither as an acid nor an alkali.
                        When gently heated on a platinum plate it gives out a fine purple vapour. If
                        the heat be suddenly increased, the indigo melts, boils, catches fire, and
                        burns with a clear flame, emitting much smoke, and leaving a charcoal which
                        burns with difficulty without leaving any residue. The purple smoke is a
                        gaseous substance, or rather vapour. If indigo be put into a retort, and the
                        retort, after being exhausted, be heated, it is filled with the vapour,
                        which on cooling deposits itself in dark purple plates; but by this process
                        a considerable portion of the indigo is destroyed.</p><p>Indigo is insoluble in water. Boiling alcohol assumes a blue colour when
                        digested on it, but generally loses its colour in a few hours, while a
                        little indigo is precipitated. It is insoluble in ether. Oil of turpentine,
                        when boiled on it, acquires a blue colour; and the fixed oils, when treated
                        in the same way, dissolve a portion, but the indigo is gradually decomposed.
                        The specific gravity of pure indigo is 1∙35. &gt;</p><p>Chlorine instantly destroys it, and gives it a yellow colour. Iodine has no
                        action on it in the wet way; but when mixed with it and heated the indigo is
                        decomposed. It cannot be combined with sulphur or phosphorus.</p><p>All bodies having a strong affinity for oxygen, and which are placed in
                        contact with indigo and lime, or on alkali,' at once absorb oxygen from the
                        indigo, and bring it to a state in which it combines with the alkaline body,
                        and becomes in that way soluble in water.</p><p>By sulphuric acid, especially the smoking variety, it is dissolved; but the
                        nature of the indigo is altered by the action of the acid. By nitric acid it
                        is decomposed with a strong effervescence, and either carbazotic acid or
                        indigotic acid maybe obtained, according to the way in which the acid is
                        applied.</p><p>Indigo has been subjected to a careful analysis by various chemists, by means
                        of black oxide of copper. The following little table exhibits the results of

                        the name of <hi rend="italic">reduced indigo.</hi> It will be proper to
                        describe its properties when in that state.</p><p>To prepare it, fill a flask with the yellow solution of reduced indigo and
                        lime, from the indigo vat prepared by i the process formerly described. Then
                        let fall into it a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid or acetic acid,
                        previously deprived of air by boiling, or by being kept in the vacuum of an
                        air-pump. The flask must now be well corked, and care taken that not a
                        particle of air remains in it. The acid occasions an abundant white, flocky
                        precipitate, which is reduced indigo. The purer the solution is, the more
                        difficultly does the precipitate fall to the bottom. When the matter has
                        been left twenty-four hours to collect at the bottom of the vessel, collect
                        the precipitate on the filter, and wash it with water which has been long
                        boiled and allowed to cool in a well-stoppered -bottle, till the uncombined
                        acid disappears. During this washing the colour darkens, but it does not
                        become blue, but acquires a grayish-green colour, especially on the surface.
                        Let the washed matter be pressed between folds of blotting paper, and then
                        dried in vacuo over sulphuric acid.</p><p>It is a grayish-white matter, having a silky lustre and some slight
                        appearance of crystallization. It has neither taste nor smell, and produces
                        no change on vegetable blues. It is insoluble in water. It is soluble both
                        in alcohol<pb break="no" facs="nls:193353347" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3347-0488"/> and ether, with a yellow colour. When the

                        precipitates.</p><p>It does not combine with diluted acids. Concentrated smoking sulphuric acid
                        dissolves it instantly with a dark purple colour. It combines very readily
                        with the saliform bases. It dissolves both in caustic alkalies and their
                        carbonates, and likewise in barytes, strontian, and lime, with a yellow
                        colour. The ammoniacal solutions are generally green, in consequence of a
                        little blue indigo which is dissolved along with the white portion. Whenever
                        thèse solutions are exposed to the air, the indigo becomes blue and is
                        precipitated.</p><p>Lime forms two distinct compounds with reduced indigo. The first is a
                        saturated solution of the indigo, known only in the liquid form, and having
                        a dark-yellow colour. The other has an excess of lime; it is insoluble, and
                        lemonyellow in colour. It falls to the bottom in consequence of the excess
                        of lime employed when indigo mixed with lime is reduced by means of sulphate
                        of iron; and as it is heavy, the gypsum and peroxide of iron may be washed
                        away. It is slightly soluble in water previously deprived of air, giving it
                        a slight shade of yellow. When exposed to the air it becomes first green and
                        then blue by the absorption of oxygen.</p><p>Reduced indigo even forms a soluble compound with magnesia, but it requires
                        more water to dissolve it than the compound with lime.</p><p>The other bases may be combined with reduced indigo, by putting the salts
                        containing them in a clear solution of reduced indigo as neutral as
                        possible, taking care that air be excluded. Alumina forms with it a white
                        compound, which instantly becomes blue when exposed to the air. The salts of
                        protoxide of iron, protoxide of tin, and protoxide of lead, give white
                        compounds with reduced indigo. Neutral sulphated peroxide of iron throws
                        down a darkbrown compound, which does not alter under the liquid so long as
                        all the reduced indigo is not thrown down. But if an excess of the salt be
                        employed, that excess is changed into a protosalt, and the precipitate
                        becomes blue. The salts of the protoxides of cobalt and manganese give green
                        precipitates. Nitrate of silver throws down a brown, and afterwards a black
                        precipitate, which is not altered by exposure to the air.</p><p>From the experiments that have been made upon reduced indigo, there is reason
                        for believing that it differs from blue indigo merely by containing one atom
                        less of oxygen.

                        a peculiar blue substance, to which Mr Crum, who first investigated its
                        nature, has given the name of <hi rend="italic">cerulm.</hi> When potash is
                        added to the acid solution previously diluted with water, a deep-blue
                        precipitate is formed. All the salts of potash are capable of precipitating
                        this blue matter from its solution. The precipitate consists of the cerulin
                        and the salt employed to throw it down. If we employ acetate of potash, we
                        may wash out this salt by means of alcohol, and leave the blue matter in a
                        state of purity. It is a compound of cerulin and sulphate of potash, and has
                        been called by Mr Crum <hi rend="italic">cerulio-sulphate of
                        potash.</hi></p><p>While moist it has so deep a blue colour, as to appear black. When dry it has

                        to it, it does not melt, nor do any purple fumes rise from it. When a

                        substance, it appears red. A single drop of nitrate or sulphate of copper
                        added to the liquid makes the candle appear blue. Zinc produces the same
                        effect, though not so powerfully. Mr Crum has shown that cerulin differs
                        from indigo merely by containing four atoms of water, or their elements,
                        united to one atom of indigo.

                        a new substance is produced, to which Mr Crum, who first obtained it, has
                        given the name of <hi rend="italic">phenicin.</hi> It may be obtained in the
                        following way:</p><p>Prepare a quantity of indigo by boiling it in sulphuric acid diluted with
                        thrice its weight of water. Then wash it well and dry it. Mix one part of
                        this purified indigo with seven or eight parts of concentrated sulphuric
                        acid in a stoppered phial, and agitate the mixture occasionally till it
                        becomes of a bottle-green colour. Then mix it with a large quantity of
                        distilled water, and throw it on a filter. By continuing to wash the filter
                        with distilled water, the liquid, which at first passed through colourless,
                        becomes more and more blue; and after some time all the indigo which has
                        been changed passes through blue. This blue liquid contains the phenicin in
                        solution. Add to it chloride of potassium, and the phenicin falls down in
                        the state of a fine reddish-purple colour, similar in appearance to the
                        vapour of sublimed indigo. Collect it on a filter, and wash it till the
                        liquid passing through gives a red precipitate with nitrate of silver. It
                        may then be dried.</p><p>When dry it has a brownish-black colour. Heated in a crucible, it gives out a
                        little vapour of indigo. When burnt it leaves about fifteen per cent, of
                        ashes, consisting of sulphate and muriate of potash. It dissolves both in
                        water and alcohol, and the solutions are blue; and it is precipitated of its
                        original colour by any soluble salt whatever. Acids do not prevent this
                        precipitation.</p><p>From the analysis of this substance by Mr Crum, it appears that it is a

                        Borneo and Sumatra. It is said to be obtained by distilling the wood along
                        with water in large iron pots, to which are fitted earthen heads stuffed
                        with straw. The camphor sublimes and concretes upon the straw in the form of
                        a gray powder. It is afterwards refined in Europe by a second
                        sublimation.</p><p>. Pure camphor is a solid substance, having a white colour, a peculiar
                        aromatic odour, and a strong, hot, and somewhat acrid taste. Its, specific
                        gravity is 0-9887. When slowly sublimed, or when a hot alcoholic solution is
                        left at rest, it crystallizes in octahedrons or in hexagonal plates. It is
                        soft enough to be squeezed flat between the fingers, but it,is somewhat
                        tough, and cannot be reduced to powder unless we add a little alcohol. It
                        un-ι dergoes no alteration when left exposed to the air.</p><p>When heated to 347° it melts into a transparent and colourless liquid. At
                        400° it boils. It sublimes completely without any decomposition whatever.
                        When mixed with six times its weight of clay, and distilled, it undergoes
                        decomposition, giving a yellow-coloured aromatic oil, with a little acid
                        water, in which a portion of the oil is dissolved. In the retort remains the
                        clay, mixed with charry matter. When the vapour of camphor is passed through
                        a red-hot porcelain tube, it is partly decomposed, furnishing a volatile
                        oil, which contains undecomposed camphor in solution, together with a
                        considerable quantity of inflammable gas, composed of carbon and hydrogen,
                        apparently in equal atomic proportions, and therefore constituting simple
                        carbo-hydrogen. Camphor, in the open air, burns with’a clear flame and much
                        smoke, and burns all away without leaving any residue.</p><p>Camphor is very little soluble in water, requiring about 1000 times its
                        weight of that liquid to dissolve it. Potash precipitates it from its
                        aqueous solution, but neither soda nor ammonia. It dissolves readily in
                        alcohol, 100 parts of alcohol of 0 ’ 806 dissolve 120 parts of camphor at
                        the temperature of 54°. The alcoholic solution is precipitated by water. The
                        alcohol may he distilled off, but it carries a portion of the camphor with
                        it. It is soluble also in ether, and in fixed and volatile oils. <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>.,</p><p>It may be fused with sulphur or phosphorus, and the fused mass is soluble in

                        alcohol be added to the solution, the alcohol takes up the whole camphor,
                        and leaves the combination of iodine and oil of turpentine undissolved. ..

                        them, and not acting on the other, which however is soluble in boiling
                        alcohol.</p><p>The chemical characters of resins are, that they are soluble in alcohol, but
                        insoluble in water; and that when heated they melt without any thing being
                        volatilized except by decomposition.</p><p>.They do not crystallize, but, like gums, are amorphous. They are usually
                        translucent, and have different shades of colour, most commonly brown,
                        though some of them are transparent, and almost colourless. Their specific
                        gravity varies from 0∙92 to 1∙2. In general they are heavier than <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353373" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3373-0490"/>
                        water. Their consistence varies considerably, some are hard, and break with
                        a vitreous fracture, and are easily pounded in a mortar; others are soft, or
                        almost liquid; but this generally proceeds from the presence of a volatile
                        oil. When rubbed they usually become negatively electric.</p><p>They are insoluble in water, but dissolve in alcohol, both cold and hot; but
                        their solubility varies very much. These solutions redden litmus paper, but
                        not syrup of violets. When they are mixed with water they become milky, and
                        the resin gradually falls to the bottom. They are soluble also in ether and
                        the volatile oils. They may also be dissolved in the fixed oils. By fusion
                        they may be combined with sulphur, and in some measure with phosphorus.
                        Chlorine frequently bleaches the powder of a coloured resin, and renders it
                        white. They dissolve readily in bisulphide of carbon.</p><p>For acids they have very little affinity. Concentrated sulphuric acid
                        dissolves them without decomposition. The solution is precipitated by water.
                        When it is heated sulphurous acid is evolved, and there remains a coaly
                        mass, mixed with some artificial tannin. Nitric acid dissolves them with the
                        assistance of heat. The solution at first is precipitated both by water and
                        alkali. If the action be continued some time longer, when the solution is
                        concentrated, a dark-yellow, tough substance is obtained, soluble both in
                        water and alcohol. At last there is formed a bitter-tasted, resinous powder,
                        together with some artificial tannin. Sometimes oxalic acid is formed, as
                        when nitric acid is made to act on guaiacum.</p><p>With alkalies and the salifiable bases in general the resins combine readily
                        and form salts, which, when the base is potash or soda, are soluble in
                        water. These combinations have been long known and considered as soaps; but
                        Unverdorben has recently shown that they are true salts, and that the resins
                        in them act the part of weak acids. When resin in excess is digested in a
                        concentrated solu» tion of potash, it is dissolved; and if the solution be
                        diluted with water and filtered, a neutral compound is obtained, the excess
                        of the resin being separated by the dilution. Pulverized resin left in
                        contact with ammoniacal gas over mercury, absorbs it, and forms a neutral
                        compound, sometimes soluble and sometimes insoluble in water. The alkaline
                        earths, in like manner, may be combined with resins, and they generally form
                        salts very little soluble in water, while the salts formed by the earths
                        proper, and the metallic oxides by means of double decomposition, are all
                        insoluble in water.</p><p>The resins have been analysed by different chemists, and shown to be
                        compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But it is not worth while to give
                        the numerical results, because we have no method of obtaining individual
                        resins in a state of purity. Of course our results cannot be
                        satisfactory.</p><p>Resins are of two kinds, liquid and solid. The liquid resins are in fact
                        combinations of resin with a volatile oil. They are usually called <hi rend="italic">balsams.</hi> The most important of these liquid resins
                        are,</p><p>1. Balsam of Capaiva, from the capaifera officinalis, a tree whiclι grows in
                        South America and some of the West India islands.</p><p>2. Opobalsamum, or balm of Gilead, from the amyris Gileadensis, a tree which
                        grows in Arabia, especially near Mecca.</p><p>3. Balsam of Peru, from the Myroxylon Peruiferum, a tree which grows in the

                        Resins.</hi></p><p>The substances called gum resins (because they are partially soluble both in
                        water and alcohoD, have long attracted the attention of apothecaries and
                        physicians, in consequence of the active properties which they possess. They
                        consist of the milky juices which exude from various plants, and which, when
                        left exposed to the air, gradually harden into solid matter. The milky juice
                        of the lactuca virosa, of leontodon taraxicum, of the chelidonium majus,
                        &amp;c. may be mentioned as examples. The chemical characters which these
                        gum resins have been observed to possess are the following:</p><p>They dissolve with difficulty and incompletely in water, and when the water
                        containing them is agitated or triturated in a mortar, a milky liquid is
                        formed, from which the undissolved portion precipitates very slowly.</p><p>Alcohol dissolves them also incompletely, leaving from one half to one fifth
                        of the gum resin undissolved; but the solution is transparent. Weak spirit
                        is the best solvent, because it is capable of taking up resin, gum,
                        extractive and saline matter, all at once.</p><p>They are soluble in dilute alkaline solutions, with the exception of any
                        portion of saline base which they may contain.</p><p>Acids act upon them nearly as upon resins. Sulphuric acid converts them into
                        a mixture of artificial tannin and charcoal. Nitric acts upon them with
                        energy, converting them first into a brittle mass, and then, with the
                        assistance of heat, dissolving them.</p><p>Their specific gravity is rather higher than that of the resins.</p><p>The gum resins may be divided into three classes, the <hi rend="italic">fetid,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">drastic,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">aromatic.</hi></p><p>I. <hi rend="italic">Fetid Gum Resins.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The

                        Caoutchouc.</hi></p><p>This valuable substance, which has of late years been employed so extensively
                        by Mr MTntosh to render cloth impervious to water, was first brought to this
                        country from South America about the beginning of the last century; and,
                        under the name of <hi rend="italic">Indian rubber,</hi> was employed to
                        efface the traces of black-lead pencils from paper. It exudes in a liquid
                        state from a considerable number of trees both in South America and India;
                        the hevoca caoutchouc and guianensis, the iatropha elastica, artocarpus
                        integri-folia, urceola elastica, smilax caduca, and a good many other
                        plants. When these plants are punctured, there exudes from them a milky
                        juice, which, when exposed to the air, gradually lets fall a concrete
                        substance, which is caoutchouc.</p><p>Caoutchouc, when pure, is of a white colour, and without either taste or
                        smell. The blackish colour of the common caoutchouc is owing to the method
                        of drying it. The usual way is to spread a thin coat of the milky juice upon
                        the mould, and then to dry it by exposing it to smoke; afterwards other
                        coats are spread out, which are dried in the same way.</p><p>It is soft and pliable like leather, and very elastic, so that it may be
                        forcibly stretched out .far beyond its natural length, and instantly
                        recovers its former bulk when the force is withdrawn. Its specific gravity
                        is 0∙9335. It is not altered by exposure to the air. It is insoluble in
                        water, but if boiled in water its edges become transparent, and so soft,
                        that when two of them are pressed together they adhere as closely as if they
                        formed one piece.</p><p>It is insoluble in alcohol, but soluble in ether. It dissolves also in
                        volatile oils and in coal naphtha; but to pro duce such a solution a
                        considerable interval of digestion is requisite. The caoutchouc is gradually
                        softened into a kind of jelly, which is afterwards dissolved in the naphtha.
                        It is by spreading several coatings of this naphtha solution between two
                        folds of cloth that the cloth of Mr M‘Intosh, which is impervious to water,
                        is made. The solution is laid on by machinery, the two plies of cloth are
                        laid upon each other, and then the whole is passed between a pair of
                        rollers. Finally, it is dried by exposure to the air in a dry place.</p><p>When caoutchouc is heated to 248° it begins to alter its appearance, and when
                        the temperature is increased it melts into the consistency of tar. When the
                        heat is withdrawn it still continues in this semifluid state. When still
                        farther heated it takes fire and burns with a strong flame, and diffuses a
                        fetid odour. In South America it is used instead of flambeaux.</p><p>Caoutchouc is not acted on nor dissolved in dilute acids. Even concentrated
                        sulphuric acid acts very imperfectly while cold, though the digestion be
                        continued for a considerable time. When heat is applied sulphurous acid is
                        disengaged, and the caoutchouc is reduced to the consistency of turpentine.
                        Water throws down from this liquid a resinous-looking substance, which
                        hardens when exposed to the air. Nitric acid renders it yellow, and when the
                        concentrated acid is assisted by heat, the caoutchouc is dissolved with a
                        dark-brown colour, and with the evolution of nitrous gas. Water, when poured
                        into the solution, throws down yellow flocks, which are soluble in alcohol,
                        acids, and alkalics, but not in volatile oils. Caoutchouc is insoluble in
                        alkaline leys, even when concentrated and boiling hot.</p><p>According to the analysis of Faraday, the constituents of caoutchouc are,</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>87∙2</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>12∙8</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>100∙0</p></cell></row></table><p>This corresponds nearly with</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>9 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙00</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>7∙75</p></cell></row></table><p>But as we are not acquainted with any definite compounds into which

                        scarlet <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353412" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3412-0493"/> colour. It has considerable consistency, and
                        an unctuous feel, as if it contained soap. Its specific gravity is about
                        1Ό527, but it varies somewhat in different animals, and even in the same
                        animal at different times.</p><p>When blood, after being drawn from an animal, is allowed to remain for some
                        time in a state of rest, it coagulates into a gelatinous-looking mass. This
                        mass gradually separates into two parts, one of which is fluid, and is
                        called <hi rend="italic">serum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other,
                        which is a tough, gelatinous-looking matter, is called the <hi rend="italic">crassamentum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">coagulum.</hi> The serum is greenish
                        yellow, but the coagulum is red. The proportions between the serum and
                        crassamentum are very various, according to the health or disease of the
                        animal. But it is difficult to determine the point with accuracy, because we
                        cannot free the crassamentum from all remains of serum. We may state the
                        scrum at 56, and the crassamentum (freed from scrum as much as possible by
                        blotting paper) at 44. But in the Asiatic or malignant cholera these
                        proportions are nearly reversed, the crassamentum constituting about sixty
                        of the blood, and the serum only about forty parts.</p><p>I. The serum or liquid portion of the blood has a light greenish-yellow
                        colour. It has the taste, smell, and feel of blood; though its consistence
                        is not so great. Its mean specific gravity is 1-0287. It gives a green
                        colour to syrup of violets; but Herman affirms that it reddens litmus, and
                        that, when it is mixed with some sulphuric acid and distilled, it gives out
                        a small quantity of acetic acid. If acetic acid be present, it must be in
                        combination with an alkali; for it has been ascertained by <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> many experiments that the serum of healthy blood
                        contains a small quantity of uncombined soda.</p><p>When serum is heated to the temperature of 159°, it coagulates precisely as
                        the white of an egg does, and for the same reason; it contains a notable
                        quantity of <hi rend="italic">albumen.</hi><hi rend="italic">Of
                        Albumen.</hi></p><p>Albumen, not in a state of absolute purity, but tolerably pure, may be
                        procured my mixing the fresh white of an egg with water, and, after the
                        portion which does not dissolve in the water has fallen to the bottom,
                        pouring off the clear solution. It consists of a solution of albumen in
                        water. No method of freeing it from <hi rend="italic">salivin,</hi> with
                        which it is always mixed in the white of an egg, has yet been
                        discovered.</p><p>. The aqueous solution of albumen is a viscid liquid, having but little
                        taste. It may be freed from water by evaporation at a low heat, and then the
                        albumen is left in the state of a translucent crust, having considerable
                        lustre. It may be employed to cement pieces of paper together. When the
                        aqueous solution of albumen (containing four parts water and one part
                        albumen) is heated to the temperature of 159°, the albumen coagulates, and
                        separates in white flocks, similar to the appearance of the white of a
                        boiled <hi rend="italic">egg.</hi> Alcohol and acids have the property of
                        coagulating albumen as well as heat, with the exception of acetic acid,
                        which is destitute of that property. There are some salts also which possess
                        the same property. The coagulation of albumen takes place in close vessels,
                        as well as in the open air.</p><p>When coagulated albumen is washed and dried, it forms a translucent, firm,
                        and somewhat elastic crust, having a yellow colour, and a good deal the
                        appearance of horn. When steeped in water, it resumes its former appearance,
                        but is no longer soluble in water, as it was before its coagulation.</p><p>When a solution of albumen in water ïs exposed to the action of galvanism,
                        the albumen coagulates round the negative wire; but when the galvanic
                        battery is very powerful, the albumen coagulates on both poles. Probably in
                        this case the coagulation is occasioned by the heat of the wires.</p><p>When coagulated albumen is put into water, and heated in a digester to a
                        temperature not lower than 390°, a solution of the albumen is obtained,
                        having a brownish-yellow colour, soluble both in water and alcohol, and
                        resembling osmazome in appearance. There remains undissolved a glue-like
                        matter, little soluble in water, and not at all in alcohol.</p><p>The solution of uncoagulated albumen in water soon putrifies, but coagulated
                        albumen is not so liable to undergo this alteration.</p><p>Albumen in solution in water is precipitated white by corrosive sublimate.
                        The infusion of nutgalls forms with it a yellowish precipitate, of the
                        consistence of pitch, and insoluble in water. But the infusion of nutgalls
                        is not a very delicate test of albumen, not being capable of detecting less
                        than <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> η⅛0th part of that substance when in
                        solution in water.</p><p>When into an aqueous solution of albumen a little acetic acid is added, and
                        then some prussiate of potash is dropt in, a white precipitate appears. This
                        is one of the most delicate tests of albumen that we have it in our power to
                        employ.</p><p>From the experiments of Hatchett, there is reason to believe that nitric acid
                        is capable of converting coagulated albumen into gelatine.</p><p>Albumen has been analysed by different chemists with considerable care. The

The crassamentum of the blood is scarlet coloured, containing all the
                        colouring particles. But it is difficult to free it completely from the
                        serum. This may be done as far as possible by placing it on bibulous paper,
                        till the paper refuses to imbibe any more moisture. It may now be considered
                        as consisting of <hi rend="italic">jibrm</hi> and <hi rend="italic">colouring matter.</hi> The latter of these is soluble in cold water, but
                        not the former. Hence we may obtain the fibrin by washing the erassamentum
                        in cold water till the red colour is removed.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Of Fibrin.</hi></p><p>Fibrin exists also in the muscles of animals, as well as in blood, and
                        constitutes the fibrous part of the muscle. Hence the origin of the term <hi rend="italic">fibrin.</hi></p><p>Fibrin, when pure, is brownish yellow, and has little or no taste or smell.
                        When newly extracted from blood it is soft and elastic, and resembles the
                        gluten of wheat. Its colour deepens very much in drying.</p><p>It is not altered by exposure to the air, nor is it speedily decomposed
                        though kept under water. It is insoluble in cold water. In boiling water it
                        curls up, and after the boiling has continued for some hours, the water
                        becomes opal-coloured, but no gas is evolved. When infusion of nutgalls is
                        dropt into the water, white flocks precipitate, which do not adhere
                        together, as the precipitate formed in solution of gelatine. The evaporated
                        liquid does not gelatinize, and leaves a white, dry, hard, friable residue,
                        soluble in cold water, and having a taste resembling that of fresh
                        broth.</p><p>Fibrin dissolves in acetic acid; and when the solution of prussiate of potash
                        is dropt into the solution, a white precipitate falls, as is the ease with
                        the solution of albumen in the same acid; but fibrin, by long boiling in
                        water, loses its property of softening and dissolving in acetic acid.</p><p>In alcohol of the specific gravity 0∙81, fibrin undergoes a species of
                        decomposition, and forms an adipoeirous substance, soluble in alcohol, and
                        precipitated by the addition of water. It has often an unpleasant odour. The
                        alcohol solution, when evaporated, leaves a fatty residue. Fibrin, after
                        being heated in alcohol, continues soluble in acetic acid. Ether acts on
                        fibrin in the same way as alcohol does.</p><p>In weak muriatic acid fibrin shrinks, and gives out a small quantity of
                        azotie gas; but scarcely any portion is dissolved, even by boiling, nor does
                        the acid liquid afford any precipitate with ammonia or prussiate of potash.
                        The fibrin thus treated is hard and shrivelled. When repeatedly washed with
                        water, it is at last converted into a gelatinous mass, which is soluble in
                        water. It is a compound of fibrin and muriatic acid.</p><p>Concentrated sulphuric acid decomposes and earbonizes fibrin. This acid, when
                        diluted with six times its weight of water, acquires a red colour if
                        digested in fibrin, but dissolves scarcely any thing. The fibrin combines
                        with sulphuric acid; and when it is deprived of the excess of acid by
                        washing it with water, the compound becomes capable of being dissolved in
                        water.</p><p>Nitric acid of the specific gravity of 1∙25, digested in fibrin, renders it
                        yellow, and diminishes its cohesion. The fluid becomes yellow, and the
                        surface of the fibrin is covered with a small quantity of fat formed by the
                        action of the acid. During this process pure azotie gas is disengaged. After
                        twenty-four hours digestion the fibrin is converted into a pulverulent mass
                        of a yellow colour. By washing it becomes orange. It is a compound of fibrin
                        and nitric acid.</p><p>In caustie alkalies fibrin increases in bulk, becomes transparent and
                        gelatinous, and at length is completely dissolved. The solution is yellow,
                        with a shade of green. Aeids occasion in it a precipitate, which gradually
                        becomes confluent. Alcohol occasions a precipitate in it. No soap is
                        formed.</p><p>When fibrin is exposed to heat it contracts suddenly, and moves like a bit of
                        horn, exhaling at the same time the smell of burning feathers. In a strong
                        heat it melts. When exposed to destructive distillation it yields water,
                        carbonate of ammonia, a heavy, fetid oil, traces of acetic acid and heavy
                        inflammable air, and it leaves a quantity of charry matter.</p><p>Fibrin has been subjected to analysis in order to determine its constituents.

                        colouring matter in the state of a dark-red powder, not, however, quite free
                        from albumen.</p><p>Its colour is a dark-reddish brown. It is soluble in water, provided it has
                        been obtained by a very low heat; but if we boil the water, the colouring
                        matter is deprived of its solubility altogether.</p><p>Its properties (if we except its colour) are very nearly the same as those of
                        albumen and fibrin. It combines with acids like these bodies, and forms
                        compounds, which are soluble in water. Alkalies dissolve it, and the
                        solution has a purple colour. The alkaline solution is precipitated by
                        alcohol, which, however, acquires a red tinge.</p><p>There is a considerable difference in the properties of this substance, as
                        described by different chemists. The colouring matter of blood, as described
                        by Brande, is quite different from that of Berzelius; while the character
                        assigned it by L. Gmelin differs from those of the other two chemists. It is
                        evident from this that colouring matter in a state of complete purity has
                        not yet been subjected to . examination. That of Berzelius was obviously
                        mixed with a great deal of albumen.</p><pb break="no" facs="nls:193353438" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3438-0495"/><p>When the colouring matter of blood is incinerated, the ashes are found to
                        contain half their weight of red oxide of iron; yet no iron can be detected
                        before the incineration. To the presence of this iron the red colour of the
                        globules has been ascribed by some chemists; but this opinion does not seem
                        to be well grounded. If the iron existed in blood in the state of red oxide,
                        its presence would certainly be detected by re-ågents. The impossibility of
                        detecting it would seem to show that it exists in blood in the metallic
                        state.</p><p>The colouring matter in the crassamentum is about twice as heavy as the
                        fibrin.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP</hi>. II.—OF SALIVA.</p><p>This fluid is secreted by a set of glands which discharge it through ducts
                        into the mouth. Its quantity is considerable, though it would be difficult
                        to determine it with precision. It is transparent and colourless, but has a
                        good deal of viscidity, and is destitute of taste and smell. Its mean
                        specific gravity is about 1Ό038. When agitated it froths like all other
                        adhesive liquids. W'hen mixed with water, a few flocks of mucus precipitate.
                        It was merely suspended in the saliva, and not dissolved. When saliva is
                        evaporated it swells greatly, and leaves behind it a thin brown-coloured
                        crust; but if the evaporation be conducted slowly, small cubic crystals of
                        common salt are deposited. Saliva contains dissolved in it a peculiar animal
                        principle, which we may distinguish by the name of <hi rend="italic">salivin.</hi> It contains also a small quantity of soda and of salts of
                        soda. The following table exhibits the constituents in a thousand parts of

                        likewise in some other animal substances. It may be obtained from saliva by
                        the following process: After freeing saliva from mucus, evaporate it to
                        dryness by a gentle heat. Digest the residual matter in rectified spirits,
                        to dissolve the salts. What remains is to be dissolved in water. By
                        evaporating the solution to dryness, salivin remains in a state of tolerable
                        purity.</p><p>Salivin is thus obtained in a translucent light-yellowcoloured crust. It
                        dissolves readily in water, and when the solution is heated and
                        concentrated, no coagulation takes place. If the salivin has been dried in
                        too high a temperature it loses its solubility in water. Salivin is
                        insoluble in alcohol. It is not precipitated from water by the infusion of
                        nutgalls. Lime-water, chloride of tin, the nitrate or acetate of lead, and
                        nitrate of mercury, occasion precipitates, when dropt into the aqueous
                        solution of salivin.</p><p>In the small intestines of the horse (when the animal is kept fasting for
                        thirty or thirty-six hours before death), there is occasionally found a
                        light-yellow, transparent, and glutinous liquid, which dissolves in cold
                        water. The solution is light yellow, transparent, slightly glutinous, may be
                        passed through the filter, and possesses the following characters: It is not
                        altered or precipitated by a boiling heat, by iodine, chlorine, muriatic
                        acid, nitric acid, or alcohol. It is precipitated by barytes water,
                        lime-water, alum, green vitriol, perchloride of iron, sulphate of copper,
                        protochloride of tin, acetate of lead, nitrate of mercury, nitrate of
                        silver, and chloride of platinum. Corrosive sublimate and tincture of
                        nutgalls render it muddy, but not immediately. Acetic acid gradually throw’s
                        down from it large white flocks. This liquid consists of a solution of a
                        peculiar substance, which has a strong analogy to salivin.</p><p>The salivin, and mucus of the saliva, constitute in a great measure the <hi rend="italic">tartar of</hi> the teeth. To these two substances, however (if

III.—OF THE PANCREATIC JUICE.</p><p>The pancreas is a gland of considerable size, situated in the abdomen, from
                        which passes a duct which terminates in the duodenum, sometimes separately
                        and sometimes in common with the bile duct. It secretes a liquid which is
                        deposited in the duodenum, where it is mixed with the chyme, and is
                        obviously intended to assist in the digestion of the food. From the
                        situation of the pancreas, it is very difficult to obtain the liquid which
                        it secretes, and which is usually called the pancreatic juice. It was
                        considered as analogous to, if not the very same with, saliva. Francis de le
                        Boé first affirmed that it is acid; and in 1664, R. de Graaf, a disciple and
                        partizan of De lc Boé, collected the pancreatic juice of a dog, and found it
                        limpid and slightly viscid. It was sometimes acid and sometimes only saline
                        in its taste. A controversy took place soon after respecting the nature of
                        this juice, one party affirming it to be acid, and another party to be
                        alkaline. It is only within these few years that we have acquired definite
                        ideas respecting the nature of this liquid, in consequence of the chemical
                        analysis of it by Tiedemann and L. Gmelin. They collected it from dogs,
                        sheep, and horses.</p><p>The pancreatic juice from the dog was at first muddy and slightly reddish;
                        but after flowing for some time, it became quite limpid, with an opaline
                        tinge inclining slightly to bluish white. It was viscid, like the white of
                        an egg diluted with water. Its taste was weakly but sensibly saline. In
                        about four hours 154 grains of the liquid were collected.</p><p>The pancreatic juice of the horse was of a very pale-yellow colour and
                        limpid, excepting a very slight opaline tinge. It was viscid, like the white
                        of an egg diluted with water. It very slightly reddened paper tinged blue by
                        litmus. In the dog and the sheep the first portion of the pancreatic juice
                        collected was acid. It afterwards became alkaline.</p><p>The pancreatic juice of the dog was found to contain an alkaline carbonate
                        and acetate, an animal matter thrown down by the infusion of nutgalls and
                        many other re-actives, and which was considered as <hi rend="italic">osmazome,</hi> and another matter reddened by chlorine, which is peculiar
                        to the pancreatic juice, and may therefore be called <hi rend="italic">pancreat'm.</hi></p><p>A hundred parts of pancreatic juice from a dog being evaporated to dryness,
                        left 8∙72 of a residue. It was brittle and elastic, of an orange colour, and
                        semitransparent. When a hundred parts of this solid residue was incinerated,
                        the ashes left weighed 8∙28 parts. A hundred parts of the solid portion of

                        nature from saliva.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP</hi>. IV.—OF BILE.</p><p>Bile is a liquid of a yellowish-green colour, an unctuous feel, bitter taste,
                        and peculiar smell, which is secreted by the liver; and in most animals
                        considerable quantities of it are usually found collected in the
                        gall-bladder. The bile of the ox has been chiefly examined by chemists,
                        being most easily procured.</p><p>Its colour is usually greenish yellow, but sometimes green. Its taste is
                        bitter, but at the same time leaving an impression of sweetness. Its smell
                        is feeble, but peculiar and disagreeable. It does not act on vegetable
                        blues. Its consistence varies a good deal, being sometimes a very thin
                        mucilage, sometimes very viscid and glutinous; sometimes it is transparent,
                        but generally contains a yellowcoloured matter, which precipitates when the
                        bile is diluted with water. Its specific gravity is about 1 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 027. When agitated, it lathers like a soap.</p><p>It mixes readily with water in any proportion; but it refuses to unite with
                        oil. Yet it dissolves soap, and is often employed to free cloth from greasy
                        stains.</p><p>When an acid is added to bile, even in a minute quantity, it acquires the
                        property of reddening vegetable blues. The addition of a little more acid
                        occasions a precipitate, and sulphuric acid occasions a greater precipitate
                        than any other acid. This precipitate consists of a yellow matter, which is
                        insoluble in water. If we continue to add sulphuric acid after the yellow
                        matter has been precipitated, a green matter falls down, formerly
                        denominated the resin of bile. It is a compound of <hi rend="italic">picromel</hi> (or the peculiar matter of bile), and of the precipitating
                        acid.</p><p>The following table exhibits the constituents of 1000 parts of ox bile,

                        obtained by the following process: Drop a little sulphuric acid into bile,
                        in order to separate the yellow matter which it may contain. Separate the
                        fluid part from the precipitate, then add fresh sulphuric acid as long as
                        any precipitate appears. This precipitate has a green colour, and is what
                        chemists have been in the habit of distinguishing by the name of <hi rend="italic">resin of bile.</hi> Wash it with water, and then digest it
                        with carbonate of barytes and water for some time. The barytes will combine
                        with the sulphuric acid, while the picromel will dissolve in the water.
                        Evaporate the aqueous solution to dryness by a gentle heat. Pure picromel
                        remains behind.</p><p>Picromel resembles entirely inspissated bile. It has a green, or rather
                        yellowish-green colour, and a bitter taste, followed by an impression of
                        sweetness. It is soluble in water and in alcohol, in all proportions. Ether
                        does not dissolve it, but converts it into an adipocirous substance, having
                        a very disagreeable smell.</p><p>It has the property of combining with acids, and of forming compounds soluble
                        when neutral, but insoluble, or only sparingly soluble, when there is an
                        excess of acid. It unites also with many metallic oxides, constituting with
                        them a pulverulent mass.</p><p>It is not precipitated by infusion of nutgalls, but nitrated suboxide of
                        mercury, diacetate of lead, and the salts of iron, occasion a precipitate

                        green, sometimes yellowish brown, sometimes nearly colourless. Its taste is
                        not very bitter. It generally contains some yellow matter suspended in it.
                        When evaporated to dryness, it leaves a brown matter, amounting to about one
                        eleventh of its weight. When this matter is calcined, it yields all the
                        salts to be found in ox bile. All the acids decompose human bile, and throw
                        down a copious precipitate, consisting of albumen and picromel. One part of
                        nitric acid is capable of saturating 100 parts of bile. The acetate of lead
                        throws down the picromel, and leaves a yellowish liquid, containing the
                        salts of bile, and a small quantity of a peculiar matter, the nature of

                        these foreign bodjes. Thus the nostrils and the trachaea, through which air
                        is continually passing during the continuance of life, is supplied with a
                        matter to defend therħ, usually called the <hi rend="italic">mucus</hi> of
                        the nose and trachaea. In like manner the ureters, the bladder, and urethra,
                        are covered with mucus, to protect them from the action of the urine. The
                        mouth, oesophagus, stomach, and intestines, are also covered with mucus, to
                        protect them from the injury which they might sustain from the food. To
                        these semifluid substances the common term <hi rend="italic">mucus</hi> has
                        been applied, though they are far from agreeing exactly in their chemical
                        constitution; and the membranes which throw out this substance are
                        distinguished by anatomists by the name of mucous membranes.</p><p>The animal matter peculiar to mucus is the same in all cases, and has the
                        following properties. It is insoluble in water, but is able to imbibe so
                        much of that liquid as to become more or less transparent, and semifluid, or
                        <hi rend="italic">glairy</hi> as it is termed. If in this state it be laid
                        on bloating paper, and the paper be changed as it becomes wet, the mucus may
                        be deprived of the greater part of the moisture which it had absorbed, and
                        will then have lost most of its peculiar properties. Mucus is not coagulable
                        by boiling; it becomes transparent when dry, and generally resumes its
                        mucous character on adding fresh water; but there is a great difference in
                        this respect in the mucus from different parts of the body.</p><p>The liquid part of mucus, or that fluid which the proper mucous matter
                        imbibes, and to which it owes its fluidity, is the same thing as the <hi rend="italic">serosity,</hi> or the liquid which oozes out of coagulated

                        matter. The peculiar animal matter seems at first to be held in solution by
                        the soda, and to be precipitated as the alkali becomes carbonated.</p><p>The proper mucous matter of the nose has the following properties. When
                        immersed in water it imbibes so much moisture as to become transparent,
                        excepting a few particles that remain opaque. It may then be separated by
                        the filter from the rest of the water, and may be further dried on bloating
                        paper, till it has again lost nearly all the water it had imbibed. It may be
                        made to imbibe water, and dried alternately as often as you please; but the
                        mucous matter gradually becomes yellow, and assumes a resemblance to pus.
                        Five parts of recent mucus imbibe ninety-five parts of water, and form a
                        glairy mass, so thick that it cannot be poured from one vessel to another.
                        When this mucus is boiled with water, it doeá not become horny, nor does it
                        coagulate. It is broken in pieces, but collects again unaltered at the
                        bottom of the vessel, when the boiling is finished. But we must, to obtain
                        this result, separate, in the first place, a little albumen which it
                        contains, by means of cold water.</p><p>It is soluble in dilute sulphuric acid. Concentrated sulphuric acid chars it
                        Nitric acid at first coagulates it; by continuing the digestion it softens,
                        and is finally dissolved into a clear yellow liquid. Acetic acid hardens
                        mucous matter, but does not dissolve it even at a boiling temperature.
                        Caustic alkali at first renders mucous matter more viscid, and afterwards
                        dissolves it into a limpid liquid. Tannin coagulates mucus, both when
                        softened by the absorption of water, and when dissolved either in an acid or
                        an alkali.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Mucus of the Trachaea.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                        mucus of the trachaea is exactly similar to that of the nose. The bluish or
                        darkcoloured flocculi expectorated in the morning will imbibe twenty times
                        their bulk of water, and become so transparent as hardly to be visible. The
                        action of acids and alkalies is the same on it as on nasal mucus.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Mucus of the Gall-Bladder.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                        The mucus of the gallbladder much resembles that of the nostrils, but is
                        more transparent, and always tinged yellow by the bile. When dried it may be
                        again softened in water, but loses part of its mucous property. Biliary
                        mucus dissolves in alkali, and its fluidity increases in proportion to the
                        quantity of the alkali. When the alkaline solution is exactly neutralized
                        with an acid, the mixture becomes slightly turbid, and may be drawn out into
                        threads. All the acids produce with biliary mucus a yellowish coagulum,
                        which reddens litmus. The coagulum formed with the sulphuric acid may be
                        restored to its mucous properties by exact saturation with an alkali.
                        Alcohol coagulates this mucus into a very yellow granular mass, to which the
                        mucous property cannot be restored. It is this mucus of the gallbladder
                        which chemists formerly mistook for albumen.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Mucus of the Intestines.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                        This mucus accompanies the excrements, in which it often forms long and
                        transparent filaments. When once dried, the addition of water will not
                        restore its mucous property. Alkalics produce this effect, but without
                        rendering it transparent.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Mucus of the Urinary Passages.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> It accompanies the urine, in which it is partly dissolved, and
                        partly suspended mechanically. This last portion is generally too
                        transparent to be distinguished by the eye; but it may be exhibited by
                        leaving the urine for some timeat rest, decanting off the fluid part, and
                        collecting the mucus on a filter. It loses its mucous property totally when
                        dried. It then often becomes rose-coloured, and appears as if crystallized.
                        It softens a little in water. The urinary mucus dissolves readily in
                        alkalies, and is not separated from this solution by acids. Tannin separates
                        it in white flocculi.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP.</hi> VI.—OF THE FLUIDS OF THE SEROUS

                        evaporation a coagulated mass collects. This matter seems to be albumen, but
                        it has a sulphur-yellow colour. The following is the result of the analysis

                        has some resemblance to coagulated albumen. It is a white solid, and when
                        freed from moisture has a good deal of brittleness.. It is precipitated from
                        milk by acids, and the precipitate consists of casein, combined with the
                        acid employed to throw it down. If we employ sulphuric acid to throw it
                        down, and, after washing it well with water, digest it with carbonate of
                        barytes and water, the sulphuric acid separates, while the casein dissolves
                        in the water. The aqueous solution thus obtained is yellowish, and resembles
                        a solution of gum. When evaporated to dryness it leaves a yellow matter,
                        which is the pure curdy part of milk, or <hi rend="italic">casein</hi> as it
                        was called by Proust.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Of Casern.</hi></p><p>Casein thus obtained dissolves readily in water. The solution, when boiled in
                        an open vessel, becomes covered with a white pellicle, precisely as milk
                        does, and acquires the smell of boiled milk. The pellicle is almost
                        insoluble in water, and appears to be a product of the action of air on the
                        dissolved casein.</p><p>With the mineral acids casein forms similar combinations with those that
                        fibrin and albumen form with the same acids. A great excess of acetic acid
                        is required in order to dissolve casein; and the neutral combination of
                        acetic acid and casein appears to be insoluble. Casein is easily dissolved
                        in alkalies. Its solution in acetic apid, as well as in ammonia, becomes
                        covered with a small quantity of cream every time that the casein has not
                        been well separated from the butter. Alcohol converts casein into an
                        adipocirous and fetid substance.</p><p>When casein has been precipitated from milk by alcohol, and the casein thus
                        obtained is put into an aqueous solution of ammonia, it first swells into a
                        glutinous matter; and when an additional quantity of water is added, it
                        dissolves completely. Milk is coagulated by tannin.</p><p>Casein has been subjected to an analysis by Gay-Lus- <hi rend="superscript">

                        contains a great deal of whey, and a considerable proportion of casein. A

It is easily
                        decomposed by agitation, absorbing oxygen, and the butter separating. By
                        this process of churning the milk becomes more acid than it was at
                        first.</p><p>Butter is of a yellow colour, possesses the properties <hi rend="italic">of</hi> an oil, and mixes readily with fixed oily bodies. When heated to
                        the temperature of 96°, it melts, and becomes transparent. When kept melted
                        for some time, some curd and whey separates, and it assumes exactly the
                        appearance of an oil. Butter possesses nearly the same properties as marrow.
                        When treated with an alkali it is converted into butyric acid, the
                        characters of which have been given in a preceding part of this article.</p><p>Milk freed from butter and casein is known by the name of whey. It is a thin
                        pellucid fluid, of a yellowish-green colour, and pleasant sweetish taste, in
                        which the flavour of milk may be distinguished. When boiled, an additional
                        portion of casein separates from it. After this separation it is almost
                        colourless, but has still a sweetish and agreeable taste. If it be slowly
                        evaporated, it deposits at last a number of white crystals, which constitute

                        times its weight of water, and in two and a half times its weight of boiling
                        water. By itself it is insoluble in alcohol; but the addition of a little
                        sulphuric acid renders it soluble in that liquid. When heated it emits the
                        odour of caramel, and when burnt exhibits the same phenomena as common sugar
                        does. When distilled it yields similar products with common sugar. It

When left at rest a
                        cream collects on its surface, which is more abundant and whiter coloured
                        than the cream of cow’s milk. The milk deprived of cream is much thinner,
                        and is rather a whey with a bluish-white colour than milk. It cannot be
                        coagulated by the ordinary methods; yet it contains casein, for when boiled
                        a pellicle collects on the surface, like what forms when the milk of the cow
                        is boiled. No butter can be procured from human milk by churning. What
                        separates by rest is rather casein than butter. Thus human milk differs from
                        that of the cow by containing less casein, by its oily constituent being so
                        intimately combined with the casein that they cannot be separated by
                        agitation, and by containing rather a greater quantity of sugar of milk.</p><p>Ass’s milk has a great resemblance to human milk. It has nearly the same
                        colour, smell, and consistence. When left at rest for some time a cream
                        forms on the surface, but by no means so abundant as on human milk. This
                        cream by long agitation yields a butter, which is always soft, white, and
                        tasteless, and, what is singular, very readily mixes again with the
                        butter-milk; but it may be again separated by agitation, while the vessel
                        which contains it is plunged in cold water. Skimmed ass’s milk is thin, and
                        has an agreeable sweetish taste. Alcohol and acids separate from it a little
                        curd, which has but a small degree of consistence. The serum yields sugar of
                        milk and chloride of calcium.</p><p>Goat’s milk, if we except its consistence, which is greater, does not differ
                        much from cow’s milk. Like that milk, it throws up abundance of cream, from
                        which butter is easily obtained. The skimmed milk coagulates just as cow’s
                        milk, and yields a greater quantity of curd. Its whey contains sugar of
                        milk, chloride of calcium, and common salt.</p><p>Ewe’s milk resembles very closely that of the cow. Its cream is rather more
                        abundant, and yields a butter which has less consistency than that from
                        cow’s milk. Its curd has a fat and viscid appearance, and is not easily made
                        to assume the consistence of that from cow’s milk. It makes excellent
                        cheese.</p><p>Mare’s milk is thinner than that of the cow, but scarcely so thin as human
                        milk. Its cream cannot be converted into butter by agitation. The skimmed
                        milk coagulates precisely as cow’s milk, but the curd is not so abundant.
                        The serum contains sugar of milk, sulphate of lime, and chloride of
                        calcium.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP</hi>. VIII.—OF URINE.</p><p>Healthy urine is a transparent liquid, of a light amber colour, and an
                        aromatic odour resembling that of violets. Its specific gravity varies a
                        great deal, but most commonly it is between 1Ό15 and 1∙020. Hysterical urine
                        is sometimes as low as 1∙005, and diabetes urine is frequently as high as
                        1*048. When it cools the aromatic smell leaves it, and is succeeded by
                        another, well known under the name of <hi rend="italic">urinous.</hi> This
                        smell gradually disappears, and a fetid ammoniacal odour replaces it.</p><p>Urine reddens delicate vegetable blues, and therefore contains a disengaged
                        or imperfectly saturated acid. This acid was at first considered as the
                        phosphoric. Berzelius endeavoured to show that it was the lactic. Dr Prout
                        has shown that urate of ammonia reddens vegetable blues, and that uric acid
                        is so insoluble in water, that the quantity of it in urine could not exist
                        in solution unless it were united with something which increased its
                        solubility. Hence he infers that urinc contains urate of ammonia, dan that
                        this salt produces the observed change on vegetable blues.</p><p>When ammonia is dropt into recent urine, a very minute quantity of phosphate
                        of lime falls down in the state of a white sediment. Now phosphate of lime
                        being insoluble in water, but biphosphate being slightly soluble in that
                        liquid, the probability is, that in urine it exists in the state of
                        biphosphate. Now, as biphosphate of lime reddens vegetable blues, this salt
                        doubtless contributes to the effect which urine has on litmus or red
                        cabbage.</p><p>If healthy urine be left standing for some time in cylindrical glass vessels,
                        small four-sided rectangular prisms are found deposited in small numbers on
                        the sides of the vessel. These consist of ammonia-phosphate of magnesia.
                        From this it would appear that urine contains a small quantity of
                        biphosphate of magnesia.</p><p>If urine be acidulated with nitric acid, to prevent the precipitation of the
                        phosphates of lime and magnesia, and a quantity of chloride of barium be
                        introduced into it, a precipitate of sulphate of barytes falls down. Hence
                        it <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353503" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3503-0500"/> appears that urine contains sulphuric acid.
                        This acid is partly combined with potash and partly with soda.</p><p>When healthy urine is allowed to cool, small red needles make their
                        appearance in it, sometimes swimming on the surface of the liquid, and
                        sometimes deposited upon the vessel containing it. These needles consist of
                        uric acid, coloured by being united with the colouring matter of urine.</p><p>If we concentrate healthy urine by a low heat, and then mix it with some
                        nitric acid, and set it aside for twenty-four hours, a number of
                        brown-coloured plates are deposited, having a silky lustre. These consist of
                        urea combined with nitric acid. They may be deprived of their colouring
                        matter by dissolving them in water and agitating them with ivory-black.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Care must be taken that
                        the ivory black contains no carbonate of lime, otherwise the nitrate of urea
                        will be decomposed.</p></note> If we now add as much potash as will just
                        saturate the nitric acid, nitre will be formed and deposited, and the urea
                        will dissolve in the water. By evaporating the solution, the urea is
                        deposited in beautiful white plates or prisms.</p><p>Besides these constituents, urine contains common salt, phosphate of soda,
                        and phosphate of ammonia. When the liquid is sufficiently concentrated,
                        these two last salts unite together and form a double salt,
                        ammonia-phosphate of soda. This salt, when first extracted from urine, drew
                        much attention, and was known by the name of <hi rend="italic">microcos-mic
                        salt.</hi></p><p>Urine is said also to contain a small quantity of sal ammoniac. Urine is
                        sometimes precipitated by infusion of nutgalls, and therefore must contain
                        albumen. But this usually happens only in the urine of dropsical patients.
                        When such urine is in the first place mixed with acetic acid, it gives a
                        copious white precipitate with prussiate of potash.</p><p>The following table exhibits the constituents of 1000 parts of healthy urine,

Evaporate
                        the urine to one fourth of its bulk, and mix it with about one third of its
                        weight of nitric acid of the specific gravity 1∙4, and set it aside for
                        twenty-four hours. Many silky plates of nitrate of urea are deposited. Dry
                        them on blotting paper, dissolve them in water, and add as much potash as is
                        requisite to saturate the nitric acid which they contain. Concentrate the
                        solution, and set it aside. Crystals of saltpetre are deposited. Separate
                        these crystals, concentrate the residual liquid, and digest it in alcohol.
                        The alcohol dissolves the urea and colouring matter of urine, but leaves the
                        nitre. Evaporate the alcoholic solution to dryness, dissolve the residue in
                        water, and agitate the solution in a phial with some good ivory-black. The
                        ivory black separates the colouring matter, and the liquid after filtration
                        is a pure colourless solution of urea. By careful evaporation it is
                        deposited in beautiful white and semi-transparent foursided prisms.</p><p>Urea has little or no smell. Its taste is strong and acrid, resembling that
                        of the ammoniacal salts. When exposed to the air it attracts moisture, and
                        is converted into a thick liquid. It is exceedingly soluble in water, and
                        during its solution considerable cold is produced. Alcohol dissolves it with
                        facility, and the alcoholic solution yields crystals much more easily than
                        the aqueous.</p><p>When nitric acid is dropt into a concentrated solution of urea, a great
                        number of pearl-coloured crystals are deposited. Oxalic acid produces the
                        same effect, but no other acid tried. The infusion of nutgalls gives the
                        aqueous solution of urea a yellowish-brown colour, but causes no
                        precipitate.</p><p>When heat is applied to urea, it melts, swells up, and evaporates. When
                        distilled, much carbonate of ammonia is obtained, together with some
                        hydrocyanic acid. Many curious mutual conversions of urea and cyanogen into
                        each other have been lately observed by Wohler, Serullas, &amp;c.</p><p>Considerable pains have been taken to determine the constituents of urea, by
                        distilling it at a red heat when mixed with oxide of copper. The following

                        decomposed by destructive distillation, hydrocyanic acid, carbonic acid, and
                        ammonia, may be formed from it.</p><p>Urea is doubtless one of the most important of the constituents of urine, and
                        to the changes to which it is liable many of the derangements to which the
                        urinary system is liable may be ascribed. The quantity of it in urine is
                        much greater than that of any of the other constituents of urine, with the
                        exception of the water. We shall now notice some of the most remarkable
                        alterations to which urine is subject.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Diabetes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Diabetes is a
                        disease fortunately of rare occurrence, but still so frequent that every
                        medical man in tolerable practice is pretty sure of meeting with more than
                        one case of it. It is attended with a dry skin, a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353516" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3516-0501"/> ravenous
                        appetite, and the passing of an enormous quantity of sweet-tasted urine. It
                        is always light coloured and of high specific gravity, sometimes as high as
                        1∙050, and never lower than 1*02, or rather 1∙025. It contains urea, uric
                        acid, and all the usual contents of urine, but in smaller quantity than
                        usual, on account of the enormous quantity of urine discharged, amounting
                        sometimes to twenty-four, or even thirty English pints, in twenty-four
                        hours. Yet the absolute quantity of these constituents thrown out of the
                        system in the course of a day is probably as great as during health. The
                        characteristics of diabetic urine are the enormous quantity and the sweet
                        taste. This sweet taste is owing to the presence of a quantity of sugar,
                        which depends upon the specific gravity of the urine. Sometimes it amounts
                        to as much as thirty ounces in twenty-four hours. This enormous discharge of
                        sugar accounts for the great appetite, the prostration of strength, and the
                        wasting of the system, which accompany this disease.</p><p>Whether diabetic sugar belongs always to the same species seems doubtful. The
                        writer of this article met with a case of diabetes some years ago, in which
                        the sugar was of such a nature, that when the urine was concentrated by a
                        gentle heat, and then set aside, beautiful crystals of the sugar were
                        gradually deposited. These crystals were perfectly white, and in regular
                        four-sided prisms slightly oblique. They were not altered by exposure to the
                        air. When the urine containing these crystals was raised to too high a
                        temperature, the sugar still retained its sweet taste; but it could no
                        longer be crystallized.</p><p>In general diabetic urine does not yield sugar in regular crystals. When the
                        urine is cautiously evaporated and set aside, the sugar is deposited in
                        small irregular grains, mixed with the usual constituents of urine. If we
                        dry this sugar between folds of blotting paper, and then digest it
                        repeatedly in cold alcohol as long as the liquid continues to acquire any
                        colour, and finally dissolve it in water and crystallize it again, we obtain
                        the sugar in small sphericles of a white colour, and composed of a congeries
                        of needles radiating from a centre. It resembles sugar of grapes in its
                        appearance, and Chevreul affirms that it possesses all the characters of
                        that sugar. If this be true, it cannot be doubted that the diabetic sugar
                        which formed regular crystals constitutes a different species. It has been
                        ascertained that diabetic sugar possesses the capability of undergoing the
                        vinous fermentation, and producing spirits precisely like common sugar and
                        sugar of grapes.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Dropsy.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In cases of dropsy
                        the urine is often loaded with the serum of the blood. It often coagulates
                        when heated, or at any rate when mixed with an acid.</p><p>In jaundice the urine has an orange-yellow colour, and communicates the same
                        tint to linen. Muriatic acid renders such urine green, and thus detects the
                        presence of picromel.</p><p>In inflammatory diseases the urine is scanty, high coloured, and acrid. It
                        deposits no sediment on standing, but is copiously precipitated by corrosive
                        sublimate. About the end of inflammatory diseases the urine becomes copious,
                        and deposits a pink-coloured sediment.</p><p>In hysteria the urine is usually limpid and colourless. It is deficient in
                        urea, but contains a considerable quantity of the phosphates.</p><p>Blue urine, black urine, and white urine, have been occasionally
                        observed.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Deposits from Urine.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                        urine being a liquid secreted from the blood for the purpose of being thrown
                        out of the body, and the intention of the secretion being obviously to keep
                        the blood as nearly as possible in the same state, it is clear that it will
                        undergo an alteration whenever the digestive organs are deranged. That this
                        is the case every person must perceive who pays any attention to the
                        secretion. In cases of perfect health the urine deposits no sediment. But
                        when the digestive organs have been deranged by excess either in drink or
                        food, the urine, though limpid when first voided, speedily becomes turbid,
                        and deposits a copious sediment. These derangements are in general but
                        momentary, and, unless the cause be persisted in, do not lead to any
                        material injury to the system. But in cases of habitual intemperance, and
                        also from other causes that cannot be always appreciated, the nature of the
                        urine sometimes becomes permanently altered. In such cases solid matter is
                        deposited in the kidney (or sometimes in the bladder), which, increasing in
                        size, becomes a calculus, and gives origin to one of the most deplorable
                        diseases to which mankind is liable.</p><p>When the urine becomes acid, uric acid is precipitated. This gives occasion
                        to the formation of uric acid calculi, the most common species of these
                        concretions. When the urine becomes alkaline, the quantity of earthy
                        phosphates in it speedily increases. Hence phosphate of lime, and sometimes
                        phosphate of magnesia, are apt to be deposited. This gives occasion to two
                        other species of calculi, those composed of phosphate of lime, and those
                        composed of a mixture of phosphate of lime and phosphate of magnesia, or of
                        <hi rend="italic">triple phosphate</hi> as it is usually termed.</p><p>There occur two other species of calculi, the origin of which it is not so
                        easy to explain. One of these is oxalate of lime, or mulberry calculus as it
                        is termed in consequence of some resemblance which such calculi have to a
                        mulberry. The other, which is very uncommon, is known by the name of cystic
                        oxide.</p><p>Uric acid calculi have usually a brown colour, and are sometimes smooth and
                        polished on the surface, but much more frequently covered with little
                        tubercles. They are composed of concentric coats indicating the. period of
                        their formation. When in powder it dissolves easily in the fixed alkaline
                        leys, from which it is precipitated in white powder by all the acids. It is
                        insoluble in water.</p><p>Sometimes the uric acid is combined with ammonia, constituting urate of
                        ammonia calculi. They have a good deal of the appearance of clay. They are
                        rather uncommon; generally exist only in the urinary bladder of very young
                        persons, and are productive of a very great degree of irritation.</p><p>Phosphate of lime calculi have a pale-brown colour, sometimes almost white,
                        and their surface is so smooth as to appear polished. They are composed of
                        very regular concentric laminae, rather thicker than those of uric acid
                        calculi, and adhering to each other so slightly as to separate with ease
                        from each other. When in powder this calculus dissolves easily, without
                        effervescence, in nitric or muriatic acid. Before the blowpipe it may be
                        fused, though an intense heat is necessary. The constitution of the
                        phosphate of lime in calculi is different from that of <hi rend="italic">apatite</hi> or native phosphate; the former being composed of an atom of
                        acid and an atom of lime, while the latter consists of an atom of acid
                        united to an atom and a half of lime.</p><p>Calculi composed of the triple phosphates are white, and resemble chalk.
                        Sometimes they are smooth, and have a kind of silky lustre, and appear
                        evidently composed of small prismatic crystals. These calculi are mixtures
                        of two different salts, which occur in unequal quantities in different
                        calculi. 1. Ammonia-phosphate of magnesia, a tasteless insoluble white
                        matter, which is frequently crystallized in small prisms. 2. Phosphate of
                        lime. These two salts are sometimes mixed with uric acid. The first two
                        salts, when mixed in the requisite proportion, have the property of fusing
                        before the blowpipe; hence the chalky <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353529" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3529-0502"/> calculus
                        is often distinguished by the name of fusible calculus. In some rare cases
                        calculi occur composed very nearly of ammonia-phosphate of magnesia, or at
                        least containing a much greater proportion of that salt than of phosphate of
                        lime.</p><p>When acetic acid is poured upon fusible calculus previously reduced to
                        powder, the ammonia-phosphate of magnesia is dissolved, and may be again
                        thrown down unaltered from the filtered solution by the addition of
                        carbonate of ammonia. Muriatic acid will dissolve the phosphate of lime,
                        which escaped the action of the acetic acid; and it may be thrown down
                        unaltered by caustic ammonia. Should the calculus contain also any uric
                        acid, it will remain undissolved after the action of the acids, but may be
                        readily dissolved by potash ley, and afterwards thrown down by acetic
                        acid.</p><p>The mulberry calculus consists of oxalate of lime mixed with a little
                        phosphate of lime and some uric acid. It is a hard calculus, commonly of a
                        dark-brown colour, as if tinged with blood, and having an irregular and
                        tuberculated structure. These calculi are seldom of a large size, or when
                        they are, the nucleus alone consists of oxalate of lime, while the outer
                        portion is sometimes uric acid, but more frequently fusible calculus.</p><p>Sometimes oxalate of lime calculi are remarkably smooth and pale coloured.
                        They arc then known by the name of hemp seed calculi, and would appear to
                        have their origin in the kidneys.</p><p>Cystic oxide calculi are very rare, not above ten or twelve having been
                        hitherto observed. They are small and oval shaped, have a light-yellow
                        colour, are translucent, and not composed of concentric laminae like the
                        other calculi. They have a peculiar glistening lustre, like that of a body
                        having a high refractive density. Before the blowpipe this calculus gives
                        out a peculiarly fetid smell, quite different from that given out by uric
                        acid, and not resembling prussic acid.</p><p>It dissolves, and combines equally with acids and alkalies, and crystallizes
                        with both. It is precipitated from nitric acid by alcohol. It does not
                        become red when treated with nitric acid. It produces no change on vegetable
                        blues. It is insoluble in water, alcohol, and ether. When distilled it
                        yields carbonate of ammonia and a heavy fetid oil, and leaves a very small,
                        black, spongy coal, consisting chiefly of phosphate of lime. It has been
                        subjected to a chemical analysis by Dr Prout, who found it composed of</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>29∙875</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5∙125</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Azote</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>11∙850</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>53∙150</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>100-000</p></cell></row></table><p>This is equivalent to</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6 atoms carbon</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙5</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6 atoms hydrogen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 atom azote</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙75</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8 atoms oxygen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>8∙00</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>15</p></cell></row></table><p>Hence the atomic weight is fifteen, or a multiple of that number.</p><p>It is a very common thing for a calculus, when of considerable size, to be
                        composed of various substances alternating in layers. In such cases uric
                        acid pretty frequently constitutes the nucleus, sometimes oxalate of lime,
                        and sometimes phosphate of lime. Very few calculi occur having a nucleus of
                        fusible calculus; but this matter is a very frequent portion of large
                        calculi, and generally constitutes the outermost layer. It is remarkable,
                        that when the constitution of calculous patients is broken up by dis ease,
                        the urine usually becomes alkaline, and great quantities of triple
                        phosphate, or of fusible phosphate, are deposited; hence when calculi are
                        extracted from the bladders of such persons after death, the outermost layer
                        is very frequently a deposit of the chalky matter which constitutes the
                        substance of fusible calculus.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP.</hi> IX. OF THE SKIN.</p><p>The skin is a strong thick covering which envelopes the whole external
                        surface of animals. It consists always of two layers, namely, the <hi rend="italic">epidermis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scarf-shin,</hi> which is
                        on the outside, and destitute of feeling, and when any portion of it is
                        rubbed off it is soon replaced; and the <hi rend="italic">cutis,</hi> or
                        true skin, which is much thicker, and composed of a great many fibres
                        closely interwoven and disposed in different directions. Anatomists mention
                        a third substance placed between the cuticle and the cutis, to which they
                        have given the name of <hi rend="italic">rete mucosum.</hi></p><p>The epidermis is easily separated from the cutis by maceration in hot water.
                        It possesses considerable elasticity. It is insoluble in water and alcohol.
                        The fixed alkalies dissolve it completely; as does lime also, though slowly.
                        Sulphuric and muriatic acids act upon it very slowly, but nitric acid makes
                        it yellow immediately, deprives it of its elasticity, and makes it fall to
                        pieces. It consists chiefly of coagulated or indurated albumen. The

                        fibres. When sufficiently macerated in cold water, most of the foreign
                        matter, such as blood, mucus, &amp;c. with which it is contaminated, is
                        separated, When thus purified, it dissolves in concentrated alkaline leys.
                        Weak acids soften it, render it transparent, and at last dissolve it. When
                        digested in nitric acid it is partially converted into oxalic acid, while
                        azotic gas is disengaged. Hydrocyanic acid is given out at the same time.
                        When heated it contracts, and then swells, exhales a fetid odour, and after
                        burning leaves a dense charcoal difficult to incinerate. When long boiled in
                        water it dissolves, and is converted into gelatine or glue.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Of Gelatine.</hi></p><p>When the solution of the skins of animals in water is sufficiently
                        concentrated, it is converted, on cooling, into a transparent jelly. When
                        this jelly is dried it becomes hard, semitransparent, and .breaks with a
                        glassy fracture. When pure it is white; but glue, from overheating, has
                        almost always a yellow colour. Its taste is insipid, and it has no
                        smell.</p><p>When thrown into water it swells very much, but does not dissolve; yet it is
                        converted into the same transparent tremulous jelly from which it was
                        originally hardened. When heat is applied it melts, and becomes what in
                        common language is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">glue,</hi> and is
                        in common use for fastening pieces of wood to each other. A very small
                        quantity of dry gelatine converts a considerable quantity of water into a
                        jelly. One part of gelatine from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353542" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3542-0503"/> isinglass
                        dissolved in a hundred parts of hot water totally gelatinizes on
                        cooling.</p><p>Gelatine, while dry, may be kept for any length of time without undergoing
                        alteration; but when dissolved in water, or in the gelatinous state, it very
                        soon putrefies.</p><p>When dry gelatine is exposed to heat it whitens, curls up like horn, then
                        blackens, and is gradually consumed to a coal. It is by no means very
                        combustible. When distilled in a retort it gives out combustible gases,
                        while carbonate of ammonia sublimes, and there pass over into the receiver a
                        light-brown watery liquid, and a dark-coloured oily matter of the
                        consistence of tar. There remains in the retort a shining charcoal, of very
                        difficult incineration.</p><p>Acids dissolve gelatine with facility, even when diluted, especially if they
                        be assisted by heat; nor do they seem to decompose or alter it, provided
                        they be dilute. From this we must except nitric acid, which occasions the
                        evolution of azotic gas and deutoxide of azote. A quantity of oxalic and of
                        malic acids is formed, and an oily matter appears on the surface of the
                        liquid.</p><p>Muriatic acid dissolves gelatine with great ease. The solution has a brown
                        colour,'and always continues strongly acid, though it has dissolved as much
                        gelatine as it can take up.</p><p>When a current of chlorine gas is passed through an aqueous solution of
                        gelatine, a white solid matter collects on the surface, and whitish
                        filaments swim through the liquid.</p><p>Alkalies dissolve gelatine with facility, especially when assisted by heat,
                        but the solution does not possess the properties of soap.</p><p>It is insoluble in alcohol (unless when very dilute), ether, fixed and
                        volatile oils. When a solution of tannin is dropt into an aqueous solution
                        of gelatine, a copious white precipitate falls, which gradually forms an
                        elastic adhesive mass, not unlike vegetable gluten. This precipitate is a
                        compound of gelatine and tannin. It soon dries in the open air, and forms a
                        brittle resinous-like substance, insoluble in water, capable of resisting
                        many chemical re-agents, and not susceptible of putrefaction. It resembles
                        over-tanned leather. Leather is a combination of tannin and gelatine, or
                        rather of tannin and the skin of animals. When gelatine is in the gelatinous
                        state, it does not combine with or precipitate tannin. The tannate of
                        gelatine is soluble in an aqueous solution of gelatine.</p><p>Tannin, or the infusion of nutgalls, is one of the most delicate tests for
                        gelatine. It is not, however, free from ambiguity, because albumen is
                        precipitated by tannin as well as gelatine. The same remark applies likewise
                        to fibrin and the colouring matter of blood, which indeed might almost be
                        considered as varieties of albumen. But if a liquid which is not
                        precipitated by a solution of corrosive sublimate be precipitated by tannin,
                        we may then be certain that it contains gelatine.</p><p>The other characteristic property of gelatine is its assuming the gelatinous
                        form when a sufficiently concentrated aqueous solution of it is allowed to
                        cool.</p><p>Gelatine has been subjected to a chemical analysis by Gay-Lussac and Thenard,

                        properties, of the muscles of different animals; but hitherto the subject
                        has been very imperfectly investigated.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Of Ozmazome.</hi></p><p>Ozmazome, so called from its smell, and the mode of obtaining it, is
                        intimately connected with the muscles of animals, and is probably nothing
                        else than fibrin altered in its nature by the heat applied. It may be
                        obtained by the following process:</p><p>Divide the muscle of beef into small fragments, and leave it in contact with
                        twice or thrice its weight of cold water for an hour or two, taking care to
                        squeeze it occasionally. Decant off the first portion of water, and add an
                        additional portion. Repeat the digestion a third time. These portions of
                        water dissolve the salts, the albumen, and the ozmazome. Mix them all
                        together, and evaporate them in a porcelain vessel till the whole albumen
                        has coagulated and separated. Then filter the liquid, which will be reduced
                        to a small quantity, and be of a deep colour. Evaporate it in a very gentle
                        heat to the consistency of a syrup, and digest it in alcohol. The ozmazome
                        will be dissolved, while the salts will be left behind. If we evaporate off
                        the alcohol, the ozmazome will remain behind in a state of tolerable
                        purity.</p><p>Its colour is brownish yellow, and it has the taste and smell of broth, or
                        rather of beef-tea. It is soluble both in water and in alcohol. When the
                        aqueous solution is heated, the ozmazome does not coagulate; nor does <pb break="no" facs="nls:193353555" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3555-0504"/>
                        it gelatinize when the hot concentrated solution is allowed to cool. When
                        the water is driven off the ozmazome remains unchanged in the state of a
                        brown-coloured matter.</p><p>The aqueous solution of ozmazome is precipitated by infusion of nutgalls,
                        nitrate of mercury, and acetate and nitrate of lead. When ozmazome is
                        heated, it melts, swells, and is decomposed, giving out carbonate of
                        ammonia, and leaving a bulky charcoal, which contains some carbonate of
                        soda.</p><p>A substance very similar to ozmazome is obtained when the muscles of animals
                        are decomposed by the action of concentrated sulphuric acid. It is reddish,
                        and tastes weakly bitter, like over-roasted meat. It is very soluble in
                        water and alcohol, and is slightly precipitated by acetate of lead and
                        infusion of nutgalls.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP</hi>. XI. OF THE BRAIN AND NERVES.</p><p>The brain is well known to be the organ of sensation, and even of motion; for
                        it communicates with every part of the body which has any function to
                        perform by means of the nerves; and when the nerve leading to any part is
                        surrounded with a ligature, that part loses its sensibility, and the power
                        of performing its proper functions, till the ligature be withdrawn.</p><p>The brain consists of two substances, which differ from each other somewhat
                        in colour, but which in other respects seem to be of the same nature. The
                        outermost of these, from some small resemblance which it has to the colour
                        of wood ashes, is called the <hi rend="italic">cineritious</hi> part; while
                        the innermost part is called the medullary part. Brain has a soft feel, not
                        unlike soap. Its texture appears to be very close; its specific gravity is
                        greater than that of water. When the contact of air is prevented, brain
                        remains a very long time without undergoing putrefaction; but when the free
                        admission of air is allowed, it putrefies with great rapidity.</p><p>It is insoluble in water; but when triturated with that liquid in a mortar,
                        it forms a whitish-coloured emulsion, which appears homogeneous, may be
                        passed through a filter, and does not allow the matter of brain to
                        precipitate when left at rest. When this emulsion is heated to 145°, a white
                        coagulum is formed. The addition of a great quantity of water likewise
                        causes a coagulum to appear, which floats on the surface; but the water
                        still retains a milky colour. Sulphuric and nitric acids, when dropt into
                        the emulsion, occasion a white coagulum to separate. The same effect is
                        produced by alcohol. This coagulum possesses properties very similar to
                        those of <hi rend="italic">albumen,</hi> of which it is probably merely a
                        modification. When dried it becomes translucent, and breaks with a vitreous
                        fracture.</p><p>When nitric acid is digested on brain, ammonia and oxalic acid are formed.
                        When brain is kept for a sufficient length of time exposed to the heat of a
                        vapour-bath, a quantity of water is driven off, and there remains a
                        browncoloured matter, weighing from a fourth to a fifth of the original
                        quantity of brain employed. Alcohol being repeatedly boiled upon this
                        residuum, dissolves about five eighths of the whole. When the alcoholic
                        solution cools, it deposits a yellowish-white substance, composed of
                        brilliant plates. When this matter is kneaded between the fingers, it
                        assumes the appearance of a ductile paste, which at 212° becomes soft, and,
                        when the heat is still farther increased, blackens, exhales empyreumatic and
                        ammoniacal fumes, and leaves behind it a charry matter. Pure concentrated
                        potash ley dissolves brain, disengaging a great quantity of ammonia.</p><p>Brain, according to the analysis of Vauquelin, is composed as follows:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Water</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>......80∙00</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>White fatty matter</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4∙53</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Reddish fatty matter</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>0∙70</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Albumen</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>7∙00</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Ozmazome</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙12</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Phosphorus</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1∙50</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Acids, salts, and sulphur</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5∙15</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>100-00</p></cell></row></table><p>Dr John extracted the following substances from the brain of a calf:</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Water</p><p>Peculiar albumen of brain</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>.75 to 80 .10</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Ozmazome )</p><p>Fat</p><p>Sulphur, trace</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Phosphates of lime, soda, iron...

XII. OF BONES.</p><p>The bones are the most solid parts of animals. Their texture is sometimes
                        compact, at other times cellular and porous, according to the situation of
                        the bone. They are white, of a lamellar texture, and not flexible or
                        softened by heat. Their specific gravity differs in different parts; that of
                        adults’ teeth is 2∙2727; that of children’s teeth 2Ό833.</p><p>Bone consists essentially of two different substances, namely, a
                        cartilaginous part, which has the shape and size of the bone, but is soft
                        and elastic. When dried it becomes translucent, and of the consistence of
                        horn; but by steeping it in water it becomes again soft and elastic, as at
                        first. This substance may be obtained by digesting fresh bones in dilute
                        muriatic or acetic acid. The earthy part of the bone is dissolved, and the
                        cartilage remains behind. When cartilage is boiled in water, it gradually
                        dissolves, and the solution, when sufficiently concentrated, gelatinizes on
                        cooling; hence it would appear that cartilage approaches very closely to the
                        nature of <hi rend="italic">cutis.</hi> D’Arect has lately proposed this
                        method of treating bones as an excellent one for converting their substance
                        into a nutritive soup. He separates the earthy matter by dilute muriatic
                        acid, and then dissolves the cartilage into a soup, which, when properly
                        seasoned, is said to be both palatable and nutritive.</p><p>The other constituent of bones is the earthy matter which they contain, and
                        to which they owe their solidity and strength. This earthy matter consists
                        of three different salts, namely, phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, and
                        phosphate of magnesia. Berzelius found the constituents of ox bones as

                        though they are of too much consequence to be omitted. These, namely,
                        cantharidin and cochenilin, will constitute the subject of the two following
                        chapters.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">CHAP</hi>. XIII.

                        distinguished. It may be obtained by the following process:</p><p>Boil cantharides in water till every thing soluble in that liquor be taken
                        up. Concentrate the solution by evaporation, and when reduced to a thick
                        syrup, boil it repeatedly in alcohol till that liquid ceases to act upon it.
                        Evaporate the alcoholic solution gently to dryness, put the dry residue into
                        a phial with sulphuric ether, and agitate the mixture for a considerable
                        time. At first the ether will seem to have no effect on it; but after some
                        hours it assumes a yellow colour. Decant it off, and allow it to evaporate
                        spontaneously in the open air. It deposits small crystalline plates, mixed
                        with a yellow matter. Alcohol takes up the yellow matter, but leaves the
                        crystalline plates. These plates, when dried between folds of blotting
                        paper, constitute cantharidin in a state of purity.</p><p>It has considerable lustre; it is insoluble in water and in cold alcohol.
                        Boiling alcohol dissolves it, but lets it fall again in crystals as the

                        it readily. When applied to the skin it acts powerfully as a vesicatory. The

                        in alcohol as long as it commu∙ ∣ nicates a red colour to that liquid. When
                        this solution is left to spontaneous evaporation, it lets fall a crystalline
                        matter of a fine red colour. Dissolve these crystals in strong alcohol, and
                        mix the solution with its own bulk of sulphuric ether. It becomes muddy, and
                        after an interval of some days cochenilin is deposited at the bottom of the
                        vessel in the form of a beautiful purplish-red powder.</p><p>Cochenilin has a granular appearance, as if it were com-: posed of crystals.
                        It is not altered by exposure to the air. It melts at 122°. When the heat is
                        increased it is decomposed, yielding inflammable air, a great deal of oil,
                        and a little acidulous water, but no traces of ammonia.</p><p>It is very soluble in water, but the solution, though concentrated to the
                        consistency of a syrup, does not crystallize. It has a fine carmine colour,
                        and its colouring powers are very considerable. It is soluble also in
                        alcohol, but the solubility diminishes as the strength of the alcohol
                        increases. It is insoluble in ether. The weak acids dissolve it. No acid
                        precipitates it when pure, yet they all produce a sensible change on the
                        solution. At first it assumes a lively-red colour, which slowly changes into
                        yellow. Concentrated sulphuric acid destroys and chars it. Muriatic acid
                        decomposes it without charring it. Nitric acid acts with still greater
                        rapidity, small needle-formed crystals being formed, which resemble oxalic
                        acid, but do not precipitate lime water, even when mixed with ammonia.</p><p>The alkalies give the solution of cochenilin a violet colour, and gradually
                        alter its nature when the colour becomes yellow. Lime water throws down a
                        violet-coloured precipitate. Barytes and strontian occasion no precipitate,
                        but produce a similar change of colour. Alumina has a strong affinity’ for
                        cochenilin. When newly precipitated alumina is put into an aqueous solution
                        of cochenilin, the liquid is deprived of its colour, and the alumina
                        converted into a beautiful lake.</p><p>Acetate of lead throws down a violet-coloured precipitate from the aqueous
                        solution of cochenilin. Nitrated suboxide of mercury produces a similar
                        effect. The chloride of tin produces also a violet-coloured precipitate.
                        Perchloride renders the solution scarlet, but occasions no precipitate.</p><p>Cochenilin is not precipitated by tannin or infusion of nutgalls.</p><p>From the experiments of Pelletier and Caventou, it appears that cochenilin is
                        composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and that it contains no azote
                        whatever; but the atomic proportions of these constituents have not hitherto
                        been determined. <hi rend="smallcaps">(l.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Caloric,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat,</hi> will be treated of under
