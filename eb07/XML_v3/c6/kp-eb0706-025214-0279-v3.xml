                    electrician and natural philosopher, born at Naples on the 30th March 1749, and
                    son of a physician established in that city.</p>
                <p>His father died when he was only eleven years old, but he received a liberal
                    education through the kindness of his friends, and completed his studies at the
                    university of Naples. He was originally destined for commerce, and came to
                    England in 1771, in order to obtain more complete information respecting the
                    various objects of mercantile pursuit. But he soon abandoned his intention of
                    adopting that mode of life, and determined to devote his time almost exclusively
                    to the cultivation of science, and to the literary employments connected with
                    it. The splendid improvements which had been lately made in electricity easily
                    directed his earliest attention to that amusing department of natural
                    philosophy; but his studies were by no means confined to that subject, and the
                    extent of his diversified researches may be understood from an enumeration of
                    his pincipal publications.</p>

                    some danger of becoming, like another Richmann, a martyr to his zeal in pursuit
                    of his favourite science; for he says that he felt a number of severe shocks

                <p>This essay contains a clear and familiar account of the principal facts
                    respecting electricity, which had been discovered at the time of its
                    publication, as well as of the best apparatus and of the most interesting
                    experiments. The first part relates to the general laws of the science; the
                    second to the hypothetical theories by which different authors have attempted to
                    explain them, but without any mention of the calculations of Alpinus and
                    Cavendish; the third part gives an account of the practical arrangement of
                    electrical apparatus, and the fourth of some original experiments and
                    instruments; the fifth part in the later editions is a republication of the
                    author’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Medical Electricity.</hi> To the fourth
                    edition a third volume is added, containing an account of the recent discoveries
                    respecting animal electricity; of the author’s multiplier for detecting the
                    presence of small quantities of electricity, by the repeated operation of two
                    condensers connected together; and of some original and very important
                    experiments relating principally to the effect of the contact of different
                    metals with each other, and exhibiting an imperfect outline of those properties,
                    which have since furnished Volta and Davy with their ingenious explanations of
                    the phenomena of the electrochemical battery.</p>
                <p>Mr Cavallo has inadvertently attributed to Nollet the honour of having first
                    entertained the opinion of the electrical nature of thunder and lightning; and
                    the German translator has thought it necessary to vindicate the scientific
                    character of his own country, by laying claim to this conjecture on behalf of
                    Winkler; but Mr Silvestre has remarked, with a laudable impartiality, that both
                    Germany and France must on this occasion give way to England, since the first
                    suggestion of the identity is found in a paper of Stephen Gray, published in the

                    the lecturer to a small fee, left by the will of Mr Henry Baker, but which is
                    commonly considered as rather complimentary than lucrative. These experiments
                    relate to the effect produced by colouring the bulb of a thermometer exposed to
                    the sun’s rays, and to the intensity of heat at different distances from its
                    source. The most refrangible colours appeared to absorb the most heat; and it
                    was observed that even the day-light, without sunshine, occasioned a perceptible
                    difference in the indications of the different thermometers.</p>

                    held out in this work has certainly not been fulfilled by later experience; but,
                    as a candid and distinct relation of cases, it may still have its value.</p>

                    for ascertaining the temperature of boiling water at different heights above the
                    level of the sea, according to the idea then suggested by Sir George Shuckburgh,
                    and very lately resumed by other natural philosophers. Mr Cavallo observes that
                    the instrument has the advantage of being very portable; but that unless the
                    quantity of water be considerable, its boiling temperature will be somewhat
                    unsteady.</p>

                    of chemistry and of hydrostatics, and proceeds to relate all the known
                    properties of the different kinds of elastic fluids, many of which had been very
                    lately discovered. These are followed by an account of some original
                    experiments, for example, on the gas produced by the deflagration of gunpowder,
                    which is found to be chiefly nitrogen and carbonic acid, without any nitric
                    oxide; on the explosion of hydrogen mixed with atmospheric air, and on the
                    evolution of gas from plants, respecting which the author finds some reason to
                    differ from the opinions of Dr Ingenhurz. Considering that Mr Cavendish had not
                    then discovered the composition of the nitric acid, it must be allowed that the
                    experiments on gunpowder may justly be deemed an important step in the progress
                    of chemical science.</p>

                    mode of opening the valve of oiled silk mechanically, when the elasticity of the
                    air became too weak to raise it. The rarefaction obtained went to about the
                    thousandth of an atmosphere. In this state the air transmitted electricity, with
                    a light equably diffused; and the balls of the electrometer exhibited no

                    chiefly to the magnetism of brass, and of some other metals, generally rendered
                    discoverable by hammering them. In the latter the same subject is continued; and
                    it is shown that the same powers may be detected in the metals in question
                    without hammering them, if they are placed on a very clean and wide surface of
                    quicksilver. The limit at which red hot iron begins to be attracted by a magnet

                    considerable change is observed in the magnetic powers of iron during its

                    effects of heat, and from internal changes in the constitution of the earth. Mr
                    Bennet has endeavoured to explain the phenomena observed by Mr Cavallo, from the
                    accidental operation of foreign causes; but he has not been perfectly successful

                    demonstrating the existence of an electricity too weak to affect the other

                    vols. 8vo, Lond. 1803. This work, the last and most valuable of the author’s
                    publications, will long serve as a useful manual of the most important parts of
                    the mechanical and physical sciences. The first volume is devoted to
                    mathematical and practical mechanics, beginning with matter and motion, and
                    proceeding to simple machines. The second relates, first, to fluids, to the
                    principles of hydrostatics, cohesion, hydraulics, pneumatics, sound, and music;
                    and, secondly, to the most important parts of chemistry. In the third volume we
                    find the doctrine of heat, optics, electricity, and magnetism; and the fourth,
                    besides astronomy and the use of the globes, contains a compendium of the
                    history of aerostation; an account of meteors, including the recent discoveries
                    respecting aeroliths; and a collection of useful tables.</p>
                <p>25. Mr Cavallo was also an occasional contributor to several periodical
                    publications, and his critical articles were not in every instance anonymous. He
                    was made a member of the Royal Academy of Naples in 1779, and a fellow of the
                    Royal Society of London in the month of December of the same year.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to hesitate in attributing to Mr Cavallo the possession of very
                    considerable powers of mind; but these powers seem to have been of a different
                    nature from those which have distinguished some other individuals, remarkable
                    for the faculty of acute reasoning and brilliant invention, and apparently born
                    to succeed in the highest flights of genius. Mr Cavallo’s talents appear to have
                    had more of the imitative character, and to have been rather calculated for the
                    attainment of excellence in the fine arts than in science; but his memory was
                    uncommonly retentive, and his industry seems to have been indefatigable. He used
                    to relate, that when he was first compelled to study Euclid, he felt himself
                    utterly incapable of comprehending the train of argumentation, and he was
                    obliged to get the whole work by heart, both propositions and demonstrations, in
                    order to impress the conclusions strongly on his mind. This expedient answered
                    his purpose very well, as long as the impression lasted; but after some years he
                    had forgotten his task, and he was obliged to go through the whole again in the
                    same manner, still finding it easier to commit the eight entire books, with all
                    the unmeaning letters of reference, to the care of his ever-faithful memory,
                    than to acquire the spirit of the mode of reasoning, and to anticipate the steps
                    of the demonstration; although, after having performed this second labour, he
                    felt himself sufficiently master of the subject. It may be observed that he
                    possessed considerable skill in music; and music was called by the ancients an
                    imitative art, a description which may indeed be somewhat objectionable with
                    regard to the province of the original composer, who creates something
                    altogether unlike what had ever before existed, but which may not improperly be
                    applied to the occupation of a performer; indeed Mr Cavallo, even when his
                    hearing was impaired, still retained<pb break="no" facs="nls:193350318"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-0318-0255"/> a very correct taste in the execution of vocal
                    music. He possessed also his country’s aptitude for the painter’s art; and he
                    was particularly happy in cutting out striking likenesses of his acquaintances
                    in paper. The principal object of his life was to collect and arrange the
                    labours of others; and he was so much in the habit of collecting, that he had
                    for many years made it his amusement to collect specimens of the handwriting of
                    eminent persons, which he had extended to an immense number of individuals of
                    different ages and countries. But he was by no means incapable of copying from
                    the great book of nature; and he made, in the course of his various researches,
                    a number of original experiments, well calculated to illus-strate particular
                    questions relating to the sciences which lie cultivated. In the latter part of
                    his life he had discontinued his attendance at the meetings of the Royal
                    Society, as well as his contributions to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he was in the habit of
                    frequenting some other literary conversations, at which he constantly met some
                    of his oldest and kindest friends. A short time before his last illness, he was
                    engaged in some experiments on Mr Deluc’s perpetual pile of paper, and on the
                    electricity of different specimens of crystals; but he does not appear to have
                    obtained any new results from these investigations. He died at his residence in
                    Wells Street, on the 26th of December 1809, and was buried in St Paneras
                    churchyard, near the tomb of General Paoli, with whom he had long been on terms
                    of the greatest intimacy. <hi rend="italic">(Literary Memoirs of īΛving
