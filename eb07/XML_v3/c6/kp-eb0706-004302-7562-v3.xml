                    It is marked out by the quartermaster-general, who appoints every regiment its
                    ground. See <hi rend="smallcaps">War.</hi></p><p>The Hebrew camp was of a quadrangular form, surrounded with an inclosure of the
                    height of ten hands-breadth. It formed a square of twelve miles in compass about
                    the tabernacle; and within this was another called the <hi rend="italic">Levites
                    camp.</hi></p><p>The Greek camps were fortified with gates and ditches. The Lacedemonians formed
                    their camps of a round figure, looking upon that as the most perfect and
                    defensible of any form. We are not, however, to imagine, that they thought this
                    form so essential to a camp as never to be dispensed with when the circumstances
                    of the place required it. Of the rest of the Grecian camps it may be observed,
                    that the most valiant of the soldiers were placed at the extremities, and the
                    rest in the middle. Thus we learn from Homer, that Achilles and Ajax were posted
                    at the ends of the camp before Troy, as bulwarks on each side of the rest of the
                    princes.</p><p>The figure of the Roman camp was a square divided into two principal parts. In
                    the upper part were the general’s pavilion, or <hi rend="italic">praetorium,</hi> and the tents of the chief officers; in the lower were those
                    of inferior degree. On one side of the <hi rend="italic">praetorium</hi> stood
                    the <hi rend="italic">quaestorium,</hi> or apartment of the treasurer of the
                    army; and near this the <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> ∕0- <hi rend="italic">rum,</hi> both for a market-place and the assembling of councils. On the other
                    side of the <hi rend="italic">praetorium</hi> were lodged the <hi rend="italic">legati</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and below it the tribunes had their
                    quarters, opposite to their respective legions. Beside the tribunes were the <hi rend="italic">proefectí</hi> of the foreign troops, over against their
                    respective wings; and behind these were the lodgments of the <hi rend="italic">evocati,</hi> then those of the <hi rend="italic">extraordinarii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ablecti</hi><hi rend="italic">equites,</hi> which concluded the
                    higher part of the camp. Between the two partitions was a spot of ground called
                    <hi rend="italic">principia,</hi> for the altars and images of the gods, and
                    probably also for the chief ensigns. The middle of the lower partition was
                    assigned to the Roman horse; next to them were quartered the <hi rend="italic">triarii</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then the <hi rend="italic">principes,</hi> and close by them the <hi rend="italic">hastati</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> afterwards the foreign horse, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347575" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7575-0044"/>lastly, the
                    foreign foot. The Romans fortified their camp with a ditch and parapet, which
                    they termed <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vallum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in the latter some distinguish two parts, namely, the
                    <hi rend="italic">agger</hi> or earth, and the <hi rend="italic">sudes</hi> or
                    wooden stakes driven in to secure it. The camps were sometimes surrounded by
                    walls built of hewn stone; and the tents themselves were formed of the same
                    materials.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
