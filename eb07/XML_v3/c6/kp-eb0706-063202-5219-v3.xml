                    continued to add, from year to year, a multitude of new discoveries to our
                    knowledge of experimental and physical optics; and no department of this subject
                    has received additions so diversified and so important as those which relate to
                    the phenomena of colours, which have been displayed, with a thousand brilliant
                    and unexpected transformations, under circumstances that in former times could
                    never have been suspected of exhibiting any thing resembling them. The
                    successive experiments and calculations of Dr Thomas Young (1801), Dr Wollaston
                    (1802), Mr Malus (1810), Mr Arago, Mr Biot, Dr Brewster,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Now Sir David Brewster.</p></note> Dr
                    Seebeck, and Mr Fresnel, have all contributed very essentially to the extension
                    and illustration of this interesting branch of science. But, notwithstanding all
                    that has hitherto been done, it appears to be utterly impracticable, in the
                    present state of our knowledge, to obtain a satisfactory explanation of all the
                    phenomena of optics, considered<pb break="no" facs="nls:193355232" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5232-0633"/> as mechanical operations, upon any hypothesis
                    respecting the nature of light that has hitherto been advanced. It will,
                    therefore, be desirable to consider the facts which have been discovered, with
                    as little reference as possible to any general theory; at the same time, it will
                    be absolutely necessary, as a temporary expedient, to borrow from the undulatory
                    system Dr Young’s law of the interference of light, as affording the only
                    practicable mode of connecting an immense variety of facts with each other, and
                    of enabling the memory to retain them; and this adoption will be the more
                    unexceptionable, as many of the most strenuous advocates for the projectile
                    theory have been disposed, especially since the experiments of Mr Arago and Mr
                    Fresnel, to admit the truth of the results of all the calculations in which this
                    law has been employed. The details of its application to particular cases,
                    together with an examination of the phenomena of polarisation and of oblique
                    refraction, will occupy the principal part of this article; but it will also be
                    necessary to premise an account of the few cases of the exhibition of colours
                    which appear to be independent of its operation.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Separation of
                    Colours by</hi><hi rend="italic">Réfraction.</hi></p><p>The separation of white light into different colours, as its component parts, by
                    refraction, though firmly established as an optical fact by Newton, had been in
                    general somewhat negligently examined as to its details, until Dr Wollaston
                    pointed out the inaccuracy of the common subdivision of the colours of the
                    prismatic spectrum into seven different species. There is little reason to doubt
                    that white light consists of an infinite number of rays, varying gradually among
                    each other, without any marked distinctions, and continued, on the one hand,
                    into the dark chemical rays, and, on the other, into the rays of invisible heat;
                    and that all these varieties are separable from each' other by refraction, and
                    preserve always a distinct and constant refrangibility. The species of
                    homogeneous light, however, distinguishable from each other by the eye, are only
                    five,—red, yellow, green, blue, and violet; which are uniform in their
                    appearance, and well-defined in their limits, whenever a perfect spectrum is
                    correctly exhibited, whether obtained by interposing a prism between the eye and
                    a small, or rather narrow bright object, or between a lens and the image of such
                    amobject formed in its focus; while, in the common method of admitting a beam of
                    the sun’s light through a prism, without either employing a lens, or previously
                    limiting the angular extent of the beam, it is obvious that there must be a
                    double source of the mixture of colours; and hence has arisen the Newtonian
                    division of the spectrum into seven parts, which were somewhat fancifully
                    compared, with respect to their extent, to the intervals of the minor diatonic
                    scale in music; although it has been shown by Dr Blair, and still more fully by
                    Dr Brewster, that their proportions are liable to very great variations,
                    according to the nature of the refracting substances employed.</p><p>Dr Brewster has remarked, that as, according to the fundamental law of
                    refraction, a prism with a large angle must occasion a dispersion of the several
                    colours somewhat greater than two smaller prisms of the same substance, having
                    together an equal mean refractive power; so also the dispersion of the most
                    refrangible or violet rays amongst themselves will be always somewhat greater in
                    a prism with a larger angle, than in two smaller prisms having an equal mean
                    dispersive power. Hence the green and blue will be less removed from the red
                    towards the violet by the single prism, the refraction of the green remaining in
                    defect, when compared with the mean of the whole. So that, if the two prisms be
                    employed to correct the mean dispersion of the single one, and the extreme rays
                    of the spectrum be brought to a perfect coincidence, the refraction of the green
                    by these prisms being comparatively in excess, the green rays will be found on
                    the side towards which their refraction tends to carry them; and the two extreme
                    portions of red and violet will be left together, forming a crimson, on the side
                    towards which the refraction of the larger prism is directed. It is obvious also
                    that if, instead of the two smaller prisms, a single one of an equal angle, but
                    of twice the dispersive power, were substituted, the joint effect would be
                    nearly the same. Dr Brewster has, however, observed, that in almost all such
                    combinations of different substances, the green is on the side towards which the
                    refraction of the larger prism is directed; so that the original proportion of
                    the space occupied by the different rays in the spectrum must be different for
                    different substances. Dr Brewster has found that the violet is the most
                    dispersed by oil of cassia and by sulphur, and least by sulphuric acid and by
                    water; the distribution afforded by these substances appearing to vary from two
                    parts of red, three green, four blue, and three violet, to about four red, three
                    green, three blue, and two violet; while the yellow is always confined to a
                    narrow line.</p><p>The immediate effects of the combinations of the primitive colours on the sense
                    of sight afford an illustration of some of the physiological characters of
                    sensation in general. It is well known that a mixture of red and green light
                    produces a simple sensation, perfectly identical with that which belongs to the
                    minute portion of yellow light originally found in the spectrum; and that a
                    mixture of green and violet makes a perfect blue. The blue colour of the flame
                    of spirit of wine, for example, is derived entirely from a mixture of green and
                    violet rays; while the blue light of the lower part of the flame of a candle is
                    shown by the prism to consist of five different portions, belonging to different
                    parts of the spectrum, nearly resembling those which would be distinguished if
                    we looked through a prism at a small portion of a transparent plate of a certain
                    minute thickness. It is obvious, therefore, that the eye has no immediate power
                    of analysing such light; and if we seek for the simplest arrangement, which
                    would enable it to receive and discriminate the impressions of the different
                    parts of the specimen, we may suppose three distinct sensations only to be
                    excited by the rays of the three principal pure colours falling on any given
                    point of the retina, the red, the green, and the violet; while the rays
                    occupying the intermediate spaces are capable of producing mixed sensations, the
                    yellow those which belong to the red and green, and the blue those which belong
                    to the green and violet; the mixed excitement producing in this case, as well as
                    in that of mixed light, a simple idea only: although it must be observed that no
                    homogeneous light can extend its action so far as to excite at once the
                    sensations of the fibres belonging to the red and the violet; so that every
                    crimson must necessarily be a compound colour. A mixture of red and blue light
                    exhibits an effect which appears unintelligible upon the supposition that a
                    compound light ought to produce a colour intermediate between those of its
                    constituent parts; but this difficulty will vanish, if we assume that the blue
                    of the spectrum contains a greater proportion of violet than of green; so that
                    the green is neutralized into a white by a mixture with the red and part of the
                    violet, and the remaining violet gives its character to the whole, either alone,
                    or with a mixture of red, according to the proportions employed.</p><p>When we look through a prism at a luminous object of considerable extent,
                    surrounded by a dark space, the spectra belonging to the several parts of the

                    white, except towards the ends of the object, where the extreme parts project
                    beyond each other. At the red end of the spectrum the whole of the red belonging
                    to the extreme point retains its place unaltered, and the green and blue become
                    a greenish yellow, nearly uniform in its appearance, throughout the space which
                    belongs to them, while the place of the violet is scarcely distinguishable from
                    the neighbouring white light; but at the opposite end the violet retains its
                    place and appearance, and the remaindcr of the length of the spectrum becomes of
                    a green, inclining more or less to blue, and continuing to be very distinctly
                    visible throughout the extent of the simple spectrum, the place of the red
                    included; so that the illuminating power of the red end of the spectrum must be
                    incomparably greater than that of the violet end; as may also be inferred by a
                    direct comparison of the distinctness of objects viewed in these different
                    lights. The portion of light totally reflected at the internal surface of a
                    dense medium, on account of the obliquity of its incidence, is bounded by a
                    fringe or bow resembling the red end of the luminous object viewed through a
                    prism; and the transmitted portion is bounded by the violet and blue fringe; but
                    it requires some caution, in observing these colours, to avoid the optical
                    deception which causes the neighbouring space to appear of the complementary
                    colour, espe-cially when the eye is turned towards it immediately after having
                    received the impression of the colours actually exhibited.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Colours of Halos
                    and Parhelia.</hi></p><p>The immediate effect of the different refrangibility of light in the production
                    of colours is sometimes spontaneously exhibited, in the atmospherical phenomena
                    of halos and parhelia, or paraselenes, attending the sun or moon; the edge
                    nearest to the luminary being generally reddish, and the remoter parts more or
                    less green and blue, although without any well-marked separation of the
                    different tints. These appearances had been long ago referred by Mariotte to the
                    refraction of the prismatic crystals of snow floating in the atmosphere, and
                    descending through it in all possible positions, but more especially in a
                    vertical or horizontal direction, on account of the effect of gravity, combined
                    with that of the resistance of the air; and sometimes perhaps, from their
                    connection with other crystals, making angles of 60° with either of these
                    positions. This theory, however simple and satisfactory, bad been very
                    unaccountably neglected for more than a century, and even superseded by the
                    awkward and unsupported conjectures of Huygens respecting the existence of
                    spherical or cylindrical particles of hail, including opaque nodules, related to
                    them in a certain constant ratio; or by the equally inadmissible calculation of
                    Newton, which assigns a partial maximum to the density of the light simply
                    refracted through a spherical drop of water when the deviation is about 26°; and
                    it is only a few years since that the doctrine of Mariotte was revived and
                    extended by Dr Young, and approved by Mr Cavendish and Mr Arago.</p><p>In some of the highest northern latitudes these appearances of halos and parhelia
                    are almost constant; and in warmer countries they are confined to the light
                    clouds which occupy the higher and colder regions of the atmosphere. The halos
                    are broad circles, with their interior margin tolerably well defined, and about
                    the distance of 22° and 46° from the sun or moon, but less distinctly terminated
                    externally. Now the angle of 22° exactly corresponds to the deviation produced
                    by a prism of ice, with a refracting angle of 60°, when it becomes a minimum
                    from the equality of the angles of incidence and emergence; and in other
                    positions of the prism the deviation increases very slowly, till it becomes a
                    few degrees greater. Hence the breadth of the circles of each ' colour being
                    considerable, the colours must fall principally on each other, and become very
                    indistinctly separated. The external circle may be referred to the effect of two
                    such refractions in succession. Mr Cavendish seems to have thought the angle
                    somewhat too great to be derived from this source; and he suggested that it
                    might depend on a single refraction by the rectangular terminations of the
                    crystals; but it does not appear that such terminations are very commonly
                    observable; and it may easily be shown that the greatest intensity of the light
                    of a halo formed by two refractions must be at more than twice the distance of
                    the edge of the inner halo, derived from one only.</p><p>These halos are commonly accompanied by a white horizontal circle passing through
                    the sun, derived from the reflection of the vertical faces of the crystals,
                    which are scattered equally throughout all possible azimuths. There are also
                    generally coloured parhelia on each side, depending on the refraction of these
                    vertical prisms; they are commonly a little without the halos, because the
                    deviation of the light passing obliquely through these crystals is somewhat
                    greater than that of the light transmitted by the crystals which have their axes
                    perpendicular to the plane of incidence and refraction. For a similar reason,
                    the light passing through the crystals horizontally in various azimuths is
                    variously modified, so as to produce the appearance of inverted arches, touching
                    the halos at their highest points, and sometimes expanding in tint form of a
                    pair of wings, with a point of contrary flexure on each side.</p><p>The anthelia seem to be referrible to two refractions and an intermediate
                    reflection within the same crystal, causing a deviation of about 120 + 22 ≈
                    142°; and sometimes with two intermediate reflections, producing an angle of 60
                    + 22 = 82° only. It is not, however, very easy to assign a reason for the
                    appearance of an anthelion exactly opposite to the sun, which is said to have
                    been sometimes seen in the horizontal circle; but it has been delineated with
                    the accompaniment of an oblique cross, and of other unusual appearances, which
                    must have been derived from extraordinary forms of the compound crystals of snow
                    existing at the time of the observation in the atmosphere.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Colours of the

                    but Descartes first applied the true law of refraction, which had recently
                    before been discovered, to the determination of the angular magnitude both of
                    this and of the secondary rainbow; although no sufficient reason could be
                    assigned for the appearance of colours in either of them, until Newton
                    ascertained the different retrangibilities of the different kinds of rays; but
                    as soon as this discovery was established, the method of fluxions at once
                    enabled him to determine precisely the limit at which the broad expanse of light
                    belonging to each colour must necessarily terminate in an edge of greater
                    brilliancy; the bright edges of the different colours projecting, gradually
                    beyond each other, so as to form a spectrum somewhat mixed, but still
                    approaching to the common appearance of a spectrum obtained by the refraction of
                    a prism; and in fact the angular distances of the exterior termination of the
                    primary rainbow and of the interior of the secondary, from the sun, are found to
                    agree very accurately with the calculation of the extreme deviations of the red
                    rays reflected once and twice respectively within the spherical drops of rain;
                    although <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355258" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5258-0635"/>the whole breadth of the coloured appearances is
                    liable to variations dependent on the magnitude of the drops," ańd belonging to
                    the phenomena of supernumerary rainbows, to be described hereafter.</p><p>The light reflected from very small portions of water appears to be incapable of
                    producing a regular rainbow. Thus we scarcely ever see a rainbow in a cloud,
                    unless it has united its drops, so that they begin to descend in the form of
                    rain. Dr Smith has observed this circumstance, and has attributed it to a
                    tendency of the bright edge of the expanse of light to lose its intensity, by
                    being gradually dissipated into the neighbouring dark space; a tendency which he
                    would probably have been much at a loss to explain from any of the received
                    doctrines of optics, but which bears some analogy to the effects more commonly
                    observed in beams of light admitted into dark spaces, and sometimes designated
                    by the term diffraction.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV.— <hi rend="italic">Of Periodical Colours in
                    general.</hi></p><p>By far the greater part of the phenomena of colours, except their separation by
                    simple refraction, are referrible to the description of periodical or recurrent
                    colours; being characterized by an alternation which is generally repeated,
                    where the observation is sufficiently extensive, several times in succession,
                    while the circumstances on which they depend are varied uniformly and by slow
                    degrees. The number of these alternations, when light perfectly homogeneous is
                    employed, appears to be continued without any discoverable limit, although it is
                    always smaller, for any given change of circumstances, when the least
                    refrangible or red light is employed, than when the observation is made on the
                    most refrangible or violet; so that mixed or white light always produces a
                    combination of alternations arranged according to a series of different
                    intervals, which are at first more or less distinct, but by degrees are so mixed
                    with each other as again to be lost in the general effect of white light. In all
                    these cases the appearances may be reduced to calculation by means of the
                    general law of the interference of two portions of light, with its appropriate
                    modifications and corrections.</p><p>A. <hi rend="italic">The law is, that when two equal portions of light, in

                    as the difference of the times occupied in their separate paths is an even or an
                    odd multiple of a certain half interval, whiclι is different for the different

                    Plates.</hi></p><p>The colours exhibited by very thin plates of transparent or semitransparent
                    substances have been well known to optical philosophers, from the time that they
                    were first noticed <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> by Boyle, and more
                    particularly examined by Hooke and Newton. They may be readily observed by
                    pressing together any two clean pieces of common plateglass, which have always
                    sufficient convexities and concavities to exhibit them, touching each other in
                    some poitìts, and leaving elsewhere a thin plate of air between them; or, still
                    more conveniently, by selecting from the plano-convex lenses, kept by the
                    opticians, such as have their flatter sides very slightly convex, and are
                    consequently calculated to throw the spaces of equal thickness, and the colours
                    dependent on them, into the form of rings. The colours are most distinct when
                    they are formed in the light reflected from the two surfaces in contact,
                    especially when care is taken to exclude the foreign light re- . fleeted by the
                    surfaces not concerned in their production; and in this case they begin from a
                    central dark spot, immediately surrounded by a bright light, and then by rings
                    more distinctly coloured, while the colours, exhibited in light transmitted
                    through the glasses, begin from a bright spot in the centre, surrounded by a
                    dark ring, being always exactly complementary to the colours seen by reflection;
                    to which they are also, as Mr Arago has demonstrated, either exactly or very
                    nearly equal in intensity, although they have generally been supposed to be much
                    less vivid, on account of the diminution of their effect on the cye by their
                    mixture with the whole of the beam of light which affords them. But if we employ
                    for the observation tŵo flattish pieces of glass, held in such a position as to
                    transmit the light received from one part, and to reflect an image of another
                    part, of an object equally illuminated throughout its extent, the two series of
                    colours will destroy each other, and the whole appearance of rings will vanish.
                    When, on the contrary, the illumination of the object varies materially, the
                    rings will re-appear in one or other of their forms, according to the different
                    intensities of the lights received from its different parts; so that, as Mr
                    Arago has ingeniously suggested, this test might be employed to answer the
                    purpose of a photometer, for ascertaining the equality of the lights of two
                    distant objects.</p><p>If any thin plate affording colours be inclined to the direction of the light
                    passing through it, the appearance of the colours will be changed either
                    precisely or very nearly· in the same manner as if the thickness were reduced in
                    the ratio of the radius to the cosine of the inclination within the plate; at
                    least, if this proportion is not perfectly accurate, the deviations from it, in
                    the experiments of Newton, arc manifestly within the limits of the unavoidable
                    errors of observation.</p><p>We are indebted to Mr Arago for the important fact, that the colours observed in
                    transmitted light are distinguished by a polarisation opposite or transverse to
                    that which is appropriate to transmitted light in general, and possessing the
                    ordinary character of the polarisation produced by partial reflection. It is in
                    light thus reflected that we must seek for one of the two portions which are to
                    be combined according to the laws of interference, in the case of the colours
                    seen by transmission, and for both in the case of reflection. The light
                    transmitted simply through the plate will be followed by a portion which has
                    been reflected back from the second surface to the first, and forwards again
                    from the first to the second; and the difference of the times occupied in these
                    different paths will obviously be proportional to the thickness of the plate,
                    and also, according to the modification (B) of the law, to its refractive
                    density; so that the number of alterations of any given colour between the
                    central spots of the rings and any given point will be as the thickness of the
                    plate at that point; and the numbers for different colours will <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355271" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5271-0636"/>be inversely as
                    the magnitudes of the appropriate intervals; the plate appearing light when
                    illuminated by a homogeneous colour, only where the thickness corresponds to any
                    exact multiple of the interval, and dark at the intermediate points; and this
                    proportion is found to agree perfectly with experiment. The two reflections
                    within the plate being always of the same kind, will either not require any
                    correction on account of their nature (C), or will altogether add a whole
                    interval to the length of the path; an alteration which makes no change in the
                    appearances.</p><p>When the incidence is oblique, the actual length of the two passages of the
                    reflected ray across the plate AB, BC, is as twice the secant of the angle of
                    refraction ABD, and its advance upon the surface AC, as twice the tangent; and
                    this advance, reduced to the direction of the transmitted ray AE without the
                    plate, must be subtracted from the retardation within the plate; the reduction
                    being in the proportion of the radius to the sine of the angle of incidence ACE,
                    for which, if we substitute that of the radius to the sine of the angle of
                    refraction ADF or CDG, we shall have the deduction required to be made from the
                    length of the path within the plate, since the velocities vary directly as these
                    sines; and by this deduction the secants AB, BC, will be reduced to the cosines
                    BF, BG: so that the true retardation will always be proportional to the cosine
                    of refraction.</p><p>The same demonstration is applicable to the difference of the paths of the two
                    portions of light reflected once only, from the upper and lower surfaces of the
                    plates respectively, supposing A, the point of emergence of the transmitted ray,
                    to become the point of incidence of a new reflected ray HA. Hence it might be
                    expected that all the phenomena of colours should be the same as in the case of
                    transmitted light; and this really appears to happen when the observation is
                    made on a plate of air contained between a transparent substance and a polished
                    surface of gold or silver; or on a plate of a refractive density intermediate
                    between the densities of the neighbouring substances, as in the instance of a
                    thin coat of smoke or of an oxide, adhering to any polished metallic surface,
                    which is at first of a yellowish white, and, as it becomes thicker, changes to a
                    yellow and an orange colour; but in more common cases there is a loss of half an
                    interval in one of the two reflections only, so that the thicknesses affording a
                    perfect coincidence for any species of colour, are always intermediate between
                    the thicknesses affording the same colour by transmission; and hence the tints
                    of the two series of rings are always complementary to each other, the series
                    seen by reflection always beginning from a dark central spot, when they are
                    exhibited by any detached transparent substance, as a soap bubble, a thin film
                    of glass or of talc, or by a plate of air contained between two plates of glass,
                    or between a plate of glass and a piece of polished steel.</p><p>There is a peculiarity in the surface of silver and gold, and perhaps of some
                    other metals, that, besides the regular reflection at an angle equal to that of
                    incidence, a considerable quantity of light is dispersed irregularly; and this
                    light, as Mr Arago has observed, is polarised in a direction transverse to that
                    of the usual polarisation by reflection; there is also in the irregular
                    reflection no loss of a half interval; so that it exhibits, with a piece of
                    glass, a series of rings resembling those which are produced by polished steel,
                    except that their dimensions are not varied exactly in the same proportion by
                    the obliquity of the incidence, because the light which forms them is not
                    required to pass towards the metal in an angle exactly equal to that which it
                    makes upon its return after reflection; and there will probably be considerable
                    irregularities in the interval of retardation, according to the mode of
                    performing the experiment; although in general the irregular dispersion or
                    diffraction from the glass is too weak to afford colours easily observable, when
                    the position of the plate differs considerably from that in which the light is
                    regularly reflected. If a portion of polarised light is incapable of interfering
                    with another portion polarised in a transverse direction, these rings ought to
                    disappear when the angle of incidence on the plate of glass is about 55°, since
                    in this case the light reflected by it is completely polarised in the plane of
                    incidence: and this disappearance seems actually to have been observed in some
                    of Mr Arago’s experiments, though in others, where the metallic surface was less
                    highly polished, the polarisation of the dispersed light may have been less
                    complete, and the rings may still have been visible at this angle. <hi rend="italic">(Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Arcueil,</hi> vol. iii. p. 354,

                    Plates.</hi></p><p>When light is transmitted in succession through two plates, differing but little
                    in thickness, they exhibit an appearance of colour similar to that which would
                    be produced by a single plate equal in thickness to their difference; and this
                    appearance is wholly independent of the distance of the plates from each other.
                    It was first noticed by Mr Nicholson in the glasses employed for the sights of
                    sextants, and is attributed by Dr Young to “the rays twice reflected in the
                    second only.” In some circumstances, however, the light returning from the
                    second glass to the first, and again reflected by it, may co-operate in the
                    effect, the interval of retardation being the same in both cases. Mr Knox has
                    more lately described some very striking appearances of colours, obtained in
                    this way, by the combination of two pairs of lenses, each exhibiting their
                    appropriate rings when viewed separately, and affording together a third series
                    of rings of larger dimensions when the two former arc unequal in magnitude, and
                    of straight bands when they are equal. It is in fact easily demonstrable, that
                    in order that the thicknesses of the plates of air, contained between two
                    unequal pairs of lenses, may be equal, the distances from the centres of contact
                    must be in a constant proportion; and it is well known that all the points from
                    which the lines drawn to two given points are in a constant proportion, will be
                    found in the circumference of a circle, the diameter of which is a third
                    proportional to the difference and sum of the segments of the given distance of
                    the points: so that the colours, depending on this difference, instead of
                    beginning as usual from a white central spot, will begin from a white ring, and
                    will be arranged in concentric rings on each side of it, precisely in the same
                    order as when they form concentric rings round an actual point of contact; and
                    when the curvatures of the two pairs of lenses are equal, the diameter of the
                    circle becoming infinite, it will obviously be converted into a right line.</p><p>Dr Brewster has observed a series of similar phenomena <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355284" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5284-0637"/>produced by two
                    plates, of equal thickness, but forming a small angle with each other, so as to
                    be differently inclined to the light passing through them. The effect of the
                    inclination being to reduce the virtual thickness of the plate in the ratio of
                    the cosine, and the difference of the cosines of equi-different arcs being
                    simply as the sine of their half sum, it is evident that the colours must
                    correspond to a thickness which varies nearly as the sine of the angle of
                    incidence, considered with regard to a plane bisecting the angle formed by the
                    plates; and this result agrees correctly with Dr Brewster’s experiments.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VII.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Colours of
                    Supernumerary Rainbows and Glories.</hi></p><p>Within the common primary rainbow, and without the secondary, we sometimes
                    observe a partial repetition of colours, more or less distinctly marked, and
                    extending occasionally to several alternations; the repetitions occupying
                    somewhat narrower spaces, as they are more remote from the ordinary bows. These
                    appearances seem to have been first described by Mariotte; they have been since
                    noticed by Langwith, Daval, and Dicquemare; and the term supernumerary rainbows
                    has been very properly applied to them. The coloured circles called glories may
                    generally be seen surrounding the shadows of our heads when we have an
                    opportunity of standing on a high hill, and observing them in a cloud below us;
                    they are also sometimes accompanied by a large white circle, which, in an
                    observation of Ulloa, was 67° in diameter; and such a circle may frequently be
                    distinguished when the sun shines on a mass of vapour rising from a warm bath,
                    of nearly the same dimensions, or sometimes a little smaller. The whole of these
                    phenomena may be explained, from the interference of some of the portions of
                    light regularly reflected within the minute drops of water, with other portions,
                    incident at a different angle, but, after an equal number of reflections,
                    coinciding ultimately with them in direction: supposing only the clouds in
                    question to afford a number of these drops, varying but little from each other
                    in diameter. We find, by the well-known mode of calculating the greatest
                    deviation, that each order of reflections exhibits a zone from 30° to 10° in
                    breadth, through which a double light is diffused by each drop; and, besides
                    this, when there have been more than three reflections, the portions belonging
                    to the opposite sides cross each other in one or more points, and surround the
                    drop, or rather the observer, if we consider the effect of the refraction of a
                    multitude of drops situated in all directions. Supposing the index of refraction
                    for the extreme rays 1∙336, and its logarithm ∙!258000, the results will be
                    these:—</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Extreme</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Final</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"/><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Deviation.</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Deviation.</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>1 reflection</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>41° 40 ’</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>13° 52'</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>9</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>51 41</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>69 12</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>3</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>40 39</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>27 44</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>4</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>45 2</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>55 20</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>5</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>50 0</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>41 36</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>6</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>34 14</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>41 28</p></cell></row></table><p>We may obtain a more distinct idea of these duplicatures if we represent them in
                    a diagram, showing the angular extent of the diffusion of light derived from
                    each order of reflections, and distinguishing by different kinds of lines the
                    portions belonging to the opposite halves of the drops; and it will be obvious,
                    from the inspection of this figure, that the appearances in question have only
                    been observed within some of the duplicatures of the orders to which they
                    belong, between the angles of extreme and of final deviation. The tertiary and
                    quaternary bows (HI. IV.) are evidently too near the luminary to be visible; the
                    quinary (V.) ought to be seen in the space between the primary and secondary;
                    but it is probably much too faint to be visible under any circumstances. The
                    duplicature belonging to the primary rainbow exhibits two portions, for which we
                    may calculate the interval of retardation in parts of the radius of the drop,
                    supposing the velocity to be that which is appropriate to the air, by taking
                    twice the difference of the cosines of incidence on the drop, and multiplying
                    twice that of the cosine of refraction by the index 1∙336; the difference of
                    these differences giving the interval for the two portions, of which the
                    direction has been found to coincide by a previous calculation.</p><table><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Distance</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Anσ</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>le of</p></cell><cell role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><p>Difference</p></cell></row><row role="data" rows="1" cols="1"><cell cols="3" role="data" rows="1"><p>from the Edse.

                    little with the refractive density: thus, for violet light, the index of
                    refraction being probably about 1∙346, and its logarithm •1290000, the greatest
                    deviation will be found 40° 14'; and for a deviation 2° less, the angles of

                    since it exhibits no appearance of colour between the primary and secondary
                    rainbows, it must necessarily be extremely faint. The interval which it affords,
                    by the comparison of its two portions, agrees sufficiently well with that which
                    is derived from four reflections, to contribute in some measure to the
                    production of an alternation of light and shade; but the separate colours would
                    be rather wcakened than strengthened by the mixture: thus, at the deviation of

                    so that we shall have a circle about 70° in diameter, at the circumference of
                    which all the colours will be united, and which will consequently be white. This
                    magnitude agrees tolerably well with the direct observations of the phenomenon;
                    and if we wish to make the agreement more complete, we have only to suppose the
                    drops a little smaller, and the coloured glories, which they are capable of
                    affording, a little larger. It has already been remarked, that the
                    non-appearance of the ordinary'rainbow, in this case, must be referred to the
                    operation of something like, diffraction; although it is obvious that its form,
                    under such circumstances, would necessarily be somewhat modified by the
                    diffusion of the colours through a greater space than that which they ordinarily
                    occupy.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VIII.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Colours of
                    Striated Substances.</hi></p><p>It was observed by Boyle that small scratches of any kind on the surfaces of
                    polished substances exhibited, when viewed in the sunshine, a variety of
                    changeable colours; and the observation may easily be repeated with any piece of
                    metal not too highly polished, and placed in a strong but limited light. Dr
                    Young ascertained by experiment that the colours afforded by some regular lines
                    drawn on glass always corresponded to an interval, varying as the sine of the
                    angle of deviation from the position in which an image of the luminous object
                    was exhibited by the regular reflection of the surface; and .it is easily shown,
                    that if we suppose two portions of light to be reflected from the opposite edges
                    of the furrow, the difference of their paths must vary in that proportion. Dr
                    Young had conjectured that the colours of the integuments of some of the
                    coleopterous insects might be derived from furrows of this nature; but the
                    conjecture has not been verified by observation. Dr Brewster has, however, very
                    unexpectedly discovered that some similar inequalities are the cause of the
                    colours exhibited by mother of pearl; and he has confirmed the observation by
                    showing that impressions of the surface of this substance taken in black wax, in
                    a hard cement, or in fusible metal, will often exhibit a similar appearance.
                    Where the form of the surface of the mother of pearl is the most regular, it
                    reflects, in an oblique light, a white image of a luminous object, like that
                    which any other polished substance affords; but on one side of this image only,
                    and at some little distance from it, we may observe the first order of recurrent
                    colours, beginning from violet, and occasioned in all probability by the
                    reflections from one side only of an infinite number of parallel striae, formed
                    by the terminations of a minute lamellated structure, nearly but not perfectly
                    perpendicular to the general surface; one side only of each of the little
                    furrows being situated in such a direction as to reflect an image of the
                    luminous object to the eye, and at such a distance that the whole may constitute
                    a regular series of equal intervals. By transmitted light, this substance
                    generally appears of a red or a green colour, changing more or less according to
                    the obliquity, and apparently belonging to some of the higher orders of
                    recurrent colours.</p><p>Dr Young has observed a series of these colours, produced by the parallel lines
                    of some of Coventry’s glass micrometers, drawn at the distance of <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>-⅛θ of an inch from each other, in which the first
                    bright space, or the confine between the green and the red, corresponded to the

                    general theory, the interval for the yellow, derived from Newton’s measurements,
                    being.∙0000235; but in· general these lines exhibit colours much more widely
                    extended, each separate line consisting in reality of two or more scratches at a
                    minute distance from each other.</p><p>There is a remarkable peculiarity in the appearance both of these colours, and of
                    those which are exhibited by substances naturally striated, as by mother of
                    pearl, agate, and some other semitransparent stones; they lose the mixed
                    character of periodical colours, and resemble much more the ordinary prismatic
                    spectrum, with intervals completely dark interposed. This circumstance may be
                    satisfactorily deduced from the general law, if we consider that each
                    interference depends not only on two portions<pb break="no" facs="nls:193355310" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5310-0639"/> separated by a
                    simple interval, but also on a number of other neighbouring portions, separated
                    by other intervals which are its multiples; so that unless the difference of the
                    two paths agrees very exactly with the interval appropriate to each ray, the
                    excess or defect being multiplied in the repetitions, the colour will disappear;
                    consequently each of the stripes, which in other cases divide the space in which
                    they appear almost equally between light and darkness, when homogeneous light is
                    employed, becomes here a narrow line; and their succession affords a spectrum
                    exhibiting very little mixture of the neighbouring colours with each other, and
                    nearly resembling that which is afforded by the simple dispersion of the prism;
                    except that, as in all other phenomena of periodical colours, the blue and
                    violet portions are much more contracted than in the common spectrum.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IX.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Colours of Mirrors,
                    and of thick Plates.</hi></p><p>In all the species of periodical colours which have been described, the two
                    portions of light concerned have both been regularly reflected froŗn different
                    surfaces. The methodical division of the subject now leads us to the
                    consideration of the colours exhibited in light separately reflected from the
                    same surface. These may be denominated in general the colours of mirrors; and
                    they will include as a variety those which are called by Newton the colours of
                    thick plates.</p><p>The general character of these colours is, that they are observed in light
                    reflected by small particles, or irregularly dissipated by a single surface,
                    first in the passage of the beam of light towards the mirror, and then in its
                    return; the difference of the length of their paths affording, as usual, the
                    interval of retardation. Thus, in I)r Herschel’s experiment of scattering a fine
                    powder in a beam of light reflected perpendicularly by a concave mirror, and
                    received on a screen in its return, it may easily be shown that the colours will
                    be precisely such as would be exhibited by light transmitted through a thin
                    plate of air, everywhere half as thick as the plate limited by two spherical
                    surfaces in contact; the centre of the one surface being the particle of powder,
                    and that of the other its image formed by the mirror. For in the direction of
                    the principal ray, which is perpendicular to the mirror, the paths of the light
                    will be of equal length, whether the dissipation takes place before or after the
                    reflection; and in other parts the whole length of the path of the light passing
                    from any local point to its conjugate focus being the same, according to the
                    definition of a conjugate focus in the Huygenian theory, from whatever point of
                    the mirror it may be reflected, the light first dissipated will have advanced,
                    after its reflection, as far as the circumference of a circle, of which the
                    conjugate focus is the centre, at the same instant that the portion coming
                    directly from the powder, after a previous reflection, will reach the
                    circumference of the circle of which the particle of powder is the centre; so
                    that the distance between these two circles must be the difference of the paths
                    of the two portions, and the colours the same as would be exhibited by a plate
                    of air of half the thickness, since such a plate is twice traversed by the
                    retarded light.</p><p>A similar appearance of colours had been obtained, by earlier experimenters, from
                    the interposition of a screen of gauze, or of a semitransparent substance, in
                    the path of the beam falling on the mirror. But the colours of thick plates,
                    observed by Newton, are modified by the nature of the transparent substance
                    employed, and by the obliquity of the refracted light. The dissipation here
                    takes place at the anterior surface of a concave mirror of glass, and the
                    reflection at the posterior, which is coated with quicksilver: and if these two
                    portions proceed, each with a slight divergence, from a perforation in a screen
                    situated near the centre of curvature of the mirror, they will co-operate
                    perfectly with each other in the circumference of a circle described on the
                    screen, of which the diameter is the distance of the perforation from its image;
                    since all the light passing, in any given section of the mirror, with the same
                    obliquity through the glass as the beam itself passes in the principal section,
                    must be collected into a focal point situated in some part of this circle, and
                    will arrive at this point at the same time, whatever its situation in the
                    section may have been; the obliquity of the incident light being the same in
                    every part of the section, because the point of divergence is at the same
                    distance from the mirror as the centre of curvature. For the other parts of the
                    dissipated light, passing with different obliquities, the interval will be
                    determined by the difference between the lengths of the paths of the two
                    portions of light arriving at the given point, the one by regular refraction,
                    after being first dissipated and then reflected; the other by dissipation, after
                    being first regularly refracted and reflected. And this interval agrees
                    precisely with the law which Newton has deduced from his experiments; but the
                    analogy which he infers from it, between these colours and those of thin plates,
                    is in fact very far from amounting to identity; since, if they belonged to the
                    ordinary colours of thin plates, there is no reason why the series should begin
                    anew from a certain arbitrary thickness, differing in every different
                    experiment, which affords a white of the first order.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> X.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Colours of deflected

                    with a portion of the same heam which has pursued its course without
                    interruption; a case which would scarcely have required a separate
                    consideration, but from the difficulty of including it in a general definition
                    with any others; although it is comprehended in the Newtonian description of the
                    colours of inflected light: but since the light is in this case turned away from
                    the substance near which it passes, it may more properly be termed deflected,
                    especially as the greater number of the appearances mentioned, by Newton as
                    depending on inflection, helong more properly to diffraction, and the term
                    inflection might consequently be misunderstood as relating to them.</p><p>When a beam of light is received in a dark room, and suffered to fall upon the
                    edges of two extremely sharp knives or razors, meeting each other in a very
                    acute angle, the shadows of the knives, received on a screen at some distance,
                    will be found to be bordered by several fringes of colours; and the angle will
                    be bisected by a dark line. The distances from the shadows at which these
                    fringes appear agree in general with the supposition of their depending on the
                    interference of the light reflected from the edges of the respective knives,
                    with the uninterrupted light of the beam passing between them; but the
                    coincidence of these portions ought to be perfect in the immediate neighbourhood
                    of the point in which the shadows meet, and the two last bright fringes ought to
                    unite there in an angle of light. This, however, does not happen, on account of
                    the modification of the general law (C), which makes it necessary to allow half
                    an interval for the effect of a very oblique reflection; and for the same
                    reason, the space immediately next to the shadow is always dark instead of being
                    light. If the knives are at all blunt, the reflection from one to the other,
                    where they meet, causes the bisecting dark line to disappear; but this source of
                    error may be avoided by causing one of them to advance a little before the plane

                    different distances from their origin, belong always to a hyperbola, as they
                    ought to do according to the calculation founded on the general law of
                    interference; a fact which had before been inferred from other measurements, but
                    which had not been so distinctly proved by direct experiments. Newton himself,
                    indeed, was so far from believing that these fringes are rectilinear, as Mr
                    Fresnel supposes, that he expressly mentions their curvature, and infers from it
                    that they are not derived from “the same light” in all their parts; imagining,
                    perhaps, that each fringe was of the nature of a caustic line, formed by
                    reflection or refraction, in which the light is everywhere more condensed than
                    in the collateral spaces, but which is by no means necessarily straight. Mr
                    Fresnel has also shown that all the fringes are found exactly at such distances
                    from the true shadow, as would be inferred from the supposition of the loss of
                    half an interval by reflection; while some of the experiments of Newton appeared
                    to indicate a deviation from this law. It has been asserted that fringes of the
                    same kind have been observed at the edges of a detached beam of light, reflected
                    into a dark space by a narrow plane and polished surface; and in this case it
                    would be difficult to point out in what manner the supposed oblique reflection
                    could be produced, or how a diffraction of any kind could cause the light to be
                    redoubled back upon itself; but the experiment does not appear to have been
                    hitherto performed with sufficient attention to all possible sources of
                    error.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> XI.— <hi rend="italic">O] the Colours of
                    diffracted Light</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">including those
                    of Fibres and of Coronce.</hi></p><p>The light reflected from each of the knife edges, in experiments like those of
                    Newton, not only produces colours by its interference with the light proceeding
                    uninterruptedly between them, but also with'another portion, diverging from the
                    edge of the opposite knife, and spreading into its shadow. This tendency of
                    light to diffuse itself was first described by Grimaldi, under the appropriate
                    name diffraction; but many of the phenomena in which it is concerned having been
                    attributed by Newton to other causes, he appears almost to have overlooked its
                    existence.</p><p>The general law of interference is very directly applicable to all phenomena of
                    this kind; the fringes exhibited are broader in the same proportion as the
                    distance between the edges is narrower; and they always depend on the difference
                    of the distance from the edges as the interval of retardation. It is, however,
                    necessary to suppose the same modification to take place in diffraction as in
                    oblique reflection, half an interval being lost in both cases; since the light
                    which deviates the least from a rectilinear direction, and which is derived from
                    the near approach of the two paths to equality, is always white. But it is
                    remarkable, that when the obliquity becomes a very little greater, the
                    diffracted light seems to change its character in this respect; for the colours
                    occupy the same ’spaces as would have belonged to them if they had begun from a
                    dark centre, one of the portions only having lost a half interval in comparison
                    with the other; and of this circumstance no explanation has yet been
                    attempted.</p><p>The diffraction producing these fringes may easily be detected within the eye
                    itself, by holding any object near it in such a position as to intercept nearly
                    all the light of a candle except a narrow line at the edge: this line will then
                    appear to be accompanied by other lines parallel to it, separated from it by a
                    dark space, and becoming wider when the object is brought nearer to the eye.
                    These fringes must be referred to the light diffracted on one side round the
                    object, so as to be spread on the unenlightened part of the retina, and
                    reflected on the other from the margin of the pupil; for if we employ an object
                    narrower than the pupil, so as’to observe them on both sides of it, their
                    magnitude will be altered by any change in the aperture of the pupil, occasioned
                    by admitting light to the opposite eye, or otherwise. In such cases as this,
                    where one of the points of divergence is much nearer to the point of
                    interference than the other, the interval increases more rapidly than the
                    distance from the primitive direction; and the first fringes are much broader
                    than those which succeed them; the mode of their formation approaching to that
                    of the fringes seen in deflected light, commonly called the exterior fringes of
                    the shadow; while the interior fringes belong more immediately to the present
                    subject, that of the colours of diffracted light.</p><p>When the distance of the points of divergence is more nearly equal, the one being
                    collateral to the other, the breadth of the successive fringes is also more
                    uniform. Such is the appearance of the colours exhibited by a number of equal
                    fibres held between the eye and a distant luminous object; their origin being
                    identical with those of the fringes produced in the shadows of the knives,
                    except that the diffracted rays come from the remoter side of the fibres, and
                    follow the reflected rays instead of preceding them, These colours may easily be
                    observed by looking at a candle through a lock of fine wool, and still more
                    distinctly by substituting for the wool some of the seeds of the lycopodium,
                    strewed on a piece of glass; and they become very large if we employ a few of
                    the particles of the blood, or the dust of the lycoperdon, or puffball. Dr Young
                    has made this appearance the foundation of a mode of measuring the fineness of
                    wool, which he has recommended for agricultural purposes, though it seems
                    hitherto to have been found much too delicate to be employed by “the hard hands
                    of peasants” with any advantage. The instrument which he has invented for this
                    examination is called the eriometer, and its scale is calculated to express, in
                    semidiameters of a circle, formed round a central aperture in a card or a plate
                    of brass, and marked by minute perforations, the distance at which the lock of
                    wool must be held, in order that the first bright ring of colours, or the limit
                    of the green and the red surrounding it, may coincide with the circle of points;
                    and the actual measure, expressed by a unit of this scale, is found to agree
                    very nearly with the thirty thousandth of an inch. Thus the particles of water
                    which have been found capable of exhibiting a glory 5° from the shadow of the
                    observer, being about ≤ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>- of an inch in diameter, they would correspond to number fourteen of this
                    scale; and the cotangent of the angle subtended by the semidiameter of the
                    bright circle being fourteen, the angle itself will be about 4°; consequently,
                    if we looked at the sun through such a cloud, he would appear to be surrounded
                    by a bright circle of colours, 8° in diameter, green within and red without, and
                    attended by other colours, more or less distinctly marked, according to the
                    degree of uniformity of the magnitude of the drops. These circles are called
                    coronae: their dimensions vary considerably, but they have seldom been observed
                    quite so large as these drops would make them; and more commonly they seem to
                    depend on drops about a thousandth of an inch in diameter, although it is not
                    easy to ascertain the precise parts of the rings from which the measures have
                    been taken by different observers.</p><p>In the shadow of a larger substance, formed in a beam of light admitted into a
                    dark room, these colours are still perceptible, beginning from a white line in
                    the middle; but here both the portions on which they depend are diffracted into
                    the shadow, and beyond its limits they are lost in the stronger light that
                    passes on each side of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355336" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5336-0641"/>it. Their appearance is somewhat modified when the
                    shadow is formed by a body terminating in an angle; for the breadth of the
                    fringes being inversely as the breadth of the object which forms them, it is
                    obvious that this breadth must increase towards the point of the shadow, like
                    the distance of the fringes formed in the shadows of Newton’s knives: and the
                    fringes seen within the angle must necessarily assume the character of
                    hyperbolas; nor will this form be materially altered when the angle becomes a
                    right one, as in thecrested fringes noticed by Grimaldi, although the steps of
                    the calculation for determining their magnitude are in this case a little more
                    complicated.</p><p>We find, in an elegant experiment of Mr Biot, on the fringes produced by
                    diffraction, a singular confirmation of the truth of the theory which derives
                    these colours from the difference of the times occupied in the passage of the
                    different portions of light to the point of interference; although this
                    celebrated author does not seem to have been aware of the nature of the
                    inference which may so naturally be drawn from it. He found that the densities
                    of the substances, from the margin of which the diffracted light originated, had
                    no influence whatever on the appearances produced by them; but when they were
                    formed in the light diffracted from substances placed at one end of a long tube,
                    and observed on a piece of glass fixed at the other end, they became contracted,
                    upon filling the tube with water, in the proportion of four to three; as was to
                    be expected from the diminished velocity which must be attributed, according to
                    the modification of the general law (B), to the passage of the light through a
                    denser medium.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> XII.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Colours of Mixed
                    Plates.</hi></p><p>The colours of mixed plates depend partly on diffraction, and partly either on
                    reflection or on direct transmission; but their essential character consists in
                    the different nature of the two mediums through which the light passes after its
                    separation.</p><p>When a minute quantity of moisture is interposed between two lenses, it readily
                    divides itself into a great number of smaller portions, scarcely distinguishable
                    by the eye; and the light transmitted through the lenses exhibits rings of
                    colours much larger than those which are ordinarily observed, and depending on
                    the interval afforded by the difference of the velocities in the different
                    mediums, according to the inverse proportion of the refractive densities. If
                    they are viewed in a direct and unconfined light, the rings belong to the series
                    commonly seen by transmission, beginning from a light central spot; both
                    portions passing in this case simply through the separate mediums, and arriving
                    at the eye after some slight diffraction only, which affects both of them in an
                    equal degree; but if a distant dark object is situated immediately behind the
                    lenses, and they are illuminated by a light incident a little obliquely, their
                    character is changed, and they resemble the colours commonly seen by reflection,
                    one of the portions of light being necessarily reflected, as in the ease of the
                    colours of deflected light; so that, when the dark object is situated behind one
                    half of the glasses only, we observe the halves of two sets of rings, of
                    opposite characters, exhibiting everywhere tints complementary to each other.
                    The diameters of the rings vary according to the refractive density of the
                    liquid employed, diminishing as that density increases, and becoming much larger
                    when two liquids, incapable of mixing with each other, and differing but little
                    in refractive density, as oil and water, are employed instead of air and a
                    single liquid.</p><p>The magnitude of the interval may also depend on that of a minute transparent
                    solid substance, immersed in a liquid, instead of being limited by the distance
                    of the two lenses; thus the dust of the lycoperdon, mixed with water, gives it a
                    purplish huc when seen by indirect, and a greenish by direct light; and when
                    salt is added to the water, or oil is substituted for it, the difference of the
                    velocities being lessened, the colours exhibited rise in the series, as if the
                    plate were made thinner.</p><p>Mr Arago has very ingeniously applied the principle of the production of these
                    colours to the construction of an instrument for measuring the refractive
                    densities of different elastie fluids, and of air in different states of
                    humidity; the fluids being contained in two contiguous tubes of a given length;
                    through which the two portions of light are made to pass, previously to their
                    re-union, and to the formation of the bands of colours; and it may easily be
                    conceived, that the delicacy of such a test must be great enough for every
                    determination that can be required, either for the correction of astronomical
                    observations, or for the illustration of the optical properties of chemical
                    compounds.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> XIII.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Laws of the
                    Polarisation of Light.</hi></p><p>The colours first observed by Mr Arago in doubly refracting crystals, and since
                    more particularly analysed by Mr Biot, afford by far the most striking and
                    interesting examples of the colours of mixed plates. In order to understand the
                    laws of these phenomena, it is necessary to be previously acquainted with the
                    affections of polarised light, which were first accurately investigated by
                    Malus, and with the theory of extraordinary refraction, derived by Huygens, with
                    equal elegance and precision, from his peculiar hypothesis respecting the nature
                    of the transmission of light.</p><p>1. Mr Malus discovered, that at a certain angle of incidence, the light partially
                    reflected by a transparent substance receives a peculiar modification, with
                    respect to the plane of reflection, which is called <hi rend="italic">polarisation in that plane.</hi></p><p>2. Dr Brewster observed, that the <hi rend="italic">angle of complete</hi>
                    polarisation is such, that the mean direction of the transmitted light is
                    perpendicular to that of the reflected portion; the tangent of the angle of
                    incidence being equal to the index of the refractive density of the medium.</p><p>3. A ray of polarised light is again subdivided, in the usual proportion, by a
                    second refraction in the plane of polarisation; but when it is refracted in a
                    <hi rend="italic">plane perpendicular</hi> to the plane of polarisation, by a
                    surface properly inclined, <hi rend="italic">there is no partial
                    reflection;</hi> and in intermediate positions, the intensity of the reflection
                    is nearly as the <hi rend="italic">square of the cosine</hi> of the angular
                    distance of the two planes.</p><p>4. A portion of the <hi rend="italic">transmitted</hi> light is polarised in a
                    <hi rend="italic">direction perpendicular</hi> to that of the plane of
                    refraction; so that none of this portion is reflected by a second surface
                    parallel to the first; and wlien there are several parallel surfaces in
                    succession, the whole of the transmitted light becomes at last so polarised,
                    that none of it is partially reflected.</p><p>5. The same transverse polarisation will happen in a <hi rend="italic">greater
                    number</hi> of transmissions, when the <hi rend="italic">angle differs</hi> from
                    that of complete polarisation; and in the same manner a second partial
                    reflection, by a surface parallel to the first, will produce a more complete
                    polarisation, when the first is imperfect.</p><p>6. A perfect polarisation in any new plane, by a partial reflection at the
                    appropriate angle, completely <hi rend="italic">supersedes</hi> the former
                    polarisation; but a reflection or refraction void of any polarising effect,
                    which may be called a <hi rend="italic">neutral</hi> reflection or refraction,
                    changes the direction of the plane of polarisation, according to Mr Biot’s
                    experiments, into that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355349" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5349-0642"/>of the image of the former plane, supposed to be

                    light <hi rend="italic">extraordinarily</hi> refracted, in the <hi rend="italic">transverse direction.</hi></p><p>8. Light <hi rend="italic">previously polarised</hi> is transmitted by the
                    ordinary refraction when its plane of polarisation coincides with the principal
                    section, and by the extraordinary when it is perpendicular to it In intermediate
                    directions, the quantity of light transmitted by each refraction is, according
                    to Malus, as the square of the cosine and sine of the angle formed by the planes
                    passing through the paths of the ray, and a line parallel to the axis in each
                    crystal, supposing the species of refraction to be exchanged.</p><p>9. The rays of light ordinarily transmitted by doubling crystals appear in
                    general to <hi rend="italic">retain their previous polarisation,</hi> like rays
                    transmitted through simple substances; but the extraordinary refraction
                    polarises them, according to Biot, like a neutral reflection at a surface
                    coinciding with the principal section; the new plane of polarisation taking the

                    Extraordinary Refraction.</hi></p><p>The extraordinary refraction of regular doubling crystals may be correctly
                    determined in all circumstances, by means of the Huygenian supposition of an
                    undulation diverging in the form of a spheroid from every point of the medium,
                    the velocity in any given direction being always proportional to the
                    corresponding diameter, so that the successive spheroidal surfaces remain always
                    similar to each other. The relations of the angles of incidence and refraction
                    may be calculated by finding the point in which any of the spheroids, supposed
                    to represent the forms of the elementary undulations, at a given instant, is
                    touched by a plane passing through that point of the surface at which the
                    original beam of light would have arrived, at the same instant, through the
                    external medium; it may also be deduced, somewhat more simply, from the
                    determination of the velocity with which an expanding spheroidal undulation must
                    extend itself on any given surface; a velocity which immediately gives us the
                    direction of the ray in the surrounding medium; and the relation thus obtained
                    will also obviously hold good with respect to a ray returning in the opposite
                    direction. <hi rend="italic">( Quarterly Review,</hi> No. xxi.)</p><p>In common refractions, if we compare the space described by an undulation or any
                    given surface with the radius, the velocities appropriate to the different
                    mediums will be represented by the sines of the respective angles; but the
                    velocity with which a spheroidal undulation advances on any surface is evidently
                    determined by the increment, or the fluxion, of the perpendicular to the
                    circumference of the section of the spheroid formed by that surface; and calling
                    this perpendicular <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> the velocity may be considered as
                    proportional to its increment <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> but the velocity of the
                    surrounding medium is to that with which the axis <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    increases, as <hi rend="italic">r</hi> to 1, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> being the
                    index of the ordinary refractive density of the crystal, compared with that of
                    the surrounding medium, since the velocity in the direction of the axis is the
                    same as that which belongs to the ordinary refractive density; consequently, the
                    increment of the path of the undulation in the surrounding medium will be

                    expressed by —, or by d&lt;z ’ r-j-, the evanescent increments of any quantities
                    being always in the ratio of their fluxions: and the plane of refraction or
                    incidence, without the crystal, will always be perpendicular to the tangent of
                    the section formed by the refracting surface. The determination of the relation
                    of the angles is therefore reduced to the calculation of the value of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and of its fluxion.</p><p>Supposing, then, the ratio of the greatest and least refractive densities of the

                    refracting Substances.</hi></p><p>In the case of doubly refracting substances, the first difficulty is, not to
                    explain why the colours of double lights are sometimes produced, but why they
                    are not more universally observable; since it might naturally be expected, as a
                    consequence of the general law of interference, that two portions of the same
                    beam, passing through a moderately thin plate of such a substance, in paths
                    differing but little from each other, and coinciding again in direction, should,
                    in all common cases, exhibit colours nearly similar to those of ordinary thin
                    plates. It would, however, be difficult to conjecture whether they ought to
                    resemble the colours seen by transmission or by reflection; and the fact is,
                    that both these series of colours are at once produced by the substances in
                    question; but they arc so mixed that, without a particular arrangement, they
                    always neutralise each other; and their formation appears to be also limited to
                    certain peculiar conditions of polarisation, consistent with Mr Arago’s
                    observation on the non-interference of two portions of light polarised in
                    transverse directions. Several of the cases, indeed, in which they are exhibited
                    remain still involved in some degree of obscurity; but it is easy to analyse the
                    most important of the phenomena, and to reduce them, with great precision, to
                    the general laws of periodical colours.</p><p>Mr Malus has demonstrated, by satisfactory experiments, that a beam of light,
                    admitted into a doubly refracting crystal, is as much divided by partial
                    reflection at the second surface as by transmission at the first; the directions
                    and the relative intensities of the two portions being precisely the same as
                    those of the two portions of a ray similarly polarised, and returning to the
                    second surface from without in an equal angle; so that, after a farther
                    transmission at the first surface, all the portions become again parallel. When
                    the ray is in the direction of the principal section, there is no separation,
                    each of the pencils proceeding undivided, as they would do if they passed
                    through a second crystal parallel to the first; and the separation becomes most
                    complete when the plane of incidence makes an angle of about 45° with the
                    principal section; each of the portions <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and e, into
                    which the ray is divided upon its admission, affording then two reflections, <hi rend="italic">oθ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">oE, eθ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eE,</hi> of nearly equal intensity. The times occupied by the portions <hi rend="italic">oθ, eE,</hi> will differ most from each other, while <hi rend="italic">oE</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eθ</hi> will describe their paths in
                    equal times of intermediate length; but of these, <hi rend="italic">eθ</hi> only
                    will commonly interfere with <hi rend="italic">oθ,</hi> which has a similar
                    polarisation in the plane of incidence, and <hi rend="italic">οΕ</hi> with <hi rend="italic">eE,</hi> both being polarised in a transverse direction; so that
                    we have two series of colours, depending on an equal interval, except so far as
                    they are distinguished by the inversion of one of the portions belonging to the
                    extraordinary reflection, which renders the series of colours exhibited by them
                    similar to that of the colours of common thin plates seen by reflection, while
                    the ordinary reflection exhibits colours analogous to those of thin plates seen
                    by transmission.</p><p>Mr Biot’s usual mode of exhibiting these colours is to place a thin plate of
                    sulphate of lime, or of any other crystal, on a black substance, to allow it to
                    reflect the white light of the clouds at an angle of incidence of about 55°, and
                    to receive this light on a black glass, at an equal angle of incidence, in a
                    plane transverse to the former, so that the plate may be viewed by reflection in
                    the black glass. In this arrangement, the light reflected from the upper surface
                    of the plate, being polarised in the first plane of reflection, is not reflected
                    by the black glass, and consequently is incapable of rendering the colours less
                    easily perceptible by admixture with them; the beams <hi rend="italic">oθ</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">eθ,</hi> returning by the ordinary reflection, are also
                    similarly polarised, and will be transmitted or absorbed by the glass; but the
                    beams <hi rend="italic">oE</hi> and <hi rend="italic">eE,</hi> being polarised
                    in a transverse direction, will be partially reflected by it, and will exhibit a
                    very brilliant colour, depending on their mutual interference. If, on the
                    contrary, the black glass be turned round the ray, so that the second plane of
                    incidence may <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355388" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5388-0645"/>coincide with the first, the ordinary rays only
                    will be partially reflected by it, and the complementary colour will be
                    exhibited by the union of the portions <hi rend="italic">oθ. eθ</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but this colour will be less distinct, on account of its
                    mixture with the white light reflected by the first surface.</p><p>Appearances of a similar nature may also be observed in the transmitted light,
                    each of the refractions exhibiting the colour complementary to that which it
                    affords by reflection, as happens in the ordinary colours of thin plates; and we
                    must seek for the portions of light which afford them in the successive partial
                    reflections at the two surfaces of the plate, as in the case of the ordinary
                    colours; the light simply transmitted by the separate refractions not exhibiting
                    the ordinary effects of interference, for want of a similarity of polarisation.
                    The obliquity? of the incident light produces similar effects on both
                    series.</p><p>Under some circumstances of the reflection of rays near the perpendicular, Mr
                    Biot observes that the plate assumes the colour which is usually exhibited by a
                    plate of twice the thickness viewed a little more obliquely; and in such cases
                    it is probable that the polarisation of the beams <hi rend="italic">oθ</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">eE</hi> has been so modified as to afford a partial
                    interference; and if this is not the true explanation, it will not be difficult
                    to suppose the interval to be doubled in some other manner by a repeated
                    reflection.</p><p>The effect of a plate of a double thickness is also produced by two equal and
                    parallel plates, through which the light passes in succession, provided that
                    their axes of crystallization be parallel, and that they be of such a thickness
                    as to exhibit in conjunction a colour more easily observable than those which
                    they afford separately; a condition which is more generally applicable to the
                    case in which the axes are transverse to each other, and one of the thicknesses
                    is to be subtracted from the other; since in this situation the two portions of
                    light must always interchange their refractions, and that which has moved the
                    more slowly in its passage through one of the plates, will move the more rapidly
                    in the other. This result is very accurately confirmed by experiment, and
                    certainly affords a very striking illustration of the truth of the law of
                    interference.</p><p>When we wish to examine the effects of the different obliquities of the incident
                    light, it is most convenient to employ a beam previously polarised, which
                    renders the separation of the different portions by a subsequent reflection or
                    refraction more easily practicable; and for these purposes we may either make
                    use of plates of black glass, placed in proper situations, or polarising piles,
                    consisting of a number of oblique thin plates, which produce the effect on the
                    light transmitted through them, with less diminution of its intensity than would
                    take place in a single partial reflection. In some cases, also, the light may be
                    analysed, by causing it to pass through a piece of Iceland crystal; or through a
                    thin plate of agate, which Dr Brewster has found to transmit only such light as
                    is polarised in a particular plane.</p><p>The measurements of the thickness of plates of doubly refracting substances agree
                    in general very accurately with the various tints exhibited by them in various
                    situations with respect to the axis, and with various obliquities of the
                    incident light, according to the theory of periodical colours; and the agreement
                    is always sufficiently perfect to convince us of the dependence of the phenomena
                    on the law of interference, even if it should happen to require some unknown
                    modification in particular cases. In the first place, when the incidence is
                    perpendicular, the thickness of the plates is precisely such as would be
                    inferred from the theory, at least as nearly as the theory is founded on
                    observations sufficiently accurate, although this thickness is often many
                    hundred times as great as that of the thin plates with which it is to be
                    compared; thus the greatest-disproportion of the ordinary and extraordinary
                    refraction of rock crystal, according to Malus’s experiments, is that of 159 to
                    160; so that the difference of the times occupied by light in passing through
                    this substance is to the interval, in virtue of which a similar plate exhibits
                    the common colours, as 1 to 320, and to the interval in a plate of crown glass
                    as 1 to 318; while the experiments of Mr Biot make the observed proportion that
                    of 1 to 360; the difference being no greater than would arise from an error of
                    less than a thousandth part of the whole, in the determination of one of the
                    refractive densities.</p><p>The effect of the obliquity of the incident light, on the colours exhibited by?
                    plates of rock crystal, agrees also perfectly with the theory. The difference of
                    the times required for the ordinary and extraordinary refractions, which is
                    always comparatively small, will vary as the fluxion of the retardation when the
                    obliquity varies; and the sine of ordinary refraction being <hi rend="italic">ξ,</hi> the interval will be expressed by — <hi rend="italic">r -</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">1 .,</hi> d?î when the axis is parallel to the</p><p>√(1- <hi rend="italic">ss)</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi> surface of
                    the plate, and by — <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic">——</hi><hi rend="italic">- dn</hi> when it is</p><p>√(1~gg) perpendicular. Taking, for example, an experiment of Mr Biot, on a plate
                    in which the axis was nearly perpendicular, the mean angle of refraction being
                    21° 38∙5', the tint was a reddish white of the seventh order, answering to the
                    reflection from a plate of glass ∙0000496 of an inch thick, in the experiments
                    of Newton, while the colour exhibited, in a perpendicular light, by a plate of
                    the same crystal, in which the axis was parallel to the surface, would have been
                    expressed by the thickness ∙000332. In these two cases, the values of the
                    fluxion become — <hi rend="italic">rdn</hi> and —∙14633nbζ,∙ and reducing the
                    interval ∙000332 in this proportion, we find ∙0000486 for the thickness of a
                    plate of glass which ought to exhibit the tint corresponding to the oblique
                    incidence; the difference from the experiment being only one millionth of an
                    inch, which would scarcely make a sensible alteration in the colour observed.
                    When the thickness of such a plate is more considerable, or when the
                    eccentricity of the extraordinary refraction is greater, the colours differ,
                    with the incidence, in different parts of the plate; and they are generally
                    disposed in rings concentric with the axis. These rings have been particularly
                    described by Dr Brewster, as observed in the topaz; they are always interrupted
                    by a dark cross, occasioned by the want of light, properly polarised to afford
                    them, in the two transverse directions.</p><p>Mr Biot has made a great number of experiments on the colours of the plates of
                    sulphate of lime, in the form denominated Muscovy talc. They exhibit a general
                    agreement with the results of the calculation, particularly with respect to the
                    constancy of the tint, in all moderate obliquities, when the inclination of the
                    axis to the plane of incidence is 45°; but in other cases the agreement is
                    somewhat less perfect, and the difference is too great to be attributed
                    altogether to accident. The most probable reason for this irregularity?, under
                    circumstances so nearly similar to those which accord with the theory in the
                    case of rock crystal, is the want of a perfect identity of the two refractions,
                    in the direction of the supposed axis; or, in the language employed by Mr Biot
                    with respect to mica, the existence of a double axis of extraordinary
                    refraction: and it is the more credible that such a slight irregularity may?
                    have existed in the sulphate of lime without having been observed, as Dr
                    Brewster has detected a similar property? in the arragonite, though both Malus
                    and Biot had examined this substance very carefully without being aware of it.

                    characters were well determined; the form in which the undulations must be
                    supposed to diverge might properly be termed an <hi rend="italic">amygdaloid,</hi> and the velocities with which the sections formed by the given
                    surface would extend themselves might be deduced from the properties of the
                    ellipsis, nearly in the same manner as they have been determined for the
                    spheroid. The difference of the results of the calculation from the spheroid,
                    and of Mr Biot’s experiments, or rather of the empirical formula derived from
                    them, may be seen in the subjoined table; the first part of which, deduced from
                    the theory, is applicable to all substances affording a regular extraordinary
                    refraction, when the axis is either perpendicular or parallel to the surface of
                    the plate. The first column of decimals shows the equivalent variation of
                    thickness where the axis is perpendicular to the plate, being equal to —thθ
                    product of the sine and tangent of refrac-</p><p>√(1-ff)</p><p>tion; the second represents the variation for an ordinary thin plate, being

                    crystal cut perpendicularly to the axis, which cannot be sufficiently explained
                    on any hypothesis, without some further investigation. These plates seem to
                    transmit the beam of light subjected to the experiment, without materially
                    altering its polarisation, and then to produce different colours, according to
                    the situation of the substance subsequently employed for analysing the light; so
                    that Mr Biot supposes the rays of light to be turned more or less by the
                    crystal, round an axis situated in the direction of their motion; and he has
                    observed some similar effects in oil of turpentine, and in some other fluids.
                    But it is highly probable that all these phenomena will ultimately be referred
                    to some simpler operation of the general law of interference.</p><p>Dr Seebeck and Dr Brewster have discovered appearances of colours, like those of
                    doubly refracting substances, in a number of bodies which can scarcely be
                    supposed to possess any crystalline structure. They are particularly conspicuous
                    in large cubes of glass which have been somewhat suddenly cooled, so that their
                    internal structure has been rendered unequal with regard to tension. The outside
                    of a round mass thus suddenly cooled, being too large for the parts within it,
                    must necessarily be held by them in a state of compression with respect to the
                    direction of the circumference, while they are extended in their turn by its
                    resistance; although in the direction of the diameter the whole will generally
                    be in a state of tension; so that the refractive density may naturally be
                    expected to be somewhat different in different directions, which constitutes the
                    essential character of oblique refraction; and when the proportions of the
                    external parts to the internal are modified by the existence of angles, or other
                    deviations from a spherical form, the arrangement of the tensions must be
                    altered accordingly; and there is no doubt that all the apparently capricious
                    variations of the rings and bands of colours which are observed, might, by a
                    careful and minute examination, be reduced to the natural consequences of these
                    inequalities of density, so far at least as the laws of the extraordinary
                    refraction alone are concerned, although the separation of the light into two
                    portions might still remain unexplained. Effects of the same kind are produced
                    by the temporary operation of partial changes of temperature, producing partial
                    compression and extension of the internal structure of the substance; and even a
                    mechanical force, if sufficiently powerful, when applied externally in a single
                    direction, has been shown, by the same observers, to produce a double
                    refraction; although the difference of the densities thus induced is much too
                    minute to be perceived in any other way than by means of these colours, which
                    are in general so much the more easily seen, as the cause which excites them is
                    the feebler.</p><p>Dr Brewster has also shown that the total reflection of light within a denser
                    medium, and the brilliant reflection at the surfaces of some of the metals, are
                    capable of exhibiting some of the appearances of colour; as if the light
                    concerned were divided into two portions, the one partially reflected in the
                    first instance, the other beginning to be refracted, and caused to return by the
                    continued operation of the same power. In the case of silver and gold, it has
                    already been observed that there appear to be two kinds of reflection,
                    occasioning opposite polarities; and these may possibly be concerned in the
                    production of this phenomenon. The original interval appears to be extremely
                    minute, but it is capable of being increased by a repetition of similar
                    reflections, as well as by obliquity of incidence. Mr Biot has also found that
                    such surfaces, combined with plates of doubly refracting substances, either
                    increase or diminish the equivalent thickness, according to the direction of the
                    polarisation which they occasion. In these, and in a variety of similar
                    investigations, a rich harvest is opened, to be reaped by the enlightened
                    labours of future observers; and the more difficulty we find in fully explaining
                    the facts, upon the general principles hitherto established, the more reason
                    there is to hope for an extension of the bounds of our knowledge of the optical
                    properties of matter, and of all the laws of nature connected with them, when
                    the examination of these apparent anomalies shall have been still more
                    diligently pursued.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> XVI.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Nature of Light
                    and Colours.</hi></p><p>Notwithstanding the acknowledged impossibility of fully explaining all the
                    phenomena of light and colours by any imaginable hypothesis respecting their
                    nature, it is yet practicable to illustrate them very essentially, by a
                    comparison with the known effects of certain mechanical causes, which are
                    observed to act in circumstances somewhat analogous; and, as far as a theory
                    will enable us to connect with each other a variety of facts, it is perfectly
                    justifiable to employ it hypothetically, as a temporary expedient for assisting
                    the memory and the judgment, until all doubts are removed respecting its actual
                    foundation in truth and nature. Whether, therefore, light may consist merely in
                    the projection of detached particles with a certain velocity, as some of the
                    most celebrated philosophers of modern times assert; or whether in the
                    undulations of a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355414" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5414-0647"/>certain ethereal medium, as Hooke and Huygens
                    maintained; or whether, as Sir Isaac Newton believed, both of these causes are
                    concerned in the phenomena; without positively admitting or rejecting any
                    opinion as demonstrably true or false, it is our duty to inquire what assistance
                    can be given to our conception and recollection, by the adoption of any
                    comparison which may be pointedly applicable even to some insulated facts only.
                    It has, however, been thought desirable to separate this investigation as much
                    as possible from the relation of the facts, in order to avoid confounding the
                    results of observation with the deductions from mere hypothesis; an error which
                    has been committed by some of the latest and most meritorious authors in this
                    department. It may be objected to some of the preceding sections, that this
                    forbearance has not been exercised with respect to the general law of
                    interference and its modifications; but it would have been impossible to give
                    any correct statement of the facts in question, without determining whether the
                    appearances depend upon one or both of the portions of light supposed to be
                    concerned.</p><p>Art. 1. (Sect. I.) The separation of colours is explained, in the hypothesis of
                    emission, by the supposition of an elective attraction, different in intensity
                    for the different rays of the spectrum; but for this difference no ulterior
                    cause is assigned. Any original difference of velocity is contrary to direct
                    experiment; and even the alterations of relative velocity, which must inevitably
                    be occasioned by a variety of astronomical causes, have not been detected by the
                    most accurate observations, instituted for the express purpose of discovering
                    them; so that it has been suggested that there may possibly be a multitude of
                    rays of the same colour, moving with various velocities, and only affecting the
                    sense when they have the velocity appropriate to that colour in the eye. The
                    name of elective attraction is indeed little more than a mode of expressing the
                    fact, without referring it to any simpler mechanical cause; and in chemical
                    elective attractions the substances concerned are under very different
                    circumstances with respect to contact, and with respect to the probable
                    influence of the form and bulk of their integral particles; at the same time it
                    seems impossible to show any absurdity in the supposition of the existence of
                    such an elective attraction with regard to the different kinds of light. On the
                    other hand, if we consider colours as depending on a succession of equal
                    undulations, of different magnitudes as the colours are different, we may
                    discover an analogy, somewhat more approaching to a mechanical explanation, in
                    the motions of waves on the surface of a liquid; the largest waves moving with
                    the greatest rapidity, although the approximate calculation, derived from the
                    most approved theory, leads us to the same expressions for the velocity as are
                    applicable to the transmission of an impulse through an elastic fluid. The fact
                    is, that a larger wave moves more rapidly than a smaller, because the pressure
                    is not precisely limited to a perpendicular direction, as the simplest
                    calculation supposes, but operates also more or less in an oblique direction,
                    principally withiń a certain angular limit; so that the utmost depth at which
                    any difference of pressure can affect the liquid as a motive force, is that at
                    which this angle may be imagined to comprehend virtually the exact breadth of a
                    wave; and since the velocity depends on the depth of the fluid affected at once
                    by the pressure, the breadth becomes in this manner an element of the
                    determination. Thus also the larger undulations, constituting red light, are
                    found to move more rapidly than those of the violet, which are supposed to be
                    smaller; and there are many ways in which the difference may be supposed to be
                    occasioned, although not depending exactly on the same cause as in the case of
                    the waves on the surface of a liquid. It is well known that sounds of all kinds
                    move with an equal velocity through the air, and all colours arrive through the
                    supposed elastic ether in the same time from the remotest planets; but a
                    refractive medium, however transparent, is not to be considered as perfectly
                    homogeneous; in many instances, two mediums, of different qualities, seem to
                    pervade every part of a crystal, which is completely uniform in its appearance;
                    and it seems to be necessary, in every case, to suppose the particles of
                    material bodies scattered at considerable distances through a medium which
                    passes freely through their interstices; so that we may conceive the undulations
                    of light to be transmitted partly through the particles themselves, and partly
                    through the intervening spaces, the two portions meeting continually after a
                    certain very minute difference in the length of their paths; we may then suppose
                    the portion transmitted through the interstices to be weakened by the
                    irregularity of its passage, which will affect the smaller undulations more than
                    the larger; and when these portions are combined with the portions more slowly
                    transmitted through the particles themselves, these last will bear a greater
                    proportion to the former in the violet than in the red light, and will have more
                    influence on the ultimate velocity, which will therefore be smaller for the
                    violet than for the red. This explanation may perhaps be far from the best that
                    the hypothesis in question might afford; but it will serve as an illustration of
                    a possible mode, in which the phenomenon may be referred to the established laws
                    of mechanics, without the continual introduction of new principles and
                    properties.</p><p>Art. 2. (Sect. IV. A.) Most of the ordinary phenomena of optics are capable of a
                    sufficiently satisfactory explanation, on either of the hypotheses respecting
                    the nature of light and colours; but the laws of interference, which have been
                    shown to be so extensively applicable to the diversified appearances of
                    periodical colours, point very directly to the theory of undulation; so
                    directly, indeed, that their establishment has been considered by many persons
                    on the Continent as almost paramount to the establishment of that theory. It
                    might not, however, be absolutely impossible to invent some suppositions
                    respecting the effects of light, which might partially reconcile these laws to
                    the theory of emission. Thus, if we suppose, with Newton, the projected
                    corpuscles of light to excite sensation by means of the vibrations of the fibres
                    of the retina and of the nerves, we may imagine that such vibrations must be
                    most easily produced by a series of particles following each other at equal
                    distances, each colour having its appropriate distance in any given medium; it
                    will then be demonstrable that any second series of similar particles
                    interfering with them, in such a manner as to bisect their intervals, will
                    destroy their effect in exciting a vibratory motion, each succeeding particle
                    meeting the fibre at the instant of its return from the excursion occasioned by
                    the stroke of the preceding, and thus annihilating the motive effect of that
                    stroke. But the illustration ends here; for it seems impossible to adapt it to
                    the greater number of the alternations which occur, during the passage of a ray,
                    through a given space, in a denser medium; since it is an indispensable
                    condition of the projectile theory, that the velocity of light should be
                    increased upon its entrance into a medium of greater refractive density. The
                    Newtonian theory, of fits of easy reflection and easy transmission, is still
                    more limited in its application, since it attributes to one portion of light
                    those effects which have been strictly demonstrated to depend on the presence of
                    two.</p><p>In the undulatory theory, the analogy between the laws of interference, and the
                    phenomena of the tides, and the effects of the combination of musical sounds, is
                    direct and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355427" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5427-0648"/>striking. The existence of an undulation of an
                    elastic medium depends on the recurrence of opposite motions, alternately direct
                    and retrograde, at certain equal distances, in the same manner as a series of
                    waves consists in a number of alternate elevations and depressions, and the
                    succession of the tides in a number of periods of high and low water. The spring
                    and neap tides, derived from the combination of the simple solar and lunar
                    tides, afford a magnificent example of the interference of two immense waves
                    with each other; the spring tide being the joint result of the combination, when
                    they coincide in time and place, and the neap when they succeed each other at
                    the distance of half an interval, so as to leave the effect of their difference
                    only sensible. The tides of the port of Batsha, described and explained by
                    Halley and Newton, exhibit a different modification of the same opposition of
                    undulations; the ordinary periods of high and low water being altogether
                    superseded, on account of the different lengths of the two channels by which the
                    tides arrive affording exactly the half interval which causes the disappearance
                    of the alternation. It may also be very easily observed, by merely throwing two
                    equal stones into a piece of stagnant water, that the circles of waves which
                    they occasion obliterate each other, and leave the surface of the water smooth,
                    in certain lines of a hyperbolic form, while, in other neighbouring parts, the
                    surface exhibits the agitation belonging to both series united. The beating of
                    two musical sounds, nearly in unison with each other, appears also to be an
                    effect exactly resembling the succession of spring and neap tides, which may be
                    considered as the beatings of two undulations related to each other in frequency
                    as 29 to 30; and the combination of these sounds is still more identical with
                    that which this theory attributes to light, since the elementary motions of the
                    particles of the luminiferous medium are supposed to be principally confined to
                    the line of direction of the undulation, while the most sensible effects of the
                    waves depend immediately on their ascent and descent, in a direction
                    perpendicular to that of their progressive motion.</p><p>Art. 3. (Sect. IV. B.) The diminution of the velocity of light upon its entrance
                    into a denser medium, in the direct proportion of the refractive density, is one
                    of the fundamental principles of the undulatory theory, and is perfectly
                    inadmissible on the supposition of projected eorpuseles. But it must be
                    remembered that the demonstration of the actual existence of this proportion is
                    somewhat indirect, being only derived from the necessity of admitting it in the
                    application of the laws of interference to the observed phenomena; and we have
                    no means of obtaining an immediate measure of the velocity of light in different
                    mediums.</p><p>Art. 4. (Sect. IV. C.) The loss of the half interval may be explained, in
                    particular cases, without difficulty, although, in other instances, the
                    circumstances are too complicated to allow us to appreciate their effects. In
                    the direct transmission of a ray of light through a plate of a transparent
                    substance, we may compare the denser medium to a series of elastie balls, larger
                    and heavier than another series in contact with them on each side. Now, it is
                    well known that a series of elastic balls transmits any motion from one end to
                    the other, while each ball remains at rest, after having communicated the motion
                    to the next in order, so that the last only flies off, from having none beyond
                    it to impel; and if the balls, instead of being only possessed of repulsive
                    forces, were connected by elastic ligaments of equal powers, a motion in a
                    contrary direction would be transmitted with equal ease; the last ball, being
                    retained by the ligament, instead of flying off, would draw the last but one in
                    the same direction, itself remaining at rest after this negative impulse; and
                    the motion would be communicated backwards in the same manner throughout the
                    series to the first ball; and then, for want of further resistance, this ball
                    would not remain at rest after receiving the negative impulse, but would be
                    drawn forwards by it, so as to strike the second, precisely in the same manner
                    as at the beginning of the experiment; and this second positive impulse would
                    proceed through the whole series like the first. Such is the nature of the
                    longitudinal vibrations of elastie rods, first observed by Chladni; the cohesion
                    of the substance supplying the place of the supposed elastic ligaments; and in
                    the ease of an elastic fluid, the pressure of the surrounding parts performs the
                    same office, a negative impulse being always propagated through it with the same
                    facility as a positive one. If, instead of a single series of balls, we now
                    consider the effect of two series, the second consisting of larger balls than
                    the first, the last ball of the smaller series will not remain at rest after
                    striking the first of the larger, but will be reflected, so as to strike the
                    last ball but one in a retrograde direction; and this retrograde impulse will be
                    continued to the first ball, constituting a positive impulse with respect to the
                    new direction in which it is propagated. But if the first series of balls be
                    larger than the second, the last of the larger balls will not be deprived of all
                    its motion by striking the first of the smaller, but will continue to move more
                    slowly in its first direction; and the elastie ligaments will then be called
                    into action, so as to carry back step by step to the first ball this remaining
                    impulse, which will become negative with respect to the new direction of its
                    transmission. And the same must happen in the ease of two elastic mediums in
                    contact, supposing them to be of equal elasticity, but of different densities;
                    the direction of the elementary motions either einciding with that of the
                    general impulse, or being opposite to it in both mediums at once, when the
                    reflection is produced by the arrival of the undulation at the surface of a
                    denser medium, and being reversed when at the surface of a rarer; and it is
                    obvious that such an inversion of any regular undulation is paramount to its
                    retardation or advancement, to the extent of half of the interval which
                    constitutes its whole breadth; every affection of such an undulation being
                    precisely inverted at the distance of half the breadth of a complete
                    alternation: and these effects will not materially differ, whether the impulse
                    be supposed to arrive perpendicularly at the surface, or in an oblique
                    direction.</p><p>Art. 5. (Seet. IV. D.; Sect. XIII.) The experiments of Mr Arago, which show that
                    light does not interfere with light polarised in a transverse direction, lead us
                    immediately to the consideration of the general phenomena of polarisation, which
                    cannot be said to have been by any means explained on any hypothesis respecting
                    the nature of light. It is certainly easier to conceive a detached particle,
                    however minute, distinguished by its different sides, and having a particular
                    axis turned in a particular direction, than to imagine how an undulation,
                    resembling the motion of the air, which constitutes sound, can have any
                    different properties with respect to the different planes which diverge from its
                    path. But here the advantage of the projectile theory ends; for every attempt to
                    reduce the phenomena of polarisation to mechanical laws, by the analogy of
                    magnetism, has completely failed of enabling us to calculate the results of the
                    actions of the forces supposed to be concerned, in any correct manner; to say
                    nothing of the extreme complication of the properties which it would be
                    necessary to attribute to the simplest and minutest substances, in order to
                    justify the original hypothesis of a polarity existing in all the particles of
                    light, and a directive attraction, that is, a combination of attraction and
                    repulsion, in every reflecting or refracting substance<pb break="no" facs="nls:193355440" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5440-0649"/>. In the
                    undulatory theory we may discover some distant analogies, sufficient to give us
                    a conception of the possibility of reconciling the facts with the theory, and
                    perhaps even of reducing those facts to some general laws derived from it;
                    although it will be necessary, in this intricate part of the inquiry, to proceed
                    analytically rather than synthetically, and to rest satisfied for the present,
                    without bringing the analysis to a termination by any means explanatory of all
                    the phenomena. Sonic of the supporters of'this theory may perhaps be of opinion
                    that its deficiencies are too strongly displayed by this attempt; but it is for
                    them to find a more complete solution of the difficulties, if any such can be
                    discovered.</p><p>In the case of a wave moving on the surface of a liquid, considering the motion
                    of the particles at some little distance below the surface as concerned in the
                    propagation of an undulation in a horizontal direction, we may observe that
                    there is actually a lateral motion, throughout the liquid, in a plane of which
                    the direction is determined by that of gravitation; but this happens because the
                    liquid is more at liberty to extend itself on this side than on any other, the
                    force of gravitation tending to bring it back with a pressure of which the
                    operation is analogous to that of elasticity; and we cannot find a parallel for
                    this force in the motions of an elastic medium. It is indeed very easy to deduce
                    a motion, transverse to the general direction, from the combination <hi rend="italic">of two</hi> undulations proceeding from two neighbouring points,
                    and interfering with each other, when the difference of their paths amounts to
                    half an interval; for the result of this combination will be a regular though a
                    very minute vibration in a transverse direction, which will continue to take
                    place throughout the line of the propagation of the joint motions, although
                    certainly not with any force that would naturally be supposed capable of
                    producing any perceptible effects. There must even be a difference in the
                    motions of the particles in every simply diverging undulation, in different
                    parts of the spherical surface to which they extend; for, supposing it to
                    originate from a vibration in a given plane, the velocity of the motion
                    constituting the undulation will be greatest in the direction of that plane, and
                    will disappear in a direction perpendicular to it, or rather will there become
                    transverse to the direction of the diverging radii; and in all other parts there
                    must be a very minute tendency to a transverse motion, on account of the
                    difference of the velocities of the collateral direct motions, and of the
                    compressions and dilatations which they occasion. When, also, a limited
                    undulation is admitted into a quiescent medium, it loses some of its force by
                    diffraction on each side, where it is unsupported by the progress of the
                    collateral parts; and if an undulation were admitted by a number of minute
                    parallel linear apertures or slits, or reflected from an infinite number of
                    small wires, parallel to each other, it would still retain the impression of the
                    incipient tendency to diffraction in all its parts, producing a modification of
                    the motion, in a direction transverse to that of the slits or wires. It is true
                    that all these motions and modifications of motion would be minute beyond the
                    power of imagination, even when compared with other motions, themselves
                    extending to a space far too minute to be immediately perceived by the senses:
                    and this consideration may perhaps lessen the probability of the theory as a
                    physical explanation of the facts; but it would not destroy its utility as a
                    mathematical representation of them, provided that such a representation could
                    be rendered general, and reducible to calculation; and, even in a physical
                    sense, if the alternative were unavoidable, it is easier to imagine the powers
                    of perceiving minute changes to be all but infinite, than to admit the
                    portentous complication of machinery, which must be heaped up, in order to
                    afford a solution of the difficulties which beset the application of the
                    doctrine of simple projection to all the phenomena of polarisation and of
                    colours. It is not however possible at present to complete such a mathematical
                    theory, even on imaginary grounds; although a fewfurther analogies between
                    polarisation and transverse motion force themselves on our observation.</p><p>In the theory of emission, the resemblance of the phenomena of polarisation to
                    the selection of a certain number of particles, having their axes turned in a
                    particular direction, supposing these axes, like those of the celestial bodies,
                    to remain always parallel, will carry us to a certain extent, in estimating the
                    quantity of light contained in each of the two pencils into which a beam is
                    divided and subdivided; but it would soon appear that, after a few
                    modifications, this parallelism could no longer be supposed to be preserved: we
                    should also find it impossible to assign the nature and extent of any forces
                    which might be capable of changing the former directions of the axes, and fixing
                    them permanently in new ones. The distinction of a fixed, a movable, and a
                    partial polarisation, which has been imagined by Mr Biot, must vanish
                    altogether, upon considering that all the effects which he attributes to the
                    partial polarisation are observable in experiments like those of Mr Knox, in
                    which there is confessedly no polarisation at all.</p><p>If we assume as a mathematical postulate, in the undulatory theory, without
                    attempting to demonstrate its physical foundation, that a transverse motion may
                    be propagated in a direct line, we may derive from this assumption a tolerable
                    illustration of the subdivision of polarised light by reflection in an oblique
                    plane. Supposing polarisation to depend on a transverse motion in the given
                    plane, when a ray completely polarised is subjected to simple reflection in a
                    different plane, which is destitute of any polarising action, and may therefore
                    be called a neutral reflection, the polar motion may be conceived to be
                    reflected, as any other motion would be reflected, at a perfectly smooth
                    surface, the new plane of the motion being always the image of the former plane;
                    and the effect of refraction will be nearly of a similar nature. But when the
                    surface exhibits a new polarising influence, and the beams of light are divided
                    by it into two portions, the intensity of each may be calculated, by supposing
                    the polar motion to be resolved instead of being reflected, the simple
                    velocities of the two portions being as the cosines of the angles formed by the
                    new planes of motion with the old, and the energies, which are the true measure
                    of the intensity, as the squares of the sines. We are thus insensibly led to
                    confound the intensity of the supposed polar motion with that of the reflected
                    light itself; since it was observed by Malus, that the relative intensity of the
                    two portions into which light is divided under such circumstances, is indicated
                    by the proportion of the squares of the cosine and sine of the inclination of
                    the planes of polarisation. The imaginary transverse motion might also
                    .necessarily be alternate, partly from the nature of a continuous medium, and
                    partly from the observed fact, that there is no distinction between the
                    polarisations, produced by causes precisely opposed to each other, in the same
                    plane.</p><p>Why light should or should not be reflected at certain surfaces, when it has been
                    previously polarised, cannot, even with the greatest latitude of hypothesis, be
                    very satisfactorily explained; but it is remarkable that the transmission is
                    never wholly destroyed, or even weakened in any considerable proportion. We
                    might, indeed, assign a reason for the occurrence of a partial reflection or a
                    total transmission in the constitution of the surface concerned, since every
                    abrupt change of density must necessarily produce a partial reflection, while a
                    gradual transition by insensible steps must transmit each impulse with
                    undiminished<pb break="no" facs="nls:193355453" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5453-0650"/> energy, and without any reflection of finite
                    intensity, as in the well-known case of a collision supposed to be performed
                    with the interposition of an infinite number of balls of all possible
                    intermediate magnitudes. If, therefore, we could find any modification of light,
                    which could cause it to be transmitted from one medium to another in a more or
                    less abrupt manner, we should thus he able to discover a cause of a variation of
                    the intensity of the partial reflection; and this seems to be the nearest
                    approach that we can at present make to an explanation of the phenomenon,
                    according to the undulatory theory.</p><p>Art. 6. (Sect. V.) The equal intensity of the colours of thin plates, seen by
                    reflection and by transmission, is a fact which would not have been expected
                    from the immediate application of the law of interference, and which seems,
                    therefore, at first sight to militate against its general adoption. But this is
                    only one of the many modifications of the law, which are the immediate
                    consequences of its connection with the undulatory theory; and it may be
                    demonstrated, from the analogy of a series of elastic bodies, that no material
                    difference in the intensity of the two kinds of colours ought to be expected in
                    such circumstances. The intensity of a ray of light must always be considered as
                    proportional to the energy or impetus of the elementary motions of the particles
                    concerned, which varies as the square <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> velocity,
                    and not simply as the velocity itself; for if the velocity were made the measure
                    of intensity, there would be an actual gain of joint intensity whenever a ray is
                    divided by partial reflection; since it follows from the laws of the motion of
                    the centre of inertia, that when a smaller body strikes a larger, not the sum,
                    but the difference of the separat’ê^-ipomenta, will remain unchanged by the
                    collision, while ⅜be sum of the energies remains constant in all circumstance^
                    the square of a negative quantity being equal to that of the same quantity taken
                    positively. Thus, supposing an elastic ball, 1, to strike another, of which the
                    mass is r, with the velocity 1, the velocity of the transmitted impulse will
                    be</p><p>2 2 r 1</p><p><hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> ∙, and that of the reflected, —— — 1 — <hi rend="italic">-į-</hi><hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> ∙, the ł'+l’ ?’+1 V <hi rend="italic">r</hi> + l’</p><p>f . 3r 1</p><p>sum of the momenta in theopposite direction^being - , instead of 1, the original

                    to this analogy, the subdivision of the light at the second surface of a plate
                    must be in the same proportion as at the first. We may call this proportion that
                    of <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> to n <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">+ n</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">

                    elementary velocities in either medium, compared among themselves, will be as
                    the square roots of the respective energies. But it may he proved that, in all
                    collisions of two moving bodies, each of the motions produces its effect on the
                    velocities after impulse, independently of the other; so that the changes
                    introduced, in consequence of the motion of one of the bodies concerned, are the
                    same as it would have occasioned if the other had been at rest; and,
                    consequently, if two undulations interfere in any manner, the joint velocities
                    of the particles must always be expressed by the addition or subtraction of the
                    separate velocities belonging to the respective undulations. When, therefore,

                    expressed by <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> interferes with the beam transmitted

                    of the intensity of the light transmitted by the single surface to the intensity
                    of the incident light, the difference being much too slight to be directly
                    perceived by the eye; so that this result may be considered as agreeing
                    perfectly with Mr Arago’s observation.</p><p>We may also obtain, from the analogy with the effects of collision, an
                    illustration of the intensity of the partial reflection in different
                    circumstances; although it is not easy to say what ought to be the precise value
                    of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in the comparison. If we imagined the two mediums to
                    differ only in density, while their elasticity remained equal, which is the
                    simplest supposition, the density must be conceived to vary as the square of the
                    velocity appropriate to the medium; but the value of <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    thus determined makes the partial reflection in general much too intense, and it
                    becomes necessary to suppose it weakened by the intervention of a stratum of
                    intermediate density, such as there is every reason to attribute to the surfaces
                    of material substances in general, from the considerations stated in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cohesion.</hi> However this may be, we shall in general
                    approach sufficiently near to a representation of the phenomenon, by taking the
                    mass <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in the simple proportion of the re- 4 fractive
                    density: thus, in the case of water, making <hi rend="italic">r = -,</hi> we
                    have for the energy of the first partial reflection^—</p><p>= = ∙0204, while the result of Bougucr’s experiments is ∙018; and the agreement
                    is as accurate as could have been expected, even if the whole calculation had
                    not been an imaginary structure. In the case of glass, 'the difference is
                    somewhat greater; and it is natural to expect a greater loss of light from a
                    want of perfect polish in the surface;</p><p>3</p><p>for, taking <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = —, we have ri <hi rend="superscript">

                    8. Whether the index of the refractive density can be so great as this, we have
                    no precise mode of determining; but there seems to be something in the nature of
                    metallic reflection not wholly dependent on the density. Thus it may be
                    observed, that potassium has a very brilliant appearance, though its specific
                    gravity is very low; at the same time, its great combustibility might give it a
                    much higher rank among refractive substances than could otherwise have been
                    expected from its actual density.</p><p>Art. 7. (Sect. XIII.) Although the ingenuity of man <pb break="no" facs="nls:193355466" xml:id="kp-eb0706-5466-0651"/>has not yet
                    been able to devise any thing like a satisfactory reason for the reflection of a
                    polarised ray in one case, and its transmission in another, yet several attempts
                    have been made, with various success, to reconcile the different hypotheses of
                    light with the other phenomena of oblique refraction. The illustrious Mr Laplace
                    has undertaken to reduce the laws of this refraction, according to the
                    projectile system, from the general doctrines of motion; and he has sufficiently
                    demonstrated that the path followed by the light is always such as to agree with
                    the principle of the least action, supposing the law of the velocities
                    previously established; or, in other words, that the sum of the products of the
                    spaces described, into the respective velocities, is always the least possible.
                    To this demonstration it has been objected, that notwithstanding the
                    complication of its steps, it is in fact nothing more than the simple
                    translation of the fundamental law of Huygens into another language; for it is
                    assumed in this theory, upon obvious and intelligible grounds, that the path of
                    light must always be such that the time may be equal with respect to two
                    neighbouring collateral parts of the undulation, which is the well-known
                    condition of a minimum of the whole time employed; and the time being always
                    expressed by the space divided by the velocity, if we suppose the proportions of
                    the velocities to be inverted, as in the two theories respecting light, the
                    expression of the time in the one will be identical with that of the action in
                    the other; consequently the conditions of the propagation of light, in the
                    Huygenian doctrine, must always imply the observation of the law of least action
                    in the opposite hypothesis; and this general proposition Mr Laplace has taken
                    great pains to prove with respect to a particular instance, in which the
                    Huygenian calculation had been found, notwithstanding Newton’s doubts, to agree
                    perfectly with the phenomena. It has also been observed, that the law of the
                    least action is wholly inadmissible as a fundamental principle of motion; that
                    it is completely unphilosophical to multiply unnecessarily the number of
                    postulates or elementary laws; and that although in many cases the principle may
                    be capable of being established as a derivative proposition, yet, in order to
                    demonstrate it, we must assume that the velocity must be the same in all
                    directions, between the same parallel or concentric surfaces, or at any rate
                    must limit our reasoning by conditions incompatible with the nature of the
                    actions, to be considered as the foundation of the laws of extraordinary
                    refraction.</p><p>In this single point, the undulatory theory has every possible advantage over its
                    rival. For the difference of the velocities in different directions, no force
                    has been assigned as a cause, in the projectile system, at all more general than
                    the individual directions of the rays with respect to the axis. But upon the
                    hypothesis of undulations, it has been demonstrated,. without any gratuitous
                    supposition, that every lamellar or fibrous substance must transmit every
                    diverging impulse in the form of a spheroidal surface, supposing only the
                    elasticity to act more powerfully in one direction than another, as it naturally
                    must do in such circumstances. <hi rend="italic">( Quarterly Review,</hi> No.
                    iv.) And when we consider the experiments of Dr Brewster and Dr Seebeck, which
                    show that any compression or extension whatever, acting in a given direction on
                    any transparent solid, is capable of occasioning those appearances of colour
                    which prove the transmission of light by an ordinary and extraordinary
                    refraction, we cannot help imagining that the cause of the elliptic refraction
                    must be of a nature more simple than is consistent with the existence of a
                    multiplicity of attractions, and repulsions, and polarising powers, acting in
                    all manner of directions, with every possible variation of intensity,
                    independently of any assignable variation of the circumstances of the light
                    affected.</p><p>There is however another mode of considering the mechanism of elliptic
                    refraction, which is somewhat less simple and elementary, but which affords us a
                    further analogy to the phenomena of polarisation by reflection and transmission.
                    If we suppose a doubling crystal to consist of a large number of very thin
                    plates, united by a medium differing but little from them in refractive density,
                    this pile will completely polarise the transmitted light, as Malus and Dr
                    Brewter have shown, in a plane perpendicular to that of the incidence, even when
                    the inclination of the surfaces is widely different from that which produces the
                    most complete polarisation at once; and at the same time a part of the light,
                    partially reflected by each plate, will be again reflected by the neighbouring
                    surfaces into its original direction; nor will it be difficult to imagine that
                    the quantity of light thus twice reflected may, from some unknown cause, be
                    rendered ultimately equal to that of the light simply transmitted, which,
                    according to the laws of polarisation, will never exceed half of the original
                    beam. Now the lengths of the paths of these two portions will not only be
                    different, but the difference will vary according to the direction; for while
                    the light simply transmitted proceeds to describe its path, with the uniform
                    velocity belonging to the mean of the two mediums, combined always in a constant
                    proportion, the light twice reflected by each plate will be retarded most of all
                    in the direction perpendicular to the plates, as in the case of the colours of
                    common thin plates; and in oblique directions, the number of plates which it has
                    to pass through in a given space bd(ng as the cosine of the angle of incidence,
                    and the retardation in each plate being also as the same cosine, neglecting the
                    difference between the angles of incidence and redaction, which is supposed to
                    be inconsiderable, the wlt&gt;le retardation will be as the square of the cosine
                    of the inclination to the axis, which is the well-known proportion of the
                    difference of the diameters of a circle, and of an ellipsis approaching near in
                    it. We thus obtain a general idea of the combination of two effects which do not
                    appear to be related in any other point of view, a regular oblique refraction
                    and a distinct polarisation; further than this, the comparison is by no means
                    completely satisfactory; and the great difficulty of all, which is to assign a
                    sufficient reason for the reflection or non-reflection of a polarised ray, will
                    probably long remain, to mortify the vanity of an ambitious philosophy,
                    completely unresolved by any theory. <hi rend="smallcaps">(l. l.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
