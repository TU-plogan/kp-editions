                    statesman, soldier, and poet, descended from a good family in Denbigh, in Wales,
                    was born in London about the year 1515. Having been educated in both
                    universities, but chiefly at Cambridge, he was introduced at the court of Henry
                    VIII. who sent him abroad in the retinue of Sir Henry Knevet, ambassador to
                    Charles V. and he had the honour to attend that monarch on his ill-fated
                    expedition against Algiers in 1541. Soon after the fleet left that place, he was
                    shipwrecked on the coast of Barbary, in a very dark night; and having exhausted
                    his strength by swimming, he chanced to strike his head -against a cable, which
                    he had the presence of mind to catch hold of with his teeth, and, with the loss
                    of several of them, was drawn up by’ it into the ship to which ∙he belonged. Mr
                    Chaloner returned soon after to England, and was appointed first clerk of the
                    council, which office he held during the rest of that reign. On the accession of
                    Edward VI. he became a favourite of the Duke of Somerset, whom he attended to
                    Scotland, and was knighted by that nobleman after the battle of Musselburgh in
                    1547. The protector’s fall put a stop to Sir Thomas Chaloner’s expectations, and
                    involved him in difficulties. During the reign of Queen Mary, being a determined
                    Protestant, he was in some danger; but having many powerful friends, he had the
                    good fortune to escape. On the accession of Queen Elizabeth he appeared again at
                    court, and was so particularly distinguished by her majesty, that she appointed
                    him ambassador to the Emperor Ferdinand I. being the first ambassador she
                    nominated. His commission was of great importance; and the queen was so well
                    satisfied with his conduct, that soon after his return she sent him in the same
                    capacity to Spain. But Sir Thomas was by no means satisfied with this instance
                    of her majesty’s confidence: the courts of England and Spain being at this time
                    extremely dissatisfied with each other, he foresaw that his situation would be
                    very disagreeable, and soit proved. Elizabeth, however, must be obeyed. He
                    embarked for Spain in 1561, ançl returned to London in 1564, in consequence of a
                    request to his sovereign, in an elegy written in imitation of Ovid. After his
                    return he resided in a house built by himself in Clerkenwell Close, where he
                    died in the year 1565, and was buried in St Paul’s. Sir William Cecil assisted
                    as chief mourner at his funeral.</p><p>So various were the talents of Sir Thomas Chaloner, that he excelled in every
                    thing to which he applied himself. He made a considerable figure as a poet. His
                    poetical works were published by William Malim, master of St Paul’s school, in
                    1579. His principal work was that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351059" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1059-0312"/>“Of restoring
                    the English Republic, in ten books,” which he wrote when he was ambassador in
                    Spain.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chaloner,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir Thomas,</hi> the
                    younger, though inconsiderable as an author, deserves to be recorded as a
                    skilful naturalist, in an age when natural history was very little understood in
                    this or any other country; and particularly as the founder of the alum works in
                    Yorkshire, which have since proved exceedingly advantageous to the commerce of
                    this kingdom. He was the only son of Sir Thomas Chaloner mentioned in the last
                    article, and was born in the year 1559. Being very young at the time of his
                    father’s death, the lord treasurer Burghley, taking charge of his education,
                    sent him to St Paul’s school, and afterwards to Magdalen College in Oxford,
                    where, like his father, he discovered considerable talents for Latin and English
                    poetry. About the year 1580 he made the tour of Europe, and returned to England
                    before 1584; for in that year we find him a frequent attendant at the court of
                    Queen Elizabeth. About this time he married the daughter of Sir William
                    Fleetwood, recorder of London. In 1591 he was knighted; and, some time
                    afterwards, discovered the alum mines on his estate at Gisborough, near the
                    river Tces, in Yorkshire.</p><p>Towards the latter end of the queen’s reign, Sir Thomas visited Scotland; and
                    returning to England in the retinue of King James I. found such favour in the
                    sight of that monarch, that he was immediately appointed governor to Prince
                    Henry, whom he constantly attended; and when his royal pupil visited Oxford, he
                    was honoured with the degree of master of arts. How he was employed after the
                    death of the prince is not known. Some years before that event he married a
                    second wife, the daughter of Mr William Blount of London, by whom he had some
                    children. He died in the year 1615, and was buried at Chiswick in Middlesex. His
                    eldest son William was created a baronet in the year 1640; but the title became
                    extinct in 1681. He wrote, 1. Dedication to Lord Burghley, of his father’s
                    poetical works, dated 1579; 2∙ The Virtue of Nitre, wherein is declared the
                    sundry cures by the same effected. Lond. 1584, 4to.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
