                    du</hi></label>, one of the most learned writers of his time, was born at Amiens
                    on the 18th December 1610. His father, who was royal provost of Beauquesne, sent
                    him at an early age to the Jesuits’ College in Amiens, where he soon
                    distinguished himself by his application and quickness of apprehension. Having
                    completed the usual course at this seminary, he applied himself to the study of
                    law at Orleans, and afterwards went to Paris, where he was received as advocate
                    before <pb facs="nls:193348043" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8043-0080"/> the
                    parliament in August 1631. He frequented the courts for some time ; but meeting
                    with little or no success as a barrister, he returned to his native country,
                    where he applied himself to the study of history in all its branches. After the
                    death of his father, Du Cange married, on 19th July 1638, Catherine Du Bos,
                    daughter of a treasurer of France, at Amiens; and seven years afterwards, in
                    1647, he purchased the same office, the duties of which in no degree interfered
                    with or retarded the great literary works in which he had engaged. The plague,
                    which in 1668 desolated the city, forced him to leave Amiens, and go to
                    establish himself at Paris, where he was enabled to consult charters, diplomas,
                    titles, manuscripts, and a multitude of printed documents, which were not to be
                    met with elsewhere. Μ. d’Héronval, his friend, procured for him many curious
                    pieces, and often aided him in his researches. In 1688 he was seized with
                    stranguary, and died of the effects of that malady on the 23d October the same
                    year. To the attributes of a good son, a good husband, and a good father, Du
                    Cange united those of extreme gentleness, affability, and modesty. His industry
                    was exemplary and unremitting ; and notwithstanding the length to which his
                    career extended, the number of his literary works would be incredible, if the
                    originals, all written in his own hand, were not still extant. In his
                    productions are united the characters of a consummate historian, an exact
                    geographer, a profound jurist, an enlightened genealogist, a learned antiquary,
                    and one deeply versed in the science of medals and inscriptions. He knew almost
                    all languages, possessed a thorough acquaintance with the belles-lettres, and
                    from a vast number of manuscripts and original documents drew much curious
                    information respecting the manners and customs of the darkest ages. The learned
                    prefaces of his glossaries afford ample proofs of his philosophical genius, and
                    are, of their kind, models in point both of matter and of style. “ Where,” said
                    Bayle, “ is the learned man among the nations most distinguished for their
                    perseverance in labour, and the patience necessary for copying and making
                    extracts, who does not admire the talents of Du Cange in this respect, and
                    consider him as unrivalled in the pursuits to which he devoted himself? If any
                    one has doubts on the subject, it is only necessary to send him <hi rend="italic">ad peenam</hi><hi rend="italic">libri</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> let him turn over the leaves of these dictionaries, and, be he ever so
                    little learned, he will see that they could not have been composed, except by
                    one of the most laborious and most patient men the world ever produced.” Du
                    Cange published the following works : 1. Histoire de l’Empire de Constantinople
                    sous les Empereurs François. Paris, 1657, folio. 2. Traité Historique du Chef de
                    S. Jean-Baptiste. Paris, 1666, 4to. 3. Histoire de S. Louis, Roi de France,

                    Du Cange died ; and, on his demise, it was edited by Baluze, who published it
                    with an éloge of the author prefixed. After the death of this remarkable man,
                    his manuscript autographs, and his extensive and valuable library, passed to his
                    eldest son, Philip du Fresne, a man of information, but who died, unmarried,
                    four years after his father. Francis du Fresne, the second son, and two sisters,
                    then received the succession and sold the library, when the greater part of the
                    manuscripts was purchased by the Abbé du Champs, who made no use of them, but
                    handed them over to a bookseller called Mariette, who re-sold part of them to
                    Baron Hohendorf. The remaining part was acquired by D’Ηozier, the genealogist.
                    But the French government, sensible of the importance of all the writings of Du
                    Cange, succeeded, after much trouble, in collecting the greater portion of the
                    manuscript autographs of this eminent scholar; and although they had been
                    scattered in Paris, Amiens, and Vienna, very few of them were lost. Among these
                    manuscripts was one, entitled <hi rend="italic">Gallia,</hi> a work of
                    incredible erudition, being a history of France, divided into seven epochs, with
                    a number of dissertations, the greater part of which are finished and ready for
                    the press, whilst, in regard to those which are not so, abundant materials have
                    been provided for completing the author’s design. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
