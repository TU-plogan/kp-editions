                <p><label type="entry">CHAUCER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Geoffrey</hi></label>, who has
                    been styled the Father of English poetry, has had many biographers, but much of
                    his history is involved in considerable obscurity. The year 1328 has been
                    usually assigned as the date of his birth, upon the authority of an inscription
                    on his tombstone, in which he is said to have died in 1400, aged seventy-two.
                    This inscription, however, was not placed on his tomb till the middle of the
                    sixteenth century; and some doubt of its correctness has been expressed in
                    consequence of Chaucer’s deposition as a witness in October 1386, in which he
                    states himself then to have been “forty years and upwards,” and which, if
                    strictly correct, would place his birth about 1345. We are certain, however,
                    from his own words, that he was born in London; but with regard to his descent
                    and parentage there is absolutely nothing known. Leland says he was <hi
                    rend="italic">nobili</hi><hi rend="italic">loco</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >natus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but Spcght, in 1598, informs us, that “in
                    the opinion of some heralds, bee descended not of any great house, which they
                    gather by bis armes.” This, as an old writer observes, “is a slender
                    conjecture,” yet not more so than Speght’s supposition that his father was
                    Richard Chaucer, a vintner, who died in 1348; while Pitts says that he was the
                    son of a knight. It may also be noticed that there was a Robert Chaucer
                    connected with the royal household of Edward II. who perhaps may have stood in
                    that relationship. (, Roi. <hi rend="italic">Scot.)</hi> Leland, who lived in
                    the reign of Henry VIII., asserts that he studied at Oxford; while his signature
                    “Phi-logenet of Cambridge, Clerk,” affixed to one of his early pieces, has been
                    brought forward as more direct proof that he received his education at the
                    latter university. Some of his biographers very gravely assure us that he was
                    first at Cambridge, and then completed his studies at Oxford; after which they
                    say lie went on his travels through France and the Netherlands. The next
                    statement is, that he was a member of the Inner Temple, and that whilst there he
                    was fined “two shillings for beating a Franciscane frier in Fleet Street.”</p>
                <p>Without stopping to consider the probability of these several points, we may
                    observe, that frequent mention of Chaucer, during the more advanced period of
                    his life, occurs in various public instruments; most of which are printed in the
                    Appendix to Mr Godwin’s life of the poet. The first direct information we
                    possess regarding his history is, that, in the autumn of 1359, he was in the
                    army with which Edward III. invaded France. This fact we learn from his own
                    deposition, which further states that he was made prisoner by the French near
                    the town of Retters during that expedition; but we are not informed at what time
                    he was ransomed and returned to England, although we may conclude that he never
                    resumed the profession of arms. The next notice that has been discovered shows
                    that he had attracted the regard of the English monarch, and that he was an
                    attendant on the king’s person. It is a patent in 1367, by which Edward the
                    Third grants Chaucer an annuity of twenty marks, by the title of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> dilectus vallettus noster,’ our valet or yeoman, in
                    consideration of his former and expected services. According to Tyrwhitt, this
                    designation was the intermediate rank between <hi rend="italic">sqιιier</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">grome</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this annuity may be
                    reckoned in our present money at two hundred pounds. In his poem of the Dream,
                    or the Complaint of the Black Knight, written before this time, the poet is
                    supposed to allude to the nuptials of his munificent patron John of Gaunt, with
                    Blanche, heiress of Lancaster. The same poem contains an allusion to the lady
                    whom Chaucer himself afterwards married, although the time of his marriage is
                    somewhat uncertain; but it is admitted that by this alliance he became
                    eventually related to his illustrious patron.</p>
                <p>In June 1370, it appears that Chaucer was abroad in the king’s service; and on
                    the 12th November 1372, being at that time one of the king’s esquires, “scutifer
                    noster,” he was joined in a commission with two citizens of Genoa, to treat with
                    the Duke and Duchess of Genoa, for the purpose of fixing upon some place on the
                    coast of England where the Genoese might form a commercial establishment. It was
                    at this time he enjoyed the opportunity of visiting Petrarch, if his visit to
                    that illustrious poet ever took place, which, however pleasing to the
                    imagination, is somewhat doubtful; as the passage in his Canterbury Tales, upon
                    which his supposed conference with the “worthy clerk of Padua” is founded, is
                    susceptible of a different interpretation. The next notice of Chauccr is, that
                    on the 23d of April 1374, he obtained a grant for life of a pitcher of wine
                    daily, to be received from the hands of the king’s butler in the port of London.
                    On the 8th June 1374 he was appointed comptroller of the customs, and subsidy of
                    wools, &amp;c. in the port of London, during the king’s pleasure; but the patent
                    contains the following injunction, “so that the said Geoffrey write with his own
                    hand his rolls touching the said office, and continually reside there, and do
                    and execute all things pertaining to the said office in his own person, and not
                    by substitute.” The reason of such an express injunction is not known, and it is
                    possible that his majesty may have been insensible of his poetical talents,
                    although this attendance on his official duties seems to have had no prejudicial
                    effect on his genius, as the composition of his House of Fame is assigned to the
                    same period. In November 1375, the wardship of Edmond, son and heir of Edmond
                    Staplegate of Kent, was granted to Chaucer, for which he received L. 104; and in
                    the following year, another grant, to the value of L. 71. 4s. 6d. connected with
                    his office of comptroller of f⅛e customs. In February 1377 Chaucer was joined
                    with Sir Guichard d’ Angle, afterwards Earl of Huntingdon, and Sir Richard
                    Sturry, to negotiate a secret treaty respecting the marriage of Richard, prince
                    of Wales, with Mary, daughter of the king of France. His employment in foreign
                    missions shows that Chaucer had established a personal and political character
                    of some importance; and the emoluments which he received enabled him to live in
                    a state of dignity and hospitality that was in accordance with his natural
                    sociality of disposition.</p>
                <p>The reign of his successor was, on the whole, not so propitious to the poet. On
                    the accession of Richard the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351384"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-1384-0337"/>Second, the annuity of twenty marks was indeed
                    confirmed to him, and his grant of wine was replaced by an equivalent annuity of
                    other twenty marks. He also retained the situation of comptroller of the customs
                    and subsidies, which Edward the Third bestowed on him; but he was doomed to
                    experience a reverse of fortune, in some measure connected with the decline of
                    John of Gaunt’s influence at court. The immediate cause of this reverse is said
                    to have been his connection with a political party, in some disputes between the
                    court and the city of London, in the year 1384. This party was headed by John of
                    Northampton, an opulent merchant, who had been mayor, and was attached to the
                    religious tenets of Wykliffe, and to the political interests of John of Gaunt.
                    The result was, that Chaucer was compelled to fly the kingdom; and he retired
                    first to Hainault, then to France, and finally to Zealand. How long he remained
                    abroad is uncertain; but we find that Chaucer was elected a knight of the shire
                    for the county of Kent in the parliament which met on the 1st October 1386.
                    Whilst attending his parliamentary duties, he was examined at Westminster, on
                    the 15th of October, as a witness “in the court of chivalry,” in the great cause
                    between Sir Richard Scrope and Sir Robert Grosvenor, when he made the deposition
                    to which we have already alluded, the substance of which, in as far as relates
                    to himself, is as follows; “Geoffrey Chaucer, Esquire, of the age of forty and
                    upwards, armed twenty-seven years, being asked whether the arms, <hi
                    rend="italic">azure,</hi> a bend <hi rend="italic">or,</hi> belonged to Sir
                    Richard Šcrope, said Yes; for he saw him so armed in France before the town of
                    Retters, and Sir Henry Scrope armed in the same arms with a white label, and
                    with banner; and the said Richard armed in the entire arms, and so during the
                    whole expedition, untill the said Geoffrey was taken.”</p>
                <p>Whatever maybe the date of Chaucer’s return to England, we have his own testimony
                    that he fled to avoid being examined in relation to certain disturbances; and
                    that after his return he was arrested and confined to the Tower of London. That
                    he was deprived of his comptrollership is also evident, as other persons are
                    named as holding them in December 1386. During his imprisonment he commenced his
                    Testament of Love, an allegorical prose composition, in imitation of Boethius’
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolatione Philosophice,</hi> in
                    which he feelingly laments his own situation, “berafte out of dignitie of
                    office, in which he had made a gatheringe of worldly goodes and “enduring
                    penance in this dark prison, caitifned from frendship and acquaintance, and
                    forsaken of al that any word dare speak.” As the price of his release, it is
                    said, he was obliged to make a confession respecting the conspiracy in which he
                    had been implicated. In May 1388 lie found it necessary to apply for permission
                    to surrender his two grants of twenty marks each in favour of one John Scalby.
                    After this he is said to have retired, to Woodstock, and employed himself in
                    revising and correcting his writings, and enjoying the calm pleasures of rural
                    contemplation, amidst the scenes which inspired his youthful genius. The
                    composition of his Canterbury Tales is usually assigned to this period; when,
                    though long past the prime of life, his mental powers must have been in their
                    fullest vigour.</p>
                <p>In 1389 the Duke of Lancaster having returned from Spain, and resumed his
                    influence at court, it was probably through his influence that, on the 12th July
                    1390, Chaucer was appointed to the office of clerk of the king’s works, the
                    duties of which he was permitted to execute by deputy, with a salary of two
                    shillings per diem. In this office, however, he seems to have been superseded in
                    the course of the following year; but, on the 28th of February 1394, he obtained
                    a grant of twenty pounds yearly for life. On the 4th May 1398, letters of
                    protection were granted him for the space of two years. On the 13th October in
                    the same year he obtained another grant of wine, being one tun yearly during his
                    life.</p>
                <p>Henry the Fourth, the son of his great patron the Duke of Lancaster, ascended the
                    throne in 1399; and from him Chaucer had his annuity of twenty pounds confirmed,
                    with the additional sum of forty marks yearly. The last record of Chaucer that
                    has been discovered is a lease of a tenement in the garden of the chapel of the
                    thessed Mary of Westminster, dated on Christmas eve 1399. But the poet was not
                    privileged to benefit long by these grants, as his death is said to have
                    occurred at London on the 25th October 1400, at the age of seventy-two. The
                    chief evidence on which the date of his decease rests is the inscription on his
                    tomb, which was erected in the year 1556, by Nicholas Brigham, a gentleman of
                    Oxford, an ardent admirer of the great English poct, and who no doubt had
                    sufficient grounds, either from a previous inscription, or other information,
                    for fixing the date. Chaucer lies interred in the south cross aisle of
                    Westminster Abbey, in a place consecrated to the poetical genius of England.</p>
                <p>Such is a brief abstract of nearly every fact relating to Chaucer that has been
                    discovered; and upon which, aided by ample conjectural inferences, Mr Godwin
                    constructed a life of the poet, which extends to two large volumes in 4to, and
                    was reprinted in four vols. 8vo. Besides the Memoir by Sir Harris Nicoas,
                    contained in his valuable historical and genealogical notes to the Scrope and
                    Grosvenor Roll, recently ptinted, the curious reader is referred to the Reverend
                    Mr Todd’s “Illustrations of the Lives and Writings of Gower and Chauccr.” Lond.
                    1810, 8vo.</p>
                <p>Chaucer’s works have been preserved in a variety of early manuscripts, which
                    attest their continued popularity, and have been very frequently printed. One of
                    the earlier productions of Caxton’s press is an edition of the Canterbury Tales,
                    without date, but printed about 1475. He also published a second edition, six
                    years after the first, on being informed of the imperfections of that edition.
                    It may be worthy of mention, in proof of Chaucer’s popularity in Scotland, that
                    one of the earliest specimens of the Scotish press was an edition of his
                    Complaynt of the Black Knight, which was printed at Edinburgh, by Chep-man and
                    Myllar, in 1508, under the title of“The Maying or Disport of Chaucer.” The first
                    collected edition of his works was edited by William Thynne, and printed by
                    Godfrey in 1532. They passed through several subsequent editions during the
                    sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, besides later republications. The edition
                    of the Canterbury Tales edited by Thomas Tyrwhitt, one of the most learned and
                    accomplished of scholars, whose attention had been directed to old English
                    literature during the last century, is worthy of the highest commendation for
                    accuracy and critical acumen. It was printed at London 1775, in 5 vols. 8vo, and
                    reprinted at Oxford 1798, in 2 vols. 4to, and also more recently in London in
                    its original form. A complete edition of Chaucer’s works, from a collation of
                    the earlier MSS. would be a most important addition to old English
                    literature.</p>
                <p>Chaucer’s merits as a poet are of no ordinary kind; but in considering his
                    poetical character, it is necessary to attend to the age in which he lived, in
                    order to ascertain to what extent he may be said to have improved our language
                    and versification. Chaucer himself, while he exposes the absurdity of his
                    countrymen, like Gower, writing in a foreign language, seems to have entertained
                    no very exalted idea of the vernacular tongue. During the thirteenth and
                    fourteenth centuries there had been several English poets whose remains are
                    interesting chiefly for their antiquity; but it remained as a distinction for
                    the reign of Edward the Third to produce works which tended<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193351397" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1397-0338"/> to exalt and fix the
                    standard of our present language. In our veneration for Chaucer, however, too
                    much influence in this respect has been attributed exclusively to his writings.
                    It was the policy of the English monarch, rather than the poetical genius of
                    Chaucer, which gave importance and dignity to the language, by causing it to be
                    spoken at court, and to be substituted in all public and judicial proceedings,
                    instead of the Norman-French, which had been introduced at the Conquest in 1066,
                    and which had continued to be employed for nearly three centuries. Among the
                    eminent men who adorned the reign of Edward the Third, the first in priority of
                    date is Langland, the reputed author of the Visions of Piers Plowman. In his
                    Visions, which are written in very obscure alliterative language, the author’s
                    object was to expose the abuses which then prevailed, and to bring about a
                    reform in the morals both of the clergy and aristocracy. To accomplish this,
                    with striking originality in his character as a moral satirist he depicts the
                    various orders of society, and inveighs with great boldness against the depraved
                    conduct of the clergy, and the corruptions of the papal government. The
                    composition of this work has been fixed to the year 1362; and although the
                    satire is considerably affected by the general personification in which the
                    author indulged, there can be little doubt that the Visions contributed to
                    improve the moral feelings of his contemporaries; and if his work had no
                    beneficial effect upon the literature of the time, it at least remains as a
                    monument of true poetical genius.</p>
                <p>Another poet of distinction, contemporary with Chaucer, was John Gower. He is
                    generally <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> allowed to have been a man of extensive
                    learning, but not of much natural genius. In fact his claims as an English poet
                    are considerably lessened, as his French ballads are among his best productions;
                    and one of his great works, the <hi rend="italic">Vox</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Clamantis,</hi> is in Latin. Neither is Laurence Minot, who wrote various
                    narrative ballads on the subject of the Wars of Edward the Third, entitled to
                    any very marked distinction as an original writer.</p>
                <p>Chaucer may have been known as a poet at the time Langland’s Visions were
                    written; but his greatest work is at least twenty years later in date. His chief
                    merit in regard to versification consisted in rendering it more natural,
                    regular, and comprehensive, by discarding alliteration, and by reducing the
                    irregular Alexandrine metre to the heroic measure in an uniform and equal number
                    of syllables. This adoption of the decasyllabic couplet has been used by nearly
                    every great English poet from Spenser to Byron, who declared it to be “the best
                    adapted measure to our language.” In the structure of his verse generally, when
                    compared with some previous writers, or with the numerous class of English
                    metrical romances, there will not be found any essential distinction. But in
                    contributing to the improvement of the English language, perhaps no author ought
                    to be put into competition with the illustrious reformer Wyklifte. In addressing
                    the different classes of society, he was obliged to use the vernacular dialect;
                    and he inveighed against the corruptions of the time, not under the veil of cold
                    allegorical personification, but in a bold and open manner, which must have been
                    productive of important consequences in exciting the intellectual energies of
                    the people. The extent and variety of knowledge he displayed far exceeded that
                    of most of his contemporaries; and, being persuaded that the surest mode of
                    enlightening the people would be the perusal of the Scriptures in their own
                    tongue (although at the time it was affirmed by illiterate ecclesiastics to be
                    heresy to speak of the Holy Scriptures in English), he accomplished a
                    translation, which of itself, in a literary point of view, is sufficient to have
                    immortalized his name.</p>
                <p>Chaucer’s writings partake much of his own personal character and spirit, as
                    influenced by his intercourse with the world and his employment in public
                    affairs. If his writings had not much influence upon the moral feelings of his
                    contemporaries, they had at least a most important influence upon the literature
                    of his country. But while his more immediate followers imitated the
                    peculiarities of his “ornate” style and manner, they suffered his spirit and
                    grace to evaporate; their chief object being an accumulation of ornament and an
                    exuberance of diction to which every thing else was subservient. It is
                    sufficiently remarkable, that during the greater part of Chaucer’s poetical
                    career, he contented himself with transferring into our language the most
                    popular works of contemporary French and Italian writers, but in a manner which
                    gives them the character of original productions rather than that of
                    translations. In these earlier works there is elegance of fancy and
                    picturesqueness of description; but all the grace and beauty of his allegorical
                    compositions fall infinitely short of his power of delineating living character,
                    as displayed in his immortal work the Canterbury Tales.</p>
                <p>In this work, the idea of which was no doubt derived from Boccaccio, he brings
                    together a motley crew of“syn-dry folke,” who “in felowshyp” are travelling
                    together on a pilgrimage to the shrine of St Thomas of Becket, to Canterbury;
                    and, as the means of affording instruction and amusement, they agree, each of
                    them in their turn, to relate a story, the details of which, with the incidents
                    that happen, and, above all, the description of the character and manners of the
                    persons themselves who are thus assembled, form a picture of life and manners
                    altogether unrivalled. Nothing can exceed the skill shown in the general
                    prologue, in which the habits of life and peculiarities of disposition of the
                    different pilgrims are so singularly and so strikingly contrasted, with a rich
                    vein of humour, and great discrimination of human nature.</p>
                <p>We cannot do better than conclude with an extract from the work of an eminent
                    contemporary, who has shown himself to be in every respect a master in the art
                    of poetical criticism.</p>
                <p>“Chaucer’s forte,” says Mr Campbell, “is description; much of his moral
                    reflection is superfluous; none of his characteristic painting. His men and
                    women are not mere ladies and gentlemen, like those who furnish apologies for
                    Boccaccio’s stories. They rise before us minutely traced; profusely varied, and
                    strongly discriminated. Their features and casual· manners seem to have an
                    amusing congruity with their moral characters. He notices minute circumstances
                    as if by chance; but every touch has its effect to our conception so distinctly
                    that we seem to live and travel with his personages throughout the journey.</p>
                <p>“What an intimate scene of English life in the fourteenth century do we enjoy in
                    those tales, beyond what history displays by glimpses, through the stormy
                    atmosphere of her scenes, or the antiquarian can discover by the cold light of
                    his researches! Our ancestors are restored to us, not as phantoms from the field
                    of battle, or the scaffold, but in the full enjoyment of their social existence.
                    After four hundred years have closed over the mirthful features which formed the
                    living originals of the poet’s descriptions, his pages impress the fancy with
                    the momentary credence that they are still alive; as if Time had rebuilt his
                    ruins, and were rc-acting the lost scenes of existence.” <hi rend="italic"
