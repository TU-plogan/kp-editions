                    Burghlcy, treasurer of England in the rcign of Queen Elizabeth, was the son of
                    Richard Cecil, Esq. master of the robes to King Henry VIII. He was born in the
                    house of his grandfather, David Ceci), Esq. at Bourn, in Lincolnshire, in the
                    year 1520, and received the rudiments of his education in the grammar school at
                    Grantham. From this seminary he was removed to Stamford, and about the year 1535
                    was entered of St John’s College, Cambridge. Here he began his studies with a
                    degree of enthusiastic application very uncommon in young gentlemen of family.
                    At the age of sixteen he read a sophistry lecture, and at nineteen a voluntary
                    Greek lecture, which was the more extraordinary as at that time the Greek
                    language was by no means universally understood. In 1541 he went to London, and
                    became a member of the society of Gray’s Inn, with an intention of studying the
                    law; but he had not been long in this situation before an accident introduced
                    him to King Henry, and gave a new bias to his pursuits. O’Neil, a famous Irish
                    chief, having brought to court with him two <pb break="no" facs="nls:193350500"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-0500-0269"/>Irish chaplains, violent bigots to the Romish
                    faith, Mr Cecil, happening to meet these ecclesiastics when on a visit to his
                    father, had a warm dispute with them in Latin, in which he displayed uncommon
                    abilities. The king, being informed of the circumstance, ordered the young man
                    into his presence, and was so pleased with his conversation that he commanded
                    his father to find a place for him. He accordingly requested the reversion of
                    the <hi rend="italic">custos brevium,</hi> which Mr Cecil afterwards possessed.
                    About this time he married the sister of Sir John Cheke, by whom he was
                    recommended to the Earl of Hertford, afterwards Duke of Somerset and
                    protector.</p>
                <p>Soon after King Edward’s accession, Mr Cecil came into the possession of the
                    office of <hi rend="italic">custos brevium,</hi> worth about L.240 a year; and
                    his first lady dying in 1543, he married the daughter of Sir Anthony Cook,
                    director of the king’s studies. In 1547 he was appointed by the protector master
                    of requests, and soon afterwards attended his noble patron in his expedition
                    against the Scots, and was present at the battle of Musselburgh. In this battle,
                    which was fought on the 10th of September 1547, Mr Cecil’s life was miraculously
                    preserved by a friend, who, on pushing him out of the line of a cannon-shot, had
                    his arm shattered to pieces. The sight and judgment of his friend must have been
                    as extraordinary as his friendship, to perceive the precise direction of a
                    cannon-ball; unless we suppose that the ball was almost quite spent, in which
                    case the thing is not impossible. The story is told in his life by a domestic.
                    In the year 1548 Mr Cecil was made secretary of state; but in the following year
                    the Duke of Northumberland’s faction prevailing, he suffered in the disgrace of
                    the protector Somerset, and was sent prisoner to the Tower. After three months’
                    confinement he was released, restored to his office in 1551, and soon afterwards
                    knighted and sworn of the privy council. In 1553 he was made chancellor of the
                    order of the Garter, with an annual fee of a hundred merks.</p>
                <p>On the death of Edward VI. Sir William Cecil prudently refused to have any
                    concern in Northumberland’s attempt in favour of the unfortunate Lady Jane Grey;
                    and when Queen Mary succeeded to the throne, he was graciously received at
                    court; but not choosing to change his religion, was dismissed from all his
                    employments. During this reign he was twice elected knight of the shire for the
                    county of Lincoln, and often spoke in the House of Commons with great freedom
                    and firmness, in opposition to the ministry. Nevertheless, though a protestant
                    and a patriot, he had die address to steer through a very dangerous sea without
                    suffering shipwreck.</p>
                <p>Queen Elizabeth’s accession, in the year 1558, immediately dispelled the cloud
                    which had obscured his fortunes and ministerial capacity. During the horrid
                    reign of her sister he had constantly corresponded with the princess Elizabeth;
                    upon the very day of her accession, he presented her with a paper containing
                    twelve articles necessary for her immediate dispatch; and, in a few days after,
                    he was sworn of the privy council, and made secretary of state. His first advice
                    to the queen was to call a parliament; and the first business he proposed after
                    it had assembled was the establishment of a national church. A plan of
                    reformation was accordingly drawn up under his immediate inspection, and the
                    legal establishment of the church of England was the consequence. Sir William
                    Cecil’s next important concern was to restore the value of the coin, which had
                    been considerably debased in the preceding reigns. In 1561 he was appointed
                    master of the wards, and, in 1571, created Baron of Burghley as a reward for his
                    services, particularly in having lately stifled a formidable rebellion in the
                    north. The following year he was honoured with the garter, and raised to the
                    office of lord high treasurer of England. From this period we find him the prime
                    mover of every material transaction during the glorious reign of Queen
                    Elizabeth. Notwithstanding the temporary influence of other favourites, Lord
                    Burghley was, in fact, her prime minister, and the person in whom she chiefly
                    confided in matters of real importance. Having filled the highest and most
                    important offices of the government for forty years, and guided the helm of the
                    state during the most glorious period of English history, he departed this life
                    on the 4th of August 1598, in the seventy-eighth year of his age. His body was
                    removed to Stamford, and there deposited in the family vault, where a
                    magnificent tomb was erected to his memory.</p>
