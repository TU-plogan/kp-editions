                <p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">very</hi> ancient and ingenious game, performed by two
                    persons, with thirty-two pieces of wood or ivory called men, on a square board
                    divided into sixty-four equal squares, usually stained black and white
                    alternately. Each player has sixteen men, those of the one player being usually
                    black, and those of the other white, in order to distinguish them.</p>
                <p>Of the sixteen men on either side, eight are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pieces,</hi> and eight <hi rend="italic">Pawns.</hi> The eight pieces consist
                    of a <hi rend="italic">King,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Queen,</hi> two <hi
                    rend="italic">Castles</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rooks,</hi> two <hi
                    rend="italic">Bishops,</hi> and two <hi rend="italic">Knights.</hi></p>
                <p>The men may be thus represented:</p>
                <p>The following diagram represents the board, with the men as placed on it when a
                    game is to be played:</p>
                <p>Each row of squares running from the bottom to the top of the board is called a
                    <hi rend="italic">file.</hi> Each row of squares running from side to side is
                    called a <hi rend="italic">rank</hi> or <hi rend="italic">line.</hi> Four lines
                    of squares belong to the black men, and four to the white. A row of squares
                    running obliquely from one side of the board to the other is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">diagonal.</hi> A diagonal consists either wholly of black squares
                    or wholly of white.</p>
                <p>The board must be so placed between the two players, that each of them may have a
                    white corner at his right hand. This manner of placing the board, though not
                    essential to the game, is invariably observed.</p>
                <p>The eight pieces are ranked up on the first line of the board next each player,
                    according to the following distribution: The two rooks occupy the two lateral
                    squares which form the angles of the board; the two knights occupy the squares
                    next to the rooks; the two bishops are next to the knights; and the king and
                    queen occupy each of them one of the two centre squares of the line, <hi
                    rend="italic">the queen being upon a square of her own colour.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sequitur regina
                    colorem.</p></note> It follows, that when the pieces are properly placed, the
                    white king will be found occupying the square to the right, and the black king
                    the square to the left, each of his respective queen.</p>
                <p>The pieces on the king’s side of the line are called the king’s bishop, the
                    king’s knight, and the king’s rook. Those on the queen’s side are called the
                    queen’s bishop, the queen’s knight, and the queen’s rook.</p>
                <p>The eight pawns are ranked up on the second line of squares, and take their
                    denomination from the several pieces before -which they are respectively placed.
                    Thus, the pawn in the square in front of the king is called the king’s pawn, the
                    one in front of the queen is called the queen’s pawn, and so on with the rest,
                    as king’s bishop’s pawn, queen’s bishop’s pawn, king’s knight’s pawn, queen’s
                    knight’s pawn, king’s rook’s pawn, queen’s rook’s pawn.</p>
                <p>In like manner the <hi rend="italic">squares</hi> of the board take their
                    denomination from the several pieces. The square occupied by the king at the
                    beginning of the game is called the king’s square, the one occupied by the queen
                    the queen’s square, and so on. The square immediately in front of the king’s
                    square is called the king’s second square, the one in front of his second square
                    is his third square, and the one in front of his third is his fourth square. The
                    eight pieces of each of the two players have thus their respective squares, and
                    second, third, and fourth squares, exhausting among them the whole sixty-four
                    squares of the board. For the sake of clearness, however, it is sometimes
                    convenient to carry the numeration into the adverse side of the board. Thus, the
                    square in front of the king’s fourth is sometimes called his <hi rend="italic"
                    >fifth</hi> square, and so on to the eighth square, which of course is the
                    adverse king’s square.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pawn</hi> moves straight forward on its own file, one
                    square at a time, except at first setting off, when, in the option of the
                    player, it may move two squares at once. For example, if it be proposed to move
                    the king’s, pawn, which stands on its own square, being the king’s second
                    square, it may be moved either to the king’s third or to his fourth square, but
                    afterwards it can be moved forward only one square at a time.</p>
                <p>The pawn, although it moves straight forward, attacks and captures its
                    adversaries diagonally or obliquely. Thus suppose a white pawn to be on its
                    king’s fourth square, and a black pawn to be also on its king’s fourth square,
                    the one pawn cannot attack and take the other; on the contrary, the one stops
                    the other in its progress onward. But suppose the black pawn to be on its
                    queen’s fourth square, then the white pawn can attack and take the black pawn.
                    This is done by removing the black pawn from the board, and advancing the white
                    pawn obliquely, and placing it on the square left vacant by the removal of the
                    black pawn; that is to say, the white pawn is removed from its own king’s fourth
                    square, and placed on the adverse queen’s fourth square. It still retains the
                    name of the king’s pawn. When this pawn has again occasion to move, it goes
                    straight forward on its new file, unless it should avail itself of another
                    opportunity of making a capture, when it again passes obliquely to a square in
                    another file. When a pawn has arrived at the eighth or last square of the file,
                    it loses its character of a pawn, and may be converted into any piece, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193353659" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3659-0512"/> except the king,
                    that the player chooses. He is said to <hi rend="italic">queen</hi> his pawn
                    when he carries it up to the ultimate square.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hnight</hi> moves in a manner somewhat difficult to be
                    described. It leaps obliquely over an adjoining square to one of the next
                    squares, having a colour different from the colour of the square which it
                    leaves. For example, let the king’s knight be on its own square; it may be moved
                    to the king’s second square, to the king’s bishop’s third square, or to the
                    king’s rook’s third square; or, supposing it to be-standing on its king’s fourth
                    square, it may be moved to the king’s knight’s third square, or to the king’s
                    bishop’s second square, or to the queen’s second square, or to the queen’s
                    bishop’s third square, or to the adverse queen’s bishop’s fourth square, or to
                    the adverse queen’s third square, or to the adverse king’s bishop’s third
                    square. On turning to the diagram, the reader will be able easily to follow and
                    understand this description of the knight’s move. It is the only piece that is
                    allowed to move <hi rend="italic">over</hi> another.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">bishop</hi> moves diagonally forward or backward any number
                    of squares at a time, provided the course be open, by being free of other men. A
                    bishop must necessarily continue to move over squares of a colour the same with
                    that on which it was originally placed. The one bishop always moves upon black
                    diagonals, the other upon white.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">rook</hi> or <hi rend="italic">castle</hi> moves straight
                    forward, straight backward, or straight across, any number of squares at a time,
                    provided the intermediate squares be unoccupied by other men; that is to say, a
                    rook moves either upon <hi rend="italic">files</hi> or upon <hi rend="italic"
                    >lines.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">queen</hi> can move either like a rook or like a
                    bishop.</p>
                <p>The Aύψ can move one square only at a time, and that backwards, or forwards, or
                    sidewise, or obliquely. He can also, once in the course of a game, make the
                    singular move called <hi rend="italic">castling.</hi> Castling usually takes
                    place for the double purpose of removing the king into a more secure situation,
                    and of bringing a castle more into play; and it may be done either on the king’s
                    side of the board or on the queen’s. When it is done on the king’s side, the
                    king and his rook are simultaneously lifted from their respective squares, and
                    placed, the king on his knight’s square, the rook on the bishop’s. When it is
                    done on the queen’s side, the king and the queen’s rook are lifted from their
                    squares, and placed, the king on the queen’s bishop’s square, the rook on the
                    queen’s.</p>
                <p>The adverse kings cannot approach each other so as to be on conterminous squares.
                    One square at least must intervene between them. The reasen of this obviously
                    is, that if one king were to come to a square adjoining that occupied by the
                    other, he would be within the range of his attack.<note anchored="true"

                    captured, the captured piece being removed from the board. A player, however, is
                    not obliged to take a piece or pawn under attack and subject to capture. He may
                    take it or not as he thinks fit.</p>
                <p>The principal technical terms made use of in chessplaying will now be
                    explained.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Check.</hi> —When an attack is made upon a king by any piece

                    understood from a practical illustration. Let your king be upon his own square,
                    and let your adversary play his queen to his king’s second square. If there be
                    no piece or pawn on any of the squares which separate the king and queen, your
                    king is directly exposed to the action of the queen, and is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">checked</hi> by her. The check is to be got the better of by
                    capturing the queen, if she happen to be within the range of any of your men, or
                    by interposing some piece between your king and the attacking queen, or by
                    moving the king to another square beyond the scope of her action.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Check by Discovery,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Discovered
                    Check.</hi> —This takes place when the removal of an interposed piece opens up a
                    check from another piece. For example, let your king be on his own square, and
                    the adverse queen on her king’s second square, and let all the intermediate
                    squares of the file be vacant, except the adverse king’s third, upon which third
                    square his queen’s bishop happens to be placed. It is evident that the
                    interposition of this bishop covers or protects your king from the action of his
                    queen. But if your adversary should play away his bishop from his king’s third
                    square, your king would be instantly exposed to the action of the queen; and
                    this is called <hi rend="italic">check by discovery,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    game is to give checkmate. When the king is so assaulted and beset that he
                    cannot move out of check, nor take the piece or pawn that checks him, nor
                    interpose any man for his protection, he is <hi rend="italic"

                    going into check, and when, at the same time, all his men are either off the
                    board, or in such a situation that none of them can move, he is said to be <hi

                    Suppose your king’s pawn to be upon its own square, and your adversary to have a
                    pawn on your queen’s fourth square, it is evident that you cannot play your

                <p>To <hi rend="smallcaps">Gain the Exchange or Difference.</hi> —When a player wins
                    his adversary’s rook, in exchange for his own knight or bishop, he is said <hi
                    rend="italic">to gain the exchange.</hi> In the Edinburgh Chess Club the
                    expression used is, to <hi rend="italic">gain the difference.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gambit.</hi> —This is a peculiar opening of a game, where a
                    player sacrifices a pawn or piece, in order to remove the adverse king’s pawn
                    from its fourth square, and thus be the better enabled to make an attack.
                    Examples of it will be given hereafter, from which its nature will be much more
                    easily understood than from any general description or definition.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">King.</hi> —As the king can never be taken, and as the very
                    existence of the game depends upon him, he can, of course, have no relative
                    value. But his power both of attack and defence being considerable, he should be
                    brought forward to action as soon as the more powerful pieces, particularly the
                    queen, are off the board.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Queen.</hi> —The queen is the most powerful of all the
                    pieces, being worth two rooks and a pawn. Towards the end of a game, when the
                    board has become more open for the action of the rooks, her relative value is
                    lessened a little, and she is then worth two rooks only. Properly speaking,
                    however, this arises not from any diminution of power upon her part, but from an
                    increase of power on the part of the rooks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rook.</hi> —The rook is next in value to the queen, and is
                    reckoned equal to a minor piece and two pawns, or to five pawns. A rook
                    increases in power of action as the board gets clear of other pieces and pawns;
                    and it is the only piece except the queen that can give check-mate with no other
                    assistance than its own king.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bishop.</hi> —The bishop is worth more than three pawns, and
                    less than four. It is reckoned of equal value with a knight. At the beginning of
                    a game the king’s bishop is more serviceable for attack than the queen’s. Two
                    bishops, with the assistance of the king, can give check-mate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Knight.</hi> —The knight, like the bishop, is worth more
                    than three pawns, but less than four. It is distinguished by these two
                    peculiarities: Is/, It is never <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    better of the attack by the interposition of a third piece, but must itself move
                    to another square. Two knights, with the assistance of the king, <hi
                    rend="italic">cannot</hi> give check-mate. A knight and bishop <hi rend="italic"
                    >can.</hi></p>
                <p>It is usual with writers on chess to give a great many <hi rend="italic"
                    >general</hi> instructions as to the mode of opening and conducting a game; but
                    as such general instructions are of little or no practical use, we shall
                    withhold them entirely, in order to make room for a few examples of the game, by
                    going over which with the aid of a board and men, the reader will become much
                    better acquainted with chessplaying, than if he were to peruse whole volumes of
                    general observations.</p>
                <p>The following are the laws usually observed in this country in playing the
                    game:</p>
                <p>1. The chess-board must be placed in such a manner that each player may have a
                    white square corner on his right hand. If the board be improperly placed, and
                    the mistake not discovered till after four moves have been played on each side,
                    it must remain as it is till the end of the game.</p>
                <p>2. If the pieces or pawns be improperly placed, the player who first perceives it
                    may insist on the mistake’s being rectified, provided four moves on each side
                    have not been played.</p>
                <p>3. If a player begin a game without having all his pieces, and if he do not
                    perceive it until the fourth move has been played, he must finish the game
                    without the pieces or pawns which he has forgotten.</p>
                <p>4. When the game is played <hi rend="italic">even,</hi> the players must draw
                    lots for the first move; after the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> game the move
                    belongs alternately to each player.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In Germany he who wins the game has the advantage of playing
                    first the next game.</p></note></p>
                <p>5. The player who gives odds has always the advantage of the move; except, of
                    course, in those games where the move is also given to the inferior player;
                    such, for example, as the <hi rend="italic">pawn and move,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>6. When a player has <hi rend="italic">touched</hi> a piece he must wzore it. <hi
                    rend="italic">N. Ľ.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> If a piece be not placed
                    exactly in the centre of its square, or if it should fall, the player must say
                    <hi rend="italic">Radoube</hi> in placing it properly, else his adversary <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> may compel him to play it.</p>
                <p>7. As long as a player holds a piece, he is at liberty to play it where he
                    chooses; but when he has <hi rend="italic">let it go,</hi> he cannot recal his
                    move.</p>
                <p>8. If a player <hi rend="italic">touch</hi> one of his adversary’s pieces without
                    saying· <hi rend="italic">J'adoube,</hi> he may be compelled to take it; if the
                    piece cannot be taken, the player must move his king; and if neither the piece
                    nor the king can be moved, no penalty shall be inflicted.</p>
                <p>9. If a player should, by mistake, play one of his adversary’s pieces instead of
                    his own, his adversary may compel him either to take it, if it can be taken, to
                    replace it where it was, or to let it remain where he played it.</p>
                <p>10. If a player take one of his adversary’s pieces with a piece that cannot take
                    it without a false move, his adversary may compel him either to take it with any
                    other piece, or to play the piece which he has touched.</p>
                <p>11. If a player take one of his pieces with another of his own, his adversary may
                    oblige him to play either of the two pieces.</p>
                <p>12. If a player make a false move, his adversary may oblige him to let the piece
                    remain where he played it; or to play it to some other square; or to replace the
                    piece where it previously was, and to play the king instead of it.</p>
                <p>13. If a player should play two successive moves, it is in his adversary’s power
                    to oblige him to put back the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> move; or, if he
                    choose it, he may insist on continuing the game, as if only <hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi> move had been played.</p>
                <p>14. A pawn that is pushed two squares may be taken <hi rend="italic">en
                    passant,</hi> by the adversary’s pawn.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This is not the case in Italy; a pawn is allowed to pass <hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">prise,</hi> which is called <hi

                <p>15. The king cannot castle: Is/, If he has moved; 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> if
                    he be in check; 3<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi> if any of the squares over which he
                    moves in castling be occupied by or under the power of one of his adversary’s
                    pieces; and, <hi rend="italic">⅛tkly,</hi> if the rook has moved. A player who
                    castles in either of these <hi rend="italic">four</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193353685" xml:id="kp-eb0706-3685-0514"/> cases must put back the
                    move; and his adversary has the option of compelling him to play either the king
                    or the rook with which he intended to castlc.</p>
                <p>16. If a player touch one of his pieces which cannot be moved without placing his
                    king in check, he must play his king; and if the king cannot move, no penalty is
                    to be inflicted.</p>
                <p>17. Whenever a player attacks his adversary’s king, he must say <hi rend="italic"
                    >check</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if he forget to say it, the adversary
                    needs not move his king, or take notice of the check; and if the player who did
                    not say <hi rend="italic">check,</hi> should, on the next move, attack the
                    queen, or any of his adversary’s pieces, and say <hi rend="italic">check,</hi>
                    the player whose king is in check may put back his last move, and, instead of
                    it, remove his king, or cover the check.</p>
                <p>18. If the king have been in check during two or more moves, and it be not
                    possible to ascertain how it happened, he whose king is in check may, as soon as
                    he perceives it, put back his last move, and remove his king, or cover the
                    check.</p>
                <p>19. If a player say <hi rend="italic">check</hi> without giving check, and his
                    adversary should in consequence move his king, or touch any piece to cover the
                    check, and should afterwards perceive that he is <hi rend="italic">not in
                    check,</hi> he may put back his last move, provided his opponent have not
                    already played his next move.</p>
                <p>20. If a player has moved previously to perceiving a false move, or any other
                    mistake which his adversary may have committed, he can no longer insist on the
                    penalty: he should have noticed the mistake before he <hi rend="italic"
                    >moved</hi> or <hi rend="italic">even touched</hi> a piece.</p>
                <p>21. When a player has pushed a pawn <hi rend="italic">to queen,</hi> he is at
                    liberty to make a <hi rend="italic">second queen,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">third
                    rook,</hi> or any other piece which he may deem more useful for his attack or
                    defence.</p>
                <p>22. At the end of a game, when a player remains with a rook and a bishop against
                    a rook, with both bishops, or with a knight and bishop, against the king,
                    &amp;c. if he cannot check-mate his adversary in <hi rend="italic">fifty</hi>
                    moves, the game shall be considered as a drawn game.</p>
                <p>But if a player engage to check-mate his adversary with a marked pawn, or with
                    any particular piece, the number of moves is then unlimited.</p>
                <p>23. If the king be <hi rend="italic">stale-mated,</hi> the game is a <hi

                <p>Sarasin has an express treatise on the different opinions as to the origin of the
                    word <hi rend="italic">schacchi,</hi> whence the French <hi rend="italic"
                    >échecs</hi> and our <hi rend="italic">chess</hi> is formed. Menage is also very
                    full on the same head. Leunclavius supposes it to come from <hi rend="italic"
                    >uscoches,</hi> famous Turkish robbers; P. Sirmond from the German <hi
                    rend="italic">schache,</hi> theft, and that again from <hi rend="italic"
                    >calculus.</hi> He takes <hi rend="italic">chess</hi> to be the same with the
                    <hi rend="italic">ludus latrunculorum</hi> of the Romans, but erroneously. This
                    opinion is countenanced by Vossius and Salmasius, who derive the word from <hi
                    rend="italic">calculus,</hi> as used for <hi rend="italic">latrunculus.</hi> G.
                    Tolosanus derives it from the Hebrew <hi rend="italic">search,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">volavit,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mat,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mortuus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> whence <hi rend="italic">check</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">check-mate.</hi> Fabricius says a celebrated Persian
                    astronomer, one Schatrenscha, invented the game of <hi rend="italic">chess,</hi>
                    and gave it his own name, which it still bears in that country. Nico derives it
                    from <hi rend="italic">scheeqιιe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">xeque,</hi> a
                    Moorish word for lord, king, and prince. Bochart adds that <hi rend="italic"
                    >scach</hi> is originally Persian; and that <hi rend="italic">scack-ηιat</hi> in
                    that language signifies the king is dead. The opinion of Nico and Bochart, which
                    is likewise thatofScri-verius, appears the most probable.</p>
                <p>With regard to the origin of the game of chess we are much in the dark. Though it
                    came to us from the Saracens, it is by no means probable that they were the
                    original inventors of it. According to some, it was invented by the celebrated
                    Grecian hero Diomedes. Others say that two Grecian brothers, Ledo and Tyrrheno,
                    were the inventors; and that being much pressed with hunger, they sought to
                    alleviate the pain by this amusement. According to Mr Irwin, it is a game of
                    Chinese invention. During his residence in India he found that a tradition of
                    this nature existed among the Brahmins, with whom he frequently played the game.
                    But according to Sir William Jones, this game is of Hindoo invention. “If
                    evidence were required to prove this fact,” says he,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Asiatic Researches,</hi>
                    vol. ii. mėm. 9.</p></note> “we may be satisfied with the testimony of the
                    Persians, who, though as much inclined as other nations to appropriate the
                    ingenious inventions of a foreign people, unanimously agree that the game was
                    imported from the west of <hi rend="italic">Lidia</hi> in the sixth century of
                    our era. It seems to have been immemorially known in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hindostan</hi> by <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cheturangα, i.</hi> e. the four <hi rend="italic">azigas,</hi> or members of
                    any army; which are these, <hi rend="italic">elephants, horses, chariots,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">foot soldiers</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in this
                    sense the word is frequently used by epic poets in their description of real
                    armies. By a natural corruption of the pure Sanscrit word, it was changed by the
                    old Persians into <hi rend="italic">Chetrang</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but
                    the Arabs, who soon after took possession of their country, had neither the
                    initial nor final letter of that word in their alphabet, and consequently
                    altered it further into <hi rend="italic">Shetranj,</hi> which found its way
                    presently into the modern <hi rend="italic">Persian,</hi> and at length into the
                    dialects of India, where the true derivation of the name is known only to the
                    learned. Thus has a very significant word in the sacred language of the Brahmins
                    been transformed by successive changes into <hi rend="italic">axidrez,
                    scacchi,</hi><hi rend="italic">échecs,</hi><hi rend="italic">chess,</hi> and, by
                    a whimsical concurrence of circumstances, has given birth to the English word
                    <hi rend="italic">check,</hi> and even a name to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >exchequer</hi> of Great Britain.”</p>
                <p>The game of chess has been generally practised by the <pb break="no"

                    to be well skilled in this game. It is a game which has something in it
                    peculiarly interesting. We read that Tamerlane was a great chess-player, and was
                    engaged in a game during the very time of the decisive battle with Bajazet the
                    Turkish emperor, who was defeated and taken prisoner. It is also related of Al
                    Amin, the caliph of Bagdad, that he was engaged at chess with his freedman
                    Kuthar at the time when Al Mamun’s forces were carrying on the siege of that
                    city with so much vigour that it was on the point of being carried by assault.
                    In a battle between the French and English in 1117, an English knight having
                    seized the bridle of Louis le Gros, and crying to his comrades, “The king is
                    taken !” the king struck him to the ground with his sword, saying, “Nc sçais-tu
                    pas qu’aux échecs on ne prend pas le roi ?” Dr Hyde quotes an Arabie history of
                    the Saracens, in which the caliph is said to have cried out, when warned of his
                    danger, “Let me alone, for I see check-mate against Kuthar !” We are told that
                    Charles I. was at chess when news were brought of the final intention of the
                    Scotch to give him up to the English; but so little was he disturbed by this
                    alarming intelligence, that he continued his game with the utmost composure, so
                    that no person could have known that the letter he received had given him
                    information of any thing remarkable. King John was playing at chess when the
                    deputies from Rouen came to acquaint him that their city was besieged by Philip
                    Augustus; but he would not hear them until he had finished his game.</p>
                <p>The following remarkable anecdote we have from Dr Robertson in his history of
                    Charles V. John Frederic, elector of Saxony, having been taken prisoner by
                    Charles, was condemned to death. The decree was intimated to him while at chess
                    with Ernest of Brunswick, his fellow prisoner. After a short pause, and making
                    some reflection on the irregularity and injustice of the emperor’s proceedings,
                    he turned to his antagonist, whom he challenged to finish the game. He played
                    with his usual ingenuity and attention; and having beat Ernest, expressed all
                    the satisfaction that is commonly felt on gaining such victories. He was not,
                    however, put to death, but set at liberty after five years’ confinement.</p>
                <p>Chess seems to have been in vogue at the court of Queen Elizabeth. Sir Walter
                    Raleigh used to say that he did not wish to live longer than he could play at
                    chess. Sir Charles Blount, afterwards Earl of Devonshire, having distinguished
                    himself at a tilt, received from that princess a present of a chess-queen of
                    gold enamelled, which he tied round his arm with a crimson riband. This favour
                    from the queen produced a duel betwixt him and the Earl of Essex.</p>
                <p>Charles XII. of Sweden was fond of the game; but he was not a successful player,
                    in consequence of his making the king take too active a share in the contest. To
                    this day a chess-king who advances too boldly into the fight is called Charles
                    XII.</p>
                <p>In the Chronicle of the Moorish Kings of Granada we find it related, that in 1396
                    Mehemed Baiba seized upon the crown in prejudice of his elder brother, and
                    passed his life in one continual round of disasters. His wars with Castille were
                    invariably unsuccessful; and his death was occasioned by a poisoned vest.
                    Finding his case desperate, he dispatched an officer to the fort of Salabreno to
                    put his brother Juzuf to death, lest that prince’s adherents should form any
                    obstacle to his son’s succession. The alcade found the prince playing at chess
                    with an <hi rend="italic">alfaqui</hi> or priest. Juzuf begged hard for two
                    hours’ respite, which was denied him; at last, with great reluctance, the
                    officer permitted him to finish the game; but before it was finished a messenger
                    arrived with the news of the death of Mehemed, and the unanimous election of
                    Juzuf to the crown.</p>
                <p>We h∙ave a curious anecdote of Ferrand, Count of Flanders, who, having been
                    accustomed to amuse himself at chess with his wife, and being constantly beaten
                    by her, a mutual hatred took place, which came to such a height, that when the
                    count was taken prisoner at the battle of Bovines, she suffered him to remain a
                    long time in prison, though she could easily have procured his release.</p>
                <p>Two Persians had engaged in such deep play, that the whole fortune of one of them
                    was gained by his opponent. He who played the white was the ruined man; and,
                    made desperate by his loss, offered his favourite wife as his last stake. The
                    game was carried on until he would have been check-mated by his adversary next
                    move. The lady, who had observed the game from a window above, cried out to her
                    husband to sacrifice his castle and save his wife.</p>
                <p>The game of chess has undergone considerable variations since it was first
                    invented. We have it on good authority, that among the eastern nations the piece
                    now called the <hi rend="italic">queen</hi> was formerly called the <hi
                    rend="italic">vizir</hi> or king’s minister, and that the powers of the queen
                    herself were but very small. The chess-boards used by Tamerlane were larger, and
                    contained many more squares, than those at present in use. Carrera invented two
                    new pieces to be added to the eight commonly in use. One of these, which he
                    calls <hi rend="italic">Campione,</hi> is placed between the king’s knight and
                    castle; the other, named <hi rend="italic">Centaur,</hi> between the queen’s
                    knight and castle, has the move of the bishop and knight united. This invention,
                    how cver, did not survive its author. In another of this kind the two additional
                    pieces are called the <hi rend="italic">centurion</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >decurion</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the former situated between the king and
                    his bishop, in its move the same with that of the queen, but only for two
                    squares; the latter moves as the bishop, but only one square at a time. This,
                    like the former, died with its inventor. The chessboard of Tamerlane was a
                    parallelogram, having eleven squares one way and tn <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> elve the other. In the Memoirs of the late Marshal Keith, we find it
                    related that he invented an amusement something similar to that of chess, with
                    which the king of Prussia was highly entertained. Several thousand small statues
                    were cast by a founder; and these were ranged opposite to each other as if they
                    had been drawn up in an army, making the different movements with them as in
                    real service in the field.</p>
