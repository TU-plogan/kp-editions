                    preacher and writer of considerable note in the reign of Charles II. was, during
                    the interregnum, and at the time of the ejection, minister of St Dennet Fink, in
                    London. In November J 660, he, in the name of the Presbyterian ministers,
                    presented an address to the king for his declaration of liberty of conscience.
                    He was one of the commissioners of the Savoy, and behaved on that occasion with
                    great prudence and moderation. He sometimes attended the church as a hearer and
                    communicant, and was much esteemed for his great probity and industry by all who
                    knew him. The most valuable of his numerous works are said to be his Lives of
                    the Puritan Divines and other persons of note, twenty-two of which are printed
                    in his Martyrology, and the rest in his Lives of sundry eminent Persons in this
                    latter Age, folio; and his Marrow of Ecclesiastical History, in folio and
                    quarto. He died in 1680.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clarke,</hi><hi rend="italic">Samuel,</hi> the son of the
                    former, was fellow of Pembroke-hall in Cambridge, but was ejected from his
                    fellowship for refusing to take the engagements, as he was also afterwards from
                    his rectory of Grendon in Buckinghamshire. He applied himself early to the study
                    of the Scriptures; and his Annotations on the Bible, printed together with the
                    sacred text, is highly commended by Dr Owen, Mr Baxter, and Dr Calamy. He died
                    in 1701, aged 75.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clarke,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dr Samuel,</hi> a celebrated
                    English divine, was the son of Edward Clarke, Esq. alderman of Norwich, and one
                    of its representatives in parliament for several years, having been born there
                    on the 11th October 1675. He was instructed in classical learning at the free
                    school of that town; and in 1691 removed thence to Caius College in Cambridge,
                    where his uncommon abilities soon began to display themselves. Though the
                    philosophy of Descartes was at that time the established philosophy of the
                    university, yet Clarke easily mastered the new system of Newton; and with a view
                    to his degree in arts, performed a public exercise in the schools upon a
                    question taken from it. He contributed greatly to the establishment of the
                    Newtonian philosophy by an excellent translation of, and notes upon, Rohault’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Physics,</hi> which he finished before he was twenty-two years
                    of age. The system of natural philosophy then generally taught in the university
                    was that written by Rohault, founded altogether upon</p>
                <p>Cartesian principles, and very ill translated into Latin. Clarke gave a new
                    translation, and added to it such notes as were calculated to lead students
                    insensibly to other and truer notions than could be found there. “And this
                    certainly,” says Bishop Hoadley, “was a more prudent method of introducing truth
                    unknown before, than to attempt to throw aside this treatise entirely, and write
                    a hew one instead of it. The success answered exceedingly well to his hopes; and
                    he may justly be styled a great benefactor to the university in this attempt.
                    For by this means the true philosophy has, without any noise, prevailed; and to
                    this day the translation of Rohault is, generally speaking, the standing text
                    for lectures, and his notes the first direction to those who are willing to
                    receive the reality and truth of things, in the place of invention and romance.”
                    Whiston relates, that in 1697, while he was chaplain to Moore, bishop of
                    Norwich, he met young Clarke, then wholly unknown to him, at a coffeehouse in
                    that city, where they entered into a conversation about the Cartesian
                    philosophy, particularly Rohault’s <hi rend="italic">Physics,</hi> which
                    Clarke’s tutor, as he tells us, had put him upon translating. “The result of
                    this conversation was,” says Whiston, “that I was greatly surprised that so
                    young a man as Clarke then was should know so much of those sublime discoveries,
                    which were then almost a secret to all but to a few particular mathematicians.
                    Nor do I remember,” continues he, “above one or two at the most, whom I had then
                    met with, that seemed to know so muoh of that philosophy as Clarke.” This
                    translation of Rohault was first printed in 1697, 8vo. There have been four
                    editions of it, in every one of which improvements were made, especially in the
                    last in 1718, which has the following title: <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Jacobi

                    of Sarum, and our author’s brother, translated this work into English, and
                    published it in two vols. 8vo.</p>
                <p>Clarke afterwards turned his thoughts to divinity; and in order to qualify
                    himself for the sacred function, he studied the Old Testament in the original
                    Hebrew, the New Testament in the original Greek, and the primitive Christian
                    writers. Having taken holy orders, he became chaplain to Moore, bishop of
                    Norwich, who was ever afterwards his constant friend and patron. In 1699 he
                    published two treatises; one entitled “Three practical Essays on Baptism,
                    Confirmation, and Repentance ;” and the other, “Some Reflections on that part of
                    a book called Amyntor, or a Defence of Milton’s Life, which relates to the
                    Writings of the Primitive Fathers, and the Canon of the New Testament.” In 1701
                    he published <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> ' A Paraphrase upon the Gospel of St
                    Matthew ;” which was followed, in 1702, by the “Paraphrases upon the Gospels of
                    St Mark and St Luke,” and soon afterwards by a third volume upon St John. They
                    were subsequently printed together in two volumes 8vo; and have since passed
                    through several editions. He intended to have treated in the same manner the
                    remaining books of the New Testament, but something accidentally interrupted the
                    execution of his design.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Bishop Moore gave him the rectory of Drayton, near Norwich, and
                    procured him a parish in that city, which he served personally in the season
                    when the bishop resided at Norwich. In 1704 he was appointed to preach Boyle’s
                    lecture; and the subject he chose was, the Being and Attributes of God. In this
                    he succeeded so well, and gave such high satisfaction, that he was appointed to
                    preach the same lecture the next year; when he chose for his subject the
                    Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion<pb break="no" facs="nls:193356480"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6480-0729"/>. These sermons were first printed in two distinct
                    volumes; the first in 1705, and the second in 1706. They have since been printed
                    in one volume, under the general title of “A Discourse concerning the Being and
                    Attributes of God, the Obligations of Natural Religion, and the Truth and
                    Certainty of the Christian Revelation, in opposition to Hobbes, Spinoza, the
                    author of the Oraeles of Reason, and other Deniers of Natural and Revealed
                    Religion.” Clarke having endeavoured, in the first part of his work, to show
                    that the being of a God may be demonstrated by arguments <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori,</hi> unluckily involved himself in the censure which Pope in the
                    following lines pronounced upon this method of reasoning:—</p>
                <p>Let others creep by timid steps and slow, On plain experience lay foundations
                    low, By common sense to common knowledge bred, And lost to nature’s cause,
                    through nature led. All-seeing in thy mists, we want no guide, Mother of
                    arrogance, and source of pride! We nobly take the high <hi rend="italic"
                    >priori</hi> road, And reason downward, till we doubt of God.</p>
                <p>On this passage we have the following note: “Those who, from the effects in this
                    visible world, deduce the eternal power and godhead of the First Cause, though
                    they cannot attain to an adequate idea of the Deity, yet discover so much of him
                    as enables them to see the end of their creation and the means of their
                    happiness; whereas they who take this high <hi rend="italic">priori</hi> road,
                    as Hobbes, Spinoza, Descartes, and some better rcasoners, for one that goes
                    right, ten lose themselves in mist, or ramble after visions which deprive them
                    of all sight of their end, and mislead them in the choice of wrong menns.”
                    Clarke, it is probable, would not have denied this; and the poet perhaps would
                    have spared his better reasoners, and not have joined them with such company,
                    had he collected our author’s apology for using the argument <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori.</hi> “The argument <hi rend="italic">a posteriori,"</hi> says he, “is
                    indeed by far the most generally useful argument, most easy to be understood,
                    and in some degree suited to all capacities; and therefore it ought always to be
                    insisted upon. But for as much as atheistical writers have sometimes opposed the
                    being and attributes of God by such metaphysical reasonings as can no otherwise
                    be obviated than by arguing <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> therefore this
                    manner of arguing also is useful and necessary in its proper place.” To this may
                    be added the answer which he made to Mr λVhiston, as narrated by the latter in
                    his Historical Memoirs. “When Clarke brought me his book, I was in my garden
                    against St Peter’s College in Cambridge, where I then lived. Now I perceived
                    that in these sermons he had dealt a great deal in abstract and metaphysical
                    reasoning. I therefore asked him how he ventured into such subtleties, which I
                    never durst meddle with; and showing him a nettle, or some contemptible weed in
                    my garden, I told him that weed contained better arguments for the being and
                    attributes of God than all his metaphysics. Clarke confessed it to be so; but
                    alleged for himself, that since such philosophers as Hobbes and Spinoza had made
                    use of those kind of subtleties against, he thought proper to show that the like
                    way of reasoning might be made better use of on the side of religion; which
                    reason or excuse 1 allowed to be not inconsiderable.”</p>
                <p>In 1706 he published a letter to Mr Dodwell, in which all the arguments in his
                    epistolary discourse against the immortality of the soul are particularly
                    answered, and the judgment of the fathers, to whom Mr Ĳodwell had appealed
                    concerning that matter, is truly represented. Bishop Hoadley observes, that in
                    this letter he answered Mr Dodwell in so excellent a manner, both with regard to
                    the philosophical part, and to the opinions of some of the primitive writers,
                    upon whom these doctrines were fixed, that it gave universal satisfaction. But
                    this controversy did not stop here; for the celebrated Collins, coming in as a '
                    second to Dodwell, went much farther into the philosophy of the dispute, and
                    indeed seemed to produce all that could possibly be said against the
                    immateriality of the soul, as well as the liberty of human actions. This
                    enlarged the scene of the dispute, into which our author entered, and wrote with
                    such clearness and demonstration, as at once showed him greatly superior to his
                    adversaries in metaphysical and physical knowledge, and made every intelligent
                    reader rejoice that such an incident had happened to provoke and extort from him
                    that abundance of strong reasoning and perspicuity of expression, which were
                    indeed very much wanted upon this intricate and ohseure subject. Clarke’s letter
                    to Dodwell was soon followed by four defences of it, in as many letters to the
                    author of “A Letter to the learned Mr Henry Dodwell, containing some Remarks on
                    a pretended Demonstration of the Immateriality and natural Immortality of the
                    Soul, in Mr Clarke’s Answer to his late Epistolary Discourse.” They were
                    afterwards printed together; and the Answer to Toland’s Amyntor added to them.
                    In the midst of all these labours he found time to show his attachment to
                    mathematical and physical studies, as well as exact knowledge and skill in them.
                    And his natural affection and capacity for these studies were not a little
                    improved by the friendship of Sir Isaac Newton, at whose request he translated
                    his Optics into Latin in 1706. With this version Sir Isaac was so highly
                    pleased, that he presented him with the sum of L.500, or L.100 for each child,
                    Clarke having then five children.</p>
                <p>This year also, Bishop Moore, who had long formed a design of fixing him more
                    conspicuously, procured for him the rectory of St Bennet’s, Paul’s Wharf,
                    London; and soon afterwards carried him to court, and recommended him to the
                    favour of Queen Anne, who appointed him one of her chaplains in ordinary; and,
                    in consideration of his great merit, and at the request of the bishop, presented
                    him to the rectory of St James’s, Westminster, when it became vacant in 1709.
                    Upon his advancement to this station, he took the degree of doctor in divinity;
                    and on this occasion the public exercise which he performed for it at Cambridge
                    was prodigiously admired. The questions which he maintained were these: 1. <hi

                    rend="italic">;</hi> without the liberty of human actions, there can be no
                    religion. The same year he revised and corrected Whiston’s English translation
                    of the Apostolical Con-titutions. Whiston tells us, that his own studies having
                    been chiefly directed to other things, and having rendered him incapable of
                    being also a critic in words and languages, he desired his great friend and
                    critic Dr Clarke to revise that translation, which he was so kind as to agree
                    to.</p>
                <p>In 1712, he published a most beautiful edition of Caesar’s Commentaries, adorned

                    “at a time,” says Bishop Hoadley, “when his unequalled victories and successes
                    had raised his glory to the highest pitch abroad, and lessened his interest and
                    favour at home.” In the publication of this book the doctor took particular care
                    of the punctuation, ln the annotations he selected what appeared the best and
                    most judicious in former editions, with <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356493"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6493-0730"/>some corrections and emendations of his own
                    interspersed. The same year, 1712, he published his celebrated book entitled The
                    Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity, which is divided into three parts. The first
                    contains a collection and explication of all the texts in the New Testament
                    relating to the doctrine of the trinity; in the second the doctrine is set forth
                    at large, and explained in particular and distinct propositions; and in the
                    third, the principal passages in the liturgy of the church of England relating
                    to the doctrine of the trinity are considered. Whiston informs us, that some
                    time before the publication of this book, a message was sent to him from Lord
                    Godolphin and other ministers of Queen Anne, importing, “That the affairs of the
                    public were with difficulty then kept in the hands of those that were for
                    liberty; that it was therefore an unseasonable time for the publication of a
                    book that would make a great noise and disturbance; and that therefore they
                    desired him to forbear till a fitter opportunity should offer itself;” which
                    message, he adds, the doctor paid no regard to, but went on according to the
                    dictates of his own conscience with the publication of his book. The ministers,
                    however, were right in their conjectures; for the work made noise and
                    disturbance enough, and occasioned a great number of books and pamphlets,
                    written by himself and others.</p>
                <p>Books and pamphlets, however, were not all which the Scripture Doctrine of the
                    Trinity occasioned; it rendered its author obnoxious to the power eccesiastical,
                    and his book was complained of by the lower house of convocation. The doctor
                    drew up a preface, and afterwards gave several explanations, which scented to
                    satisfy the upper house; at least the affair was not brought to any issue, the
                    members appearing desirous if possible to prevent dissensions and divisions.</p>
                <p>In 1715 and 1716, he had a dispute with Leibnitz relating to the principles of
                    natural philosophy and religion; and a collection of the papers which passed
                    between them was published in 1717. In 1718, he was presented by Lord Lechmere,
                    the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to the mastership of Wigston’s
                    hospital in Leicester. In 1724, he published seventeen sermons preached on
                    several occasions, eleven of which were never before printed; and the year
                    following, he gave to the world a sermon, preached at the parish-church of St
                    James’s, upon the erection of a charity school for the education of women
                    servants. In 1727, upon the death of Sir Isaac Newton, he was offered by the
                    court the place of Master of the Mint, worth, <hi rend="italic">communibus
                    annis,</hi> L.1200 or L.1500 a year. But to this secular preferment he could not
                    reconcile himself, and therefore absolutely refused it. Whiston seems to wonder
                    that Clarke’s eulogists should lay so little stress upon this refusal, as either
                    not to mention it at all, or at least very negligently; while “he takes it,” he
                    says, “to be one of the most glorious actions of his life, and to afford
                    undeniable conviction that he was in earnest in his religion.” In 1728 was
                    published “A Letter from Dr Clarke to Mr Benjamin Hoadley, F.R.S. occasioned by
                    the controversy relating to the Proportion of Velocity and Force in Bodies in
                    Motion ;” printed in the Philosophical Transactions.</p>
                <p>In 1729, he published the first twelve books of Homer’s Iliad. This edition was
                    printed in quarto, and dedicated to the Duke of Cumberland. The Latin version is
                    almost entirely new, and annotations are added at the bottom of the pages.
                    Homer, Bishop Hoadley tells us, was Clarke’s .admired author, even to a degree
                    of something like enthusiasm, hardly natural to his temper; and in this feeling
                    he went a little beyond the bounds of Horace’s judgment, and was so unwilling to
                    allow the favourite poet ever to nod, that he has taken remarkable pains to find
                    out, and give a reason for every passage, word, and title that could create any
                    suspicion. “The translation,” adds the bishop, “with his corrections, may now be
                    styled accurate; and his notes, as far as they go, are indeed a treasury of
                    grammatical and critical knowledge. He was called to his task by royal command;
                    and he has performed it in such a manner as to be worthy of the young prince for
                    whom it was laboured.” The year of its publication was the last of this great
                    man’s life. Though not robust, he had always enjoyed a firm state of health,
                    without any indisposition bad enough to confine him, except the small-pox in his
                    youth, till Sunday the 11th of May 1729, when, going out in the morning to
                    preach before the judges at Sergeant’s Inn, he was seized with a pain in his
                    side, which rendered it impossible for him to perform the office he had been
                    called to discharge, and which quickly became so violent that be was obliged to
                    be carried home. He went to bed, and thought himself so much better in the
                    afternoon, that he would not suffer himself to be bled; against which remedy he
                    entertained strong préjudices. But the pain returning violently about two the
                    next morning, bleeding became absolutely necessary; he appeared to be out of
                    danger, and continued to think himself so, till the Saturday morning following,
                    when, to the inexpressible surprise of all about him, the pain removed from his
                    side to his head, and, after a short period of suffering, took away his senses
                    to such a degree, that they never again returned. He continued breathing till
                    between seven and eight o’clock of the evening of that day, which was May the
                    17th 1729, and then expired, in his fifty-fourth year.</p>
                <p>Soon after his death were published, from his original manuscripts, by his
                    brother Dr John Clarke, dean of Saturn, <hi rend="italic">An Exposition of the
                    Church Catechism,</hi> and ten volumes of sermons, in 8vo. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exposition</hi> is composed of those lectures which he read every Thursday
                    morning for some months in the year, at St James’s church. In the latter part of
                    his time he revised them with great care, and left them completely prepared for
                    the press. Three years after his death appeared also the last twelve books of
                    the Iliad, published in 4to by his son Mr Samuel Clarke, who informs us in the
                    preface, that his father had finished the annotations to the first three of
                    these books, and as far as the 359th verse of the fourth; and had revised the
                    text and version as far as verse 510 of the same book.</p>
                <p>Dr Clarke was of a cheerful, and even playful disposition. An intimate friend of
                    his, the Reverend Mr Bott, used to relate, that once when he happened to call
                    for him, he found him swimming upon a table. At another time, when the two Dr
                    Clarkes, Mr Bott, and several men of ability and learning were together, and
                    amusing themselves with diverting tricks, Dr Samuel Clarke, looking out at the
                    window, saw a grave blockhead approaching to the house; upon which he cried out,
                    “Boys, boys, be wise, here comes a fool.” This turn of his mind has since been
                    confirmed by Dr Warton, who, in his observations upon the line of Mr Pope,</p>
                <p>Unthought-of frailties cheat us in the wise, says, “Who could imagine that Locke
                    was fond of romances; that Newton once studied astrology; that Dr Clarke valued
                    himself on his agility, and frequently amused himself in a private room of his
                    house in leaping over the tables and chairs; and that our author himself was a
                    great epicure ?” With respect to what is here recorded of Dr Clarke, we can
                    scarcely persuade ourselves to consider it as a frailty. To be possessed of such
                    a temper as he was, must have been no small degree of happiness; as it probably
                    enabled him to pursue his important and serious studies with greater vivacity
                    and vigour. To be capable of deriving amusement from trivial <pb break="no"

                    divine, was born at Hagh-mon Abbey, in Shropshire, in 1696, and, after a
                    grammatical education at Shrewsbury School, was sent to St John’s College,
                    Cambridge, of which he was elected fellow in 1716, B. A. in 1731, and Μ. A. in
                    1735. He was presented by Archbishop Wake, in 1724, to the rectory of Buxted in
                    Sussex, at the particular recommendation of Dr λVotton, whose daughrer lie had
                    married. In 1738 he was made prebendary and residentiary of the cathedral church
                    at Chichester. Some years before this he had given to the public a specimen of
                    his literary abilities, in a preface to his father-in-law Dr Wotton’s <hi

                    written by our author. It came either from his hand or from that of his friend
                    Mr Bowyer, and is reprinted in that gentleman’s <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous
                    Tracts.</hi> But Mr Clarke’s chief work was, <hi rend="italic">The Connexion of
                    the Roman, Saxon, and English Coins,</hi> tracing the antiquities, customs, and
                    manners of each people from the earliest times, particularly the origin of
                    feudal tenures, and of parliaments, and illustrated throughout with critical and
                    historical remarks on various authors, both sacred and profane. This work was
                    published, in one volume quarto, in 1767; and its appearance from the press was
                    owing to the discovery made by Martin Folkes, Esq. of the old Saxon pound. It
                    was dedicated to the Duke of Newcastle, whose beneficent disposition is
                    celebrated for having conferred obligations upon the author, which were not the
                    effects of importunity. Mr Clarke’s performance was perused in manuscript by
                    Arthur Onslow, Esq. Speaker of the House of Commons, who honoured him with some
                    useful hints and observations; but he was chiefly indebted to Mr Bowyer, who
                    took upon him all the care of the publication, drew up several of the notes,
                    wrote part of the dissertation on the Roman sesterce, and formed an admirable
                    index to the whole. Mr Clarke’s last promotions were the chancellorship of the
                    church of Chichester, and the vicarage of Amport, which were bestowed upon him
                    in 1770. These preferments he did not long live to enjoy, departing this life on
                    the 21st of October, in the following year. He had resigned, in 1768, the
                    rectory of Buxted to his son Edward. In Mr Nichols’s Anecdotes of Bowyer, there
                    are several letters and extracts of letters written to that learned printer by
                    Mr Clarke, which display his character to great advantage as a man of piety, a
                    friend, and a scholar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Clarke,</hi><hi rend="italic">Edward Daniel,</hi> a
                    celebrated traveller and mineralogist, was born at Willingdon, in the county of
                    Sussex, on the 5th of June 1769. He received the rudiments of his education at
                    Uckfield, and at ten years of age he was removed to the grammar school of
                    Tunbridge, where, however, it does not appear that his progress was very
                    satisfactory. In the spring of 1786 he obtained the office of chapel clerk at
                    Jesus College, Cambridge; and the year following he lost his father, after which
                    he had to struggle with many difficulties. He never rose to any thing like
                    scholastic eminence; his favourite pursuits were of a different character, being
                    principally literary. In 1790 he took his degree, and shortly afterwards
                    obtained the of-ficeoforivate tutor to the Honourable HenryTufton, nephew to the
                    Duke of Dorset. In 1792 he was fortunate enough to obtain an engagement to
                    travel as a companion with Lord Berwick, through Germany, Switzerland, and the
                    classic ground of Italy. This was a most fortunate appointment. It opened up to
                    him a means of gratifying a passion for travel, which reigned paramount in his
                    mind over every other. After crossing the Alps, and visiting a few of the
                    principal cities of Italy, including Rome, he repaired to Naples, where he
                    remained nearly two years. During his stay he made several excursions to
                    Vesuvius, in one of which, during an eruption, he narrowly escaped the fate of
                    Pliny the Elder. He had the daring hardihood to ascend to the edge of the crater
                    while it belched forth its broad columns of liquid fire, which glowed with all
                    the splendour of the sun.</p>
                <p>Mr Clarke finally returned to England in the summer of 1794, after having been
                    disappointed in the expectation of undertaking a journey to Egypt and the Holy
                    Land. He soon afterwards undertook the care of a young gentleman, with whom he
                    continued about tu elve months. After unsuccessfully attempting a periodical
                    work, he became a tutor in the family of Lord Uxbridge, with one of the members
                    of whose house he made a tour of Scotland, keeping a regular journal, as was his
                    usual custom while travelling, and noting down every remarkable object or event
                    which occurred during his journey. The next circumstance of his life which it is
                    necessary to record was his connection with a young gentleman of Sussex, whose
                    studies he superintended for a year at Cambridge, and afterwards accompanied in
                    his travels over a considerable portion of the Continent. This was the most
                    important event of his life, and laid the foundation of his future fame.</p>
                <p>Mr Clarke and his friend Mr Cripps set out from Cambridge in May 1799, and after
                    traversing Norway and Sweden, proceeded to Russia, from thence through the
                    Crimea to Constantinople, then to Rhodes, and afterwards to Egypt, where,
                    however, their stay was short, the country being still, in the possession of the
                    French. From Egypt they set out for Palestine; and, after visiting Jerusalem,
                    Nazareth, Bethlehem, and other remarkable places, they returned to Aboukir Bay.
                    Subsequent to the capitulation of Alexandria, Mr Clarke was of considerable use
                    in securing for England the statues, sarcophagi, maps, manuscripts, &amp;c.
                    which had been collected by the French savans. Greece was the next country
                    visited by our indefatigable travellers. From Athens they proceeded by land to
                    Constantinople through ancient Thrace; and, after a short stay in that city,
                    they directed their course homewards, through Rumelia, Austria, Germany, and
                    France, and arrived in England after an absence of upwards of three years.</p>
                <p>Mr Clarke, who had now obtained an immense reputation, took up his residence at
                    Cambridge, where, with very few intervals of absence, he continued to reside
                    till the day of his death. Cambridge was indebted to him for a statue of Ceres
                    which he had sent home from Greece; and, to show the sense which was entertained
                    of his merits, and the value placed upon the relict of antiquity with which he
                    had presented the university, he received from it the degree of LL.D. In 1805 he
                    published a “Dissertation on the Sacrophagus in the British Museum,” which gave
                    considerable satisfaction to the learned. He had now formed a matrimonial
                    alliance, and also entered into orders, shortly after which event he received a
                    living, and about three years afterwards a second. Towards the end of 1808 Dr
                    Clarke was further honoured with the Professorship of Mineralogy, then first
                    instituted. Thus were his most sanguine wishes crowned with success; and his
                    perseverance and talents rewarded with one of the highest honours which the
                    university could bestow. The manuscripts which he had collected in the course of
                    his travels were sold to the Bodleian Library for L.1000, and by the publication
                    of his travels which next followed, and which came out volume by volume, he
                    realized altogether a clear profit of L.6595.</p>

                <p>Besides regularly delivering his lectures on mineralogy, and discharging the
                    duties of his clerical office, Dr Clarke occupied himself with various other
                    pursuits, particularly with chemistry, to which he was ardently attached. In
                    this science he made several discoveries, some of which, effected by means of
                    the gas blow-pipe, an agent which he himself had brought to a high degree of
                    perfection, are of great importance. His health, however, never properly
                    established after his return from his latter travels, began to give way under
                    ardent study and long-continued excitement. He was removed to London in order to
                    obtain the first medical advice; and after lingering for a short while, he
                    expired there, on the 9th of March 1821. Public honours were paid to his
                    remains, which were conveyed to Jesus College, Cambridge, where his fellow
                    collegians erected a monument to his memory. In all the relations of life Dr
                    Clarke was the most amiable of men. The leading qualities of his mind were
                    enthusiasm and benevolence, while the capacity of enduring long-continued mental
                    as well as physical exertion was likewise characteristic of him. His ardour in
                    the pursuit of knowledge was remarkable, and he possessed the happy power of
                    bringing his whole energies to bear upon any individual subject with which he
                    chose to occupy his attention. The following are his principal works :—Testimony
                    of different Authors respecting the Colossal Statue of Ceres placed in the
                    vestibule of the Public Library at Cambridge, with an account of its removal
                    from Eleusis, 8vo, 1801-1803; The Tomb of Alexander, a Dissertation on the
                    Sarcophagus brought from Alexandria, and now in the British Museum, 4to, 1805; A
                    Methodical Distribution of the Mineral Kingdom, folio, 1807; A Letter to the
                    Gentlemen of the British Museum, 4to, 1807; A Description of the Greek Marbles
                    brought from the shores of the Euxine, Archipelago, and Mediterranean, and
                    deposited in the vestibule of the University Library, Cambridge, 8vo, 1809;
                    Travels in various Countries of Europe, Asia, and Africa; part first, containing
                    Russia, Tartary, and Turkey, 4to, 1810; part second, containing Greece, Egypt,
                    and the Holy Land, section first, 4to, 1812; section second, 1814; the last
                    volume was published in 1819. In this year also appeared his octavo volume on
                    the Gas Blow-pipe, and in the year following a Dissertation on the Litnus.
                    Besides these works, Dr Clarke wrote a number of articles for scientific
                    journals.</p>

                    >Clair-Obscure,</hi> in painting, the art of distributing to advantage the
                    lights and shadows of a piece, both with respect to the relief of the eye and

                    only two colours, most usually black and white, but sometimes black and yellow;
                    or it is a design washed only with one colour, the shadows being of a dusky
                    brown, and the lights heightened up by white. The word is also applied to prints
                    of two colours taken off at twice.</p>
