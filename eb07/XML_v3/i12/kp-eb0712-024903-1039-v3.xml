                <p><label type="entry">ILLUMINATING</label>, a kind of miniature painting, anciently
                    much practised for illustrating and adorning books. Besides the writers of
                    books, there were artists whose profession it was to ornament and paint
                    manuscripts, and who were called illuminators. The writers of books first
                    finished their part, and the illuminators embellished them with ornamented
                    letters and paintings. We frequently find in manuscripts blanks left for the
                    illuminators, which, however, were never filled up. Some of the ancient
                    manuscripts were gilt and burnished in a style superior to those of later times.
                    The colours were excellent, and the skill in preparing them must have been very
                    great.</p>
                <p>The practice of introducing ornaments, drawings, emblematical figures, and even
                    portraits, into manuscripts, is of great antiquity. Varro wrote the lives of
                    seven hundred illustrious Romans, which he enriched with their portraits, as
                    Pliny attests <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Nat.</hi> lib. xxxv. chap. 2). Pomponius
                    Atticus, the friend of Cicero, was the author of a work on the actions of the
                    great men amongst the Romans, which he ornamented with their portraits, as we
                    are informed by Cornelius Nepos in his life of that illustrious Roman. But these
                    works have not been transmitted to posterity. There are, however, many precious
                    documents remaining, which exhibit the advancement and decline of the arts in
                    different ages and countries. These inestimable paintings and illuminations
                    display the manners, customs, habits ecclesiastical, civil, and military,
                    weapons and instruments of war, utensils and architecture, of the ancients; and
                    they are of the greatest use in illustrating many important facts relative to
                    the history of the times in which they were executed. In these treasures of
                    antiquity are preserved a great number of specimens of Grecian and Roman art,
                    which were executed before the arts and sciences fell into neglect and contempt.
                    The manuscripts containing these specimens form a valuable part of the riches
                    preserved in the principal libraries of Europe; the Royal, Cottonian, and
                    Harleian Libraries, as also those in the two universities of England, the
                    Vatican at Rome, the Imperial at Vienna, the Royal at Paris, St Mark’s at
                    Venice, and many others.</p>
                <p>A very ancient manuscript of Genesis, which was in the Cottonian Library, and
                    almost destroyed by a fire in 1731, contained two hundred and fifty curious
                    paintings in watercolours. Twenty-one fragments, which escaped the fire, have
                    been engraved by the Society of Antiquaries of London. Several specimens of
                    curious paintings also appear in Lambecius’s catalogue of the Imperial Library
                    at Vienna, particularly in volume third, where forty-eight drawings of nearly
                    equal antiquity with those in the Cottonian Library are engraven; and several
                    others may be found in various catalogues of the Italian libraries. The drawings
                    in the Vatican Virgil, executed in the fourth century, before the arts were
                    entirely neglected, illustrate the different subjects treated of by the Roman
                    poet. A miniature drawing is prefixed to each of the gospels brought over to
                    England by St Augustin in the sixth century, which is preserved in the library
                    of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. In the compartments of those drawings are
                    depicted representations of several transactions in each gospel. The curious
                    drawings and elaborate ornaments in St Cuthbert’s gospels, made by St Ethelwald,
                    and now in the Cottonian Library, exhibit a striking specimen of the state of
                    the arts in England in the seventh century. The same observation may be made
                    respecting the drawings in the ancient copy of the four gospels preserved in the
                    cathedral church <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941052"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-1052-0250"/>of Lichfield, and those in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Codex Rushworthianus</hi> in the Bodleian Library at Oxford. The life of St
                    Paul the Hermit, now remaining in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, affords an
                    example of the style of drawing and ornamenting letters in England in the eighth
                    century; and the copy of Prudentius’s <hi rend="italic">Psycomachia</hi> in the
                    Cottonian Library exhibits the style of drawing in Italy in the ninth century.
                    Of the tenth century there are Roman drawings of a singular kind in the Harleian
                    Library, No. 2820; whilst Nos. 5280, 1802, and 432, in the same library, contain
                    specimens of ornamented letters, which'are to be found in Irish manuscripts from
                    the twelfth to the fourteenth century. Caedmon’s Poetical Paraphrase of the book
                    of Genesis, written in the eleventh century, which is preserved amongst Junius’s
                    manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, exhibits many specimens of utensils,
                    weapons, instruments of music, and implements of husbandry, used by the
                    Anglo-Saxons. The like may be seen in extracts from the Pentateuch of the same
                    age in the Cottonian Library. The manuscript copy of Terence in the Bodleian
                    Library displays the dresses, masks, &amp;c. worn by comedians in the twelfth
                    century, if not earlier. The very elegant Psalter in the library of Trinity
                    College, Cambridge, exhibits specimens of the art of drawing in England in the
                    same century. The Virgil in the Lambeth Library of the thirteenth century, and
                    written in Italy, shows, both by the drawings and writing, that the Italians
                    produced works much inferior to ours at that period. The copy of the Apocalypse,
                    in the same library, contains a curious example of the manner of painting in the
                    fourteenth century. The beautiful paintings in the history of the latter part of
                    the reign of King Richard II., in the Harleian Library, afford curious specimens
                    of manners and customs, both civil and military, at the close of the fourteenth
                    and in the beginning of the fifteenth century. Many other instances might be
                    produced; but those who desire further information may consult Strutt’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities,</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Horda Angelcynnan,</hi> published in three volumes.</p>
                <p>This art was much practised by the clergy, and even by some in the highest
                    stations in the church, “The famous Osmund,” says Bromton, “who was consecrated
                    Bishop of Salisbury, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1076, did not disdain to
                    spend some part of his time in writing, binding, and illuminating books.” Mr
                    Strutt, as already noticed, has given the public an opportunity of forming a
                    judgment as to the degree of delicacy and art with which these illuminations
                    were executed, by publishing prints of a prodigious number of them, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Regal and Ecclesiastical Antiquities of England,</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">View of the Customs of England.</hi> In the first of these works
                    we are presented with the genuine portraits, in miniature, of all the kings and
                    several of the queens of England, from Edward the Confessor to Henry VII. mostly
                    in their crowns and royal robes, together with the portraits of many other
                    eminent persons of both sexes.</p>
                <p>The illuminators and painters of this period seem to have been in possession of a
                    considerable number of colouring materials, and to have known the arts of
                    preparing and mixing them, so as to form a great variety of colours; for, in the
                    specimens of their miniature-paintings which are still extant, we perceive not
                    only the five primary colours, but also various combinations of these. Though
                    Strutt’s prints do not exhibit the bright and vivid colours of the originals,
                    they give us equally a view, not only of the persons and dresses of onr
                    ancestors, but also of their customs, manners, arts, and employments, their
                    arms, ships, houses, and furniture, and enable us to judge of their skill in
                    drawing. The figures in these paintings are often stiff and formal; but the
                    ornaments are in general fine and delicate, and the colours clear and bright,
                    particularly the gold and azure. In some of these illuminations the passions are
                    strongly represented. Terror, for example, is strongly painted in the faces of
                    the Earl of Warwick’s sailors when they were threatened with a shipwreck, and
                    grief in the countenances of those who were present at the death of that hero.
                    After the introduction of printing, this elegant art of illuminating gradually
                    declined, and at length became quite neglected.</p>
                <p>Before concluding, it may not be improper to observe, that from the fifth till
                    the tenth century, the miniature paintings which we meet with in Greek
                    manuscripts, are generally good, as are also some which we find amongst those of
                    Italy, England, and France. From the tenth till the middle of the fourteenth
                    century they are commonly very bad, and may be considered as so many monuments
                    of the barbarism of those ages; but towards the latter end of the fourteenth,
                    the paintings in manuscripts were much improved; and in the two succeeding
                    centuries many excellent performances were produced, especially after the
                    restoration of the arts, when great attention was paid to the works of the
                    ancients, and the study of antiquity became fashionable.</p>
