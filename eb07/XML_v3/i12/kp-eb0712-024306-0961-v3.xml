                <p><label type="entry">IDOLATRY, or the worship of idols</label>, may be
                    distinguished into two sorts. By the first, men adore the works of God, the sun,
                    the moon, the stars, angels, daemons, men, and animals; by the second, men
                    worship the work of their own hands, as statues, pictures, and the like: but to
                    these may be added a third, that by which men have worshipped the true God under
                    sensible figures and representations. This indeed may have been the case with
                    respect to each of the above kinds of idolatry; thus the Israelites adored God
                    under the figure of a calf.</p>
                <p>The host of heaven were the first objects of idolatrous worship, on account of
                    their beauty, their influence on the productions of the earth, and the
                    regularity of their motions, particularly the sun and moon, which are considered
                    as the most glorious and resplendent images of the Deity. But afterwards, when
                    the sentiments of mankind became more corrupt, they began to form images, and to
                    entertain the opinion, that by virtue of consecration, the gods were called down
                    to inhabit or dwell in these statues. Hence Arnobius takes occasion to rally the
                    pagans for guarding so carefully the statues of their gods, who, if they were
                    really present in their images, might save their worshippers the trouble of
                    securing them from thieves and robbers.</p>
                <p>As to the adoration which the ancient pagans paid to the statues of their gods,
                    it is certain, that the wiser and more sensible heathens considered them only as
                    simple representations or figures designed to recal to their minds the memory of
                    their gods. This was the opinion of Varro and Seneca; and the same sentiment is
                    clearly expressed in Plato, who maintains that images are inanimate, and that
                    all the honour paid to them has respect to the gods whom they represent. But as
                    to the vulgar, they were stupid enough to believe the statues themselves to be
                    gods, and to pay divine worship to stocks and stones.</p>
