                <p><label type="entry">INGENHOUSZ, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, an
                    eminent physician and natural philosopher, was born at Breda in 1730. He was
                    first established in medical practice there, but removed to London in 1767,
                    particularly with a view to study the improved methods of inoculation then
                    recently introduced. Having become acquainted with Sir John Pringle, at that
                    time President of the Royal Society, he was by him recommended to the Austrian
                    ambassador, for the purpose of inoculating the Imperial family at Vienna, the
                    Empress Maria Theresa having lost two of her children by the natural small-pox.
                    He accepted this engagement in 1768, and having been perfectly successful in his
                    operations, he was remunerated by the grant of a pension of L.600 a-year for
                    life, together with the titles of Aulic Counsellor and Physician to the Imperial
                    Family. He was also consulted, in his medical capacity, by many others of the
                    most distinguished personages at Vienna, and he enjoyed the particular esteem of
                    the Emperor Joseph II., who was fond of receiving him in his cabinet, and of
                    witnessing the exhibition of a variety of physical experiments, with which it
                    was always the delight of Ingenhousz to amuse and instruct his acquaintance of
                    both sexes. The following spring he went to Italy, and inoculated the Grand Duke
                    of Tuscany. He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society in May 1769; but he
                    appears to have remained some years in Italy, for he was at Leghorn in January
                    1773; in March he dates from Salzburg; and in November 1775 from Vienna. The
                    next year he was in London; and, in the winter of 1779, he went to Paris. The
                    latter part of his life he spent principally in England, which, notwithstanding
                    his dislike to the chillness of the climate, was always his favourite residence,
                    and “where he enjoyed during many years,” to use his own words, “that felicity
                    which a free and independent man finds in the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom,
                    in the society and friendly intercourse of those who have distinguished
                    themselves by their learning.”</p>
                <p>Dr Ingenhousz was cheerful in his disposition, and often playful in his
                    conversation. Though his pursuits were chiefly scientific, he was not destitute
                    of taste for literature and poetry. He had a particular predilection for Lucan
                    and for the Cardinal de Polignac, and would frequently recite passages from
                    their poems with great energy, and with a strong German accent. Nor did he
                    disdain the comforts of commercial opulence, and he was often a visitor at the
                    magnificent villa of the late Mr Rucker of Rohamp-ton. He had been introduced
                    there by his friend Dr Brocklesby, who was in many respects of a perfectly
                    congenial disposition, and who had great pleasure in prevailing on him to
                    partake occasionally of his own hospitality, when his table would otherwise have
                    been solitary. He died the 7th September 1799, at Bow Wood, in Wiltshire, the
                    house of the Marquis of Lansdown, who had long known and esteemed him.</p>
                <p>Dr Ingenhousz’s principal publications are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Experiments on
                    the Torpedo. Phil. Trans.</hi> 1775, p. 1. Mr Walsh had lately gained
                    considerable reputation by his account of the effects of the torpedo. These
                    experiments, which were made off Leghorn, in company with Dr Drummond, arc
                    merely illustrative of the properties of that animal, which are now better
                    known; and they afford no decided test of the electrical nature of the
                    phenomena.</p>

                    Nitrous Air, with Experiments on Platinα, Phil. Trans.</hi> 1776, p. 257. The
                    eudiometrical apparatus is described as an improvement on Fontana’s. The
                    experiments are intended to shew that platina is not an alloy of iron and gold,
                    since it may be deprived of all magnetic properties by repeated cupellation.</p>

                    relating to the instrumer t then lately invented by Professor Volta, and which
                    had been made known to the author by the Archduke Ferdinand. Its action is
                    explained upon the elementary principles of the Franklinian theory. The next
                    article in the volume contains some experiments of Mr Henly in confirmation of
                    the doctrines here advanced.</p>

                    powerful explosion is produced by the detonation of the vapour of a single drop
                    of ether with oxygen gas. The author takes occasion to investigate the
                    elasticity of the gas evolved by the detonation of gunpowder; and agrees with
                    Bernoulli in estimating it as equivalent to near 2500 atmospheres. It may here
                    be remarked, that notwithstanding Bernoulli’s general accuracy, and great
                    mathematical talents, he has fallen into a very singular error, in comparing the
                    force of gunpowder with the daily labour of men; and has accidentally made the
                    force of one pound equivalent to the daily work of 100 men, while, in fact, the
                    force of 40 pounds is only equivalent to the daily labour of a single man.</p>

                    chiefly occupied by the detailed proofs of the author’s principal discovery,
                    that vegetables in general pour out a portion of oxygen gas in the sunshine,
                    while they rather diminish its proportion at night and in the shade. It is
                    dedicated to Sir John Pringle, and was translated into <hi rend="italic"

                    the test employed, it was easy to imagine that some differences were discovered,

                    experiments, and denying some statements of Dr Priestley; advancing, in
                    particular, many arguments to prove that the air obtained is really supplied by
                    the vegetables, and not by the water in which they are usually immersed, in
                    order to collect it. Dr Ingenhousz was, on all occasions, anxious to support his
                    claim to this very interesting discovery; and he insisted that Priestley’s
                    earlier experiments, on the green matter contained in stagnant water, had little
                    or nothing in common with his own, because that matter was, in fact, of an
                    animal nature. He was in the habit of collecting the gas from cabbage leaves,
                    and of keeping it bottled up in his pocket; and he was prepared with some coils
                    of iron wire fastened into the corks, in order to exhibit the brilliant
                    phenomenon of their combustion to his friends; the public being at that time
                    less accustomed to this dazzling exhibition, than it has become in later years,
                    when elementary lectures on chemistry have been more commonly addressed to mixed
                    audiences than heretofore.</p>
