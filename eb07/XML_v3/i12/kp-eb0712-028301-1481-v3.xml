                    tribunal, charged with the detection, prosecution, and punishment of heresy,
                    apostasy, and other crimes against religion· ...</p>
                <p>This formidable jurisdiction, created for the express purpose of repressing free
                    inquiry in matters of religion, and maintaining the unity of the faith, was
                    first instituted about the beginning of the thirteenth century, when Innocent
                    III. appointed a commission to prosecute and punish the heretics of Narbonne. In
                    1203, the Pope employed Pierre de Castelnau and Raoul, monks of Citeaux,
                    attached to the monastery of Frontfroine in Narbonne, to preach against the
                    heresy of the Albigenses. The labours of these missionaries were not altogether
                    fruitless, as is proved by an authentic act which William Castel has inserted in
                    his History of the Counts of Toulouse, and which was agreed to in the year 1204.
                    They appear to have made a considerable impression, and, in particular, to have
                    induced the inhabitants of Toulouse to bind themselves by an oath to maintain
                    the Catholic religion, and to combat heresy by every means in their power. The
                    success which Castelnau and Raoul had thus obtained in their mission, encouraged
                    the Pope to put in execution a project which he had formed for introducing into
                    the Catholic Church inquisitors independent of the bishops, who should, as
                    delegates of the Holy See, have the right of prosecuting heretics.</p>
                <p>With this view he named as apostolic legates, the Abbot of Citeaux, and the two
                    monks Castelnau and Raoul, who received orders to take the necessary measures
                    for bringing back heretics to the Catholic faith, and also for delivering to the
                    secular power, after excommunication, those who refused submission; a penalty
                    which involved the seizure of their goods, and the proscription of their
                    persons. And, in order to facilitate the execution of his design, he solicited
                    Philip II., king of France, his oldest son Louis, and the counts, viscounts, and
                    barons of the kingdom, to prosecute heretics of whatsoever rank they might be,
                    and to seize the goods of all persons who might be convicted of favouring heresy
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, or who had not laboured to destroy it; promising
                    them, as a recompense for their zeal, plenary indulgences, similar to those
                    granted to the Christians who had assumed the cross, and repaired to the Holy
                    Land to combat against the Infidels. But the papal legates experienced great
                    difficulties in the execution of their mission, which was distasteful to the
                    bishops; the king of France took no part in the affair; and the Counts of
                    Toulouse, Foix, Beziers, Carcassonne, and other seigneurs or great lords of the
                    provinces, seeing that the Albigenses had singularly multiplied, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192941494" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1494-0284"/> persuaded that
                    only a very small number of them would freely consent to abjure their opinions,
                    refused to expel a body of men, the loss of whom would weaken the population of
                    their estates, and consequently prove injurious to their interests. Nor was the
                    force of this motive lessened by the consideration that these heretics were
                    generally peaceable and obedient subjects. The legates were consequently
                    discouraged, and one of their number applied to the Pope for permission to
                    retire to his monastery. But the Holy Father, firm to his purpose, exhorted him
                    to prosecute the enterprise with new ardour, and at the same time addressed new
                    briefs to Philip II., reproaching him for his indifference, and to the
                    Archbishop of Narbonne and to the Bishop of Beziers, censuring the mode in which
                    they had acted towards his legates.</p>
                <p>In these circumstances, Castelnau and Raoul commenced preaching to the heretics,
                    and even held conferences with some of their leaders; but, as might have been
                    expected, the number of persons converted by them was exceedingly small.
                    Arnauld, Abbot of Citeaux, the principal legate, then summoned to his assistance
                    twelve abbots of his order, elected by a chapter held in 1206, and also admitted
                    to a participation of their labours two Spaniards, whose zeal prompted them to
                    preach against the heretics, and one of whom became afterwards celebrated as the
                    founder of a new order in the Catholic Church. These were Diego Ace-bes, Bishop
                    of Osma, who was then on his return from Rome to his diocese, and Dominic de
                    Guzman, a regular canon of St Augustin, and sub-prior of the cathedral of the
                    same diocese, who had accompanied the bishop in his journey. With a staff thus
                    reinforced, some conversions were made, and when the Spanish bishop resolved to
                    cross the frontier, he permitted De Guzman to remain in France.</p>
                <p>At this time the great feudatories of Provence and Narbonne were almost all
                    engaged in war with each other; and hence when the legates sent by the Pope
                    summoned them to prosecute obstinate heretics in their states, they represented
                    that they could not execute the orders of his Holiness, by reason of the wars
                    which they were obliged to maintain against their neighbours. Innocent III.,
                    informed of what was passing, issued a formal order to his legates, commanding
                    them to terminate, by their mediation, the differences which had armed the
                    princes and great lords of this country, and to make the latter promise upon
                    oath, to extirpate heresy, and to exterminate heretics in their domains. Nor
                    were the legates unfaithful to the instructions which they had received. They
                    threatened to excommunicate those who should refuse obedience to the orders of
                    the Holy See; to lay their principalities under interdict; to release their
                    vassals from their oath of fidelity; and, in a word, to punish them by all the
                    means which the church had or claimed a right to employ against rebels. The
                    effect of this measure was decisive; and the great lords, dreading evils still
                    greater than those of war, renounced for the time their different pretensions,
                    and consented to sign a peace. Of these princes the most powerful was Raymond
                    VI., Count of Toulouse. Having been several times menaced by Pierre de
                    Castelnau, because he hesitated to execute what he had promised, and failed to
                    reinforce the predications of the legate by proscription and confiscation, the
                    proud noble let fall some expressions of resentment. His words were treasured up
                    by those who had deeper wrongs to avenge, and falling in with the feeling of
                    indignation excited by the insolent conduct of the churchman, they induced the
                    Albigenses to assassinate the legate. The latter was beatified, and enrolled
                    amongst the martyrs of the church, sooner perhaps than he had anticipated ∙, but
                    the perpetrators of the crime were destined ere long to taste its bitter fruits.
                    Meanwhile the Pope wrote to all the counts, barons, seigneurs, and gentlemen of
                    the provinces of Narbonne, Arles, Embrun, Aix, and Vienne in</p>
                <p>Dauphine, urging them to unite their forces and to march against these heretics,
                    and promising them the same indulgences as if they had been called to combat
                    against the Saracens. In this expedition, Innocent named as his legate the
                    Bishop of Couserans, who was to be accompanied by the Abbot of Citeaux.</p>
                <p>The commencement of the Inquisition in France dates from the war undertaken
                    against the Albigenses, and their protector Raymond VI., Count of Toulouse, in
                    1208. The murder of Castelnau having excited the indignation of the* Catholics
                    of Narbonne, Arnauld took advantage of this feeling, to put in execution the
                    orders which he had received from the Pope. He charged the twelve monks of his
                    order who were associated with him, besides Dominic de Guzman, and certain other
                    priests, to preach a crusade against the heretics; to grant indulgences to all
                    who should take part in the war; to take especial notice of those who might
                    refuse to engage in it; to inform themselves particularly as to the creed of
                    such recusants; and to cause the‘obstinate to be placed at the disposal of
                    Simon, Count de Montfort, who had been entrusted with the command of the
                    crusaders. The authentic act by which these measures were ordained, has not
                    reached our time; but its existence is proved generally by the events of that
                    epoch, and, in particular, by a certificate of reconciliation granted by Dominic
                    de Guzman to a heretic named Ponce Roger, in which the founder of the Dominicans
                    declared that he acted as the delegate of the Abbé Arnauld.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to determine the number of the unfortunate Albigenses who perished
                    in the flames after 1208, the year in which the Inquisition commenced in France.
                    But it is impossible not to be strongly moved with horror as well as compassion,
                    in reading the histories of the time, which represent the destruction of several
                    millions of persons, in the midst of the most cruel torments, as the triumph of
                    a religion on which its divine Founder had impressed the characters of humanity
                    and charity, benevolence and mercy. The apostles, upon one occasion, entreated
                    their divine Master to cause fire to descend from heaven and consume the
                    Samaritans, who were the heretics and schismatics of the Hebrew communion; but,
                    so far from complying with their impious request, he reproached them for
                    entertaining the very thought, and made them feel that he detested it, by
                    treating them with a degree of severity of which there is no other example to be
                    found in the Gospel. This lesson, however, was lost upon the men of the
                    thirteenth century. They seem to have conceived that the history of Samaria had
                    nothing in common with the conduct which ought to be pursued towards the
                    heretics of that age. In 1215, Innocent III. celebrated the tenth general
                    council, being the fourth of Lateran, in which a variety of new penalties were
                    decreed against the heretics of Languedoc. In particular it was ordained, that
                    those who were condemned by the bishops as impenitent heretics should be
                    delivered to secular justice; that the goods of laymen condemned should be
                    confiscated, and those of priests applied to the use of their churches; that the
                    inhabitants suspected of heresy should be summoned to purge themselves in the
                    canonical form, and, in case of refusal, excommunicated; that if they continued
                    more than a year under the anathema, without having recourse to the pardon of
                    the church, they should be accounted heretics, and treated as such; that all
                    persons who favoured or received into their houses heretics, should be liable to
                    excommunication as well as the heretics themselves,—declared infamous, and as
                    such excluded from all public employments,—deprived of the right of electing
                    their own magistrates,—and rendered incapable of giving evidence in a court of
                    justice, making testamentary dispositions, or taking up any succession, if at
                    the expiration of a year they had failed to perform their duties and satisfy the
                    church.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941507" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1507-0285"/>
                <p>Pope Innocent HL died on the 12th of July 1216, and two days thereafter was
                    succeeded by Honorius III., who resolved to continue the work which his
                    predecessor had commenced. The new pontiff approved of the institution founded
                    by Dominic de Guzman, according to the rule of St Augustin, and having for its
                    object to preach against the heretics; an institution which gave rise to the
                    order of preaching friars, who were afterwards termed Dominicans. He wrote to
                    Guzman, praising his zeal, and encouraging him to persevere in the enterprise in
                    which he had engaged; he sent into the provinces of Languedoc and Provence,
                    Cardinal Bertrand, with the title of legate, the principal object of whose
                    mission was to prosecute with new vigour the war against the Albigenses, to
                    sustain the zeal of the missionaries, and to ensure the reconciliation of
                    converted, as well as the punishment of obstinate heretics; and, lastly, he
                    issued a brief addressed to all the bishops of Christendom, strongly
                    recommending to their favour and support the order of preaching friars.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile St Dominic, who happened to be at Rome, had instituted an order for
                    seculars who lived in the world, the members of which were to be bound to
                    assist, as far as they could, those who preached against heresies, and to
                    prosecute heretics with unrelenting rigour. This order has sometimes been
                    designated the Third Order of Penitence, but it was more commonly denominated
                    the Militia of Christ, because those who entered it were required to combat
                    heretics, and to aid the inquisitors in the exercise of their ministry. They
                    were in fact regarded as forming part <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the family of
                    the inquisition, and, for this reason, they bore the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Familiars.</hi> Here, then, we have the two great elements of the Holy Office;
                    first, the institution of St Dominic, or the order of preaching friars, called
                    Dominicans; and, secondly, the Militia of Christ, an association which
                    afterwards gave rise to that which was known under the name of the Congregation
                    of St Peter Martyr; two orders which were soon confounded, and the members of
                    which were denominated <hi rend="italic">Familiars of the Holy Office of the
                    Inquisition.</hi></p>
                <p>Nor was it long ere the tribunal, thus organized, commenced active operations
                    against heretics. In 1224, the Inquisition had been established in Italy, under
                    the direction of the religious Dominicans. This is proved by a constitution of
                    Frederick II., published at Padua in February 1224, which provided that heretics
                    condemned as such by the church, and delivered over to the secular arm, should
                    be punished in a manner proportioned to their crime; that whosoever, through
                    fear of punishment, might be brought back to the unity of the faith, should be
                    subjected to a canonical penance and shut up in prison for life; that the
                    inquisitors established by the pope, or Catholics zealous for the purity of the
                    faith, might require judges, in any part of the empire, to cause heretics to be
                    seized, and detained as prisoners until, after being formally excommunicated by
                    the church, they were judged and punished with death; that all who supported or
                    protected heretics should undergo the same punishment; that heretics who had
                    returned into the bosom of the church should be obliged to pursue those persons
                    charged with heresy, discover, and bring them before the Inquisition; that he
                    who, having made abjuration <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >articulo</hi><hi rend="italic">mortis,</hi> should relapse into heresy after
                    recovering his health, should equally suffer a capital punishment; and that
                    treason against God was a much greater crime than treason against man. This
                    constitution contains other provisions equally severe, and concludes by
                    declaring that all those who should concur with the new religious order m
                    delivering the empire from the contagion of heresy, would serve God and render
                    themselves useful to the state. It appears, however, that the efforts of the
                    Inquisition in Narbonne, were not attended with the success which the Pope had
                    expected from them, probably because the events of the war were not always
                    favourable to the crusaders.</p>
                <p>But it was reserved for Gregory IX., who ascended the pontifical throne in 1227,
                    to fix the establishment of the Inquisition in the form of a tribunal, and at
                    the same time to give it constitutions. With this view he convened a council at
                    Toulouse, where new measures of severity were adopted against the heretics; he
                    also issued a bull excommunicating them, and further, enjoining that the
                    impenitent should be delivered over to the secular arm, and that all their
                    supporters and adherents should be declared infamous. He next transmitted a
                    brief to Esparrago, archbishop of Toledo, exhorting him to combat heresy; and at
                    the same time addressed to the prior of the Dominicans of Lombardy a commission,
                    confiding to that religious order the execution of his bull against heretics.
                    Councils were also held at Melun, and at Beziers, where new regulations were
                    adopted for preserving the purity of the faith, by multiplying the severities
                    against those by whom it was denied.</p>
                <p>But whilst this was passing in France, the heresy <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    Albigenses penetrated even into the capital of the Catholic world. The extreme
                    means of repression hitherto employed against these schismatics had totally
                    failed either in lessening their ardour, or in abating their enthusiasm. Several
                    thousands of their number had perished at the stake in France and Italy; yet, so
                    far from being discouraged, they had, in defiance of the power of the Pope,
                    carried their doctrines into his very capital, and, by this conduct, proved how
                    much they disregarded the anathemas of the church, and even the horrible
                    torments with which Gregory had menaced them. Nor is it improbable that the
                    pontiff would have abandoned the system of repression which he had adopted, if
                    the opinions which originated in the fourth century, when Constantine embraced
                    Christianity, had not from age to age acquired a new degree of force; namely,
                    that sufficient reasons might be discovered in the Gospel for punishing heretics
                    with death. Unhappily, however, men’s minds, subjugated by prejudice, and
                    inflamed by bigotry, were rendered incapable of considering objects in their
                    true light. Hence, so far from changing his system, or taking as his guide that
                    spirit of meekness and benevolence which had distinguished the first three
                    centuries of Christianity, Gregory fulminated against the heretics a bull in
                    which he excommunicated all those belonging to certain classes that are therein
                    named; ordained that the persons condemned should be delivered over to the
                    secular power to receive the punishment due to their crime; regulated the mode
                    of procedure to be adopted against persons accused of heresy; intercommuned,
                    declared infamous, and deprived of their civil rights, those inhabitants who
                    should receive into their houses, protect, or defend reputed heretics; and
                    provided that if any one desired to recant and renounce his errors, he should
                    undergo such penance as might be prescribed, and thereafter be imprisoned for
                    life. This bull, which contained many other penalties and disabilities, was
                    enforced with the utmost rigour; whilst the senator Annibal, and other members
                    of the government of Rome, in order to second the Pope in the execution of the
                    measures which he had ordained, passed different municipal laws, having for
                    their object the detection and punishment of heretics, and being in spirit and
                    character nearly the same with those which had been promulgated by Frederick
                    II.</p>
                <p>Nor were these regulations confined in their operation to Rome. They were
                    transmitted, along with those which Gregory himself had decreed, to the
                    Archbishop of Milan, in order that he might cause them to be rigorously executed
                    in his own diocese, in those of his suffragans, and in some other parts of
                    Cisalpine Gaul, where heresy had already made alarming progress. Frederick II.
                    also renewed the constitutions which he had published against heretics in 1224,
                    particularly the law against blasphemers, which condemned all heretics
                    indiscriminately to undergo the punishment of burning, or of having the tongue
                    cut out, if the <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941520" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1520-0286"
                    />bishops thought proper to shew them mercy, in order that in future it might be
                    impossible for them to blaspheme the holy name of God.</p>
                <p>Such is the general form which the Inquisition had assumed in France and Italy,
                    when Gregory IX. introduced it into Spain. This event took place about the
                    middle of the thirteenth century. Spain was then divided into four Christian
                    kingdoms, viz. Castille, Navarre, Aragon, and Portugal, besides the Mahommedan
                    States; but, with relation to the Inquisition, that country was, in 1301,
                    divided into two provinces, viz. those of Castille and Aragon. To the
                    Dominicans, who had hitherto acquitted themselves with success in the ministry
                    of persecution, Gregory confided the execution of the bull by which the
                    Inquisition was established in Spain; and, at a subsequent period, the
                    provincial of this order had conferred upon him the right of nominating the
                    local inquisitors, with the title and rank of provincial of Spain. Nor was it
                    long ere this formidable institution, having for its object to extirpate heresy,
                    and to preserve the purity of the Catholic faith, came into active operation.
                    For the details of its proceedings, however, we must refer the reader to the
                    work of Llorente,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire Critique de l’inquisition d’Espagne,</hi> Paris, 1818, 4
                    vols. 8vo. Llorente had been an inquisitor himself (at Calatayud) and was
                    probably on that account selected to prepare a digest of the materials for a
                    history of the Inquisition, furnished by the archives of the Holy
                    Office«</p></note> which, with all its faults of style and arrangement, contains
                    a vast body of interesting and authentic information on this subject. We shall
                    only remark here, that never did plant find a more congenial soil. In France and
                    in Italy it had required strenuous and persevering efforts to organize and
                    establish this terrible tribunal; in Spain, however, it took root at once, and
                    in time attained a magnitude which, from a variety of causes, it never reached
                    in any other country. During the fourteenth century its progress was steady,
                    whilst its vigour and energy were continually on the increase. Its jurisdiction
                    was enlarged, and its ramifications multiplied; <hi rend="italic"
                    >autos-da-fe</hi> were celebrated in various places; and many perished in the
                    flames, or were condemned to suffer punishments of greater or less severity, for
                    asserting the unalienable rights of conscience.</p>
                <p>But it was not until towards the close of the fifteenth century, when Isabella,
                    wife of Ferdinand of Aragon, had ascended the throne of Castille, and when the
                    different kingdoms of Spain were united under these sovereigns, that the
                    Inquisition became general in that country, and assumed that form which it
                    retained until the period of its dissolution in 1808. The execution of the bull
                    of Sixtus IV., which authorized Ferdinand and Isabella to establish the
                    Inquisition in their states, was indeed for a time suspended; but this
                    suspension must have been of short duration, for in 1480 and 1481 we find it in
                    full activity. Severe measures were adopted against the Jews, who were accused
                    of the most absurd and ridiculous crimes, and in consequence the new Christians,
                    as they were called, emigrated in great numbers. The flames of persecution raged
                    at Seville, where, in 1481, twenty-six persons perished at the stake; and
                    already no less than two hundred and ninety-eight victims had shared a similar
                    fate. From this period, indeed, may be dated the establishment of the modern
                    Inquisition, that is, of the Inquisition such as it existed even until our own
                    time. This was effected by the creation of a grand inquisitor-general; the
                    appointment of a royal council of the Inquisition, afterwards denominated the
                    Council of the Supreme; the institution of subaltern tribunals in all parts of
                    the kingdom; and, lastly, the enactment of organic laws, having for their object
                    to give stability to the tribunal, as well as uniformity to its procedure, and
                    efficacy to its exertions in the repression of heresy. By this organization
                    there was created in Spain a jurisdiction in matters of religion, which, under
                    the able but merciless direction of such men as Torquemada, Valdez, and their
                    immediate successors, became the most effective and vigorous eng⅛ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> e</hi> of persecution which had ever before been known in any
                    age or country. Its character will be best understood by stating the substance
                    of the organic or fundamental laws of the modern Inquisition, which, under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Instructions,</hi> were published at Seville on the
                    29th of October 1484.</p>
                <p>The first of these regulated the manner in which the institution of the tribunal
                    should be announced in those countries or places where it might be judged
                    necessary to establish it. The second crdained the publication, in the church of
                    the place, of an edict accompanied with the <hi rend="italic">censures</hi>
                    provided against those who, having committed the crime of heresy or apostasy,
                    should not voluntarily denounce themselves before the expiration of the term of
                    grace which had been granted them, and also against those who should obstruct or
                    resist the execution of the measures ordained by the Holy Office. By the third,
                    a delay of thirty days was allowed to heretics to declare themselves, and
                    thereby to prevent the confiscation of their goods, without prejudice, however,
                    to the pecuniary fines to which they might afterwards be condemned. By the
                    fourth, it was provided that the voluntary confessions of those who declared
                    themselves should be made in writing in the presence of the inquisitors and a
                    registrar, so that the self-accused might be required to answer all the
                    questions which might be addressed to them by the inquisitors on the subject of
                    their confession, andalso respecting their accomplices, and those whom they knew
                    or suspected to be guilty of apostasy. The fifth prohibited giving secret
                    absolution to any one who had made a voluntary confession, excepting in the
                    single case where no one had had knowledge of his crime, and where there was
                    nothing to apprehend from its publicity. By the sixth article it was provided
                    that part of the penance enjoined on him who had been reconciled should consist
                    in his being deprived of the exercise of every honourable employment, and of the
                    use of gold, silver, pearls, silk, and fine linen. The seventh imposed pecuniary
                    fines upon those who had made a voluntary confession. The eighth provided that
                    the voluntary penitent who might present himself with his confession, after the
                    expiration of the term of grace, should not be exempted from the penalty of
                    confiscation of goods, which he would otherwise have incurred. In the ninth
                    article, it was enacted, that if persons under the age of twenty presented
                    themselves to make confession, after the expiration of the term of grace, and if
                    it were proved that they had been led into error by their parents, it would be
                    sufficient to impose on them a slight penance. The tenth imposed on inquisitors
                    the obligation of declaring, in the act of reconciliation, the time in which the
                    reconciled had fallen into heresy, in order to ascertain what portion of his
                    goods belonged to the fisc. The eleventh article bore, that if a heretic
                    detained in the secret prisons of the Holy Office, were touched with due
                    repentance, and demanded absolution, it might be granted him, by imposing as a
                    penance the pain of perpetual imprisonment. By the twelfth, it was provided,
                    that if the inquisitors considered the confession of the penitent to have been
                    simulated, in the case indicated in the preceding article, they should refuse
                    absolution, declare him a false penitent, and condemn him as such to be <hi
                    rend="italic">relaxed,</hi> that is, delivered over to the secular arm. The
                    thirteenth ordained that if a man, absolved after free confession, boasted of
                    having concealed several crimes, or if it appeared, from information afterwards
                    obtained, that he had committed more than he confessed, he should be arrested,
                    and judged as a false penitent· The fourteenth provided, that if the accused,
                    when convicted, <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941533" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1533-0287"
                    />persisted in denying the charge, even after the publication of the evidence,
                    he should be condemned as impenitent. By the fifteenth, if there were only a <hi
                    rend="italic">semi-plena</hi><hi rend="italic">probatio</hi> against the
                    accused, who denied the crime charged against him, he might be subjected to the
                    question; in which case, if he confessed himself guilty under the torture, and
                    thereafter confirmed his confession, he was punished as one regularly convicted;
                    but if he retracted, he was to undergo, a second time, the same probation, or to
                    be condemned to an extraordinary punishment. The sixteenth prohibited
                    communicating to the accused an entire copy of the declarations of the
                    witnesses. They were only to be informed generally what had been deposed,
                    without being made aware of any circumstances which might enable them to
                    discover who had given evidence against, them. The seventeenth article enjoined
                    inquisitors themselves to interrogate the witnesses, in every case where it was
                    possible for them to do so. The eighteenth provided that two inquisitors should
                    be present when the person arraigned was put to the question; but if otherwise
                    occupied, they might appoint a commissary to receive the declarations of the
                    sufferer. By the nineteenth article, if the accused did not appear, after having
                    been cited according to the prescribed forms, he might be condemned as a
                    convicted heretic. The twentieth bore, that if it were proved by the books, or
                    by the conduct whilst in life of a person deceased, that he had been a heretic,
                    he might be judged and condemned as such, his corpse disinterred, and the whole
                    of his property confiscated to the state, at the expense of his natural heirs.
                    By the twenty-first article, the inquisitors were ordered to extend their
                    jurisdiction over the vassals of the great lords; and if the latter refused to
                    recognise it, to apply to them censures and other penalties. The twenty-second
                    provided that if the person condemned to be <hi rend="italic">relaxed</hi> to
                    the ordinary tribunal left children minors, a small portion of the confiscated
                    property of their father should be granted them by the government, in name of
                    alms, and the inquisitors should be obliged to confide to proper persons the
                    care of their education and Christian instruction. By the twenty-third, if a
                    heretic reconciled during the term of grace, without having incurred the penalty
                    of confiscation, should have acquired property from a person who would have been
                    condemned to that penalty, such property was not to be included in or protected
                    by the law of pardon. The twenty-fourth rendered it obligatory to restore to
                    liberty the Christian slaves of the reconciled, when confiscation had not taken
                    place, provided the king had granted pardon only on that condition. The
                    twenty-fifth article prohibited the inquisitors, and other persons attached to
                    the tribunal, from receiving presents, under pain of incurring the greater
                    excommunication, being deprived of all their employments, condemned to make
                    restitution, and amerced in twice the value of the articles received. The
                    twenty-sixth recommended to the officers of the Inquisition to live in peace
                    with one another, without affectation of superiority even on the part of him who
                    might be invested with the powers of the ordinary of the diocese; and, in case
                    any difference should arise, it was reserved for the inquisitor-general to
                    settle it quietly <hi rend="italic">(sans cclatf.</hi> By the twenty-seventh,
                    inquisitors were expressly enjoined to watch carefully over their subordinates,
                    in order that the latter might be exact in discharging their duties. Lastly, the
                    twenty-eighth article committed to the prudence of the inquisitors the
                    examination and discussion of all points which might not have been provided for
                    in the foregoing constitutions.</p>
                <p>Such is the substance of the Code of the Inquisition, as originally promulgated,
                    perhaps the most extraordinary digest ever formed for consolidating a system of
                    religious tyranny. From this abstract, indeed, it must be evident, whether we
                    examine the twenty-eight articles in detail, or consider them as a whole, that
                    the judgments and sentences pronounced would depend upon the manner in which the
                    charge was prepared, and the particular views and feelings entertained by the
                    judges, who were to decide as to the heresy or orthodoxy of the accused,
                    according to inductions, analogies, or consequences, deduced from facts or
                    isolated observations, reported with more or less of exaggeration and
                    infidelity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Que

                    however, several times augmented, even in the early days of the Inquisition. In
                    particular, there were added to it the instructions which had been prepared at
                    Seville in the beginning of 1484, those of Valladolid in 1488, those of Toledo
                    and Avila in 1498, and, lastly, those of Valladolid in 1561. But with all these
                    modifications the forms of procedure underwent little or no change; nor was the
                    arbitrary character which distinguished this cruel and odious jurisprudence in
                    any degree mitigated. It was scarcely possible for the accused, however
                    innocent, to establish an effectual defence. Placed between the alternative of
                    either recognising his innocence, or suspecting him of guilt, the judges
                    constantly allowed themselves to adopt the latter course, which at once
                    superseded the necessity of proof, and left the accused entirely at their
                    mercy.</p>
                <p>The additional acts of the inquisitor-general Torquemada also fall under the
                    description which has already been given. They were eleven in number, and
                    principally intended to regulate details. They provided that in every subaltern
                    tribunal there should be two inquisitor-jurisconsults, a fiscal, an alguazil,
                    registrars, and other officers if required; that every functionary who received
                    presents either from the accused, or their families, should be immediately
                    dismissed; that the Inquisition should maintain at Rome an able jurisconsult,
                    with the title of agent; that contracts signed before the year 1479 by persons
                    whose goods happened to be seized after that period, should be valid; that
                    proprietors who might have afforded to fugitives an asylum on their estates,
                    should be held as having placed their whole property at the disposal of the
                    government; that the notaries of the Inquisition should keep accounts of the
                    effects of persons condemned; that the receivers of the Holy Office might sell
                    that property, the administration of which they found troublesome, and collect
                    the rents of such as was immoveable; that each receiver should attend to the
                    interests of the tribunal to which he was more immediately attached; that the
                    goods of a person condemned could not be sequestrated without an order of the
                    Inquisition; that the inquisitor and other officers should be paid their
                    salaries quarterly by the receiver; and that, in regard to circumstances
                    unprovided for in the new constitutions, the inquisitors should have a
                    discretionary power to act as they judged best, but that, in matters of great
                    importance, they <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> should have recourse to the
                    government for instructions.</p>
                <p>The crimes of which the Inquisition took cognisance were heresy in all its
                    different forms, apostasy, Judaism, Mahommedanism, sorcery, offences against
                    nature, and polygamy; and the punishments consequent on conviction varied
                    according to the presumed degree of delinquency, from temporary confinement and
                    severe penance to the <hi rend="italic">san benito</hi><note anchored="true"

                    The first inquisitor of Aragon was openly assassinated, and all the provinces of
                    that kingdom offered the most strenuous resistance to a jurisdiction which
                    trenched so much on their ancient rights and privileges. But their opposition
                    proved unavailing, as did also an attempt made by the Cortes of Castille and
                    Aragon to reform the Holy Office after it had been established. The Inquisition
                    triumphed over all its adversaries, and soon became so formidable, that parents
                    delivered up their children, husbands their wives, and masters their servants,
                    without a murmur. Terror, in fact, constituted the great element of its power;
                    nor was this feeling diminished in force by the suddenness with which it pounced
                    on its victims, and the impenetrable secrecy in which all its proceedings were
                    involved. Its stroke was like that of fate. No man knew when it might descend on
                    his own head; every one felt that resistance was vain, and escape impossible.
                    Imagination lent its aid to exaggerate the fearful reality; terror froze all
                    hearts; even kings and princes trembled before it. Nor can it be denied that, in
                    its high and palmy days, its proceedings were marked by a bold and fearless
                    impartiality. It scrupled not to arrest and proceed against Don Carlos of
                    Austria, prince of the Asturias, whom death alone placed beyond the reach of its
                    sentence. It instituted processes against Charles V., Philip II., the Duke of
                    Alba, and other illustrious personages, the first of whom was accused of
                    favouring Lutheranism, and the others were charged with want of zeal in the
                    prosecution and extermination of heretics. Nor was it in any respect more
                    lenient to the clergy than to the laity. Bartolomeo Carranza, archbishop of
                    Toledo, a prelate of eminent learning, piety, and moderation, was accused of
                    entertaining and countenancing certain opinions declared to be heretical,
                    imprisoned for several years, and, after enduring the greatest sufferings, died
                    before his process was brought to a close, though it ended in a sentence of
                    absolution. With regard to the inferior clergy, a charge of heresy, or even the
                    suspicion of having shewn kindness to heretics, was almost equivalent to a
                    capital condemnation. Neither rank, nor age, nor sex, afforded any defence
                    against its watchful vigilance and its pitiless severity. It was instituted to
                    preserve the uniformity of the faith, and, in Spain at least, it completely
                    succeeded.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Llorente,

                <p>Nor can it be doubted that the procedure of the Inquisition was eminently
                    calculated to accomplish the objects for which it had been originally
                    instituted. This consisted of several parts; namely, the denunciation, the
                    inquest, the censure by qualificators, secret imprisonment, the primary
                    audiences, the charges, torture, the requisitory, the defence, the proofs, the
                    publication of the proofs, the definitive censure by qualificators, and the
                    sentence.</p>
                <p>The procedure of the Holy Office commenced by denunciation, or something held
                    equivalent thereto, such as a discovery incidentally resulting from a deposition
                    made before the tribunal in another affair; and this, when signed, assumed the
                    form of a declaration, in which the delator, after having sworn to tell the
                    truth, designated by their names, or in some other manner, the persons whom he
                    believed or presumed to be able to give evidence against the denounced. Then
                    followed the inquest, or examination of the persons named and designed in the
                    declaration as cognisant of the facts and circumstances therein set forth, and
                    who were made to promise upon oath that they would never reveal the
                    interrogatories which they were to be called upon to answer. Next came the
                    censure by the qualificators. When the tribunal had examined the preliminary <hi
                    rend="italic">instruction,</hi> and discovered therein sufficient grounds for
                    further procedure; and when the registers of the other tribunals of the province
                    had been examined, to ascertain if there existed in these any charges against
                    the denounced; the whole was submitted by the inquisitors to certain
                    theologians, called <hi rend="italic">qualificators of the Holy Office,</hi> who
                    indicated or <hi rend="italic">qualified</hi> in writing the propositions
                    meriting theological censure, as heretical, savouring of heresy, or calculated
                    to lead to heresy: And in case the denounced was only suspected of this crime,
                    they decided whether the suspicion was <hi rend="italic">light, grave,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">violent.</hi> As soon as the qualification here described had
                    been made, the procurator-fiscal demanded that the denounced should be
                    transferred to the secret prisons of the Holy Office. The tribunal had three
                    sorts of prisons; public, intermediary, and secret. The first were those in
                    which the Holy Office caused to be confined persons who, without being guilty of
                    any crime against the faith, were accused of some delict, the punishment of
                    which belonged of right to the Inquisition. The second were destined for such
                    servants or ministers of the Holy Office as had committed some crime or some
                    fault in the exercise of their functions, without, however, incurring the
                    suspicion of heresy. The third or secret prisons were those in which heretics,
                    or persons suspected of being so, were confined, and where the prisoners could
                    only communicate with the judges, in the cases provided and with the precautions
                    enjoined by the constitutions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Il serait difficile de rien concevoir de plus affreux que
                    ces réduits,” says Llorente; “non qu’ils soient à présent tels qu’on les a

                    l’inquisition que le témoignage de la vérité. Je ne parlerai de ce qu’ils ont

                    saisi dans un séjour où le feu n’a jamais pénétré.” <hi rend="italic">(Hist.

                <p>In the three days which followed the imprisonment of the suspected, they gave him
                    three audiences of <hi rend="italic">monition</hi> or advice, to engage him to
                    speak the truth and the whole truth, without concealing any thing which he had
                    himself done or said, or which he could impute to others contrary to the faith.
                    He was also told, that if he conformed faithfully to what had been prescribed to
                    him in this particular, mercy would be shewn him, but that, in the contrary
                    case, he would be treated with all the rigour of law. After the formality of the
                    three audiences of monition had been gone through, the procurator-fiscal
                    prepared the indictment against the prisoner, in conformity with the heads of
                    accusation indicated or <hi rend="italic">qualified</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">instruction</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and although there
                    existed only a <hi rend="italic">semi-plena</hi><hi rend="italic">probatio,</hi>
                    he charged the facts deposed to as if they had been fully proved, and what was
                    worse, he did not limit the articles or counts of his indictment to the number
                    of facts declared, and dispensed with applying to each head of accusation the
                    proper character or notion which distinguished it. The next part of the
                    procedure was the most horrible, namely, the application of the torture.
                    Although the prisoner, in the three audiences of monition, might have confessed
                    as much as, or even more, than the witnesses had deposed to, the fiscal
                    terminated his requisitory or accusation, by demanding that the accusea should
                    be subjected to the question, on the alleged ground <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192941559" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1559-0289"/>of culpable concealment and
                    denial of the truth. It is certain that for a long period the torture had not
                    been applied by the inquisitors, either in Spain or in any other country, the
                    mitigating and humanizing influence of time and improvement having virtually
                    abolished this barbarity; but the form of procedure still remained unchanged.
                    The <hi rend="italic">requisitory</hi> or accusation of the fiscal was never
                    communicated in writing to the accused, to enable him to prepare his defence. He
                    was conducted into the hall of audience, where, in presence of the inquisitors
                    and the fiscal, a secretary read over the charges one after another, stopping at
                    each article, and calling upon the accused to answer at the instant, whether it
                    was conformable to the truth or otherwise; thus laying a snare for the unhappy
                    person who was about to be put on his trial. After the accusation had been read,
                    the inquisitors asked the accused if he wished to be defended. If he answered in
                    the affirmative, they ordered a copy to be taken of the accusation and answers,
                    and, from the list of titularies of the Holy Office, appointed him an advocate.
                    No prisoner was permitted to choose his own counsel, although there existed no
                    law of the Holy Office which denied him this just and natural right. To the
                    proof, and the publication of the proof, as it was called, both gross mockeries
                    of justice, succeeded the definitive censure by the qualificators, or
                    theologians of the Holy Office, to whom was remitted the original of the
                    judgment they had pronounced on the summary instruction, together with an
                    extract of the answers made by the accused in his last examination, and who were
                    required to qualify for the second time the propositions upon which the
                    accusation was founded, to consider the explanation given by the prisoner, and
                    to decide whether he had, by his answers, elided in whole or in part the
                    suspicion of heresy with which he was charged, or whether, on the contrary, he
                    had not fortified the suspicion of his guilt. The importance of this censure
                    must be evident, since on it depended the definitive sentence. Yet, says
                    Llorente, “les <hi rend="italic">qualificateurs</hi> se donnent à peine le temps
                    d’écouter one lecture rapide de ce qui s’est passé; ils se hâtent d’établir leur
                    opinion, et c’est là le dernier acte important de la procédure,” all the rest
                    being a simple formality. Lastly, came the sentence, which, as may easily be
                    anticipated from the nature of the procedure, was generally condemnatory of the
                    prisoner. In fact, before the reign of Philip HL, sentences of absolution were
                    so rare in the Holy Office, that in one or even two thousand judgments we
                    scarcely find an instance where the prisoner was fully acquitted, because the
                    slightest doubt as to the complete innocence of the accused led the
                    qualificators to declare him suspected <hi rend="italic">de levi,</hi> and this
                    was sufficient to induce the inquisitors to condemn him to suffer pains more or
                    less grave, according to circumstances, and to make a formal abjuration of all
                    kinds of heresy, particularly of that of which he had incurred the
                    suspicion.</p>

                <p>lhe reading of the judgment formed the finale of the procedure which we have been
                    endeavouring to describe; and the execution of it always commenced in the same

                    with any form of the monastic habit This last circumstance led the inquisitors
                    to perfer for the <hi rend="italic">san-benito</hi> an ordinary woollen stuff
                    dyed yellow, with crosses of a red colour, by which means every trace of
                    resemblance between the habit in which the penitents of the Inquisition were
                    clothed, and that worn by any of the religious orders, Was completely
                    annihilated. Such was the <hi rend="italic">san-benito</hi> in 1514, when
                    Cardinal Ximenes de Cisneros caused the ordinary cross to be replaced by that of
                    St Andrew. Afterwards, however, the inquisitors varied the forms of the <hi
                    rend="italic">san-benito,</hi> in order that one of these might be applicable to
                    each class or description of penitents. But we shall only mention here those
                    which were in common use.</p>
                <p>When a person had been declared <hi rend="italic">slightly suspected</hi> of
                    heresy, and condemned to make abjuration, if he demanded to be relieved from the
                    censures <hi rend="italic">ad cautclam,</hi> he was made to assume a <hi
                    rend="italic">san-benito,</hi> which the Spaniards of the fifteenth century
                    called <hi rend="italic">zamarra,</hi> and which was merely the scapulary we
                    have already mentioned, without a cross in saltier. But if the condemned abjured
                    as one <hi rend="italic">violently suspected,</hi> he bore one-half of this
                    cross; and if he made abjuration as a <hi rend="italic">formal heretic,</hi> he
                    bore it entire. This, however, applied only to those who, after having been
                    reconciled, had their lives spared. But there were other kinds of <hi
                    rend="italic">san-benito</hi> for those who were condemned to perish in the
                    flames. He who, after having been once absolved from the crime of formal heresy,
                    and reconciled to the church, relapsed into his former errors, was denominated
                    <hi rend="italic">relapsed,</hi> and incurred the pain of death. His fate was
                    inevitable, however lively might be his repentance, and even notwithstanding a
                    second reconciliation. The only advantage which this last act procured him, was
                    that of not being burned alive. He was merely strangled, or put to death in some
                    other manner less horrible than by fire, and then his corpse was delivered to
                    the flames. Thus, as there were three kinds of <hi rend="italic">san-benito</hi>
                    for the three classes of condemned who were delivered to the secular arm, so
                    also the inquisitors contrived an equal number for those who were doomed to
                    suffer death.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> was that of prisoners who had repented before
                    being condemned. It was formed of a simple yellow scapulary, with an entire red
                    cross in saltier, and a round pyramidal bonnet, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >coroza,</hi> of the same stuff as the <hi rend="italic">san-benito,</hi> and
                    garnished with similar crosses, but without any representation of flames,
                    because the repentance of the accused having been manifested in time, had saved
                    them from the penalty of cremation. The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> was
                    destined for those who had been definitively condemned to be delivered to
                    secular justice, in order to undergo the pains of fire and who had repented,
                    after their condemnation, and before being conducted to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >auto-da-fe.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">san-benito</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">coroza</hi> were made of the same stuff. On the lower part of the
                    scapulary was represented a human bust on a brazier, whilst the rest of it was
                    covered with the resemblance of flames pointing downwards, to indicate that the
                    criminal was not to be burned alive, because he had not been adjudged to suffer
                    that punishment, but only to be thrown into the flames after being strangled.
                    The same representations were painted upon the <hi rend="italic">coroza.</hi>
                    The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> was for those who were treated as guilty of
                    final impenitence. It was made of the same stuff (serge) as the others. The
                    lower part exhibited a human bust on a brasier, surrounded with flames; and the
                    rest was covered with flames in their natural direction, to shew that he who
                    wore it was doomed to actual burning. On the vestment were also delineated
                    grotesque figures of devils, which were painted thereon, to indicate that these
                    lying spirits had entered and taken up their abode in the soul of the guilty.
                    The <hi rend="italic">coroza</hi> was charged with similar figures. Such were
                    the principal forms of the <hi rend="italic">san-benito.</hi> The others were
                    intended for those adjudged to suffer milder penalties, as confinement <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192941572" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1572-0290"/> and penance, and
                    generally had inscribed on them the name, country, species of heresy,
                    punishment, and date of condemnation of the delinquent, accompanied with a cross
                    in saltier or with flames, according to circumstances.</p>
                <p>As the Inquisition was the creation of an intolerant age, when religious zeal was
                    envenomed by bigotry, and exasperated by schisms and divisions, so it has fallen
                    before the humanizing influence of modern civilization, and is now, even in
                    Catholic countries, only a matter of history. In Spain and Portugal it has
                    ceased to exist even in name; in Italy and other countries, where it has not
                    been formally abolished, it is merely an obsolete institution, which
                    henceforward no one will ever succeed in reviving. But the time was when it
                    acted with fearfìfl energy and efficacy, and when, like the Vehmgericht of the
                    middle ages, it struck terror into all hearts. In Spain alone, according to
                    Llorente, upwards of three hundred and forty thousand persons were judged and
                    punished, one way or other, by this tribunal. The following is the general
                    result of his statement in figures :—</p>
                <p>Burned alive, 31,912</p>
                <p>Burned in effigy, 17,659</p>
                <p>Subjected to rigorous pains and penances, 291,450</p>
                <p>Total, 341,021</p>
                <p>And if to the number of victims immolated by the Inquisition in the Peninsula, be
                    added all the unfortunates who were condemned by the tribunals in Mexico Lima,
                    Carthagena, Sicily, Sardinia, Oran, Malta, together with Naples, Milan, and
                    Flanders, whilst these countries were under the dominion of Spain, it would
                    probably be found that more than half a million of human beings had been
                    condemned by this inexorable tribunal to undergo various punishments, a large
                    proportion of which inferred infamy. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
