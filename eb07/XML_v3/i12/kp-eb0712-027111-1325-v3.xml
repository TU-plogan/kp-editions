                    view to acquire distinction, there is none easier than that of professing a
                    disbelief of the established<pb break="no" facs="nls:192941338" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1338-0272"/> religion. That which shocks the feelings of those
                    with whom we converse, cannot fail of attracting notice; and as the vain are
                    usually confident, they utter their doubts with an air so oracular and decisive,
                    as induces the simple to think them profoundly wise. Audacity, with little
                    ingenuity, will attract the eyes of spectators, and this will sufficiently
                    answer the purpose of many amongst the professed unbelievers. One might be
                    diverted, if one were not hurt, at seeing a circle of silly admirers, gaping and
                    fixing their eyes on some half-learned and impudent prater, who throws out
                    oblique insinuations against the Bible, the clergy, or the sacrament. These are
                    fertile topics of wit and ingenuity; but it might mortify the vanity of some
                    very vain writers and talkers, if they were to recollect, what is undoubtedly
                    true, that it is a species of wit and ingenuity which not only the vilest, but
                    the most stupid and illiterate of mankind, have frequently displayed in all its
                    possible perfection.</p><p>“There is indeed no doubt, but that vanity is one of the principal causes of
                    infidelity. It must be the sole cause of communicating it to others, by writing
                    or conversation. For let us suppose the case of a very humane, judicious, and
                    learned man, entertaining doubts of the truth of Christianity: If he cannot
                    clear his doubts by examination, he will yet recollect that doubts are no
                    certainties; and, before he endeavours to propagate his scepticism, he will ask
                    himself these questions: ‘ Am I quite convinced that what I doubt of cannot
                    possibly be true? If I am convinced of it, am <hi rend="italic">I sure that</hi>
                    the publication of my opinions will not do more harm than good? Is not the
                    disturbing of any long-established civil constitution attended with confusion,
                    rebellion, bloodshed, and ruin? And are not the majority of men more strongly
                    attached to the religion than the government of their forefathers? Will it serve
                    my country to introduce discontent of any species? May not those innovations in
                    religion, which discontent may introduce, lead to all the evils which are caused
                    by frenzy and fanaticism? 'Granting that I were able to make a party formidable
                    enough to crush opposition and to exterminate Christianity, still am I certain
                    that I act, in this instance, like a good member of society? For is not this
                    system, whether well or ill founded, friendly to society? I must confess it; its
                    greatest enemies have acknowledged it. What motive, then, can induce me to
                    divulge my doubts of its authenticity? Not the good of mankind; for it is
                    already allowed by unbelievers, that the good of mankind is interested in the
                    belief of its divine original. Is it for my own good, and with a view to be
                    convinced? I will not deceive myself: my motive, <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
                    suspect, is of another kind; for do I read those books which have been already
                    written to satisfy similar doubts? Nothing but the vanity of appearing to be
                    wiser than my credulous neighbours can induce me to interrupt the happiness of
                    their belief. But vanity of this sort, which tends to disturb society, to injure
                    the national morals, and to rob many thousand individuals of a copious source of
                    sweet and solid comfort, must be pronounced extreme wickedness, even according
                    to the obvious dictates of natural religion. I shall act the part of a good
                    citizen and a good man, by conforming to a system whose beneficial influence I
                    feel and confess, and by endeavouring to acquire a belief in that which has for
                    so many centuries been established, and which promises to soothe me in distress
                    with the sweetest consolations, and to brighten the dismal hour of death, by the
                    hope of a more glorious and happy state of existence. At all events, I shall
                    have the satisfaction of having commanded myself so far, as not to have run the
                    hazard of endangering the welfare of my fellow-creatures, either here or
                    hereafter, by indulging a degree of vanity, which, in a creature so weak and so
                    shortlived as myself, is a folly very inconsistent with the supe rior wisdom
                    which I seem to arrogate.”</p><p>“I will venture to repeat,” continues our author, “that all writers against
                    Christianity, however they may affect even the extremes of benevolence, honour,
                    philosophy, and enlargement of mind, are actuated by vanity and wickedness of
                    heart. Their motives are as mean, selfish, narrow, and in every respect
                    unjustifiable, as the tendency of their writings is mischievous. Their malice is
                    often impotent, through the foolish sophistry of their arguments; but, if ever
                    it be successful, it is highly injurious: and, indeed, considering their
                    motives, and the probable consequences of their endeavours, the infidel writer
                    is a greater enemy to society, and consequently guiltier, according to all the
                    principles of social union, than the thief or the traitor. Persecution would,
                    however, only promote his cause, and his proper punishment is contempt.</p><p>“It is certainly no derogation from the character of a man of sense, to conform,
                    even while he is so unfortunate as to doubt their truth, to the opinions of his
                    country. His conformity will probably lead him to a train of actions and of
                    thought, which, in due time, will induce him to believe. But, if that should not
                    happen, yet he will act, as very wise and very great men have acted, in paying a
                    respectful deference to the avowed conviction of others. The most intelligent
                    and powerful men of ancient Rome, not only appeared to believe a very absurd and
                    hurtful system, but assisted in all its ceremonies as priests. Even Socrates,
                    who evidently entertained some notions adequate to the dignity of the one great
                    and supreme Being, yet thought it was a duty which he owed to his country, so
                    far to conform to the wretched establishment, as to order in his dying words a
                    sacrifice to Aesculapius. This external conformity to the national religion
                    ought not to be confounded with hypocrisy. If, indeed, it is carried to
                    extremes, or zealously affected, it certainly is very blameable and contemptible
                    deceit; but while it keeps within the bounds of reason and moderation, it ought
                    to be called a decent deference to the opinions of the majority, arising from
                    humility, and from a desire to maintain the tranquillity of the state, and to
                    continue an innocent and useful system, which has, and will always greatly
                    contribute to lessen the quantity and degree both of moral and of natural
                    evil.</p><p>“The easiest, after all, or at least the most effectual method of appearing in
                    any character, is really to be what we wish to appear. But belief, you will say,
                    is not in our power, and how can we believe what appears to us incredible?
                    Certainly you cannot while it appears incredible. But let me ask you, whether
                    you have taken any pains to believe, or have at once and at a glance persuaded
                    yourself, that the Christian religion is totally false? It is probable that a
                    great number of sceptical writers never gave themselves the trouble to read
                    those Scriptures which they warmly oppose. They hear objections, they read
                    objections, and they find, that from men of reputed wit and ingenuity the
                    objections often originate. They also wish to be reputed men of wit and
                    ingenuity, and therefore eagerly adopt the language and sentiments of the order.
                    Perhaps the vanity and pride of this class of men will render all attempts to
                    convince them abortive; but to modest doubters, and to those whose good sense
                    and good dispositions lead them to wish to adopt the religion of their country,
                    it may not be useless to suggest advice, with a view to facilitate their
                    conviction.</p><p>“The chief thing required is to free themselves from the pride of human reason.
                    Humility (and surely our blindness and imperfections are sufficient to render us
                    humble, if we would be reasonable), humility will open our hearts, and belief
                    will find admission. Sincere endeavours, seconded by prayers, will never fail to
                    help our unbelief. But, alas! a fine, gay, spirited, liberal, and enlarged
                    modern philosopher, would be ashamed to be found on his knees, or with a
                    Testament in his possession. There is <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941351" xml:id="kp-eb0712-1351-0273"/>scarcely any
                    vicious act, or any vicious book, which would put him so much to the blush.</p><p>“A modest well-meaning man might, however, one should think, divest himself of
                    those prejudices which prevent the possibility of belief, by the following
                    soliloquy :— I find myself placed in a world abounding with evil and misery.
                    Under the immediate pressure of it, I feel my heart inclining, like the needle
                    to the north, by its natural tendency, to the Deity for support. Man, of all
                    animals, is the only one who has the sense of religion. Feeling this distinctive
                    propensity of my nature, I look around to discover to what object, and in what
                    manner, that part of my fellow creatures, who live in the same society with
                    myself, pay their adoration. I find a system of religion already established,
                    and which has been established in the most enlightened countries of the earth
                    near two thousand years. I resolve to examine it. It claims that respect from
                    its antiquity and universality. Many difficulties appear on the first
                    inspection. My reason is often startled, and my belief wavers. But I will not
                    yet give up a point of so serious importance, without further and closer
                    attention to it. I reflect, that two thousand years is a vast space in the age
                    of the world. How many myriads of men like myself have lived and died in the
                    faith during that time. And were all of them fools or hypocrites? It could not
                    have been. Can the understanding of a poor individual, just come into the world,
                    and hardly knowing where he is, comprehend on intuition an object of such
                    magnitude, and make the mighty discovery which has escaped millions of the
                    wisest and most learned of mortals? Or, supposing that they all perceived the
                    deception, am I then at last the only honest man who will confess it? I am
                    ashamed to avow such an idea to myself. But yet, if I reject what they received,
                    surely I avow it in the more expressive language of my conduct. Pride, I fear,
                    is the foundation of my scepticism, and humility must form the basis of my
                    belief. I will check my own presumption, and reject the cavils of vain and
                    foolish philosophy. Shall a poor weak creature, who cometh up like a flower, and
                    is cut down, w ho fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in one stay, presume
                    to pronounce decisively in that little period, in which he has scarcely time to
                    look about him before he dies, against a system which has strong internal and
                    external evidence of divine original, which is most useful and comfortable, and
                    which has been admitted among a great portion of mankind during almost twenty
                    centuries? No, it is the first wisdom to be humble. Humility will be follow ed
                    by grace, and grace by faith, and faith by salvation. It plainly appears, that I
                    can lose nothing by belief, but some of those excessive and irregular enjoyments
                    which would destroy my health and life; but I may possibly gain a glory and a
                    happiness which shall continue to all eternity.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
