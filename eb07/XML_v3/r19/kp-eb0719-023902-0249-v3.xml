                <p><label type="entry">RIDICULE</label> in matters of literature, is that species of
                    writing which excites contempt with laughter.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ridiculous,</hi> says Lord Kames, differs from the <hi
                    rend="italic">risible.</hi> A risible object produces an emotion of laughter
                    merely; a ridiculous object is improper as well as risible, and produces a mixed
                    emotion, which is vented by a laugh of derision or scorn.</p>
                <p>Burlesque, though a great engine of ridicule, is not confined to that subject;
                    for it is clearly distinguishable into burlesque that excites laughter merely,
                    and burlesque that provokes derision or ridicule. A grave subject in which there
                    is no impropriety, may be brought down by a certain colouring so as to be
                    risible; which is the case of <hi rend="italic">Virgil Travestie,</hi> and also
                    the case of the <hi rend="italic">Secchia Rapita;</hi> the authors laugh first,
                    in order to make their readers laugh. The <hi rend="italic">Lutrin</hi> is a
                    burlesque poem of the other sort, laying hold of a low and trifling incident, to
                    expose the luxury, indolence, and contentious spirit of a set of monks. Boileau,
                    the author, gives a ridiculous air to the subject, by dressing it in the heroic
                    style, and affecting to consider it as of the utmost dignity and importance. In
                    a compositiori of this kind, no image professedly ludicrous ought to find
                    quarter, because such images destroy the contrast; and accordingly the author
                    shows always the grave face, and never once betrays a smile.</p>
                <p>Though the burlesque that aims at ridicule produces its effects by elevating the
                    style far above the subject, yet it has limits beyond which the elevation ought
                    not to be carried. The poet, consulting the imagination of his readers, ought to
                    confine himself to such images as are lively and readily apprehended; a strained
                    elevation, soaring above an ordinary reach of fancy, makes not a pleasant
                    impression. The reader, fatigued with being always upon the stretch, is soon
                    disgusted; and if he persevere, becomes thoughtless and indifferent. Further, a
                    fiction gives no pleasure unless it be painted in colours so lively as to
                    produce some perception of reality; which never can be done effectually where
                    the images are formed with labour or difficulty. For these reasons, we cannot
                    avoid condemning the <hi rend="italic">Batrachomyomachia,</hi> said to be the
                    composition of Homer: it is beyond the power of imagination to form a clear and
                    lively image of frogs and mice acting with the dignity of the highest of our
                    species; nor can we form a conception of the reality of such an action, in any
                    manner so distinct as to interest our affections even in the slightest
                    degree.</p>
                <p>The Rape of the Lock is of a character clearly distinguishable from those now
                    mentioned; it is not properly a burlesque performance, but what may rather be
                    termed <hi rend="italic">an heroi-comical poem;</hi> it treats a gay and
                    familiar subject with pleasantry, and with a moderate degree of dignity. The
                    author puts not on a mask like Boileau, nor professes to make us laugh like
                    Tassoni. The Rape of the Lock is a genteel species of writing, less strained
                    than those mentioned; and is pleasant or ludicrous without having ridicule for
                    its chief aim; giving way, however, to ridicule, where it naturally arises from
                    a particular character, such as that of Sir Plume.</p>
                <p>Those who have a talent for ridicule, which is seldom united with a taste for
                    delicate and refined beauties, are quick-sighted in improprieties; and these
                    they eagerly grasp, in order to gratify their favourite propensity. Persons
                    galled are provoked to maintain that ridicule is improper for grave subjects.
                    Subjects really grave are by no means fit for ridicule; but then it is urged
                    against them, that, when called in question whether a certain subject be really
                    grave, ridicule is the only means of determining the controversy. Hence a
                    celebrated question, whether ridicule be or be not a test of truth.</p>
                <p>On one side it is observed that the objects of ridicule are falsehood,
                    incongruity, impropriety, or turpitude of certain kinds; but as the object of
                    every excited passion must be examined by reason before we can determine whether
                    it be proper or improper, so ridicule must, apparently at least, establish the
                    truth of the improprieties designed to excite the passion of contempt. Hence it
                    comes in aid of argument and reason, when its impressions on the imagination are
                    consistent with the nature of things; but when it strikes the fancy and
                    affections with fictitious images, it becomes the instrument of deceit. But
                    however ridicule may impress the idea of apparent turpitude or falsehood in the
                    imagination, yet still reason remains the supreme judge; and thus ridicule can
                    never be the final test or touchstone of truth and falsehood.</p>
                <p>On the other side, it is contended that ridicule is not a subject of reasoning,
                    but of sense or taste. Stating the question, then, in more accurate terms,
                    whether the sense of ridicule be the proper test for distinguishing ridiculous
                    objects from what are not so, they proceed thus. No person doubts that our sense
                    of beauty is the true test of what is beautiful; and our sense of grandeur, of
                    what is great or sublime. Is it more doubtful whether our sense of ridicule be
                    the true test of what is ridiculous? It is not only the true test, but indeed
                    the only test; for this subject comes not, more than beauty or grandeur, under
                    the province of reason. If any subject, by the influence of fashion or custom,
                    have acquired a degree of veneration to which it is not naturally entitled, what
                    are the proper means for wiping off the artificial colouring, and displaying the
                    subject in its true light? A man of true taste sees the subject without the
                    disguise; but if we hesitate, let him apply the test of ridicule, which
                    separates it from its artificial connections, and exposes it naked with all its
                    native improprieties.</p>
