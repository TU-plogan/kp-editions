                    of the nether ward of Lanarkshire, in Scotland, is situated about two miles
                    south-east of Glasgow, and nine west of Hamilton. Few towns in Scotland can lay
                    claim to greater antiquity than Rutherglen. It was erected into a royal burgh by
                    King David I. about the year 1126.</p><p>The territory under the jurisdiction of the burgh was extensive, and the
                    inhabitants enjoyed many distinguished privileges, which were, however,
                    gradually wrested from them by political influence in favour of Glasgow, which
                    in latter times rose into consequence by trade and manufactures. The ancient
                    dimensions of the place are now unknown; but in the fields and gardens towards
                    the east, the foundations of houses are occasionally discovered.</p><p>About a hundred and fifty yards to the south of the main street is a kind of
                    lane, known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Dins-dykes.</hi> This place has
                    acquired an opprobrious celebrity, from the circumstance which befell the
                    unfortunate Queen Mary when her forces were routed at the battle of Langside.
                    Her majesty, who, during the battle, stood on a rising ground about a mile from
                    Rutherglen, no sooner saw her army defeated, than she took her precipitate
                    flight to the south. Dins-dykes unluckily lay in her way. Two rustics, who were
                    at that instant cutting grass hard" by, seeing her majesty flying in haste,
                    rudely attempted to intercept her, and threatened to cut her in pieces with
                    their scythes if she presumed to proceed a step further. Neither beauty nor
                    royalty would have secured her escape, had not some of her followers come to her
                    relief.</p><p>Adjoining to a lane called the <hi rend="italic">Bach-row</hi> stood the castle
                    of Rutherglen, originally built at a period coeval, it is reported, with the
                    foundation of the town. This ancient fortress underwent several sieges during
                    the unhappy wars in the days of King Robert Bruce, and it remained a place of
                    strength until the battle of Langside; soon after which it was destroyed by
                    order of the regent, to revenge himself on the Hamilton family, in whose custody
                    it then was. The foundations of the buildings are now erased, and the site
                    converted into dwelling-houses and gardens.</p><p>Rutherglen, in conjunction with Renfrew, Dumbarton, Kilmarnock, and Port-Glasgow,
                    sends a member to the British parliament. The fairs of this town are generally
                    well attended, and have long been famous for a great show of horses, of the
                    Lanarkshire breed, which are esteemed the best draught-horses in Britain. The
                    inhabitants of this borough still retain some customs of a very remote
                    antiquity. One of these is the making of <hi rend="italic">Rutherglen sour
                    cakes.</hi> The operation is attended with some peculiar rites, which lead us to
                    conclude that the practice is of Pagan origin. In</p><p>1821 the population of Rutherglen was about 1800, and including the parish it was
                    4640; in 1831 that of the town and parish was 5503.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
