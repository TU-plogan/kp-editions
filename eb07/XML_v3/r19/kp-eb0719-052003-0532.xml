                    classical critic of great eminence, was born at Stolpen, in Prussian Pomerania,
                    in the year 1723. Of the early part of his studies little is known, but it
                    appears that he was some time at Schlaff, from which he removed to Königsberg,
                    where he met with the celebrated Kant, whose system has so much engaged the
                    attention of Europe. He afterwards repaired to Göttingen to attend the lectures
                    of Gesner, and to enlarge his knowledge of the Greek language. Some time after
                    this period he formed an acquaintance with Ritter and Berger, whilst he resided
                    at Wittemberg, where he continued about two years. His earliest production was a
                    disputation <hi rend="italic">De Galla Placidia Augusta,</hi> daughter of
                    Theodosius, and the sister of Arcadius and Honorius. Under Berger he studied
                    Roman antiquities and eloquence; under Ritter, jurisprudence and history. He
                    relinquished the study of divinity, for which he was at first designed, and
                    prevailed with his parents to allow him to transfer his residence to Leyden,
                    where he arrived with recommendations to many of the learned. He pursued his
                    studies with avidity and zeal, and accompanied Alberti in his visit to the Spa
                    in the year 1750. Hemsterhuis wished to attach him to Holland, urging him to
                    persevere in the study of the law, as affording an additional chance of
                    employment. This advice he thought proper to follow, and published a translation
                    of some works of Theodorus, Stephanus, and other Greek civilians.</p><p>In the year 1755 he went to Paris, where Capperonnier, who was at that time
                    keeper of the king’s library, received him kindly. He now formed an acquaintance
                    with Dr Musgrave and Mr Tyrwhitt, who were there for the purpose of examining
                    the manuscripts of Euripides. He had also formed the resolution of going to
                    Spain; but Hemsterhuis recalled him, as he needed his assistance as lecturer in
                    the Greek tongue. In 1755, Ruhnkenius took possession of his office, and read an
                    excellent discourse <hi rend="italic">De Gracia Artium et Doctrinarum
                    Inventrice.</hi></p><p>About this time he was useful to Ernesti, in his edition of Callimachus; and, in
                    1761, he succeeded Oudendorp as professor of history and of eloquence,
                    delivering an inaugural oration <hi rend="italic">De Doctore Umbratico</hi>
                    About a year after this event, Ruhnkenius was offered the chair of Gesner in the
                    university of Göttingen. This offer he however declined; but, on his
                    recommendation, the office was very worthily bestowed upon Heyne.</p><p>In 1764 he married an Italian lady, who, about six years afterwards lost both her
                    speech and sight by a stroke of apoplexy. She had two daughters, one of whom was
                    afterwards blind. The desire of Ruhnkenius to do Ernesti a favour, made him turn
                    his attention to the Memorabilia of Xenophon; and he was led to examine with
                    particular attention the treatise of Longinus on the Sublime. Having risen
                    superior to his domestic misfortunes about the year 1772, he pursued his new
                    edition of Velleius Paterculus, and he prepared a second edition of his <hi rend="italic">Epistola Critica,</hi> and a collection of <hi rend="italic">Scholia</hi> on Plato. In the year 1766, he published a valuable tract <hi rend="italic">De Vita et Scriptis Longini,</hi> in the form of an academical
                    dissertation, to which he prefixed the name of one of his pupils. His Velleius
                    Paterculus appeared in 1779, and in 1780 Homer’s reputed hymn to Ceres. In 1786,
                    he published the first part of Apuleius, which had been prepared by Oudendorp,
                    and a new edition of his own Timaeus in 1789; and at the same time he collected
                    and published the works of Muretus, in five volumes 8vo.</p><p>Both the body and mind of Ruhnkenius were much weakened in consequence of the
                    loss of friends, an attack of the gout, and the misfortunes of the Batavian
                    republic; but he was in some measure relieved by the satisfaction he felt at the
                    dedication of Homer by Wolf, although he was not of that writer’s opinion that
                    the works of Homer were written by different authors. He sunk into a kind of
                    stupor on the 14th of May 1798, which in two days put a period to his
                    existence.</p><p>His knowledge and learning were unquestionably immense; and he was allowed to be
                    lively, cheerful, and gay, even to an extreme. Many posthumous honours were
                    conferred upon him, and a pension settled on his unfortunate widow. When
                    Whyttenbach took possession of Ruhnkenius’s chair, he delivered a discourse on
                    the early age of Ruhnkenius, which he proposed as an example to the Batavian
                    youth who made the belles lettres their study.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
