                    and civil engineer, was born on the 7th of June 1761, at Phantassie, in the
                    parish of Prestonkirk, in the county of East Lothian. His father, a highly
                    respectable farmer, died in 1766, leaving a widow and nine children, of whom
                    John was the youngest. The first rudiments of his education w ere acquired at
                    the village school; and as it frequently happens that some trifling circumstance
                    in early life gives a bent to the pursuits and fixes the destinies of the future
                    man, so it fared with young Rennie. The school was situated on the opposite side
                    of a brook, over which it was necessary to pass by means of a rustic bridge of
                    stepping stones; but when the freshes were out, the only alternative of crossing
                    the stream was by means of a boat, which was kept at the workshop of Mr Andrew
                    Meikle, an ingenious mechanic, well known in Scotland as the inventor of the
                    thrashing-machine, and many improvements in agricultural implements. In passing
                    through this workshop, which stood on his family property, young Rennie’s
                    attention was forcibly draw n to the various operations that were in progress,
                    and a great part of his leisure and holiday time was passed therein. The sons of
                    Mr Meikle, and the workmen, seeing the delight which he appeared to take in
                    examining their labours, were in the habit of indulging him with their tools,
                    and showing him their various uses. His evenings were chiefly employed in
                    imitating those models which had particularly attracted his attention in the
                    workshop; and it is known in the family, that, at little more than ten years of
                    age, he had constructed the model of a windmill, a pile-engine, and a
                    steam-engine. That of the pile-engine is still in existence, and is said to be
                    remarkably well made.</p><p>Having continued at Preston school till twelve years of age, he had about that
                    time a quarrel with his schoolmaster, whom he deemed incompetent to give him
                    further instruction, and therefore entreated that he might be permitted to leave
                    the school. But his active mind soon became restless; for the first time he felt
                    the hours hang heavily on his hands; and having expressed a wish to be placed
                    under his friend Mr Meikle, he employed himself with this ingenious mechanic for
                    about two years; but his mind expanding with his growth, he began to feel that
                    the progress of his intellectual faculties was likely to be retarded by a
                    constant application to manual labour. He therefore at length determined to
                    place himself under the tuition <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=131" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0131-0121"/>of Mr Gibson, an able teacher of mathematics at Dunbar; where he soon
                    distinguished himself in so particular a manner, that Mr David Loch, general
                    inspector of the fisheries in Scotland, in describing a visit which he paid to
                    the school at Dunbar in 1778, notices the great proficiency displayed by young
                    Rennie; prophesying that at no distant period he would prove an honour to his
                    country. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Loch'a Essays

                    211. Q </p></note> From this school, in less than two years, he returned to Mr
                    Meikle, with a mind well stored with every branch of mathematical and physical
                    science which Mr Gibson could teach him. About this time, Mr Gibson being
                    appointed master to the public academy of Perth, he earnestly recommended young
                    Rennie to succeed him at Dunbar. But his views were of a more aspiring cast As a
                    matter of favour, he undertook the management of the school for about six weeks,
                    when he returned to his family, occasionally visiting and assisting his friend
                    Mr Meiklebut mostly improving himself in drawing and making models of machinery.
                    His first essay in practical mechanics was the repairing of a corn-mill in his
                    native village; and he erected two or three others before he was eighteen years
                    of age.</p><p>Resolved, however, that these mechanical occupations should not interfere with
                    his studies, he laid his plans so that he should be able to proceed occasionally
                    to Edinburgh with a view of improving himself in physical science. He there
                    attended the lectures of Professors Robison and Black, and formed that
                    acquaintance with the former of these gentlemen, which was gradually raised into
                    friendship, and which, perhaps, may be said to have laid the foundation of his
                    future fortune; for by him he was introduced to Messrs Bolton and Watt of Soho,
                    near Birmingham. With these gentlemen he remained but a few months, for the
                    purpose of receiving explanations respecting the plan of the Albion Mills, then
                    erecting, the machinery of which he superintended. This exactly suited his
                    views; for, conscious of his own powers, he deemed the capital the proper
                    theatre to try their strength, and in this he was not mistaken.</p><p>In proceeding from Edinburgh to Soho, he had taken the route by Carlisle,
                    Lancaster, Liverpool, and Manchester, for the purpose of visiting the different
                    mills and public works in those great commercial and manufacturing towns; and
                    the remarks which he made on the bridge then building over the Lune at
                    Lancaster, on the docks at Liverpool, and more particularly on the Bridgewater
                    Canal, are distinguished by great sagacity, and were of essential use to him
                    afterwards. On leaving Soho, he again made a tour through the manufacturing
                    districts of Leeds, Sheffield, Rotherham, and Newcastle.</p><p>For some time after he was settled in London, the Albion Mills, of which Bolton
                    and Watt and Mr Wyatt were the projectors and leading proprietors, and who
                    engaged him to superintend the execution of the mill-work, occupied a great
                    share of his attention. Mr Watt, in his Notes to Professor Robison’s Account of
                    the Steam-Engine, says, that, “in the construction of the mill-work and
                    machinery, they derived most valuable assistance from that able mechanician and
                    engineer Mr John Rennie, then just entering into business, who assisted in
                    placing them, and under whose direction they were executed.” He also says, that
                    the machinery, which used to be made of wood, was here made of cast iron, in
                    improved forms; and thinks that this was the commencement of that system of
                    mill-work which has proved so beneficial to this country. In fact, Rennie’s
                    mills are the most perfect species of mechanism in that way that exist,
                    distinguished by a precision of movement and a harmony and proportion of parts
                    that now serve as models throughout the empire. His water-mills are so
                    accurately calculated, that every particle of water is effectively employed, and
                    none of it lost, as in the common mode of constructing water-wheels. There is
                    reason to believe that the difficulties which occurred at the Albion Mills with
                    regard to the ebb and flow of the tides, and which required all the ingenuity of
                    that extraordinary genius, Mr Watt, first led Mr Rennie to the study of that
                    branch of civil engineering connected with hydraulics and hydrodynamics, and in
                    which he soon became so celebrated as to have no rival after the death of
                    Smeaton, in whose steps, he always used to say, he was proud to follow.</p><p>Our limited space will not permit us to enter upon even an enumeration of all his
                    great works, much less to give any detailed account of them; we must therefore
                    content ourselves by mentioning some of the most important designs and
                    undertakings in his threefold capacity of mechanist, architect, and civil
                    engineer; three branches of art so intimately blended as scarcely to admit of a
                    separation.</p><p>First, as a Mechanist Immediately after the completion of the Albion Mills, in
                    1786 or 1787, Mr Rennie’s reputation was so firmly established in everything
                    connected with mill-work, that he found himself in a very extensive line of
                    business. To him the planters of Jamaica and of the other West India islands
                    applied for their sugar-mills, which he constructed in a manner so superior to
                    the old ones, that he soon obtained almost a monopoly of these expensive works.
                    The powder-mill at Tunbridge, the great flour-mill at Wandsworth, several
                    saw-mills, the machinery for various breweries and distilleries, were mostly of
                    his manufacture; and wherever his machinery was required to be impelled by
                    steam, the incomparable engines of his friends Messrs Bolton and Watt supplied
                    the moving power; but, contrary to what has been stated in some of the public
                    journals, he never had the least concern in directing, contriving, or advising
                    any one part or movement of the steam-engine. He also constructed those
                    beautiful specimens of machinery, the rolling and triturating mills, at the Mint
                    on Tower Hill, to which Bolton and Watt’s engines give motion; and, at the time
                    of his death, he was engaged in the construction of a rolling-mill, and similar
                    machinery, for the intended mint at Calcutta.</p><p>As a bold and ingenious piece of mechanism, which may be considered as distinct
                    from positive architecture, there is nothing in Europe that can bear a
                    comparison with the Southwark Bridge. The three immense arches, the centre one
                    of 240, and each side arch of 210 feet span, consist entirely of masses of cast
                    iron, of various forms and dimensions, put together on the same principle as a
                    similar fabric of hewn stone; a method of employing iron which may be considered
                    to form a new epoch in the history of bridge-building. Various sinister
                    predictions were entertained against this light and beautiful bridge, which was
                    to be rent in pieces by the expansive power of the first summer’s heat, or, if
                    it escaped that, by the contraction of the first winter’s cold; but it has stood
                    the test of many winters and summers, and appears not to feel either. Mr Rennie
                    was applied to by the East India Company for the design of a cast-iron bridge to
                    be thrown over the river Goomty at Lucknow, at the desire of the nabob vizier of
                    Oude. It consisted of three arches of cast iron, the centre arch ninety, and
                    each of the other arches eighty feet span. The arches were cast, and a
                    superintending engineer sent out with them; but on their arrival, the nabob, in
                    one of those moments of caprice to which eastern despots, even in their
                    impotency, are so liable, changed his mind, and would not allow it to be put
                    up.</p><p>Secondly, as an Architect. Since there are few parts of civil engineering that do
                    not occasionally require the aid of architecture, Rennie, at a very early stage
                    of his pro<pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=132" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0132-0122"/>gress, was called upon for a display of his skill
                    in this line. Amongst his first undertakings in either line was that of the
                    Lancaster Canal, which presented many difficulties, and, amongst others, that of
                    carrying it by an aqueduct over the Lune, so as not to interrupt the navigation
                    of the river. Being one of the largest fabrics of its kind in Europe, and of a
                    pleasing design, it is an object that arrests the attention of strangers, and is
                    very generally admired. The bridges of Leeds, Musselburgh, Kelso,
                    Newton-Stewart, Boston, New Galloway, and a multitude of others, attest the
                    architectural skill, the solidity, and, we may add, the good taste of Rennie;
                    whilst a thousand smaller ones, with the various locks, wharf-walls, quays,
                    embankments appertaining to canals, rivers, and harbours, in every part of the
                    united kingdom, are so many proofs of his diversified talent, and his skill in
                    adapting the means to the end. The breakwater in Plymouth Sound can scarcely be
                    called an architectural work, but it is constructed on true hydrodynamical
                    principles, and so gigantic in its dimensions, and cyclopean in its structure,
                    as to defy equally the force of the waves and the ravages of time. To Mr Whidby,
                    who zealously superintended the execution of this immortal work, the highest
                    praise is also due; nor was the plan finally determined on without his advice
                    and assistance.</p><p>But the architectural work which, above all others, will immortalize the name of
                    Rennie, is the Waterloo Bridge, a structure which, even foreigners admit, has no
                    parallel in Europe (and if not in Europe, certainly not in the whole world) for
                    its magnitude, its beauty, and its solidity. That a fabric so immense,
                    presenting a straight horizontal line, stretching over nine large arches, should
                    not have altered more than a few inches, not five in any one part, from that
                    straight line, is an instance of firmness and solidity utterly unknown, and
                    almost incredible; <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    bridge of Neuilly, which the vanity of the French led them to rank as superior
                    to that of Waterloo, actually sunk 23 inches. </p></note> but all Rennie’s works
                    have been constructed for posterity. He made nothing slight; nor would he engage
                    in any undertaking where, from an ill-judging economy, a sufficiency of funds
                    was not forthcoming to meet his views.</p><p>Another work, executed from a design of his, is that of the stone bridge over the
                    Thames, by which the old London Bridge, so long the disgrace of the metropolis,
                    was replaced. His design, which was selected by a committee of the House of
                    Commons, out of at least thirty that were offered, consisted of a granite bridge
                    of five arches, the centre one of 150 feet span, being the largest stone arch in
                    the world which has been constructed in modern times. This great work, an
                    account of which will be found under the head London, cannot but form a
                    remarkable feature in the future history of the capital. For of the five bridges
                    which connect the two banks of the Thames, three have been built from the
                    designs of one man; a fact which must throw a lustre on the name of Rennie, and
                    be regarded with a feeling of pride by the most distant connection of his
                    family.</p><p>Thirdly, as a Civil Engineer. The first great attempt in this line of his
                    profession was the survey and execution of the Crinan Canal, a work remarkable
                    for the multitude of practical difficulties that occurred throughout the whole
                    of this bold undertaking; it being necessary in many places to cut down through
                    solid rock, to the depth of sixty feet; and it is rather remarkable, that the
                    second undertaking, the Lancaster Canal, was also replete with difficulties, and
                    called for the exercise of his skill as an architect, as we have already seen in
                    noticing the aqueduct over the Lune. But these two works established his
                    reputation as a civil engineer, and his opinion and assistance were required
                    from all quarters. His faculties were now called into full play, and they
                    expanded with the demands made upon them. The rage for canals had pervaded every
                    part of the kingdom, and scarcely any of these useful means of conveyance and
                    communication was thought of without a previous consultation with Rennie; so
                    that in a few years the surveys he was called upon to make were so numerous,
                    that he knew the surface of England as it were by heart, and could tell at once,
                    when a canal was projected, whereabouts the line of it ought to be carried. The
                    following are some of the most important of those the execution of which he
                    personally attended: Aberdeen, Brechin, Grand Western, Kennet and Avon,
                    Portsmouth, Birmingham, Worcester, besides many others.</p><p>But the resources of his mind were displayed in all their vigour in the plans and
                    construction of those magnificent docks, which are at once an ornament to the
                    capital, and of the utmost utility to commerce and navigation. Nor are these
                    splendid and useful works confined to the metropolis. The docks at Hull,
                    Greenock, Leith, Liverpool, and Dublin, attest his skill; and the harbours of
                    Queensferry, Berwick, Howth, Holyhead, Dunleary (now called Kingstown Harbour),
                    Newhaven, and several others, owe their security and convenience to his
                    labours.</p><p>But even these works, splendid as they are, must yield to what he has planned and
                    executed in her majesty’s dock-yards at Portsmouth, Plymouth, Chatham, and
                    Sheemess. The latter was a mere quicksand of forty feet in depth, mixed with mud
                    and the wrecks of old ships; the whole of which was excavated, and a magnificent
                    basin constructed, with a beautiful surrounding wall of granite, with which
                    three of the finest dry docks in the universe communicate; and that important
                    dock-yard, which may be said to command the mouths of the Thames and the Medway,
                    from being an unhealthy and detestable place, and wholly inefficient for its
                    purpose, is now, by being raised many feet, and laid out with skill and
                    judgment, one of the most convenient in the kingdom, He also planned the new
                    naval arsenal at Pembroke, which is considered as a perfect model for a
                    building-yard. But his plan for the projected naval arsenal at Northfleet on the
                    Thames was far superior to all in design; and upon a scale so grand as to be
                    capable of containing afloat two thirds of the whole navy, with dry docks and
                    slips for repairing and building ships of all classes to the same extent, and
                    with all manner of storehouses, workshops, and manufactories of all such
                    articles as were required for consumption in the navy. But the estimated sum of
                    eight millions, which would probably have amounted to ten, induced the
                    government to pause, and it was finally deemed prudent to abandon the design
                    altogether.</p><p>Mr Smeaton, we believe, was the first who used the diving-bell effectually for
                    building with stone under water; but the machine he employed for that purpose
                    was very defective, and could be used only in certain situations. Rennie,
                    however, by improvements in the instrument itself, and in the machinery by which
                    its movements could be regulated, was enabled to carry on the finest masonry,
                    and the foundations of sea-walls, piers, and quays, as well under water as above
                    it The repairing of the pier-head of Ramsgate Harbour was a remarkable instance
                    of this kind. The violence of the waves, acting upon the bad quality of the
                    stone, had so completely undermined it that the stability of the whole pier
                    began to be endangered. It was from ten to thirteen feet below the level of low
                    water, spring-tides; yet by means of the improved diving-bell and its apparatus,
                    the pier-head was not only effectually secured, but rendered more solid and
                    durable than it originally had been. In the harbour of Howth the diving-bell was
                    of the utmost use; and it is remarkable enough, that the masons who have been
                    for a little while accustomed to work under water prefer it, at least the Irish
                    masons do, to working in the air,</p><pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=133" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0133-0123"/><p>it being cooler in summer, and warmer m winter; though an increase of pay for
                    submarine work is probably the real cause of preference.</p><p>The last effort of Rennie’s genius to which we shall advert, was the drainage of
                    that vast tract of marsh land bordering upon the rivers Trent, Witham, New
                    Welland, and Ouse, which for centuries past had baffled the skill of some of the
                    ablest men in that department of civil engineering. Upon the same principles, he
                    laid down a grand scheme for draining the whole of that immense district known
                    by the name of the Bedford Level, which has in part been carried into execution
                    by the completion of the Eaubrink Cut, near Lynn. The estimate he made for
                    draining the whole amounted to L.l,200,000.</p><p>Such are some of the grand undertakings which Rennie, during the last thirty
                    years of his life, was either employed to project or to carry into execution,
                    and which, on a rough estimate, collected from his valuable Reports, did not
                    fall far short of forty millions sterling; about twenty millions of which were
                    expended under his own immediate superintendence. Indeed, few great works were
                    carried on, either by the public or individuals, on which he was not either
                    employed or consulted. His industry was very extraordinary. Fond of the society
                    of his select friends, and of rational conversation, he never suffered amusement
                    of any kind to interfere with his business, which seldom engaged him less than
                    twelve hours, and frequently fifteen, in the day. His conversation was always
                    amusing and instructive. He possessed a rich fund of anecdote, and, like his old
                    friend James Watt, told a Scotch story admirably. As a travelling companion, he
                    was highly entertaining; he knew everybody on the road, and everybody knew John
                    Rennie. Of an ardent and anxious mind, and naturally impetuous, he was gifted
                    with the most perfect self-control; and the irritation of the moment was seen
                    but as a light summer’s cloud, passing across his finely-marked features, which
                    were on so large a scale, though blended with much mildness as well as dignity,
                    as to obtain for his noble bust by Chantrey, when exhibited in Somerset House,
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Jupiter Tonans.</hi></p><p>Were we to seek for a parallel to Rennie, the name of Smeaton would at once
                    suggest itself. Their boyhood was employed precisely in the same manner, in
                    making models of pumps and windmills, whilst their school-fellows were at play;
                    their pursuits in manhood were similar, and their paramount success pretty
                    nearly the same. But the spirit of speculation and improvement was but just
                    springing up when Smeaton finished his career, and when Rennie began his. He
                    was, in fact, the successor of Smeaton. There was a strong characteristic
                    likeness between Rennie and the late Mr Ramsden. The pursuits of the former
                    embraced a wider sphere of action, but they both arrived at their proposed
                    objects by the most simple and obvious, and, at the same time, most effectual
                    means. They were both equally clear in their mode of communicating information
                    to others; and it is sufficiently remarkable that, in their illustrations, both
                    of them had recourse rarely to any other instrument than a two-feet rule, which
                    each always carried in his pocket Many a time has the writer of this article
                    derived instruction from the two-feet rules of John Rennie and Jesse Ramsden.
                    They were both equally communicative when they saw that information was desired;
                    and nothing like professional jealousy, or selfish feelings, actuated either of
                    these ingenious men, who, on the contrary, were always kind and condescending to
                    the more humble artists of their respective professions.</p><p>Mr Rennie possessed considerable skill in bibliography; and being a zealous and
                    liberal collector, he succeeded in forming a very valuable library, consisting
                    of the best and rarest books in all the branches of science and art, of voyages
                    and travels, and many curious books in the black letter; whilst in his own
                    department it contained every work of the least merit, in whatever language it
                    might be written. He· had, besides, a good collection of mathematical and
                    astronomical instruments, and frequently spoke of erecting an observatory, but
                    did not live to carry his intention into execution. He had for some years
                    laboured under a disease of the liver, which had apparently yielded to the usual
                    treatment; but a relapse took place, and on the 16th of October 1821, after a
                    few days’ illness, he expired without a struggle, in the sixtieth year of his
                    age.</p><p>Mr Rennie, in 1789, married Miss Mackintosh, who died in 1806, leaving a family
                    of seven young children, six of whom are now living. The two eldest, George and
                    John, are successfully following the profession, and promise to tread in the
                    footsteps, of their able and excellent father.</p><p>Sixteen mourning coaches, filled with his friends, mostly men of eminence in the
                    arts, sciences, or literature, followed his hearse to St Paul’s, where his
                    remains were interred near those of Sir Christopher Wren. A plain granite slab
                    covers his grave, on which is the following appropriate inscription:</p><p>Here lie the mortal remains of JOHN RENNIE,</p><p>Civil Engineer,</p><p>F. K. S. L. &amp; E. F. A. S. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p><p>Born at Phantassie, in East Lothian, 7th June 1761; deceased in London 4th Oct
                    1821.</p><p>THIS STONE</p><p>testifies his private virtues, and records the affection and the respect of his
                    family and his friends; but the many splendid and useful works by which, under
                    his superintending genius,</p><p>England, Scotland, and Ireland, have been adorned and improved, are the true
                    monuments of his public merit <hi rend="smallcaps">(m.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
