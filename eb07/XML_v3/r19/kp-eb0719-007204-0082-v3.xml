                    Moves commas following <gi>pb</gi> in the text to preceding it and removes extra

                <p><label type="entry">RAPIN</label> Rene, a Jesuit and eminent French writer, was
                    born at Tours in 1621. He taught polite literature in the society of the Jesuits
                    with great applause, and was justly esteemed one of the best Latin poets and
                    greatest wits of his time. He died at Paris in the year 1687. His principal
                    works were, 1. A great number of Latin poems, which have rendered him famous
                    throughout all Europe, amongst which are his <hi rend="italic">Hortorum Iibri
                    quatuor;</hi> 2. Reflections on Eloquence, Poetry, History, and Philosophy; 3.
                    Comparisons between Virgil and Homer, Demosthenes and Cicero, Plato and
                    Aristotle, Thucydides and Titus Livius; 4. The History of Jansenism; and, 5.
                    Several works on religious subjects. The best edition of his Latin poems is that
                    of Paris in 1723, in three vols. 12mo.</p>

                    celebrated historian, was the son of James de Rapin, lord of Thoyras, and was
                    born at Castres in 1661. He was at first educated under a tutor in his father’s
                    house, and afterwards sent to Puylaurens, and thence to Samur. In 1679 he
                    returned to his father, with a design to apply himself to the study of the law ,
                    and was admitted an advocate; but some time afterwards, reflecting that his
                    being a Protestant would prevent∙his advancement at the bar, he resolved to quit
                    the profession of the law, and to apply himself to that of the sword. His
                    father, however,</p>
                <p>, would not consent to the change. The revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685,
                    and the death of his father, which happened two months afterwards, made him
                    resolve to come to England; but as he had no hopes of any settlement there, his
                    stay was but short. He therefore went to Holland, and enlisted himself in the
                    company of French volunteers at Utrecht, commanded by M. Rapin, his
                    cousin-german. He attended the Prince of Orange into England in 1688; and the
                    following year Lord Kingston made him an ensign in his regiment, with which he
                    proceeded to Ireland, where he gained the esteem of his officers at the siege of
                    Carrickfergus, and soon received a lieutenant’s commission. He was present at
                    the battle of the Boyne, and was shot through the shoulder at the siege of
                    Limerick. He was soon afterwards made captain of the company in which he had
                    been ensign; but, in 1693, he resigned his company to one of his brothers, in
                    order to become tutor to the Earl of Portland’s son. In 1699, he married
                    Marianne Testard; but this marriage neither abated his care of his pupil, nor
                    prevented his accompanying him in his travels. Having finished this employment,
                    he returned to his family, which he had settled at the Hague; and there he
                    continued some years. But as he found his family increase, he resolved to retire
                    to some cheap country; and accordingly removed, in 1707, to Wesel, where he
                    wrote his History of England, and some other works. Though he was of a strong
                    constitution, yet seventeen years <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> application, for
                    so long was he engaged in composing his great work, entirely ruined his health.
                    He died in 1725.</p>
                <p>Rapin wrote, in French, 1. A Dissertation on Ihe Whigs and Tories; 2. His History
                    of England, printed at the Hague in 1726 and 1727, in nine vols. 4to, and
                    reprinted at Trevoux in 1728, in ten vols. 4to. This' last edition is more
                    complete than that of the Hague. It has been translated into English, and
                    improved with notes, by Mr Tindal, in two vols. folio. This performance,
                    although the work of a foreigner, is deservedly esteemed as the fullest and most
                    impartial collection of English political transactions extant.</p>
