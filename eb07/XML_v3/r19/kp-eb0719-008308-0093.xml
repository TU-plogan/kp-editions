                    Mississippi, in North America. Its source is situated at the base of a range of
                    the Rocky Mountains, called the Caous Mountains, near Santa Fe, in Mexico A
                    great number of streams descend this chain, and, flowing separately for some
                    three or four hundred miles, at length unite and form the Red River. The country
                    through which its upper branches flow is but little known. After the river
                    enters Louisiana, its south bank forms for a great distance the boundary between
                    the United States and Texas. Much of its course lies through noble prairies of a
                    rich red soil covered with grass intermingled with vines, which bear, it is
                    said, excellent grapes. About a hundred miles above Natchitoches the alluvion
                    enlarges to a breadth of twenty or thirty miles, forming a sort of swampy bed
                    through which the river flows in a number of channels. Great quantities of
                    timber, brought down from the upper parts of the river, have for ages been
                    accumulating in these channels, and to such an extent, that in soipe parts the
                    stream may be crossed on horseback. Hence the name of Raft, which this swampy
                    expansion bears throughout its whole extent. The river finds its way sometimes
                    below these accumulations of timber, sometimes between them. Nearly seventy
                    miles of the river are thus obstructed; and it is of incalculable injury to its
                    navigation, for here small boats only can pass. For nearly a thousand miles
                    above the Raft the soil is extremely rich, and the climate very salubrious; but,
                    until this obstacle be removed, it will form an almost insurmount I able barrier
                    to its proper settlement. Below the Raft the river separates into a number of
                    channels, and expands at intervals into a multitude of sheets of water. Its
                    breadth enlarges as it approaches the Mississippi; but immediately below the
                    Raft the channel becomes narrower than above it. From both sides it receives a
                    vast number of tributaries. The whole length of this noble stream is estimated
                    at 2500 miles, following its meanderings; and it enters the Mississippi in about
                    31° 15' north latitude. It was supposed at one time to discharge itself into the
                    Gulf of Mexicowithout joining the Mississippi. Much of the soil through which
                    the Red River passes in its upper course is of a reddish colour, which is
                    imparted to the waters, and hence the name of the stream. So impregnated is it
                    with this ochreous earth, that at low water at Natchitoches it cannot be used
                    for culinary purposes. The valley of Red River is three or four miles in breadth
                    as far as the Kiamesia, which, following its windings, is about a thousand miles
                    from its mouth. But it widens to from six to eighteen miles as it approaches the
                    Mississippi, and is of an average breadth of twelve miles for a great distance
                    above the confluence of the rivers. This alluvial tract is considered as equal
                    to any in all the vast valley of the Mississippi. The staple production is
                    cotton, of a quality superior to any raised in the United States except Sea
                    Island. Its indigo and tobacco are the best raised in Louisiana; and sugar has
                    been introduced, and found to thrive well. (r. r. r.)</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Red River is also the name of a number of other American
                    streams. The most important is that which flows into Lake Winnipeg, in the
                    northern part of North America. It is formed of two branches, the principal of
                    which rises in Red Lake, and flows west by north for a hundred and fifty miles,
                    when it is joined by the other branch. It then changes its direction to east of
                    north, and flows for a hundred and eighty miles below its junction, when it
                    falls into Lake Winnipeg.</hi> (R. <hi rend="smallcaps">r. r.)</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
