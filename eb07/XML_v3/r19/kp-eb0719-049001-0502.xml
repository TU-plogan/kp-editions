                    of the different parts of a solid body about an axis, in contradistinction to
                    t!fe progressive motion of the body in a straight line, or in an orbit about a
                    distant centre, of which the rotation is absolutely independent, although both
                    motions may take place simultaneously. Thus the planets have a progressive
                    motion, or a motion of translation, in the orbits which they describe about the
                    sun, while at the same time each revolves about an axis which passes through its
                    centre of gravity.</p><p>In consequence of this double motion of the planetary bodies, the two great
                    problems in physical astronomy are, first, to determine the orbit described in
                    space by each body under the influence of the sun’s attraction, but disturbed by
                    the attraction of every other body in the system; and, secondly, to determine
                    the circumstances of the rotation of each body under the influence of the same
                    disturbing forces. This last problem is not of less importance or difficulty
                    than the first. In the case of the earth it includes the determination of the
                    precession of the equinoxes and the nutation of the axis under the disturbing
                    action of the sun and moon; and its analysis has led to the discovery of two
                    important facts connected with the physical constitution of the universe,
                    namely, the invariability of the length of the day, and the permanence of the
                    poles of rotation on the earth’s surface.</p><p>But the problem of determining the rotation of a solid body is not merely
                    interesting in consequence of its forming a principal part of physical
                    astronomy; it is also one of the highest importance in practical mechanics; for
                    the principles to which we are led in considering the general theory of rotatory
                    motion, enable us to determine the effect or performance of machines, and the
                    proper relations and most advantageous disposition of their several parts, in
                    order to accomplish the object in view with the smallest waste of force, and the
                    least strain or injury to the machine itself.</p><p>In treating the subject, we shall first endeavour to demonstrate the fundamental
                    propositions of rotatory motion in as elementary a manner as possible; secondly,
                    we shall show the methods of computing the inertia of bodies of different forms,
                    and the properties of principal axes; thirdly, we shall consider the motion of a
                    body which revolves about a fixed axis, and the properties of the centres of
                    gyration, percussion, and oscillation; and, lastly, we shall give the general
                    equations which determine the rotation of a body acted upon by any number of
                    forces, and which is at liberty to move in any direction.</p><p>1. When a solid body, or system of material particles, so connected that their
                    mutual distances remain invariable, turns round an axis, every particle
                    describes a circle having its centre in the axis, and its plane perpendicular to
                    the axis; and at every instant of the motion the particle is in the direction of
                    a tangent to the circle, or in a straight line perpendicular to its radius
                    vector. In order, therefore, to ascertain the direction of the motion of any
                    particle of the system, we have only to draw a straight line from the particle
                    perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This line will lie in the plane of the
                    circle, and be its radius vector; and the perpendicular to the radius vector at
                    its extremity gives the direction of the motion of the particle.</p><p>2. Since the system is supposed to be invariable in form, every particle
                    describes the circumference of a circle in precisely the same instant of time;
                    and as this is also true of any given portion of the circumference, it follows
                    that the absolute velocities of the different particles are proportional to
                    their distances from the axis of rotation. Hence, if <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                    denote the velocity of the particle whose radius vector or distance from the
                    axis = 1, then <hi rend="italic">rw</hi> is the velocity of the particle whose
                    distance from the axis = r. The velocity denoted by to is called the <hi rend="italic"> angular velocity of</hi> the body; and the rotations of different
                    bodies are compared in respect of velocity by comparing their angular
                    velocities.</p><p>3. The nature of the forces which connect the different particles or atoms of a
                    solid body, and render it impossible for any single particle to change its
                    position without a corresponding change in the positions of all the other
                    particles, is very obscurely known; but whatever their nature may be, there is
                    one general fact or law, established by unexcepted experience, which affords a
                    sufficient foundation for a dynamical theory, namely, that the forces by which
                    the particles of a body act reciprocally on each other are equal. An immediate
                    consequence of this law is, that when a solid body is in equilibrium between two
                    external forces A and B, these forces are equal and opposite; for the force A
                    being in immediate equilibrium with the opposite forces exerted by that particle
                    of the solid body to which it is applied, must therefore be equal and opposite
                    to the force resulting from the combination of all the forces which connect that
                    particle with the series of particles immediately adjoining. In like manner, the
                    compound force by which this first series of particles acts on that to which the
                    external force A is applied, is equal and opposite to the compound force which
                    connects this first series with the next series, and so on until we come to the
                    particle to which the external force B is immediately applied. And this particle
                    being in equilibrium, the external force applied to it must be equal and
                    opposite to the compound force exerted on it by the series of contiguous
                    particles on that side; therefore the two forces A and B are equal and
                    opposite.</p><p>Hence it follows, that when any number of external forces are applied to a solid
                    body, and it is in equilibrium between them, the forces are such as would be in
                    equilibrium if they were all applied at one point.</p><p>4. If a body is maintained in equilibrium by the action of three forces, these
                    forces lie in the same plane, and are either parallel, or meet in the same
                    point. This follows immediately from the composition of forces; for the forces
                    being in equilibrium, any one of the three must be equal and opposite to the
                    equivalent, or <hi rend="italic">resultant,</hi> as it is termed, of the other
                    two; and this resultant is the diagonal of a parallelogram of which the other
                    two <hi rend="italic">component</hi> forces are the sides. But the diagonal and
                    sides of a parallelogram are in the same plane, therefore the third force is in
                    the plane of the other two; and, further, since it is equal and opposite to the
                    resultant of the other two, it must be in the same straight line, and
                    consequently pass through their point of concourse. These simple propositions
                    are the foundation of the theory of statics.</p><p>5. In applying these propositions to explain the motion of rotation, we must
                    recollect a fundamental theorem in dynamics, that the force which produces any
                    motion is equal and opposite to the force which would prevent it, if applied at
                    the same point, and in the same straight line, or which would extinguish the
                    motion in the same time in which we suppose it to be produced. The force
                    therefore which, acting on any particle, causes the body to revolve about an
                    axis with a given angular velocity, is equal to the force which, if applied at
                    the same point in the opposite direction, would reduce the body to a state of
                    rest in the same time as was necessary to produce the given velocity.</p><p>6. The only distinct notion we can form of the intensity of any moving force, is
                    the quantity of motion which <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=503" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0503-0491"/>it can produce by acting uniformly during a given time. This will be
                    ascertained when we know the velocity impressed upon a body containing a given
                    quantity of matter. Thus we know that terrestrial gravity acting on a body for a
                    second, will cause it to fall sixteen feet with an uniformly accelerated motion,
                    and will leave it in a state such that it would move on for ever at the rate of
                    thirty-two feet per second. The force of gravity is therefore such as to
                    communicate a velocity of thirty-two feet per second; and in this case the mase
                    of the body is not considered, for gravity acts equally on every particle of
                    which it is composed. In the same manner, the best way of acquiring a distinct
                    conception of the rotatory effect of a moving force, is to determine the
                    quantity of rotatory motion which it can generate by acting uniformly during
                    some known time.</p><p>7. If a solid body, or rigid system of invariable form, admit of a rotatory
                    motion about an axis, and if at any point of the body a force P be applied,
                    which acts in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and tends to turn
                    the body in one direction; and to any other point in the same plane a force Q be
                    applied, tending to turn the body in the opposite direction; then, if the two
                    forces be to each other inversely as the distances of the lines of their
                    directions respectively from the axis, the body will remain at rest, or the two
                    forces will be in equilibrium.</p><p>For let O (fig. 1) be the axis of rotation, and suppose the force P to be applied
                    at the point P in the direction PA, and tending to turn the solid body about the
                    axis O perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and let the force Q act in the
                    direction QB, and consequent ly tend to turn the body in the oppo site
                    direction, and draw OA perpen dicular to PA, and OB perpendicu lar to QB. Then,
                    in order that there may be equilibrium, we must have, by the principle of the
                    lever, P: Q:: OB: OA, whence P ∙ OA = Q ∙ OB.</p><p>8. It is obviously indifferent at what point of the plane the force is applied,
                    provided its distance from the axis remains the same· Let BO therefore be
                    produced, and take OC equal to OA, and draw CR perpendicular to BC, or parallel
                    to BQ. We may now suppose the force P to be replaced by an equal force R, acting
                    in the direction RC; then, since R ∙ OC = P ∙ O A, we have R ∙ OR = Q ∙ OB, and,
                    consequently, the axis being supposed fixed, the body will remain in equilibrium
                    between the two forces Qand R. These forces are therefore equivalent to a single
                    force applied at O, equal to their sum, and acting in a parallel direction.
                    Hence the resultant of two parallel forces applied to a straight line is a force
                    parallel to the component forces, equal to their sum, and whose line of
                    direction divides the straight line into parts reciprocally proportional to the
                    forces themselves.</p><p>9. If two forces, which are inversely as the distances of their respective
                    directions from the axis of rotation, be applied to a body, the equilibrium will
                    still be maintained, although the two forces are not in the same plane. Let OO'
                    be two points in the axis of rotation, through which let there be drawn two
                    planes <hi rend="italic"> Aa</hi> and Βό at right angles to the axis. Suppose
                    also these planes to be intersected by another plane (here supposed to be the
                    plane of the figure) passing through the axis, and let OA, O'B be the
                    intersections, and let the straight line which joins A and B intersect the axis
                    in C. Let P and Q be two forces applied respectively at A and B in the planes
                    A0α and BO⅛, and at right angles to O A and O'B, or perpendicular to the plane
                    of the paper, then these two forces are parallel; and because by hypothesis P:
                    Q:; O'B: OA, we have P: Q:: CB: CA; therefore (8) the two forces P and Q are
                    equivalent to a single parallel force passing through C. But a force passing
                    through the axis has no tendency to turn the body round the axis; consequently
                    the body remains at rest.</p><p>10. Let wl, <hi rend="italic">m', m",</hi> &amp;c. (fig. 3) be a system of bodies
                    immoveable in respect of each other, and suppose them to revolve about an axis
                    passing through O; also let <hi rend="italic">m, m', rn",</hi> &amp;c. denote
                    the quanti ties of matter in the bodies respectively, and let r, r', r", &amp;c.
                    denote their dis tances from the axis of rotation. Let the angular velocity of
                    the system be <hi rend="italic">w;</hi> then</p><p>(2) the absolute velocities of the bodies are respectively <hi rend="italic">tor,
                    tor', wr", &amp;c.</hi> Now let us suppose the system to be put in motion by an
                    external force F applied at the point P, in the direction PA, which is contained
                    in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation; then the relation between the
                    force F and the velocity <hi rend="italic">w</hi> may be found as follows.
                    Considering, first, the body <hi rend="italic">m;</hi> since its velocity = <hi rend="italic">wr,</hi> and its quantity of matter = rn, its quantity of motion =
                    <hi rend="italic">wrm.</hi> But it is a principle in dynamics, that the quantity
                    of motion of a moving body is proportional to the impressed force, and may be
                    taken as a measure of that force; whence <hi rend="italic"> wrm</hi> is the
                    measure of a force which, if applied at <hi rend="italic"> m,</hi> in a
                    direction perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">Om,</hi> would cause <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to begin to move with the actual velocity <hi rend="italic">tor.</hi> Let/be the force which, if applied at P in the direction PA, would
                    make equilibrium with the force <hi rend="italic"> wrm</hi> at <hi rend="italic">m;</hi> draw OA perpendicular to PA, and make OA = <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> We
                    have then (7)</p><p><hi rend="italic">f: wrm:: Om</hi>: O A:: <hi rend="italic">r: h,</hi> whence <hi rend="italic">fh = wr~m.</hi> In like manner, the quantities of motion in the
                    bodies <hi rend="italic">m', m",</hi> &amp;c. are <hi rend="italic"> wr'm',
                    wr"ni',</hi> &amp;c.; and if we denote by/,/", &amp;c. the forces which, if
                    applied at P in the direction PA, would respectively make equilibrium with the
                    forces <hi rend="italic">wr <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> m', wr"m",</hi>
                    &amp;c. we shall have <hi rend="italic"> f'h — wd <hi rend="superscript">i</hi>
                    m',f''h = tor <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> “ml', &amp;c.</hi>; therefore, if
                    we assume</p><p>F =∕+∕+∕'+, &amp;c. we shall have the equation</p><p>F ∙ <hi rend="italic">h = w (f <hi rend="superscript">l</hi> m + r <hi rend="superscript">n</hi> m'</hi> + r <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> “zw" +,
                    &amp;c.).</p><p>If we suppose <hi rend="italic">m = m' = m"</hi> =, &amp;c. and take <hi rend="italic"> r</hi> to denote the distance of any particle from the axis of
                    rotation, the equation becomes F ∙ <hi rend="italic">h = wl</hi> (r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> m); the summation denoted by2 extending to every
                    particle in the system.</p><p>11. When the direction of the external force F is not in a plane parallel to the
                    circles of rotation, it must be resolved into two forces, one of which lies in
                    that plane, and the other is parallel to the axis. It is only the first of these
                    forces which in the present case is regarded as the moving force; the second
                    merely tends to push the body in the direction of the axis, and does not
                    influence the rotation. When we come to consider the rotation of a body
                    perfectly free, it will be necessary to attend particularly to this
                    circumstance.</p><p>12. A solid body may be regarded as composed of molecules of a very small but
                    finite magnitude, connected so as to form an invariable system; and although a
                    solid, according to his view of the constitution of body, is formed of discrete
                    elements, the sums relative to the molecules may be changed into definite
                    integrals without sensible error; that is to say, for the sums 2r <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> m we may substitute the definite integrals <hi rend="italic"> ∕r <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> dm,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">dm</hi> is the element of the mass, and the integrals extend to the whole mass.
                    We have then F ∙ <hi rend="italic">h = ufr <hi rend="superscript">i</hi>
                    dm,</hi></p><p>13. The energy of a force applied to a lever, or its power of producing motion
                    round the fulcrum, is expressed by the product of the force into the
                    perpendicular drawn from the fulcrum upon the line of its direction. This
                    product (denoted above by F ∙ A) is called the <hi rend="italic">moment,</hi> or
                    momentum, or rotatory effort, of the force F. And because <hi rend="italic">fd
                    <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> dm</hi> is <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=504" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0504-0492"/>the sum of the moments of all the particles of the body in actual motion, this
                    integral expresses the energy or effort of all the resistances made to the
                    rotation by the inertia of the particles, and is therefore called the <hi rend="italic"> moment of inertia</hi> of the moving body with respect to the
                    axis from which the distances <hi rend="italic">r</hi> are reckoned. We have
                    therefore these definitions:</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">moment of a force</hi> in respect of a given axis, is the
                    product of the force into the perpendicular from the axis upon the line of its
                    direction.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">moment of inertia</hi> of a body in respect of any axis is
                    the sum of the products obtained by multiplying each particle of the body into
                    the square of its distance from the axis.</p><p>14. From the equation F ∙ <hi rend="italic">h = wfι <hi rend="superscript">3</hi>
                    dm</hi> (12), we have the following expression for the angular veloaty,
                    namely,</p><p>F∙A</p><p><hi rend="superscript">w =</hi>? ι'; 'i <hi rend="italic">fr-dm</hi> that is to
                    say, the angular velocity about any axis is equal to the moment of the external
                    or applied force divided by the moment of inertia. This fraction expresses a
                    number; for the force F may be represented by the product of a mass M into a
                    certain velocity = <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> so that F = Mt&gt;; and therefore,
                    since <hi rend="italic">v</hi> represents a line, the numerator and denominator
                    have both the same dimension. The fraction also expresses the part of the radius
                    which is equal to the arc measuring the angle; and since the radius is equal to
                    the arc of 57° ∙2958, if we make the radius = 1, we have only to multiply the
                    fraction by 57∙2958 in order to obtain the value of <hi rend="italic">w</hi> in
                    degrees.</p><p>15. Since the relation between the angular velocity and the external impelling
                    force is expressed in terms of the moment of inertia, it is evident that this
                    moment is an important element in the theory of rotation. We shall therefore now
                    proceed to consider the subject under a more general view, and point out the
                    method by which it is computed for bodies of any form revolving about given
                    axes.</p><p>Let the different points of a solid body be referred to three rectangular
                    co-ordinates ar, <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> z, and let <hi rend="italic">dm</hi>
                    be the differential element of the mass; then the distance of any particle from
                    the axis <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is <hi rend="italic">s∕{fl <hi rend="superscript">i</hi></hi> + z <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ), and, by the
                    definition, the moment of inertia relative to the axis <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>
                    is ∕(y <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + z <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ) <hi rend="italic">dm,</hi> the integral extending to the whole mass of the body. In
                    like manner, the moments of inertia relative to the axes <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and z are respectively <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (z <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + z <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ) <hi rend="italic">dm</hi> and 4" <hi rend="italic">ʹ ' <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> ) yim∙</hi>
                    It <hi rend="superscript"> 18</hi> thus evident that the determination of the
                    moments of inertia, with respect to any body whatever, consists in forming the
                    analytical expression of the product of the differential element of the body
                    into the square of its distance from the axis, and integrating for the whole
                    extent of the body. The integration may always be effected by the method of
                    quadratures.</p><p>16. Since the same body may be referred to an infinite number of different axes,
                    in respect of all of which the moments of inertia will have different values, it
                    follows that the moment cannot be absolutely defined unless it be referred to a
                    determinate axis. But when it is required to investigate the moments of inertia
                    of a body in respect of several axes successively, it is not always necessary to
                    compute the formula <hi rend="italic">fr <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> dm</hi>
                    for each case. For example, when the moment of inertia has been determined in
                    respect of any one axis, we may find its value in respect of any other parallel
                    axis without further calculation, if we know the mass of the body and the
                    distances of both axes from the centre of gravity.</p><p>17. The moment of inertia of any body in respect of an axis AO (fig. 4) being
                    given, to find the moment of inertia in respect of another axis <hi rend="italic"> oa</hi> parallel to OA.</p><p>Let the origin of the rectangular co-ordinates be at O, and let <hi rend="italic"> x</hi> be taken on the axis OA, and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in the plane
                    of</p><p>OA and <hi rend="italic">oa.</hi> Also let Z be the place of an element <hi rend="italic"> dm,</hi> and Y the projection of Z on the plane <hi rend="italic"> xy;</hi> and from Y draw YX perpendicular to OA, meeting OA in X and <hi rend="italic">oa</hi> in <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> then OX = <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> XY <hi rend="italic">= y,</hi> YZ = z. The moment of inertia in respect
                    of the axis OA is <hi rend="italic">fr <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> dm =f(y∙ +
                    χ <hi rend="superscript">ν</hi> )dm.</hi> But by hypothesis this is given;
                    suppose it = MA <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (M being the mass of the body),
                    and we have ∕(y <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + <hi rend="italic"> z <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> )dm</hi> = MA <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> . In like
                    manner, if we assume the distance of <hi rend="italic">oa</hi> from OA to be A,
                    we have <hi rend="italic">ox</hi> = r, <hi rend="italic">xY</hi> = A+y, YZ = z,
                    and the moment of inertia in respect of <hi rend="italic">oa</hi> is <hi rend="italic">f</hi> {(A + y) <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> + z <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> } <hi rend="italic">dm = k <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> fdm</hi> + 2A <hi rend="italic">fydm</hi> + ∕(y <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + <hi rend="italic">z <hi rend="superscript">ν</hi> )dm.</hi> But <hi rend="italic"> fk <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> dm —</hi> MA <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (y <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> +z <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> -)⅛w = MA <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>; therefore the moment in respect of the new axis is MΛ
                    <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + MA <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + <hi rend="italic">2kfydm.</hi> Suppose the centre of gravity of the body to be at G;
                    let GF be perpendicular to the plane <hi rend="italic">xy,</hi> and draw FE
                    perpendicular to the axes, meeting OA in E and <hi rend="italic"> oa</hi> in e.
                    From the nature of the centre of gravity <hi rend="italic"> fydm</hi> = M ∙ EF;
                    therefore the moment in respect of <hi rend="italic"> oa</hi> becomes MA <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + MA <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + 2A∙M∙EF. But A =
                    cE, and 2M∙A∙EF = 2M∙eE∙EF = M(eF <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — A <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> — EF <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ); whence we have
                    finally for the moment of inertia in respect of the new axis <hi rend="italic">οa,</hi></p><p>MΛ <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + M∙eF <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> -M∙EF <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> .</p><p><hi rend="italic">Corollary</hi> 1. If the original axis OA passes through the
                    centre of gravity G, then EF vanishes, and the moment in respect of the new axis
                    <hi rend="italic">oa</hi> becomes MA <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + M∙eF <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> , or MA <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + MA <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> . And if <hi rend="italic">oa</hi> passes through the
                    centre of gravity, then eF vanishes, and the moment in respect of <hi rend="italic">oa</hi> becomes MΛ <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> —M∙EF <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> . Hence we infer that the moment of inertia in respect
                    of the axis which passes through the centre of gravity is less than the moment
                    in respect of any other parallel axis.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Corol.</hi> 2. The moment of inertia is the same in respect of
                    every axis parallel to that which passes through the centre of gravity, and is
                    at the same distance from it; or the same in respect of every straight line
                    which lies in the surface of a cylinder having the centre of gravity in its
                    axis.</p><p>18. We shall now give a few examples of the application of the preceding
                    formulae.</p><p>I. Let it be proposed to find the moment of inertia of a very slender rod (the
                    breadth and thickness of which may be neglected), in respect of an axis passing
                    through its extremity and perpendicular to its length.</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = the length of the rod, and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = the distance of any point from the axis, then the element of the body
                    is <hi rend="italic">dx,</hi> and the moment of inertia <hi rend="italic">= fx
                    <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> dx,</hi> the limits of "the integral being <hi rend="italic"> x</hi> = 0 and <hi rend="italic">x = a.</hi> For those limits we
                    have <hi rend="italic">fx <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> dx</hi> = ⅙α <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> , which therefore is the moment of inertia.</p><p>II. To find the moment of inertia of a very thin rectangle, the thickness of
                    which may be neglected, in respect of an axis coinciding with one of its
                    sides.</p><p>Let the side which coincides with the axis = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and the
                    other side = <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be taken
                    in the axis. The co-ordinates of any point in the rectangle being <hi rend="italic"> x, y,</hi> the element of the body is <hi rend="italic">dxdy,</hi> and the distance from the axis = <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> therefore
                    the moment of inertia is <hi rend="italic">ffy <hi rend="superscript">i</hi>
                    dxdy.</hi> The integral of this in respect of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is/ <hi rend="italic">xy°dy,</hi> which from <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 0 to <hi rend="italic">x = a</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">af'y <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> dy.</hi> A second integration gives ½βy <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> ,
                    which from <hi rend="italic">y</hi> = 0 to <hi rend="italic"> y</hi> = 6,
                    becomes ⅙αZr <hi rend="superscript">,</hi>; therefore, since M = αά, <hi rend="italic">fft/dxdy —</hi> ⅜aA <hi rend="superscript">3</hi> = ½M ∙ A <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> .</p><p>III. To find the moment of inertia of a circle in respect of one of its
                    diameters.</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">α</hi> be the radius of the given circle, <hi rend="italic"> r —</hi> the radius of a concentric circle passing through a point P whose
                    coordinates are <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y, x</hi> being
                    taken on the axis of rotation, and <hi rend="italic">r + dr</hi> the radius of a
                    second concentric circle, very near the other. If we now assume <hi rend="italic">dz — sf(dχ + tfy <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> )</hi>, then <hi rend="italic">dz ∙ dr</hi> is the area of the elementary surface included
                    between <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=505" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0505-0493"/>the circumferences of the two circles whose radii
                    are respectively <hi rend="italic"> r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r + dr,</hi>
                    and two straight lines drawn from the centre to the extremities of a very small
                    arc at P; that is to say, we have <hi rend="italic">dm — dzdr.</hi> But the
                    distance of this element from the axis is y; therefore the moment of inertia is
                    <hi rend="italic"> ffy <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> dzdr.</hi> Now, by the
                    nature of the circle, <hi rend="italic">dz: dx:: r: y,</hi> whence <hi rend="italic"> ydz — τdx,</hi> and the double integral becomes <hi rend="italic">fydx ×frdr.</hi> Now, on the supposition that <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is
                    constant, the integral <hi rend="italic">fydx</hi> = or <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> = area of the circle whose radius is r; therefore the integration in
                    respect of <hi rend="italic">dx</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">stfr <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> dr;</hi> and on integrating this from <hi rend="italic"> r =</hi> 0 to <hi rend="italic">r = a,</hi> we get ulti-timately
                    ¼ wα <hi rend="superscript">4</hi> for the moment of the circle whose radius is
                    <hi rend="italic">a. '</hi></p><p>Since in this case the mass M = &lt;rα <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> = the area,
                    we have ¼&lt;rα <hi rend="superscript">4</hi> = ¼Mα <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , which is another expression for the moment of inertia of a circle in
                    respect of one of its diameters.</p><p>IV. To find the moment of inertia of a circle in respect of an axis perpendicular
                    to its plane, and passing through its centre.</p><p>Supposing, as in the last proposition, the surface to be composed of elementary
                    rings, we have <hi rend="italic">dm = dzdr,</hi> whence <hi rend="italic">fridm
                    = fridr × fdz</hi> = 2&lt;r <hi rend="italic">fi <hi rend="superscript">3</hi>
                    dr</hi> (since <hi rend="italic">fdz</hi> = 2wr), the integral of which, from
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = 0 to <hi rend="italic">r = a,</hi> gives <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> = ½wα <hi rend="superscript">4</hi> = ½Ma <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> .</p><p>V. To find the moment of inertia of a solid body generated by the revolution of a
                    curve line in respect of the axis of rotation.</p><p>Let AB (fig. 5) be a section perpendicular to the axis of rotation OX, and
                    meeting it in C, and make OC = <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> Suppose the solid to be
                    divided into thin slices by planes parallel to AB, and let <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> be the section next to AB, so that Cc = <hi rend="italic">dx.</hi> Let
                    P be a point in the plane AB, and make CP = <hi rend="italic">r,</hi></p><p>Cp = r+ <hi rend="italic">dr.</hi> The length of the circumference described by P
                    in one revolution is 2&lt;rr, therefore the mass of the ring comprised between
                    AB and <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and traced by the revolution of the points P
                    andp, is <hi rend="italic">2vrdrdx;</hi> and its distance from the axis is <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> therefore the moment of inertia of the ring is 2wr <hi rend="superscript">3</hi> drd⅛. Integrating this in respect of <hi rend="italic"> r</hi> from <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = 0 to <hi rend="italic"> r</hi> = CA =
                    <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> we get <hi rend="italic"> tyrfldx for</hi> the moment
                    of the slice comprised between the two sections of the solid, whose distances
                    from O are <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">xJ, dx.</hi> Hence the
                    moment of inertia of all the slices, or of the solid body, is <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">*fy*dx∙</hi></p><p>Applying this formula to a sphere whose radius = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> we get
                    from the equation <hi rend="italic">y <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> =z 2ax — χ
                    <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> , y' — 4a <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> — 4ax + ar <hi rend="superscript">4</hi></hi> , on
                    substituting which, and integrating, we have <hi rend="italic">⅛srfy <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> dx = gsra + ⅛ra <hi rend="superscript">5</hi></hi> ,
                    which from <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = 0 <hi rend="italic">to x = a</hi> gives
                    <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">vfy <hi rend="superscript">i</hi>
                    dx</hi> = -⅛wα <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> for the hemisphere, and
                    consequently the moment of inertia of the whole sphere = ⅛wα <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> = IM ∙ o <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , since M =∣wa
                    <hi rend="superscript">3</hi> .</p><p>The moment of inertia of a spheroid revolving about its shorter axis is¼M(o <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +A <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ). See the
                    calculation of <hi rend="italic"> fa"dm</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ffldm</hi> in
                    this case in the article Precession, vol. xviii. p. 508.</p><p>In all the preceding examples, the density of the body has been supposed uniform,
                    and =1. For bodies of different densities the formulae must be multiplied in
                    each case by the density. Thus, in the last example, the moment of inertia of a
                    sphere whose radius = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and density = (, the moment of
                    inertia in respect of one of the diameters is ⅛ <hi rend="italic">grξα <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> .</hi></p><p>19. The examples which have now been given wili suffice to illustrate the method
                    of computing the moments of inertia of bodies of any form in respect of
                    particular axes; and they render it obvious that the computation will in general
                    be greatly facilitated when the mass is symmetrically disposed about the axis
                    for which the inertia is to be computed. It is likewise evident that the amount
                    of rotatory inertia depends on the position of the axis of rotation. Hence, for
                    every point of a mass there must exist at least one axis in respect of which the
                    inertia is less, or greater, than in respect of any other axis passing through
                    that point. The axes for which the moments of inertia are the greatest or least
                    possible are called <hi rend="italic">principal axes;</hi> and they possess some
                    very remarkable properties of great importance in the theory of rotation. We now
                    proceed to investigate the position and properties of the principal axes.</p><p>20. The moments of inertia of a mass M being given in respect of three
                    rectangular axes OX, OY, OZ (fig. 6) passing through O, to find the moment in
                    respect of another axis OG given in position, and also passing through the
                    origin O.</p><p>Let P be the position of a particle <hi rend="italic">dm;</hi> through P draw PQ
                    parallel to the axis OZ, meeting the plane XOY in Q, and draw QR parallel to OY,
                    meeting OX in R; then OR = <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> RQ = <hi rend="italic">
                    y,</hi></p><p>QP = <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> Also suppose the plane which passes through OG,
                    and is perpendicular to XOY, to meet the plane XOY in OF, and let the angle XOF
                    = <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> and the angle FOG = ∙ψ. The axis OG is entirely
                    determined by these two angles, and consequently, when OG is given in position,
                    <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and ∙ψ are also given. In order to compute the moment
                    of inertia in respect of the axis OG, it is convenient to refer the different
                    points of the mass, as P, to a new system of rectangular axes, of which one is
                    OG. To effect this, in the first place let OY be drawn perpendicular to OF in
                    the plane XOY, and let P be referred to the axes OF, OY', OZ, and draw QR'
                    perpendicular to OF. We have then OR' = a/, R'Q = <hi rend="italic"> f,</hi> QP
                    = z, and the new co-ordinates expressed in terms of the former, and the angles
                    <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and ∙ψ are <hi rend="italic">x <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> = x</hi> cos. <hi rend="italic">φ + y</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">φ, y'

                    to OG in the plane FOG. We have, then, similarly,</p><p>∙r" = ar <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> cos. ∙ψ + z <hi rend="superscript">,</hi>

                    Euler ( <hi rend="italic">Theoria Motus Corporum Solidorum,</hi> p. 169).</p><p>21. The values of the angles p and ∙ψ, which give the position of the axis for
                    which the moment <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> is a maximum or minimum, may be
                    deduced from the above equation in the usual manner, that is to say, by
                    differentiating successively for each of the variables, and making the
                    differential co-efficient = 0. The differentiation in respect of p (supposing ∙ψ

                    following form, in which κ = tan. p, and <hi rend="italic">e,f, g, h,</hi> are
                    co-efficients depending upon the quantities A, B, C, D, E, F, viz.</p><p>0 = e +∕a + <hi rend="italic">gu <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + hu <hi rend="superscript">3</hi> .</hi></p><p>This being a cubic equation, must have at least one real root. But it is easy to
                    see, from the nature of the thing, that all the roots are real; for if there be
                    one axis for which the moment of inertia is a <hi rend="italic">maximum,</hi>
                    there must evidently be a second, in respect of which it is a <hi rend="italic">minimum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Hence the equation must
                    have two real roots, and therefore, by the theory of cubic equations, all the
                    roots are real. We are therefore led to this very important conclusion, that
                    through any point of every solid body, however irregular in its form, there may
                    be drawn a system of three axes, such that the differential co-efficient of the
                    moment of inertia in respect of each of them is nothing. In respect of one of
                    these, the moment is a maximum, in respect of another, it is a minimum, and
                    though, in respect of the third it is neither a maximum nor a minimum, it is
                    still such that its value is not altered by a small change in the position of
                    the axis. According to the definition in (19), these are the <hi rend="italic">principal axes</hi> of the body.</p><p>22. It would be difficult, in general, to determine the position of the principal
                    axes from the cubic equation found above; but they possess certain properties,
                    by means of which they may be readily found in almost every case of practical
                    application. On comparing the two equations for tan. ∙ψ and tan. 2-ψ (21), with
                    the expressions for z", y*, z" (20), it will be seen that the first is identical
                    with 2 cos. -ψ <hi rend="italic">fri'ιf'dm,</hi> and the second with — 2 <hi rend="italic">fx"z"dm; whence fx"y"dm</hi> = 0, and <hi rend="italic">
                    fxyz"dm</hi> = 0; and it follows, that if <hi rend="italic"> x</hi> be taken in
                    one of the principal axes, we have, in respect of that <hi rend="italic">nuis,
                    fxydm = 0, fxzdm</hi> = 0, or the quantities denoted by D and E respectively
                    vanish.</p><p>23. From this it follow’s, that if all the matter in a body of uniform density be
                    symmetrically disposed about any line, that line is one of the principal axes of
                    rotation (for if <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be taken in the axis of symmetry, then
                    to every element whose co-ordinates are <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi> there
                    corresponds another element whose co-ordinates are <hi rend="italic">x, —
                    y,</hi> whence <hi rend="italic">fxydm</hi> — 0); therefore, in the case of
                    symmetrical figures, the position of one of the principal axes is known, and the
                    positions of the other two are thence readily determined by means of the two
                    equations(2D. On making D = 0, E = 0, the first of these equations gives</p><p>(A — B) sin. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> cos. <hi rend="italic">φ —</hi> F cos. ®
                    tan. -ψ = 0, whence cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = 0, and sin. <hi rend="italic"> φ</hi> = 1; or <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = 90°. Substituting this
                    value of <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> in the second of the equations (21), and
                    making at the same time D = 0, E = 0, we get tan. 2+ = 2F ÷ (B ∙—C); or 2∙ψ is
                    the angle which has 2F -j- (B — C) for its tangent. Hence the angle ∙ψ has a
                    double value, one corresponding to FOG, and the other to FOG + 90°.</p><p>24. Hence also it appears, that when one principal axis OX is determined, two
                    others may be found having the same property of maximum or minimum, and, by
                    reason of <hi rend="italic">φ —</hi> 90°, these axes are both in a plane
                    perpendicular to OX. As this conclusion holds good with respect to each of the
                    three axes, it follows that the three principal axes are at right angles to each
                    other, and also, since <hi rend="italic">fxydm =</hi> 0, and <hi rend="italic">
                    fxzdm =</hi> 0, that <hi rend="italic">fyzdm</hi> = 0. We have therefore, in
                    respect of the principal axes, the three equations</p><p>D = <hi rend="italic">fxydm</hi> = 0, E = <hi rend="italic">fxzdm</hi> = 0, F =
                    <hi rend="italic">fyzdm</hi> = 0.</p><p>If the origin of the co-ordinates is placed at the centre of gravity, we have
                    likewise <hi rend="italic">fxdm =. 0,fydm = 0,fzdm</hi> = 0, by the well-known
                    property of the centre of gravity.</p><p>25. By means of these equations, the proposition in (20) is considerably
                    simplified when the three axes for which the momenta are respectively given are
                    principal axes. Let</p><p>OX, OY, OZ (fig. 6) be the three principal axes passing through O, then D = 0, E
                    = 0, F = 0, and the equation (20) for the moment, in respect of the axis OG,
                    becomes <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> = A (sin? <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> + cos.
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi><hi rend="italic">φ</hi> sin. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ∙ψ)</p><p>+ B (cos. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> p + sin. <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> ρ
                    sin. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∙ψ) + C cos. <hi rend="superscript">5</hi>
                    ∙ψ. Suppose the given moments in respect of the principal axes to be
                    respectively M∙o <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> , M∙A <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> , M∙c <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>; then, from the values of A, B, C
                    (20) we have M∙α <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> = B + C, M∙A <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> = A</p><p>+ C, M∙c <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> = A + B, whence</p><p>A=¼M(i <hi rend="superscript">l</hi> + c <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> -β <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> ),B = i M (α <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> + <hi rend="italic">b <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi></hi> — c <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ),</p><p>C = ⅜(α <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + c <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> -A <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ), on substituting which in the above equation, we get
                    <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> = M (α <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> cos. <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> p cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∙ψ+A <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> sin. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> p cos. sin. <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> ∙ψ). If we now refer the new axis OG to the
                    co-ordinates OX,</p><p>OY, OZ, and make the angle XOG = &lt;x, YOG = <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> ZOG <hi rend="italic">= y,</hi> and observe that because the two planes XOF and FOG are
                    at right angles, cos. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = cos. p cos. ∙ψ, cos. <hi rend="italic">β =</hi> sin. p cos. ∙ψ, cos. <hi rend="italic">y</hi> = sin. ∙ψ,
                    the equation becomes <hi rend="italic">fridm —</hi> M (α <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> α + A <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
                    cos. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi><hi rend="italic">β</hi> + c <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> cos. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi><hi rend="italic">γ).</hi></p><p>It is to be remarked, that as the co-ordinates are rectangular, cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> + cos. <hi rend="superscript">5</hi><hi rend="italic">β</hi> + cos. <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> y = 1, so that the position of OG is determined by any two of these
                    angles. If we therefore suppose the moments in respect of two of the principal
                    axes to be equal, for example, if ♯ <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> = <hi rend="italic">b <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ,</hi> the formula for the moment
                    in respect of OG becomes <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> = M∙α <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (1 — cos. <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi><hi rend="italic">γ)</hi> + M∙c <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> cos. <hi rend="superscript">5</hi><hi rend="italic">y.</hi></p><p>Now when <hi rend="italic">y =</hi> 90°, that is, when OG lies in the plane XOY,
                    then <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> = M∙α <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> . Hence,
                    if the moments in respect of the axes OX and OY be equal, the moment will be the
                    same for every axis passing through O, contained in the plane XOY.</p><p>When the moments in respect of the three principal axes are equal, that is, when
                    <hi rend="italic">a- = tri —</hi> c <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> , then <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> = M <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> α <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (cos. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> + cos. <hi rend="superscript">5</hi><hi rend="italic">β</hi> + cos. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi><hi rend="italic">y)</hi> = M <hi rend="superscript">-</hi> α <hi rend="superscript">5</hi> , so that the moment is the same in
                    respect of any axis whatever which passes through O. Thus it appears, that for
                    every point of a solid body there are either three principal axes of rotation
                    only, or else an infinite number.</p><p>26. These conclusions are obviously true in the case of some simple figures.
                    Thus, in the spheroid of revolution, the moments are equal in respect of every
                    diameter which lies in the plane of the equator; and in the sphere they are the
                    same in respect of any diameter whatever, the bodies being always supposed
                    homogeneous. The existence of three principal axes in every body was first
                    noticed by Segner in 1755, but demonstrated for the first time by Albert Euler,
                    in a memoir which received the prize of the Academy of Sciences of Paris in
                    1760.</p><p>27. Having established these general propositions respecting the moments of
                    inertia and principal axes of bodies endowed with a rotatory motion, we now
                    proceed to consider more particularly the rotation of a solid body about a fixed
                    axis.</p><p>When a force is impressed on a body which can only move round a fixed axis, the
                    difference between the motion which actually takes place, and that which would
                    take place if the body were free, is evidently owing to the connexion which its
                    parts have with the axis, and to the action of the points of support upon the
                    axis. This action must be viewed in the light of another external force, such
                    that, if combined with the force impressed on the body, it would produce in the
                    body unconnected with any fixed points the motion which actually takes
                    place.</p><pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=507" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0507-0495"/><p>28. In order to determine the strain on the axis, let OY (fig. 7) be the axis of
                    rotation, retained in a fixed position by tile two pivots S, T, and suppose a
                    force = F applied to the body at P, in the direction PQ, which is supposed to
                    lie in a plane perpendicular to OZ. In the plane perpendicular to the axis, and
                    containing PQ, let the rectangular axes OX, OY be drawn, and let <hi rend="italic"> x, y, z</hi> be the co-ordinates of a particle <hi rend="italic">
                    dm,</hi> the projection of which on the plane X Y is at A, and let <hi rend="italic">r</hi> denote its distance from the axis of rotation, so that <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = OA = √(x <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + y <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ); also let <hi rend="italic">&lt;f</hi> = the angle
                    which OA makes with OX. If we now suppose <hi rend="italic">w</hi> to be the
                    angular velocity communicated to the body, then <hi rend="italic">rw</hi> is the
                    velocity with which the point A revolves, and the direction of this velocity is
                    in the perpendicular to OA, and from OX towards OY, whence the velocity of A in
                    the direction OX is — <hi rend="italic">wr</hi> sin. p, and <hi rend="italic">wr</hi> cos. p in the direction OY. But <hi rend="italic"> r</hi> sin. p = <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> r</hi> cos. <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> p = <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> therefore the velocity of A in the
                    direction OX is — <hi rend="italic"> wy,</hi> and in the direction O Y it is +
                    <hi rend="italic">wχ.</hi> The quantities of motion in these directions are
                    therefore respectively — <hi rend="italic">wydm</hi> and + <hi rend="italic">wxdm;</hi> and the integrals of those expressions extended to the whole mass of
                    the moving body give the whole quantities of motion in those directions, namely,
                    — <hi rend="italic">wfydm,</hi> and + <hi rend="italic">wfxdm.</hi> On denoting
                    the mass by M, and the co-ordinates of its centre of gravity by <hi rend="italic"> x <hi rend="subscript">γ</hi></hi> and <hi rend="italic">y <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> ,</hi> we have (from the well-known expressions for
                    these co-ordinates) <hi rend="italic">fydm</hi> = M <hi rend="subscript">ι</hi>
                    y,, and <hi rend="italic">fxdm</hi> = M∙τ,, therefore — <hi rend="italic">wfydm</hi> = — wMy,, and + <hi rend="italic">wfxdm</hi> = + wMr <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> .</p><p>29. Now, since the body is supposed to be put in motion by a force F acting in a
                    plane parallel to X0Y, let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi>
                    be the angles which its direction makes with parallels to OX and OY
                    respectively; then the components of F in those directions are F cos. <hi rend="italic"> a</hi> and F cos. <hi rend="italic">β.</hi> But these two forces
                    are evidently equal respectively to the two former, together with the pressures
                    on the pivots estimated in the same directions; therefore, calling <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> the pressures sustained by the
                    point S in the directions OX and OY, and <hi rend="italic">fl, &lt;f</hi> the
                    pressures sustained by T in the same directions, we shall have <hi rend="italic">p + p' =</hi> F cos. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> + wMy,, <hi rend="italic"> q +

                    ,</hi> it is still necessary to find two other equations. These will be obtained
                    by considering, that in respect of the plane XOY, the moments of the forces
                    acting on the two pivots, resolved in the directions <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> must be equal to the moments of the resultants of
                    all the forces or quantities of motion due to the rotation estimated in the same
                    directions. Let <hi rend="italic">h</hi> = OS, and <hi rend="italic">h'</hi> =
                    OT, the moments of the resolved forces which act on the pivots in the directions
                    parallel to OX and OY are <hi rend="italic">ph + p'h</hi> and <hi rend="italic">
                    qh + q <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> h!;</hi> and the resultants of the
                    quantities of motion in the same two directions being — <hi rend="italic">
                    wfydm</hi> and + <hi rend="italic">wfxdm,</hi> their moments in respect of the
                    plane OXY are respectively — <hi rend="italic">wfyzdm</hi> and + <hi rend="italic"> wfxzdm;</hi> therefore <hi rend="italic">ph + ]ik' = — wfyzdm, qh
                    + q <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> k' = + wfxzdm.</hi> Combining these with the
                    preceding two equations, <hi rend="italic"> p, ji, q,</hi> ?/ are obtained in
                    terms of known quantities.</p><p>30. If the axis of rotation OZ be one of the principal axes of the system which
                    intersect at O, then, by (24), <hi rend="italic">fyzdm</hi> = 0 and <hi rend="italic"> fxzdm</hi> = 0, whence <hi rend="italic">ph</hi> + ρ'A <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> = 0, and <hi rend="italic">qh + tfh <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> =</hi> 0, and consequently <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic"> h'</hi> both vanish, and the percussions sustained by the
                    axis pass through the origin O-Let R represent the single force or shock which
                    the axis supports in this case, and <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> the angle which its

                    rotatory motion, to apply the pressures arising from the power and from the
                    resistance opposed by the work in such a manner as to annihilate or diminish
                    this pressure on the supports of the axis of motion. Attention to this theorem
                    will point out what may be done; and it is at all times proper, nay necessary,
                    to know what are the pressures in the points of support. If we are ignorant of
                    this, we shall run the risk of our machine failing in those parts; and our
                    anxiety to prevent this will make us load it with needless and ill-disposed
                    strength. In the ordinary theories of machines, deduced entirely from the
                    principles of equilibrium, the pressure on the points of support (exclusive of
                    what proceeds firom the weight of the machine itself) is stated to be the same
                    as if the moving and resisting forces were applied immediately to these points
                    in their own directions. But this is in all cases erroneous; and, in cases of
                    swift motions, it is greatly so. We may be convinced of this by a very simple
                    instance. Suppose a line laid over a pulley, and a pound weight at one end of
                    it, and ten pounds at the other; the pressure of the axis on its support is
                    eleven pounds, according to the usual rule; whereas we shall find it only 3¼¼.
                    For the direction of the pressure R being in this case parallel to the axis <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> and the force F also acting in the same direction, we have
                    cos. <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = 0 cos. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 0, sin. <hi rend="italic">φ —</hi> 1, cos. <hi rend="italic">β</hi> = 1, y <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> = 0, and the two equations of (30) give the single
                    equation</p><p>R = F — ιcMι <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> .</p><p>If we now call the radius of the pulley 1, the moment of the moving force isl0×l
                    — l×l = 9; and the moment of inertia (13) is 10 × l <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> + 1 × l <hi rend="superscript">l</hi> = 11; therefore (14) the angular
                    velocity <hi rend="italic"> w</hi> = -⅛. But the distance of the centre of
                    gravity from the axis of motion is also ⅛ because the two weights may be
                    supposed in contact with the circumference of the pulley; therefore, since M =
                    11, ∞Mr, = -, <hi rend="superscript">9</hi> , × S <hi rend="superscript">,</hi>
                    × ^⅛ <hi rend="superscript">=</hi> ⅝⅛∙ Now F = 10 + 1 = 11, therefore R = 11— ¾¼
                    = ¼¼ = 3-, ʹ <hi rend="subscript">r</hi> pounds, which is the pressure sustained
                    by the axis.</p><p>32. If we suppose R = 0, the two equations (30) will express the conditions that
                    must be fulfilled in order that the axis may receive no shock from the action of
                    the impressed force F. This supposition gives the equations</p><p>F cos. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = — wMy,, F cos. <hi rend="italic">β =</hi> wMz
                    <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> , from which, since cos. <hi rend="italic">β =</hi>
                    sin. <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> we deduce <hi rend="italic">— y- <hi rend="subscript">i</hi></hi> sin. cos. <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> or — tan. <hi rend="italic">a = x <hi rend="subscript">l</hi> .</hi></p><p>Now, if a plane be conceived to pass through the axis OZ and the centre of
                    gravity of the body, and if we denote by ∙ψ the angle which it makes with the
                    plane XOZ, we shall have a·, = tan. +; and therefore, since r, = — <hi rend="italic">y <hi rend="subscript">l</hi></hi> tan.&lt;x, tan. ∙ψ = — tan. <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> From this equation it follows that the direction PQ of the
                    impressed force is perpendicular to the plane which passes through the axis and
                    the centre of gravity. It now remains only to find the distance of the point of
                    impulse P from the axis. Let <hi rend="italic">h</hi> = this distance, and r, =
                    distance of centre of gravity from the axis; the above equations give F <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> cos. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> α = <hi rend="italic">w"bVy <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> ",</hi> F <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> sin. <hi rend="superscript">2</hi><hi rend="italic">a zz</hi> w <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> M⅛ <hi rend="subscript">1</hi><hi rend="superscript">s</hi> , whence F <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> = je <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> M <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (r, <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> + y,

                    consequently A = jj∣—∙∙</p><p>33. Hence it appears that the conditions which must be fulfilled in order that
                    the axis may receive no shock when the body is struck, are, 1st, that the
                    direction of the force be in the plane of the two axes which make with the axis
                    of rotation a system of principal axes; 2<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, that its
                    direction be perpendicular to the plane which passes through the axis and the
                    centre of gravity; and, 3<hi rend="italic">d</hi>, that the distance of the
                    point of its application from the axis be <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> ÷
                    Mr,.</p><p>34. The point determined by these conditions is called the <hi rend="italic">centre of percussion</hi> of the system. The centre of per<pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=508" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0508-0496"/>cussion is therefore the point at which, if an obstacle were opposed
                    sufficient to resist the rotation of the system, no motion would be communicated
                    to the axis; or, which is the same thing, if the axis were not fixed, the system
                    would acquire from the shock no tendency to turn, the effect being the same as
                    if the whole rotatory effort had been accumulated at that point.</p><p>Let HKL (fig. 8) be a section of the body perpendicular to the axis, and
                    containing the centre of gravity G. Let O be the axis, and in the line OG take
                    OP = <hi rend="italic">h = fridm</hi> +- M∙OG, then P is the centre of
                    percussion, and a force applied at P, in the plane HKL, and in the direction
                    perpendicular to OP, will produce the same initial velocity of the centre of
                    gravity G as if the body were free; for as the force exerts no pressure on the
                    axis or points of support, the initial velocity will be the same as if they were
                    not there.</p><p>35. The distance of the centre of percussion from the axis is always greater than
                    the distance of the centre of gravity from the axis; for the moment of inertia
                    in respect of the axis passing through O being <hi rend="italic">fridm,</hi> by
                    (17) the moment of inertia in respect of the parallel axis passing through G is/
                    <hi rend="italic">ridm —</hi> M∙OG <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>; therefore,
                    since the moment of inertia is necessarily positive, <hi rend="italic">
                    fridm</hi> M∙OG <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> . But by the definition <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> = M∙OG∙OP, therefore M∙OG∙GP tx. M∙OG <hi rend="superscript">a</hi> , or OP OG.</p><p>36. The property of the centre of percussion, that a force applied there produces
                    no strain on the axis, may be rendered sensible by a simple experiment. If a
                    straight line, or rod of uniform thickness, be suspended from one extremity, the
                    centre of percussion is at the distance of two thirds of its length from the
                    axis; for the centre of gravity being at the middle of the line, OG = ½, so that
                    if we call its mass M = 1, the formula OP = ∕r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    dm+-M∙OG becomes OP <hi rend="italic">= 2fridx,</hi> which, on taking the
                    integral from <hi rend="italic">x =</hi> 0 to <hi rend="italic"> χ = l,</hi>
                    gives GP = 'j∕∙ Now if the rod be held in the hand, and we give it a motion
                    round the joint of the wrist only, and strike smartly against an obstacle with a
                    point considerably nearer or more remote than two thirds of its length, we feel
                    a painful shock or wrench in the hand; but if we strike with that point which is
                    exactly at two thirds of its length, we feel no such disagreeable strain.</p><p>37. It is sometimes said that the point P, considered as the centre of
                    percussion, is that with which the most violent blow is struck. But this is by
                    no means true. P is that point of a body turning round O which gives a blow
                    precisely equal to the progressive motion of the body, and in the same
                    direction. As we have already said, it is the point where we may suppose the
                    whole rotatory momentum of the body accumulated. Every particle of the body is
                    moving in a particular direction, with a velocity proportional to its distance
                    from the axis of rotation; and if the body were stopped in any point, each
                    particle tending to continue its motion endeavours to drag the rest along with
                    it. Whatever point we call the centre of percussion should have this property,
                    that when it is stopped by a sufficient force, the whole motion and tendency to
                    motion of every kind should be stopped; so that if at that instant the supports
                    of the axis were annihilated, the body would remain in absolute rest.</p><p>38. The expressions in (29) for the stress on the axis have reference only to the
                    initial movement of the body, and the forces which they represent are soon
                    destroyed by the resistance of the axis. But when a body is in permanent
                    rotation about a fixed axis, there is a strain exerted on the axis which depends
                    only upon the centrifugal force of rotation, and which therefore continues as
                    long as the rotation continues. This constant pressure is determined as follows:
                    Since <hi rend="italic">w</hi> is the angular velocity, and <hi rend="italic">
                    r</hi> the distance of a particle <hi rend="italic">dm</hi> from the axis, the
                    velocity of the particle <hi rend="italic">= rw;</hi> and, by mechanics, the
                    centrifugal force of a body moving in a circle is proportional to the square of
                    the velocity divided by the radius; therefore the centrifugal force of the
                    particle <hi rend="italic"> dm,</hi> in the direction of the radius <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> is <hi rend="italic">w <hi rend="superscript">i</hi>

                    situation of a point in which the whole mass of the machine might be
                    concentrated without altering the rotatory effort. In the straight line OG (fig.
                    8) suppose a point Qto be taken, such that OQ <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> =
                    <hi rend="italic"> fridm =</hi> moment of inertia in respect of the axis O;
                    then, if the whole matter in the body were collected at Q, a force applied at
                    any point P in the line OG, would produce exactly the same angular velocity as
                    if applied to the same point of the body having its natural form. For if the
                    whole mass M were concentrated at Q, the moment of inertia would become M∙OQ <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> (13), and the moment of the force F applied at P is
                    FOP; therefore the angular velocity (14) would be</p><p>F∙OP</p><p>MOQ** <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> ' <hi rend="superscript">le an</hi> ≈ <hi rend="superscript">u</hi> ' <hi rend="superscript">ar velθcit</hi> y produced by

                    yp <hi rend="subscript">i</hi> ^~' &gt; therefore, since M∙0Q <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> = <hi rend="italic">fridm,</hi> the two expressions
                    are equal, and the angular velocity is not altered by supposing the whole mass
                    concentrated at Q.</p><p>40. The point Q is called the <hi rend="italic">centre of gyration</hi> of the
                    revolving mass; and since OQ = √ <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> +- M, its distance
                    from the axis O is found by extracting the square root of the quotient which is
                    obtained by dividing the moment of inertia by the mass of the body. It is also
                    connected with the centres of gravity and percussion by a simple relation.
                    Suppose P to be the centre of percussion, then (34) OP <hi rend="italic"> =
                    fridm</hi> +∙ M ∙ OG, therefore OG ∙ OP = <hi rend="italic"> fridm</hi> + M = OQ
                    <hi rend="superscript">s</hi>; whence the distance of the centre of gyration
                    from the axis of rotation is a mean proportional between the distances of the
                    centre of gravity and percussion from the axis.</p><p>In a straight line or slender rod, as a working beam, or the spoke of a wheel in
                    a machine, OQ is √¼ of its length; for in this case <hi rend="italic">fridm =

                    circle turns round one of its diameters, then OQ = ½ the radius; for in this

                    produces its effect by instantaneous impact, and then ceases to act, so that the
                    motion communicated to the system is uniform. But if the action of the external
                    force continues after the first impact, like the force of gravity on a falling
                    body, the motion of the system will be accelerated. In the case of uniform
                    velocity, it has been shown (14) that the angular velocity is equal to the
                    moment of the applied force divided by the moment of inertia; that is, assuming
                    F to denote the force, and P the perpendicular from the axis on the line of its
                    direction, <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = p∙F +∙ <hi rend="italic">fridm.</hi>
                    Suppose now the body to be subjected to the action of an accelerating force, and
                    let <hi rend="italic">dw</hi> be the increment of the angular velocity in the
                    very small time <hi rend="italic">dt.</hi> The increment of the actual velocity
                    of the particle <hi rend="italic">dm,</hi> the distance of which from the axis
                    is <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> is then <hi rend="italic">rdw,</hi> and its
                    accelerating force (the ratio of the increment of the velocity to the increment
                    of the time) is <hi rend="italic">r~∙</hi> Its moving force is consequently ⅛ ∙
                    <hi rend="italic">rdm;</hi> and since the direction of this force is
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> its moment = <hi rend="italic"> ∙
                    ridm.</hi></p><p>But the sum of all these moments, in respect of every particle <hi rend="italic">
                    dm,</hi> must be equal to the moment of the impressed force, continuing to act
                    during the same instant of time, therefore <hi rend="italic">^fr'dm -PF,</hi>
                    whence</p><p>42. In the case of a heavy body oscillating about an axis by the force of
                    gravity, let HKL be a section of the body passing through the centre of gravity
                    G, and let the axis of suspension be at O,and perpendicular to the plane HKL.
                    Also, let OX be horizontal, and OY vertical. Then the accelerating force being
                    denoted by <hi rend="italic">g (g =</hi> 32 feet in a second of time), the

                    the centre of gravity to be drawn aside from the vertical, and let OG = <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and the angle GOY = <hi rend="italic">6,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">x <hi rend="subscript">1</hi> = k</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">

                    and the solid body will oscillate exactly in the same time as if all its matter
                    were united at the point S, and connected with the axis by an inflexible rod
                    without weight, that is, in the same time as a simple pendulum, of which the
                    length is OS.</p><p>Since ri = <hi rend="italic">χ <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> + y <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> ,</hi> and M ∙ <hi rend="italic">h = fxdm,</hi> this
                    expression for OS may be put under the following form, in which it is usually
                    exhibited, namely, os=∕&lt;^+y⅛</p><p><hi rend="italic">Jxdm</hi></p><p>44. The point S is called the <hi rend="italic">centre of oscillation.</hi> On
                    comparing the expression for OS with that for OP in (34), it will be seen that
                    it is at the same distance from the axis as the centre of percussion. But the
                    centre of oscillation is not, strictly speaking, limited to a single point; for
                    it through S a line be drawn perpendicular to the plane HKL, or parallel to the
                    axis of rotation, every point in this line will move with the same angular
                    velocity as if it were entirely unconnected with the other points of the
                    oscillating body, and the line itself is denominated the <hi rend="italic">axis

                    straight line, perpendicular to the axis, which contains the centre of
                    gravity.</p><p>45. If we denote the moment of inertia of the body in respect of the axis which
                    passes through G the centre of gravity, perpendicular to the plane HKL, by M ∙ A
                    <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , then A is a given line: and if we also make OG =
                    A, then (17) the moment of inertia in respect of the axis passing through O is M
                    (A <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + A <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> ). Hence we
                    find OS = —</p><p>A <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> A <hi rend="superscript">8</hi></p><p>= A +; and consequently GS = j-. This formula gives the distance of the centre of
                    oscillation below the centre of gravity.</p><p>46. The point S possesses several very remarkable properties, one of which is,
                    that as S is the centre of oscillation of the body turning about O, so O is the
                    centre of oscillation of the body turning about the parallel axis passing
                    through S; in other words, the centres of oscillation and suspension are</p><p>A <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> convertible. For it has been shown (45) that GS
                    =-^-A <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> A <hi rend="superscript">8</hi></p><p>= τvr,! therefore OG = <hi rend="subscript">5</hi> =, that is to say, if the

                    oscillation. Ί his curious property, which was first demonstrated by Huygens in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Horologium Oscilla-torium,</hi> was ingeniously applied by
                    Captain Kater as a practical means of determining the length of the seconds
                    pendulum. Two axes being assumed in a bar or rod of metal, the bar is adjusted
                    by filing away one of its ends until the oscillations about each axis are
                    performed exactly in the same time; and when this equality has been established,
                    the distance between the axes is the length of the synchronous simple pendulum.

                    thread or an inflexible rod, is important on account of its application to the
                    measurement of the seconds pendulum. Let us first suppose that the weight of the
                    thread is insensible in comparison of that of the ball. Let <hi rend="italic">r</hi> = radius of ball, Z = length of thread from the point of suspension to
                    the ball, and <hi rend="italic">a = l + r</hi> = distance from the point of
                    suspension to the centre of the ball. The moment of inertia of the sphere in
                    respect of an axis passing through its centre (18) is <hi rend="italic">2Mri</hi>; therefore (17) the moment in respect of a parallel axis at the
                    distance <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is M (α <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> + ¼r <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ); and on dividing this by MA ( = Mα), we get the
                    distance from the point of suspension to the centre</p><p>2r <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> of oscillation = <hi rend="italic">a + ∙—</hi> ,
                    or the centre of oscillation is be-5α</p><p>low the centre of gravity by the distance ¾r <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>
                    -+β.</p><p>49. Let us now suppose the weight of the thread or rod to be taken into account.
                    Let C (fig. 10) be the centre of the ball, G the centre of gravity of the ball
                    and rod OA, S the centre of oscillation; also let <hi rend="italic">b</hi> =
                    weight of ball, and <hi rend="italic">f∕' =</hi> weight of rod. The moment of
                    the sphere, oscillating about O, supposing the weight of the rod insensible, is
                    found above = M (β <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + <hi rend="italic">iri)</hi>;
                    and (18) the moment of the rod alone is ½OA <hi rend="superscript">3</hi> = ½Z
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> = ½M‘Z <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (putting M'
                    = mass of the rod); therefore, substituting the weightsfor the masses, that is,
                    making M = A, and M'= A <hi rend="superscript">,</hi> , the moment of the
                    compound body is A <hi rend="italic"> (α°</hi> + ⅞r <hi rend="superscript">i</hi> ) +½A'Z <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> . Now, to find the position ofG
                    the centre of gravity, we have this theorem in statics, that the product of the
                    whole mass multiplied into the distance of its centre of gravity from the axis,
                    is equal to the sum of the products of the masses of the several parts into the
                    respective distances of their centres of gravity; that is, putting OG = A, we
                    have (M + M')A = Aα + ½A'Z, and consequently (45), <hi rend="subscript">os</hi>

                    the rotation may be performed about axes which are themselves in motion, as in
                    the case of a ball or cylinder rolling down an inclined plane. When a ball rolls
                    down an inclined plane, the point of the ball which rests on the plane is
                    hindered from sliding down by friction; and therefore the ball tumbles, as it
                    were, over this point of contact, and is instantly caught by another point of
                    contact, over which it tumbles in the same manner. A cylinder rolls down in the
                    very same way; and its motion is nearly the same as if a fine thread had been
                    lapped round it, and one end of it made fast at the head of the inclined plane.
                    The cylinder rolls down by unwinding this thread.</p><p>The mechanism of all such motions (and some of them are important) may be
                    understood by considering them as follows: Let a body of any shape be connected
                    with a cylinder HO K (fig. 11), whose axis passes through G, the centre of
                    gravity of the body. Suppose the body suspended from a fixed point A by a thread
                    wound round the cylinder. The body will descend by the action of gravity, and it
                    will also turn round, unwinding the thread. Draw the horizontal line SGO; this
                    will pass through the point of contact O of the thread and cylinder, and O is
                    the point round which the cylinder <hi rend="italic">begins</hi> to turn in
                    descending. Let S be its centre of oscillation correspond ing to the momentary
                    centre of rotation O.</p><p>The body will begin to descend in the same manner as if all its matter were
                    collected in</p><p>S; for it may be considered, in this instant, as a pendulum suspended at O. But
                    in this case S will descend in the same manner as if the body were falling
                    freely. There fore the velocity of G (that is, the velocity of descent) will be
                    to the velocity with which a heavy body would fall as OG to</p><p>OS. Now since the points O, G, S, are always in a horizontal line, and the radius
                    OG is given, as also OS (43), the velocity of a body falling freely, and of the
                    body unwinding from this thread, will always be in the same proportion of OS to
                    OG, and so will the spaces described in any given time. And thus we can compare
                    their motions in every case when we know the place of the centre of
                    oscillation.</p><p>It follows from this that the weight of the descending body will be to the
                    tension of the thread as OS to GS; for the tension of the thread is the
                    difference between the moment of the rolling body and that of the body falling
                    freely. It is to be remarked, that this proportion between the weight of the
                    body and the tension of the thread will be always the same; for it has been
                    demonstrated (46), that if O be in the circumference of a circle whose centre is
                    G, S will be in the circumference of another circle round the same centre, and
                    therefore the ratio of OG to OS is constant.</p><p>If a circular body HOK roll down an inclined plane by unfolding a thread, or by
                    friction which prevents all sliding, the space described will be to that which
                    the body would describe freely as OG to OS; for the tendency down the inclined
                    plane is a determined proportion of the weight of the body. The motion of
                    rotation in these cases, both progressive and whirling, is uniformly
                    accelerated.</p><p>51. In order to give an example of the application of the preceding formulae for
                    the rotation of bodies about fixed axes to the theory of machines actually
                    performing work, we shall suppose the machine to be the wheel and axle, and that
                    a weight W, attached to a chain passing over the cylinder, is to be raised by
                    means of a power acting on another chain which passes over the wheel. Let the
                    radius of the wheel = <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the radius of the cylinder = A,
                    and suppose the moving power to be another weight P, or a mass of matter
                    descending by the accelerating force of gravity.</p><p>Since the machine is in this case impelled by an accelerating force, the angular
                    velocity <hi rend="italic">w</hi> is obtained from the equation (41), namely,
                    <hi rend="italic">dw</hi> _ moment of impelling force <hi rend="italic">dt</hi>
                    moment of incrtia</p><p>Now, because the weight P acts in a straight line whose distance from the axis =
                    a, the moment of its force is Pa; and in like manner the moment of the force
                    exerted by W is WA. But this last moment retards the motion, and must be taken
                    as negative; therefore the moment of the impelling force is Pα — WA. Again, the
                    moment of inertia is made up of three parts: first, the moment of inertia of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=511" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0511-0499"/>machine, which depends on the quantity of dead
                    matter contained in the wheel and cylinder, and which we may denote by K;
                    second, the moment of inertia of the weight P, which may be considered as
                    attached to the extremity of the radius of the wheel; third, the moment of
                    inertia of the weight W, which may be considered as attached to the extremity of
                    the radius of the cylinder. Let M and M ’ be the masses of the bodies whose
                    weights are P and W, then the moments of inertia are respectively Ma <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> and M‘Z∣ <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> . Let also <hi rend="italic">g</hi> = the acceleration of gravity, then the weight of a body
                    being the product of its mass into the force of gravity, we have P = ^M, W =
                    ^M', whence the whole moment of inertia is</p><p>K + ‰^, <hi rend="italic">g g</hi> and we have consequently <hi rend="italic">dw

                    respective accelerating forces by <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and ∙ψ, we shall have

                    which give the greatest performance when the weight and power are both given, we
                    may treat the formula which expresses the work, that is, the accelerating force,
                    or W, as a fluxionary quantity, and find its maximum. Thus, to find the radius
                    of the wheel by which the weight will be raised with the greatest velocity, we
                    have to differentiate the quantity denoted by U, on the supposition that <hi rend="italic"> α</hi> is variable, and make the result equal to zero. This will
                    give an equation from which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will he obtained in terms
                    of P, W, and A ,∙ and it will be observed, that as K varies with <hi rend="italic"> a,</hi> the value of K in terms of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> must
                    be substituted in the value of U before the differentiation.</p><p>53. The friction may be taken account of by considering it as a quantity to be
                    added to the weight W. Let/ = the co-efficient of friction, and c = radius of
                    the pivots supporting the machine, then the friction will be expressed <hi rend="italic"> by fc</hi> (P + W), and we have only to substitute WA + <hi rend="italic"> fc</hi> (P + W) for WA in the above expression for U.</p><p>54. In the case of the fixed pulley, the velocities of P and W are equal, and we
                    have also <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = A. If we denote the weight of the pulley by
                    Q, then its mass will be Q +- <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and (18) its moment of
                    inertia = ½ Qo <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> -÷- <hi rend="italic">g;</hi>
                    therefore the formula for the accelerating force with which P descends or W

                    which the direction does not pass through the centre of gravity, the body, if
                    free to move in every direction, acquires two motions, one progressive, and
                    equal to that which would have resulted if the direction of the force had passed
                    through the centre of gravity, and the other rotatory, and equal to that which
                    would have resulted if the body had been only at liberty to move round a fixed
                    axis passing through the centre of gravity, and perpendicular to the plane which
                    contains that centre, and the line of the direction of the impelling force.</p><p>56. In order to demonstrate this proposition, let HKL (fig. 12) be a section of
                    the body passing through G the centre of gravity, and containing the line in
                    which the force is directed; let P</p><p>be the point at which the given force F is applied, and PA its direc tion;
                    through G draw GA perpen dicular to PA, and let PA repre sent the intensity of
                    the force F.</p><p>Bisect AP in B, produce AG un til GC = AG, and through C draw</p><p>CD, CE perpendicular to AC, and make each equal to AB. If we now conceive a force
                    represented by DC to be applied at D in the direction DC, and another force
                    represented by EC to be applied at E in the direction EC, these two forces being
                    equal, and acting in opposite directions, will destroy each other, or produce no
                    movement in the body, and the motion which actually takes place in consequence
                    of the application of the force PA at P, will be the same as would result from
                    the application of the four forces PB, BA, DC, EC. Now it is evident, that if
                    the two forces BA and DC acted alone, they would produce no rotatory motion
                    about the axis passing through G, for their moments BA ∙ AG and DC ∙ CG are
                    equal, and they tend to turn the body in opposite directions. But the same two
                    forces both tend to give the body a progressive motion; and as the resultant of
                    two equal and parallel forces is a force equal to their sum, and acting at the
                    point which bisects the distance between their directions, the initial
                    progressive motion of the body in consequence of the forces BA and DC will be
                    the same as if the force PA = F were applied at the point G in the direction
                    parallel to PA. We have now to consider the two remaining forces PB and EC. As
                    these two forces act on the line AC in opposite directions, their resultant is
                    nothing, or their separate tendencies to produce a progressive motion in the
                    centre of gravity of the body, are counteracted by their joint effort. But they
                    conspire in tending to produce a rotatory motion in the same direction about the
                    axis passing through G; and the moment of the first in respect of that axis
                    being PB ∙ AG, and that of the second EC ∙ CG, the sum of their moments is (PB +
                    EC) AG or PA ∙ AG. The whole effect of these two forces is therefore to produce
                    the same initial angular velocity about the axis through G, perpendicular to
                    HKL, as would be produced by the single force PA applied at the point A; and it
                    has been shown, that the whole effect of the forces BA and DC is to produce the
                    same progressive movement of the centre of gravity as if the single force PA
                    were applied at that point, consequently the proposition is demonstrated, and it
                    appears that the two motions produced by the application of a force which is not
                    directed towards the centre of gravity may be considered independently of each
                    other.</p><p>57. Let V = the progressive velocity of the centre of gravity in the direction
                    parallel to PA; then the mass of the body being M, we have the force F = MV, and
                    consequently V = F -+ M. Again, if we make AG = <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> the
                    angular velocity produced by the force F applied at A is <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = F ∙ <hi rend="italic">l ÷ fridm</hi> (14), therefore V: <hi rend="italic"> w :: Jridm</hi>: MZ. Now, since <hi rend="italic">fridm</hi> and
                    M are both known from the nature of the body, it follows, that when the distance
                    Z is given, the ratio of the progressive motion of the centre of gravity to the
                    velocity of angular rotation can be found; and, conversely, when the ratio of
                    the two velocities is given, the distance Z can be found. For example, let <hi rend="italic">s</hi> be the space described by the centre of gravity while the
                    body makes one revolution about its axis, then 2w is the space described, in
                    consequence of the rotatory motion, by a point of the body whose distance from
                    the axis = 1, and the above proportion gives ,2» <hi rend="italic"> fridm</hi><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> ~^T' IT’</hi></p><pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=512" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0512-0500"/><p>58. As it is not necessary that the progressive motion of the centre of gravity
                    be in a straight line, this formula enables us to determine the distances from
                    the centre at which the planets may have received the single impulses which gave
                    them at the same time their motions of revolution in their orbits, and of
                    rotation round their axes. Thus, taking the case of the earth, and making R =
                    the radius of its orbit, the circumference of the orbit is 2wR, and the part of
                    this which is described by the centre of gravity, while the</p><p>2&lt;jrn</p><p>earth revolves once about its axis, is θ=- <hi rend="italic">= s;</hi> and by
                    (18) <hi rend="italic">.ouO</hi><hi rend="italic">fr <hi rend="superscript">l</hi> dm</hi> +- M = ∣ r <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>; therefore <hi rend="italic">l = -~</hi> ° <hi rend="subscript">r</hi> p — <hi rend="superscript">r</hi> -. If we assume Dit.</p><p>r = 4000 miles, and R = 95,000,000 miles, this formula gives <hi rend="italic">l</hi> = 24½ miles nearly.</p><p>59. The direction of the force being PA (fig. 12), if a point be taken in the
                    line AG between A and G, the motion of the point arising from the rotation of
                    the body about the axis is in the first instant of time parallel to the
                    direction of the progressive motion, and if <hi rend="italic">r</hi> be its
                    distance from G, the velocity due to both motions will be V + <hi rend="italic">rw.</hi> But if the point be taken on the other side of G, the direction of the
                    rotatory motion will be opposite to that of the progressive motion, and the
                    velocity of the point will be V — <hi rend="italic">rw.</hi> If therefore the
                    point T be taken such that making GT = <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> we have the
                    equation V <hi rend="italic">— rw;</hi> then, for a single instant, every point
                    in the straight line passing through T perpendicular to HKL is at rest, or is
                    carried as far back by the rotatory motion in the first instant of time, as it
                    is carried forward by the progressive motion; and, for a single instant, the
                    double motion of the body may be regarded as a simple rotatory motion about that
                    straight line. This point T is called the <hi rend="italic">centre of
                    spontaneous rotation,</hi> and the straight line passing through T,
                    perpendicular to the plane HKL, is called the <hi rend="italic">axis of
                    spontaneous ιotation∙</hi></p><p>60. The preceding formulae enable us to determine completely the two motions of
                    translation and rotation when a ’force is applied to a single point of the free
                    body; we have now to determine what the effect will be when any number of forces
                    given in magnitude and direction are applied to different points of the body;
                    and as it appears from what precedes, that during the first instant the two
                    motions take place independently of each other, we shall first give the
                    equations which fix the position of the centre of gravity of the moving body,
                    and then those which define the rotatory motion, or determine the position of
                    any point of the body with reference to its centre of gravity.</p><p>Let G be the centre of gravity of the body, M its mass, and let the motion be
                    referred to three rectangular axes OX, OY, OZ. Let us now suppose forces given
                    in magnitude and direction to be applied at the points A, A', A", &amp;c. of the
                    body, and that each of them is resolved into three others respectively parallel
                    to the directions of the axis, and let <hi rend="italic">p, q, r,</hi> be the
                    resolved forces applied at A; <hi rend="italic">j∕, cf, r <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ,</hi> the resolved forces applied at A', and so on; also let P <hi rend="italic">—p</hi> + ∕ + ∕∕' +, &amp;c., <hi rend="italic"> Q. = q +
                    &lt;f</hi> + r∕'+, &amp;c., R = <hi rend="italic"> r</hi> + r' <hi rend="italic">+ r’</hi> +, &amp;c.; then, since the moving force is equal to the product of
                    the mass into the velocity, and since by (56) the progressive motion resulting
                    from the force applied at A is the same as if it had been applied to the centre
                    of gravity, the velocity of the centre of gravity from the joint action of all
                    the forces, in the directions OX, OY, OZ, will be re-</p><p>P Q R</p><p>spectively ∙^&gt; -yp —. But the resulting velocity is the diagonal of the
                    parallelopiped of which these component velocities are the sides; therefore,
                    denoting it by V, we have v = ⅛√(P <hi rend="superscript">t</hi> +Q <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> + R <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> )∙</p><p>To determine the direction of this velocity, let ♯, ,8, χ, be the angles which
                    its direction makes with the axis <hi rend="italic">x, y, z;</hi> then, since
                    the forces P, Q, R meet in a point (the centre of gravity), we have</p><p>P <hi rend="subscript">a</hi> Q _ R</p><p>cos.α = <hi rend="subscript">i3v</hi> ,cos.∕3 = <hi rend="subscript">s</hi> ; <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> , cos. <hi rend="subscript">r</hi> =, ^ <hi rend="subscript">v</hi> .</p><p>These equations give the direction of the velocity; hence, since V has already
                    been found, the initial velocity of the centre of gravity and its direction are
                    both completely determined.</p><p>61. When the forces applied to the body are simply percussions, which cease to
                    act after the first impact, and there is no resistance, no change will take
                    place in the velocity or its direction during the second and succeeding
                    instants, and the centre of gravity will describe a straight line with a uniform
                    motion; but if the forces continue to act after the motion has commenced, we
                    must have recourse to the formulae given by the principles of dynamics, which
                    express the varied motion of a body subjected to the action of accelerating
                    forces. At the end of the time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> reckoned from the
                    commencement of the motion, let <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> be the
                    co-ordinates of the element of the body <hi rend="italic">dm,</hi> referred to
                    the rectangular axes OX, OY, OZ; then the velocity at that instant being
                    expressed by the differential of the space described divided by the element of
                    the time, the components of the velocity at the same instant will be ⅛ ⅞ ⅜. Now
                    <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> dt dt dt</hi> the forces acting
                    on the body, whatever be their nature, may always be decomposed into others
                    parallel to the three axes; suppose therefore P, Q, R to be the components of
                    the accelerating forces in those directions acting on the point <hi rend="italic">dm,</hi> then the increment of velocity being equal to tile force
                    into the element of the time, if the particle <hi rend="italic">dm</hi> were
                    entirely free, the velocities ^∙, ⅛ would acquire the increments <hi rend="italic">Pdt, Qdt,</hi> RΛ in the instant <hi rend="italic"> dt.</hi> But
                    the increments of velocity actually acquired in the instant <hi rend="italic">dt</hi> are the differentials of the velocities, or <hi rend="italic">d ∙ d∙ d
                    ∙</hi><hi rend="italic">’ dt' dt' of</hi> and therefore the velocities lost in
                    consequence of the mutual connection of the particles are respectively</p><p>PΛ-d∙⅛QΛ-d∙⅛, RΛ-rf∙⅜ <hi rend="italic">dt dt dt</hi></p><p>Multiplying each of these expressions by <hi rend="italic">dm,</hi> we get the
                    quantities of motion due to the respective velocities. Now, according to a
                    well-known principle of dynamics, the discovery of which is due to D’Alembert,
                    the infinitely small quantities of motion lost in every instant by all the
                    particles in consequence of their mutual connection must make equilibrium; the
                    integrals of the preceding expressions multiplied by <hi rend="italic">dm</hi>
                    must therefore be severally equal to zero, and we have accordingly (on effecting
                    the operations indicated, and dividing by <hi rend="italic">dt)</hi> the three
                    equations <hi rend="italic">fPdm =J' <hi rend="superscript">t</hi>

                    consideration, subjected to the accelerating forces P, Q, R; it follows,
                    therefore, that during the whole continuance of the motion the centre of gravity
                    moves as if the whole of the matter of the body were concentrated there, and the
                    forces which act on the body were all applied at that point.</p><p>63. Having thus given the equations which enable us to determine the motion of
                    the centre of gravity of a free system under the action of given forces, we now
                    proceed to consider the rotatory movement of the system, and to investigate the
                    position of any point of it with respect to the centre of gravity at the end of
                    any given interval of time. The investigation of this problem is greatly
                    facilitated by means of the following elegant theorem respecting the composition
                    of rotatory motion, discovered by Frisi.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Proposition. If a solid body revolve round an axis O A (fig.

                    revolve about either OA or OB, but about a third axis OC lying in the plane of
                    the other two, and inclined to each of the former axes in angles whose sines are
                    inversely as the angular velocities round those axes, or so that sin. AOC: sin.

                    id</hi>:: sin. AÔB: sin. AOC.</p><p>64. In order to prove this proposition, it is necessary to show, lst, that any
                    point in the line OC is at rest while the two motions are taking place; 2d, that
                    every particle of the body not situated in AC revolves about the axis AC; and
                    3d, to assign the velocity of rotation.</p><p>(1.) Let the angular motion about the axis OA be supposed to be in the direction
                    by which every point in the angle AOB would be raised above the plane of the
                    paper, and that about OB to be in the direction by which every point within the
                    same angle wouldbe depressed below theplane of the paper, and take any point E
                    in OC, and draw EH and EK respectively perpendicular to OA and OB. The absolute
                    velocity with which the point E moves in consequence of the rotation about OA is
                    HE· w, and the absolute velocity with which it moves about OB is KE ∙ κ∕. But
                    HF=OE sin. AOC, and KE = OE sin. BOC; and by hypothesis <hi rend="italic">id:

                    in opposite directions, consequently the point E remains at rest. In the same
                    manner, it is shown that every other point in OC remains at rest.</p><p>(2.) Let P be the place of any particle of the body, and conceive the surface of
                    a sphere to pass through P, intersecting the axes in A and B, and join PA and PB
                    by arcs of great circles. Draw PM perpendicular to AP, and make PM = <hi rend="italic"> w ∙</hi> sin. AP = absolute velocity of the particle P about the
                    axis OA in 1" of time; also draw PN perpendicular to BP, and make PN = <hi rend="italic"> id ∙</hi> sin. BP = absolute velocity of P about OB in 1" (the
                    radius being unity), and complete the parallelogram PMRN.</p><p>Since the particle <hi rend="italic">dm,</hi> in virtue of the rotation about OA,
                    has a motion which would cause it to describe the line PM in a second, and in
                    virtue of the rotation about OB has also a motion which would cause it to
                    describe PN in a second, the particle will describe PR the diagonal of the
                    parallelogram PMRN. Through P let an arc of a great circle be described
                    perpendicular to PR, and produced to meet the plane AOB in the point C, which at
                    present we suppose indeterminate, and join OC; then OC is the straight line in
                    which a plane passing through P, perpendicular to PR. intersects the plane
                    AOB.</p><p>Because APM and CPR are equal, being right angles, take from each the common
                    angle APR, and there remains RPM = APC; and because BPN and CPR are right
                    angles, add to each NPC, and we have RPN = BPC. Now PM = <hi rend="italic">w</hi> sin. AP, and PN = RM = <hi rend="italic">id ∙</hi> sin. BP,
                    therefore</p><p>PM: RM:: <hi rend="italic">w</hi> sin. AP: <hi rend="italic">id</hi> sin. BP; but
                    PM: RM:: sin. MRP (= sin. RPN): sin. RPM, or PM: RM:: sin. BPC: sin. APC;
                    therefore sin. BPC: sin. APC:: <hi rend="italic">to</hi> sin. AP: <hi rend="italic">id</hi> sin. BP, whence <hi rend="italic">id</hi> sin. BP ∙ sin.
                    BPC = <hi rend="italic">w</hi> sin. AP ∙ sin. APC. Now in the spherical
                    triangles BPC and APC we have sin BP ∙ sin. BPC = sin. CB ∙ sin. PCB, and sin.
                    AP ∙ sin.</p><p>APC = sin. AC ∙ sin. ACP; therefore <hi rend="italic">id</hi> sin. CB ∙ PCB = <hi rend="italic">w</hi> sin. AC ∙ sin. ACP.</p><p>But sin. PCB = sin. ACP (the one angle being the supplement of the other); also
                    sin. CB — sin. BOC, sin. AC = sin. AOC, therefore <hi rend="italic">id</hi> sin.
                    BOC = <hi rend="italic">w</hi> sin. AOC, and consequently <hi rend="italic">w:
                    id</hi>:: sin. BOC: sin. AOC.</p><p>From this it follows that OC divides the angle AOB into parts having a given
                    ratio, and is therefore given in position; and as it may be shown in like manner
                    that the plane passing through every other particle of the body perpendicular to
                    the direction of the motion of that point intersects the plane AOB in OC, OC is
                    therefore the axis of rotation.</p><p>(3.) To find «, the angular velocity about OC. In the triangle RPM we have RP:
                    PM:: sin. RMP: sin. MRP; but sin. RMP = sin. MPN = sin. APB, and sin. MRP = sin.
                    RPN = sin. CPB, therefore RP: PM:: sin. APB: sin. CPD. Now RP = “sin. CP =
                    absolute velocity about OC in 1", and PM = <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> id</hi></hi> sin. AP — absolute velocity about OA in 1".
                    Substituting these expressions therefore in the last proportion, and multiplying
                    extremes and means, we get <hi rend="italic">u</hi> sin. CP ∙ sin. CPB = <hi rend="italic">w</hi> sin. AP ∙ sin. APB.</p><p>But the spherical triangles CPB and APB give sin. CP sin. CPB = sin. CB sin. CBP,
                    and sin. AP sin. APB = sin. AB sin. ABP. Therefore, substituting, and leaving
                    out the common term, we have <hi rend="italic">u</hi> sin. CB = <hi rend="italic"> w</hi> sin. AB, or “sin. COB = <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> id</hi></hi> sin. AOB, that is, <hi rend="italic">u: w</hi>::
                    sin. AOB: sin. COB.</p><p>In like manner, it may be shown that <hi rend="italic">u: id</hi>:: sin. AOB:
                    sin. AOC, whence the proposition is demonstrated.</p><p>65. When the two primitive axes OA and OB are at right angles, sin. AOB = 1, sin.
                    COB = cos. AOC, and the above two proportions give <hi rend="italic">u:

                    about OC with the velocity <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> the effect of this new

                    velocity about the new axis, we <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=514" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0514-0502"/>shall have from the preceding formulae W cos. 4' = «, and <hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Wsin.= whence W=&lt;/(u <hi rend="superscript">2</hi>

                    convenient to refer every point of the body to a system of three principal axes
                    passing through the centre of gravity; there are therefore two distinct steps in
                    the investigation, the first being to find the situation of the principal axes
                    in respect of absolute space at the end of any given time, and the second to
                    find the position of any point of the body referred to these axes, whose
                    positions have been determined. To accomplish the first of these, the following

                    motion of a body which is at liberty: only to turn about a fixed point. The
                    statical principle' on which the determination must be made is, that a body so
                    circumstanced will be in a state of equilibrium, when the sums of the moments of
                    the forces with reference to three rectangular axes drawn through the fixed
                    point are nothing relatively to each of the three axes. It is therefore
                    necessary' in the first place to find expressions for these moments.</p><p>70. Suppose a material point whose co-ordinates are <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi> to be urged by two forces, namely, a force = X, in the
                    direction OX (fig. 15), and an other force — Y in the direction OY,
                    perpendicular to OX; then the effi cacy of the two forces to turn the par ticle
                    about the axis OZ perpendicular to the plane XOY, in the direction from X
                    towards Y, is equal to Yj—Xy.</p><p>For let M be the situation of the par ticle, and take MN to represent the
                    intensity and direction of the single force into which X and Y may be
                    compounded; through M and N draw MA, NB perpendicular to OX and MC, ND
                    perpendicular to OY; let E be the point in which MC and NB intersect; join OM,
                    ON, OE, and complete the parallelogram OF. Now the force represented by MN is
                    compounded of the two forces represented by ME and EN; we have therefore, by
                    construction,</p><pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=515" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0515-0503"/><p>ME = — X = force in direction — OX,</p><p>EN = + Y = force in direction OY.</p><p>But the moment of the force MN in respect of the axis OZ is equal to MN
                    multiplied into the line drawn from O perpendicular to MN, that is, equal to

                    and Y, is expressed by Yx — Xy.</p><p>71. If we put Z = a force acting in the direction OZ perpendicular to the plane
                    XOY, we shall evidently obtain similar expressions for the moments in respect of
                    the other axes OX and OY; so that if we suppose the motion about OX to be in the
                    direction from Z towards Y, and that about OY to be from X towards Z, and that
                    about OZ to be from Y towards X, we shall have the three expressions, moment
                    about OX = Yz — Zy, about OY = Za; — Xz, about OZ = Xy— Y*.</p><p>72. If we now suppose P, Q, R to be the accelerating forces acting on a particle

                    about the axes. Referring to fig. 14, let <hi rend="italic">x —</hi> cos. <hi rend="italic"> l,y —</hi> cos. <hi rend="italic">m, z —</hi> cos. <hi rend="italic"> n,</hi> then <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> will be the
                    co-ordinates of the point T referred to the rectangular axes OX, O Y, OZ; and we
                    shall have <hi rend="italic">dx = —</hi> sin. <hi rend="italic">Idl, dy z=

                    Substituting these values of <hi rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> and their
                    differentials, in the three first of the system of equations in (68), and
                    supposing the direction of the motion to be changed (namely, the rotation about
                    OX to be in the direction from Z towards Y, and so with the other as in (71)),
                    those three equations will become <hi rend="italic">dx — dt (ufz — w/'y),</hi><hi rend="italic">dy = dt (td’x— wz),</hi> (A)</p><p><hi rend="italic">dz = dt (wy — idr).</hi><hi rend="italic">If we</hi> now

                    the moments of inertia in respect of the three axes respectively, that is, if we
                    put <hi rend="superscript">A</hi> =/(y <hi rend="superscript">s</hi> + <hi rend="superscript">s?</hi> ) <hi rend="superscript">rf</hi> '”, B=/(3^+z <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> )dm, C=/(z <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +y' <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> )r7»i, the three equations of the last number will be

These three equations enable us to determine the angular velocities of
                    rotation about each of the principal axes when the forces F, G, H are known, and
                    consequently suffice, when joined to the equations of (68) and the equations
                    (A), for the determination of any point of the revolving body at any given
                    instant of time reckoned from the commencement of the motion; for the values of
                    <hi rend="italic">w, uf, id</hi> being supposed to be found in terms of <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and substituted in the two sets of equations of (68), the
                    integrals of these equations will give the situation of the three principal axes
                    at that instant, and the situation of the instantaneous axis ol rotation, in
                    respect of the principal axes, will be found by integrating the equations (A)
                    after substituting in them the same values of <hi rend="italic">w, id,
                    id'.</hi></p><p>75. When the body is subject to no accelerating forces, or the origin of the
                    co-ordinates is placed at the centre ol gravity, the integrations indicated in
                    the last paragraph are obtained without difficulty; for in this case the
                    quantities denoted by F, G, II, respectively vanish, and the equations (B)
                    become</p><p>0 = <hi rend="italic">Adw</hi> + (C — <hi rend="italic">Pf) ufufdt,</hi></p><p>0 = Brfw' + (A — C) <hi rend="italic">wufdt, (a)</hi></p><p>0 = <hi rend="italic">Cduf</hi> + (B — A) <hi rend="italic">ww/dt.</hi></p><p>Now if we multiply the first of these by <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> the second by

                    the products, we shall have</p><p>0 = Aicrfro + <hi rend="italic">Pufduf + Cufduf,</hi> the integral of which

                    (a) be multiplied respectively by <hi rend="italic">Aw,</hi> B,rf, Cw, and the
                    products added and integrated; we shall then have, in like manner,</p><p>L' = AV + IiV + C'trf’ <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> , (c)</p><p>L' being another arbitrary constant, and always positive. From these two last
                    equations we deduce</p><p>_„_CK — L' -1- A (A — C)w'</p><p>~ B(C — B)</p><p>,- <hi rend="underline">L' —BK — A (A — B) w'</hi> .</p><p>C(C —B)</p><p>and on substituting the values of <hi rend="italic">w'</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> uf</hi> thus found in the first of the equations <hi rend="italic"> (a),</hi>
                    and resolving the equations in respect of <hi rend="italic"> dt,</hi> we get <hi rend="italic">_</hi> zi= ^(PC)-Adw <hi rend="italic">__</hi></p><p>~V{CK— L'+A(A—C)w'}-{V—BK—A(A—Bp}’</p><p>an equation of which the integral will be obtained in a finite form when any two
                    of the three quantities A, B, C are equal (as in the case of a solid of
                    revolution), or when L' is equal to any one of the three quantities AK, BK, CK.
                    In any case, the relation between <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> w</hi> is expressed by a single differential equation of the first order, the
                    integral of which gives the value of <hi rend="italic">w</hi> in terms of <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> whence the values of <hi rend="italic">id</hi> and <hi rend="italic">id'</hi> are also given by the preceding formulae.</p><p>76. From the two equations <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> and (c) of last paragraph,
                    a conclusion is deduced of considerable interest in the physical theory of the
                    universe respecting the <hi rend="italic">stability</hi> of the rotation about
                    the axes of greatest and least <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=516" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0516-0504"/>moment. Let the first of those equations be multiplied by C, and subtracted
                    from the second; we shall have, on making L <hi rend="superscript">!</hi> — CK =
                    D,</p><p>D = A (A — C) w<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> + B (B — C) w <hi rend="superscript">12</hi> .</p><p>Now, if we suppose the axis of instantaneous rotation to be situated at the
                    commencement of the motion, very near the axis OZ, the angular velocity about
                    which = «/', then the angle <hi rend="italic">y</hi> which it makes with that
                    axis being very small, and since (66) sin. <hi rend="italic">y — -</hi> . J ,
                    follows that <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript"> v</hi> ' ' V</hi> (w <hi rend="superscript">4</hi> + <hi rend="smallcaps"> m/ <hi rend="superscript">2</hi> +</hi><hi rend="italic">w <hi rend="superscript">n</hi> )</hi> the
                    angular velocities <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and «/ will be very small in
                    comparison of «/', and consequently D must be a very small quantity. Now D is
                    constant; and therefore if the two differences A — C and B — C have the same
                    sign, which will be the case when the value of B is intermediate between A and
                    C, the two velocities <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and m/ must always be very small;
                    and hence (64) the instantaneous axis will never deviate much from OZ when this
                    is the axis of greatest or of least moment. But if A — C and B — C have opposite
                    signs, as will be the case when the value of C lies between the values of A and
                    B, then D may be a very small quantity, and the equation still be satisfied,
                    although the values of <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and «/ be large; and hence,
                    although the axis of instantaneous rotation may have been very near the axis C
                    at the commencement of the motion, it may deviate to any extent from that axis
                    during the motion. Hence we infer that the rotation about the axes, both of
                    greatest and least moment, is permanent, but that the rotation about the
                    intermediate axis is not permanent.</p><p>77. The same conclusions may also be obtained by the direct integration of the
                    equations (a) of (75), if we neglect, as insensible, the squares and products of
                    the small velocities <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and io*. Restricting the calculus
                    to this approximation, the third equation (a) becomes rfw" = 0, whence <hi rend="italic">vf = h, k</hi> being an assured arbitrary constant. Substituting
                    this value of w" in the first two equations <hi rend="italic">(a) we</hi>
                    get</p><p>0 zz <hi rend="italic">Adxo</hi> -p (C — B) <hi rend="italic">hxddt, /

                    We have then <hi rend="italic">dw</hi> = 7,3 cos. (7Z + «), <hi rend="italic">dw' — — qy</hi> sin. (7Z + «).</p><p>On substituting these values of <hi rend="italic">w, rd, dw, dw,</hi> and

                    which we deduce <hi rend="italic">q = kV(A —</hi> C) (B — C) -r V'AB; and also,
                    on assuming another indeterminate constant <hi rend="italic">a, 0 = a.</hi> VB

                    =</hi> V(A — C) (B — C) VAB, then 7 = XA; and the substitution of these values
                    of 7, 3, <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in the equations (e) gives <hi rend="italic">w

                    equations (d).</p><p>If in these expressions the quantity denoted by X is real, which will be the case
                    when C is the least or the greatest of the three moments, the values of <hi rend="italic"> w</hi> and <hi rend="italic">w’</hi> must always continue small,
                    because they are proportional to the sines and cosines of a real angle; but if C
                    be intermediate between A and B, the X will be an impossible quantity, and the
                    sine and cosine of the arc XAZ -)- <hi rend="italic">i</hi> will be changed into
                    exponentials which increase continually with the time /, whence the velocities
                    <hi rend="italic">xo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">xd</hi> will also increase
                    indefinitely; and consequently, by Frisi’s theorem, the deviation of the
                    instantaneous axis of rotation from the original axis will increase
                    indefinitely.</p><p>If we suppose that at the commencement of the motion the axis of instantaneous
                    rotation coincided accurately with 1 the principal axis OZ, we should have <hi rend="italic">w</hi> = 0, <hi rend="italic">xd —</hi> 0, when <hi rend="superscript">s</hi><hi rend="italic">t</hi> = 0; and as in this case we
                    have also <hi rend="italic"> a</hi> = 0, <hi rend="italic">w</hi> and <hi rend="italic"> id</hi> will always be zero, or the body will continue for ever
                    to revolve uniformly about OZ. We have therefore, from what precedes, these
                    mechanical properties relative to the rotation of solid bodies: 1. If a body
                    begins to revolve about any one of the three principal axes, and is affected by
                    no external force, it will continue always to revolve about that axis; 2. If it
                    begins to revolve about an axis which is very near the axis of the greatest or
                    least moment, then, although the motion is disturbed a little by the action of
                    an extraneous force, the instantaneous axis of rotation will continue very near
                    the original axis; 3. If the rotation commences about the axis of the mean
                    moment of inertia, then, if the smallest disturbance takes place, the effect
                    will increase indefinitely with the time, and the poles of rotation will
                    entirely change their position on the surface of the body. These properties
                    establish an essential difference between the three principal axes.</p><p>78. Our limits will not permit us to enter further into C the discussion of this
                    subject, nor is it within the scope of the present article to apply the formulae
                    to the rotation of the planets, an example of which application has already been
                    given in the article Precession of the Equinoxes. It has now been shown that
                    every circumstance relative to the motion of a solid body, acted upon by any
                    number of forces, is expressed by means of two systems of equations (each
                    containing three differential equations of the first order), the first system
                    (62) defining the motion in space of the centre of gravity, and the second (73)
                    the rotation about that centre. At the commencement of the motion these two
                    systems are independent of each other; but it is important to remark, that this
                    independence does not necessarily continue during the motion. If we suppose the
                    moving forces to act upon different points of the body, and to be functions of
                    the co-ordinates of those points, that is, to vary with their distance from the
                    origin, then the coordinates enter at the same time into both systems of
                    equations, which therefore cannot be integrated separately, the two motions
                    affecting each other. The integrals can then only be obtained by approximation.
                    There are, however, two important cases in which the two motions continue to be
                    permanently independent of each other. The first is that of a projectile which,
                    during its motion, is acted upon by no other force than gravity; for in this
                    case the equations (62) will be those of an isolated material point, and the
                    weight of the body, acting as a single force applied to the centre of gravity,
                    will have no influence on the rotation, which will be the same as if the centre
                    of gravity were fixed. The second is the case of a sphere, either homogeneous or
                    composed of concentric strata of different densities, the density of each
                    stratum being constant; for in this case the resultant of all the attractive
                    forces, as was shown by Newton, passes through the centre of gravity, which will
                    therefore move as an isolated point, and the motion of rotation will be the same
                    as if the centre of gravity were fixed.</p><p>The theory of the rotation of solid bodies forming an important branch of
                    mechanics, is treated more or less in every systematic work on that science. As
                    the more important works in which it is especially considered, we may refer the
