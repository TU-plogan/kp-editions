                <p><label type="entry">RUSH</label> Benjamin, a celebrated American physician, born
                    on the 5th of January 1745, near Bristol, in Pennsylvania, was descended from a
                    family who were originally Quakers, and who had accompanied Penn, in 1683, to
                    his infant colony.</p>
                <p>He lost his father at an early age, and having been first placed by his mother at
                    a school kept by the Rev. S. Finley, he proceeded to finish his classical
                    education at the college of Princeton, and there took a degree of bachelor of
                    arts before he was sixteen. He then determined to make the profession of physic
                    the pursuit of his life, and went to study it, first under the care of Dr Redman
                    of Philadelphia, and then at Edinburgh, where he was created a doctor of physic
                    in 1768. At the time of his return from Europe, a new school of medicine was
                    about to be founded in Philadelphia, and he became professor of chemistry
                    immediately upon his arrival. In 1776, he began to take an active part, with the
                    rest of his countrymen, in the political struggle of the day, and he was chosen
                    a member of congress for the state of Pennsylvania; in 1777 he was appointed
                    surgeon-general to the army, and not long afterwards became physician-general.
                    He also contributed his best efforts to the improvement of the internal
                    government of the state which he represented. But he soon withdrew his attention
                    from political affairs, in order to devote it exclusively to medical and
                    literary subjects; and he continued to be actively engaged in the practice of
                    physic for the remainder of his life.</p>
                <p>In 1776 he married Miss Julia Stockton of New Jersey. He had by her thirteen
                    children, nine of whom survived him in respectability and prosperity. In 1791,
                    when the two medical colleges of Philadelphia were incorporated into a single
                    university, he was appointed professor of the institutes of medicine, and of
                    clinical practice. In 1793, he greatly distinguished himself by the new and
                    apparently successful modes of practice that he introduced in the epidemic
                    yellow fever, which was then causing great mortality throughout the United
                    States; and which, shortly before his death, he was induced to believe not
                    contagious, but derived from some general causes independently of the previous
                    existence of the disease. He died on the 13th of April 1813, after an illness of
                    five days, of a typhus fever, with some pulmonary symptoms. He had for a
                    considerable part of his life been threatened with consumption, but had combated
                    its attacks with unusual success. The number of his writings is considerable in
                    proportion to their bulk; the times and the state of society in which he lived
                    being such as to produce rather hasty and spirited than highly finished
                    compositions.</p>
                <p>1. His inaugural dissertation was entitled <hi rend="italic">De concoctione
                    ciborum in ventricule,</hi> and contained an explanation of the opinions
                    relating to digestion, which he had learned from Dr Cullen. Edinburgh, 1768.</p>
                <p>2. Account of the Effects of the Stramonium. American Phil. Trans. i. 1770.</p>

                    America; an anniversary oration delivered in 1774.</p>

                    Inquiries and Observations, i. Phil. 1788. His grand object, in the cure of
                    consumption, is to recommend exercise, and every thing which will enable the
                    patient to take exercise; anticipating a practice which has become somewhat
                    fashionable in England of late years, from its frequent success as a temporary
                    palliative. The subject is continued in the second volume of the Inquiries,
                    published in 1793; and bleeding is very strongly recommended in the earlier and
                    only curable stages. Consumption, he observes, is common in America, though
                    scrofula scarcely ever occurs; and it has sometimes been known to be clearly
                    communicated by infection to the negroes belonging to a family, who had, of
                    course, no consanguinity that could account for a similarity of constitution.
                    Five volumes, in the whole, of this collection, appeared from 1788 to 1798; a
                    second edition was published in 1804, in four volumes 8vo; a third in 1805,
                    revised and enlarged, with a continuation of the Histories of the Yellow Fever
                    from 1793 to 1809; a Defence of Bloodletting as a Remedy for Certain Diseases; A
                    View of the State of Medicine in Philadelphia; An Inquiry into the Sources of
                    the Usual Forms of Summer and Autumnal Diseases in the United States; and the
                    recantation of his opinion of the contagious nature of the yellow fever, already
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>12. Information to Europeans disposed to Emigrate to the United States, in a
                    Letter to a Friend.</p>

                    8vo.</p>
                <p>16. Essay on the Study of the Latin and Greek Languages, American Museum;
                    condemning it as a waste of time, oppressive to the poor dunces who are tortured
                    into their parts of speech, to the great scandal of a humane and republican
                    country, and subversive of a proper respect for the rights of boys, and,
                    consequently, for the rights of man.</p>
                <p>17. Essays, Literary, Moral, and Philosophical, 1798, 8vo, containing a
                    republication of the last article, together with the author’s Eulogiums on Dr
                    Cullen and on Professor Rit-tenhouse, delivered in 1790 and 1796, and with some
                    other miscellaneous papers of less moment. 1806.</p>
                <p>18. Lectures on the Cause of Animal Life, 1791.</p>
                <p>19. Account of the Sugar Maple Tree. American Trans. iii. 1791.</p>
                <p>20. Observations on the Black Colour of the Negro, American Trans. iv. 1792;
                    attributing the blackness to leprosy.</p>
                <p>21. History of the Yellow Fever, 1794. This celebrated work has been translated
                    into French and Spanish. At the time of its publication, an almost superstitious
                    dread was entertained by medical men of the use of the lancet in idiopathic
                    fever; and few books have ever had so powerful and extensive an effect in
                    altering the general treatment of a disease as this history had produced in
                    every part of the world. Probably, indeed, it may have carried a number of the
                    younger and bolder practitioners into an opposite extreme; but, with respect to
                    the author’s claims <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=536" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0536-0524"
                    />to merit on the occasion, it must be allowed that the innovation showed an
                    uncommon combination of courage with talent and good sense; and the accurate
                    description of the disease that he has given us fully establishes his claim to
                    the character of an accurate nosologist.</p>

                <p>29. In 1809 he published the works of Sydenham and of Cleghorn, with Notes, and
                    in 1810 those of Pringle and Hilary.</p>
                <p>30. On Diseases of the Mind, 8vo, 1812; an elaborate work, which had long been
                    impatiently expected.</p>
                <p>31. A letter on Hydrophobia, 1813; addressed to Dr Hosack, and containing
                    additional reasons for believing the seat of the disease to be chiefly in the
                    blood-vessels; an opinion which, in all probability, has at least tended to
                    shorten the sufferings of several individuals on whom the experiment of profuse
                    depletion has been tried.</p>
                <p>Dr Rush’s numerous publications obtained him many marks of respect from his
                    contemporaries, and procured him admission, as an honorary member, into the most
                    distinguished literary and philosophical societies of Europe. His name was
                    familiar to the medical world as the Sydenham of America. His accurate
                    observations and correct discrimination of epidemic diseases well entitled him
                    to this distinction; while, in the original energy of his reasoning, he far
                    excelled his prototype. His literary and professional character, indeed, appears
                    to have been greatly influenced by the moral and political sentiments which were
                    prevalent in his day. A love of innovation led him to that proud defiance of
                    established authority which is just as likely to be pernicious as to be
                    salutary.· The study of the learned languages he depreciated, in one of his
                    early essays, as unfit for a republican education; and this was the first step
                    to the true Jacobin doctrine, that it was unrepublican and aristocratical to
                    have received any education whatever. In physic, his rejection of the prejudices
                    of antiquity was somewhat more consistent with moderation, and the reform that
                    he attempted was occasionally more successful than his literary speculations;
                    nor can it be denied that there are a multitude of original suggestions in his
                    works, which may very probably be found capable of affording valuable hints to
                    the lovers of medical experiments.</p>
