FUNAMBULUS, among the Romans, was what we call a rope-dancer, and the Greeks schoenobates.

There was a funambulus, it seems, who performed at the time when the Hecyra of Terence was acted; and the poet complains that the spectacle prevented the people from attending to his comedy. Ita populus studio stupidus in funambulo, animum occuparat.

At Rome the funambuli first appeared under the consulate of Sulpicius PÂ¢eticus and Licinius Stolo, who were the first to introduce scenic representations. It is added, that they were first exhibited in the island of the Tiber, and that the censors Messala and Cassius afterwards promoted them to the theatre.

In the Floralia, or Ludi Florales, held under Galba, there were funambulatory elephants, as we are informed by Suetonius. Nero also gave similar entertainments in honour of his mother Agrippina. Vopiscus relates the same of the time of Carinus and Numerianus.
