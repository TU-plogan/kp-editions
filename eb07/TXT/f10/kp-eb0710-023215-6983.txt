FRIEDRICHSBORG, a small city of Denmark, in the northern part of the island of Zealand. It is surrounded with extensive woods, and stands on the border of a lake of the same name. It contains 1600 inhabitants; but is only remarkable for the royal palace built on an island on the lake, which is a fine specimen of the architecture of the seventeenth century.
