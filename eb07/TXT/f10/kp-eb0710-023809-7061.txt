FROWDE. Philip, an English poet, was the son of a gentleman who had been postmaster in the reign of Queen Anne. He was sent to the university of Oxford, where he had the honour of being distinguished by Addison, [7:10:239]who took him under his protection. While he remained there, he wrote several pieces of poetry, some of which, in Latin, were considered worthy of a place in the Musa Anglican#. He likewise wrote two tragedies, The Fall of Saguntum, dedicated to Sir Robert Walpole; and Philotas, addressed to the Earl of Chesterfield. He died at his lodgings in the Strand, in 1738; and in the London Daily Post of the time the following character was given him: “Though the elegance of Mr Frowde’s writings has recommended him to the general public esteem, the politeness of his genius is the least amiable part of his character; for he esteemed the talents of wit and learning only as they were conducive to the excitement and practice of honour and humanity. Therefore, with a soul cheerful, benevolent, and virtuous, he was in conversation genteelly delightful, in friendship punctually sincere, in death Christianly resigned. No man could live more beloved; no private man could die more lamented.”
