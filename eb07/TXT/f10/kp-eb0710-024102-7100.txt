FUEGO, Fogo, or St Philips, one of the Cape de Verd Islands, situated to the west of St Jago. It is chiefly remarkable on account of a volcano issuing from the top of a mountain which may be said in a manner to constitute the whole island. The island is not of great value, there being only a few plantations along the coast, belonging to the Portuguese, and cultivated by negroes. Long. 24. 20. W. Lat. 15. 0. N.
