FUTTEHPOOR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Agra, twenty-four miles from the town of that name. It was enlarged and embellished by Akbar, in honour of a celebrated saint, to whose prayers the Emperor Akbar thought that he was indebted for a son. The tomb of this saint is situated on a mountain near the town, and is still the resort of Mahommedan pilgrims. The place is enclosed with a high stone wall of great extent; but the space within appears never to have been filled with buildings. It presents at present a wide extent of ruined houses and mosques, interspersed with fields cultivated with rice and mustard, and a few tamarind trees; and nearly in the middle, on a high ridge of rocky hills, is a range of numerous palaces, serais, and other public buildings, in the best style of Mussulman architecture, with a noble mosque in good repair. Long. 77. 34. E. Lat. 27.
