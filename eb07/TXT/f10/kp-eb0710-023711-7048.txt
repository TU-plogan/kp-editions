FRONTAL, in Architecture, a little fronton or pediment, sometimes placed over a small door or window.

Frontal, Frontìet, or Brow-band, is also used in speaking of the Jewish ceremonies. This frontal consists of four several pieces of vellum, on each of which is written a text of scripture. They are all laid on a piece of black [7:10:238] calf’s leather, having thongs by which the Jews fasten it to their foreheads in the synagogue.
