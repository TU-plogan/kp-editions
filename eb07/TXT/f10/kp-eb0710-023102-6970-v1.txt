FREIND, John, a learned English physician and writer of the eighteenth century, was born at Croton, Northamptonshire, in 1675. In 1696 he published, in conjunction with Mr P. Foulkes, an edition of two Greek orations, one of Aeschines against Ctesiphon, and the other of Demosthenes De Corona, with a new Latin version. In 1699 he wrote a letter concerning an Hydrocephalus, published in the Philosophical Transactions ; and another letter in Latin, De Spasmis rarior. Historia, printed in the same Transactions. In 1703 his Emmenalogia appeared, which gained him a high reputation. In 1704 he was chosen professor of chemistry in the university of Oxford. In 1705 he attended the Earl of Peterborough to Spain as physician to the army there; and, upon his return in 1707, published an account of the earl’s expedition and conduct. In 1709 he published his Chemical Lectures. In 1712 he attended the Duke of Ormond in Flanders as his physician. In 1716 he was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians in London. This year he published the first and third books of Hippocrates De Morbis popularibus, with a Commentary on Fevers. He sat member for the borough of Launceston, in Cornwall, in 1722, when he distinguished himself by his opposition to the administration. In March 1722 he was committed to the Tower on a charge of high treason; and, during his confinement, he wrote a Latin epistle to Dr Mead, De quibusdam Variolarum Generibus. He also commenced his History of Physic, the first part of which was published in 1725, and the second in 1726. Upon the accession of George II. to the throne, he was appointed physician in ordinary to the queen, who showed the utmost regard and esteem for him. He died at London in 1728. - His works were published in Latin at London in 1733, in folio, and dedicated to the queen.
