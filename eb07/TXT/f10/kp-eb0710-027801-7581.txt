FUSILIERS, Fusileers, or Fuzileers, are men armed with fusils or light muskets. When pikes were in use amongst the French, each regiment had only four fusileers, exclusively of ten grenadiers who also carried muskets. At present, fusils or muskets are universally adopted in all European armies, though some regiments still retain the name of fusi)eers, which was anciently applied only to that one which was exclusively armed with fusils.
