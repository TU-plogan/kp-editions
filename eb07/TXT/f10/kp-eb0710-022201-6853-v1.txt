FRANKEN, Franciscus, usually designated OldFrank, a famous Flemish painter, supposed to have been born about the year 1544. Although his works are well known, very few of the circumstances of his life have been ascertained. This master painted historical subjects from the Old and New Testaments, and was remarkable for introducing a great number of well-grouped figures into his compositions. Vandyck commended his works, and thought them worthy of a place in any collection.

Franken, Franciscos, distinguished by the name of Young Frank, was the son of the former, and born in the year 1580. He was instructed by his father, whose style he adopted so closely that their works are frequently mistaken. He travelled into Italy to improve his colouring; and upon his return his works were much sought after. The best works of this painter are, a scriptural performance in the church of Notre Dame at Antwerp; and an excellent picture, in a small size, of Solomon’s idolatry. Young Frank died in 1642.
