FUNCHAL, a sea-port town on the island of Madeira, of which it is the capital. It is situated in the centre of a large bay, the extremities of which are formed by two steep promontories. The city is by no means handsomely built, the only respectable looking houses being those belonging to English merchants. The streets are narrow, irregular, and dirty. Funchal contains six parishes, one cathedral and seven other churches, four convents, and three hospitals. The trade of Funchal consists almost entirely in the exportation of the wine which the island produces, and which is so much sought after in the British dominions and settlements. It is principally carried on by English merchants, who are numerous, and constitute the most opulent portion of the inhabitants. The Madeira wine is exported not only to Britain, but to the East and West Indies. The bay does not afford secure anchorage, and landing is also attended with danger, on account of the heavy surf which breaks upon the shore. The harbour is defended by several batteries and a castle, but on the land side the town is defenceless, a great oversight. Ships, by touching at Funchal, may obtain, [7:10:244] besides water, wine, fruits, and vegetables, very reasonably; but fresh meat and poultry are high priced, and difficult to be obtained. The population amounts to about 15,000. Long. 17. 4. W. Lat. 32. 38. N.
