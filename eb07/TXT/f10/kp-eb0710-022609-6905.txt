FREA, or Frigga, the wife of Odin, was, next to him, the most revered divinity among the Saxons, Danes, and other northern nations, during the reign of heathenism. As Odin was believed to be the father, Frea was esteemed the mother, of all the other gods. In the most ancient times, Frea was the same with the Å–oddess Herthus, or Earth, who was so devoutly worshipped by the Angli and other German nations. But when Odin, the conqueror of the north, usurped the honours due only to the true Odin, his wife Frea usurped those which had been formerly paid to mother Earth. She was worshipped as the goddess of love and pleasure, who bestowed on her votaries a variety of delights, particularly happy marriages and easy child-births. To Frea the sixth day ol the week was consecrated, which still bears her name.
