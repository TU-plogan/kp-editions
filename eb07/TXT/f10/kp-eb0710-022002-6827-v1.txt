FRANCIS, Philip, an English poet and dramatic writer, but more distinguished for his translations of classical authors than for his original compositions. His father was dean of Lismore, and rector of St Mary’s, Dublin, whence he is said to have been ejected on account of his principles at the Revolution. His son received his education for the church at Dublin; but, after entering into holy orders, he came over to England, and settled at Esher, in Surrey, where he opened a school. He obtained the degree of doctor of laws, and was afterwards presented to the rectory of Barrow, in Suffolk, and made chaplain of Chelsea hospital. He wrote two tragedies, Eugenia, 1752, and Constantia, 1754, neither of which, however, met with a favourable reception at the time of its appearance, and both have now fallen into oblivion. But his translation of Horace with notes was completely successful, and has been often reprinted. In 1757 he published a translation of the orations of Demosthenes and Aeschines, in two vols. 4to. Dr Francis was also a considerable political writer, and was said to. have been employed by government. He died at Bath in the year 1773, leaving a son, who having distinguished himself as a politician, rose to considerable eminence, held several official situations under government, and in 1773 went out to the East Indies, where he became

Before the correctional tribunals there were tried, without the aid of juries, the same year, 209,493 persons, of a member of the council of Bengal. After his return to England he came into office under the whig administration,! and was honoured with the order of the bath. He published several political pamphlets, and died in 1818. Since i his death the authorship of the Letters of Junius has been ascribed to him, on evidence which certainly creates a strong presumption in his favour.
