FRANKFORT, the political metropolis of Kentucky, one of the United States of North America. It is situated on the northern bank of the river Kentucky, at about sixty miles above its junction with the Ohio. The environs of the plain upon which the town is built are beautiful, and remarkable for their romantic scenery. The town is divided by the river into Frankfort and South Frankfort, each of which contains about 2000 inhabitants. The two divisions are connected by a bridge across the Kentucky, which here flows between banks of from four to five hundred feet in height. The state-house of the town is entirely built of marble, with a front presenting a porticoof Ionic columns, and the whole has an aspect of imposing magnificence. It contains the halls of the legislature, and apartments for the court of appeals and the federal courts. The other public edifices of Frankfort are three churches, an academy, and county court-house. The houses are singularly neat, many of them being built of a beautiful species of marble, which is found on the banks of the river. It possesses a number of manufacturing establishments, and is a place of considerable commercial enterprise, being the head port of steam-boat navigation. Vessels have been built at Frankfort, and floated to New Orleans, from which it is distant 806 miles. Long. 84. 40. W. Lat. 38. 14. N.
