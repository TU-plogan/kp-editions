FUSEE, in clock-work, is that conical part drawn by the spring, and around which the chain or spring is wound.

Fusee, Fuze, or Fuse, is a tube, generally made of very dry beech-wood, and sometimes of horn-beam, taken near the root, which, being filled with a composition of saltpetre, sulphur, and mealed powder, hard rammed, is driven into a loaded shell, which it serves to explode. The fuze must be of such length as to continue burning all the time the shell is in its flight or range, and to inflame the powder within as soon as it reaches the ground. Fuzes are of various kinds, according to the purposes to which they are applied. Fusees ã bombes à feu mart, or bomb-fuzes with dead light, differ from the ordinary ones in this, that the eye, instead of being pierced and hollow, is full, and of a half spherical shape. Fusees à grenades, or fuzes for grenades, are made of the same quality of wood as that adopted for bombs, and required to be charged with the same care and precision. Fusées tsobus, or howitzer fuzes, are generally made of the same wood and composition as those of bombs, and are loaded in a similar manner. Fusees votantes, or rockets, are made of various dimensions, and serve as signals in time of war.
