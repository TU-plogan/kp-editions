FROSINONE, one of the delegations of the papal dominions in Italy, extending over 1360 square miles, comprehending eleven cities, nine market-towns, and many small villages, with 123,300 inhabitants. The northern part is a branch of the Appennines, enjoys a good climate, and, though the cultivation is negligently conducted, produces abundance of all the Italian crops. The inhabitants are of a lazy, filthy, and knavish character, and constantly embroiled with the Roman police. The southern part, called the Maremna, is nearly desolate, because the marshes have vanquished cultivation, and the malaria has nearly exterminated man and beast. In the height of summer not a living creature is to be seen; and it is only in the winter that the shepherd descends from the mountains to gain some pasture for his cattle. The efforts of the several popes to drain the Pontine marshes have been unavailing, though a canal has been constructed as a drain, which is so deep as to be navigable. The marshes continue to extend, and the air to be as pestiferous as before; and it is to be apprehended that the whole Campagna may be turned into an uninhabitable marslì. The capital of the delegation bears the same name, is situated on a hill near the river Cosa, and contains 6014 inhabitants. Long. 13. 59. 9. E. Lat. 41. 13. 45. N.
