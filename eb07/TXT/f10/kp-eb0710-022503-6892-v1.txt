FRASERBURGH, a small sea-port town in the county of Aberdeen, situated on the point of land called Kinnaird's Head, which is the southern extremity of the Murray Frith. During the last war a large harbour was [7:10:226] constructed here, to serve as a place of shelter for British ships of war which might suffer from stress of weather in the north seas; this being the first point of land which can be reached. In consequence of this, Fraserburgh has risen from comparative obscurity to a port of some importance. Opposite the harbour there is a spacious road for vessels, formed by the bay of Fraserburgh. The town is neat and regularly built, the streets being generally broad and commodious. The herring fishing is here carried on to a great extent, and also the manufacture of linen yarn, considerable quantities of which are exported. Fraserburgh is situated 42 miles north of Aberdeen, and 151 from Edinburgh. The population of the town and parish amounted in 1821 to 283], and in 1831 to 2954.
