FRYBURG, or Freiburg, one of the cantons of Switzerland. It is bounded on the north and the east by the canton of Berne, on the south and west by that of Neufchatel, and on the north-west by the lake of NeuÎ“chatel.

It is 506 square miles in extent, and in the year 1828 contained 83,800 inhabitants, dwelling in 18,384 houses. It is divided into twelve circles, called bailiwicks.

The canton is full of mountains and hills, but in the north are some extensive and fruitful plains. None of the elevations within the district are more than 6000 feet in , height. The religion of the inhabitants is generally Catholic; but there are about 7000 Protestants in the bailiwick of Murten, who are allowed the free exercise of their religion. The chief means of subsistence are the dairy and the Alpine common husbandry. It is said that the canton contains 34,900 head of black cattle, and that the milch cows yield 24,000 quintals of Gruer cheese. Some horses are bred for sale. Neither wine nor corn is raised in quantities equal to the demand, and the greater part of the people subsist on potatoes; so that when a failure of that crop occurs, their sufferings are excessive. Flax and hemp are cultivated so as to supply the domestic demand.

The only occupations besides husbandry are linen weaving, for the use of the several families, and plaiting of straw for hats and other purposes, which is sent to other districts. The government is intrusted to a greater and smaller council; the first consisting of 116 members, and the latter of 29. The laws are framed by the small council, and rejected or approved by the greater. In each bailiwick is an amtman or bailiff, chosen by the councils, who administers the laws. The church is in possession of the larger portion of the landed property. The canton pays a contribution to the general funds of the confederation, of 18,600 francs, and provides a contingent of 1240 men to the army of the union. The chief place is the city of the same name on the Soane, on a sandy rock, surrounded with ancient walls, defended by lofty towers. It is a place of no industry, but has four churches, besides a beautiful one belonging to the Jesuits, eight monastic establishments, a college for Catholics, 1079 houses, and 6460 inhabitants.
