FREIBERG, a bailiwick in the circle of the Erzgeberg, in the kingdom of Saxony. It is combined with the bailiwick of Grillenburκ, and contains five cities, one markettown, eighty-one villages, with 55,000 inhabitants. It is a mountainous and woody district, watered by the Mulda, the Flohe, and various smaller streams. The chief support[7:10:231] of the population is mining and preparing the metals for use. Agriculture is also pursued, but does not produce sufficient food to supply the consumption. There is also much employment for females in making thread lace, and in weaving cotton goods. The capital of the bailiwick is a city of the same name. It is about 1200 feet above the level of the sea, in a most romantic district on the river Munzbach. It is surrounded with walls, contains five churches, 1377 houses, and about 13,000 inhabitants. The chief employment is mining; and the operations of extracting the several ores, of separating the valuable from the useless particles, and of adapting the machinery and the chemistry to the best purposes, have made this city a school whose pupils have benefited all mining countries. The mining academy is a valuable institution, conducted by six professors, and containing from 300 to 400 students, who have cabinets of minerals, a museum of models, and a public library. The silver mine of Himmelsfurst, in the valley of Mulda, yielded, between the years 1740 and 1801, 3,064,000 ounces of silver. Silver is however by no means the most valuable product of these mines, which yield more in lead, copper, iron, and vitriol. Long. 12. 21. £. Lat. 50. 55. Ń.
