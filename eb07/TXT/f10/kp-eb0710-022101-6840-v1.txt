FRANCISCO, St, the name of a small island on the coast of Brazil. Its situation is low, and it is watered by various small rivers. On its eastern side there is a narrow lake, ten miles long from north to south, denominated the river Acarhy; and contiguous to it there is another small lake. The town of St Francisco, which gives name to the island, consists of houses mostly built of earth, and a stone church. Only two of the streets are paved. The inhabitants are almost all white, and of a pale complexion. They are chiefly occupied in the cultivation of mundioc; and as the town is said to be well supplied with fish, some have accounted for their cadaverous appearance by supposing it to arise from their meagre diet. The adjacent country, though rich, is swampy, and of course unhealthy. The port of St Francisco appears to want depth of water for large vessels, a circumstance which considerably detracts from its value. Lat 26. 15. S.
