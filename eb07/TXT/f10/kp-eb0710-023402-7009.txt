FRIGATE, a ship of war usually of two decks, light built, designed for swift sailing. Frigates mount from twenty to forty-four guns, and are esteemed excellent cruisers. The name was formerly known only in the Mediterranean, and applied to .a long kind of vessel navigated in that sea with sails and oars. The English were the first who appeared on the ocean with these ships, and equipped them for war as well as for commerce.

Frigate-BuÄ°U denotes the disposition of the decks of such merchant ships as have a descent of four or five steps from the quarter-deck and forecastle into the waist; in contradistinction to those whose decks are on a continued line for the whole length of the ship, which are called galley-built. See Ship-Building.
