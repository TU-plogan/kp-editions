FRUMENTARII were a species of soldiers or archers under the Western Empire. They are first mentioned in the reign of the Emperor Adrian, who made use of them as a kind of spies. They did not form any particular corps distinct from the rest of the forces, but there was a certain number of them in each legion. It is supposed that they were at first a number of young persons, disposed by Augustus throughout the provinces, particularly on all the great roads, to acquaint the emperor, with all expedition, of every thing that happened. Afterwards they were incorporated into the troops themselves, where they still retained their ancient name. As their principal office was the giving intelligence, they were often joined with the curiosi, with whom they agreed in that part of their office. Their name of frumentarii is derived from their being also a sort of purveyors to the armies, cities, and so on, collecting all the corn from the several provinces to furnish the commonwealth.
