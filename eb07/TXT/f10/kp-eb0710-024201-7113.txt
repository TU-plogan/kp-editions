FULHAM, a large village of the county of Middlesex, in the hundred of Ossulton, four miles from London. It is beautifully situated on the left bank of the Thames, over which is a bridge to Putney in Surrey. The palace of the Bishop of London, and several other houses scarcely inferior to it, with the grounds and gardens around them, are very interesting objects; and even those of less pretensions are elegant. The chief pursuit of the labouring inhabitants is gardening; and it supplies the metropolis with a large portion of the fruit and vegetables it consumes. The population amounted in 1801 to 4428, in 1811 to 5903, in 1821 to 6492, and in 1831 to 7317.
