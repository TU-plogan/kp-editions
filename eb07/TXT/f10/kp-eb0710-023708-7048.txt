FROME, a river which rises from several springs in the western parts of Dorsetshire, in England, the principal of which is near Evershot. Directing its course almost due west, it passes under Frampton Bridge, washes the town of Dorchester, and falls into a bay of the English channel called Poolhaven, near Warcham.

Frome, a town of the county of Somerset, in the hundred of its own name, 105 miles from London. It has the addition of Seiwood to its name, from having been in ancient times at the termination of a forest of that name, said to have extended fourteen or fifteen miles. It is built on the acclivity of several hills, and the streets, which are narrow, rise one above the other. It is a place of extensive manufactures, chiefly of the best superfine broad cloths and kerseymeres from Spanish and Saxon wool. There are, besides, mills for rolling iron, and some considerable breweries. The church is handsome and spacious, with an octagonal spire 150 feet in height. There is a good market on Wednesday. The town was formerly governed by a bailiff, but is now under the superintendence of the county magistrates. It returns a member to parliament. The population amounted in 1821 to 12,41 l,and in 1831 to 12,240.
