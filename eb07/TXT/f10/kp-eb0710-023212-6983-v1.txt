FRIDSTOL, mentioned, in our ancient writers, among the immunities granted to churches, signifies a seat, chair, or place of peace and security, where criminals might find safety and protection. Of these there were many in England; but the most celebrated were that at Beverley, and that in St Peter’s church at York, granted by charter of Henry I.
