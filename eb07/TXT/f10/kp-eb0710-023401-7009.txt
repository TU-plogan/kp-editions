FRIESLAND, one of the provinces of the Netherlands, bounded on the north by the German Ocean, extending over 1027 square miles, comprehending eleven cities and 337 towns and villages, with a population, in 1835, of 217,882 inhabitants, the greater part of whom are Protestants. It is a low, flat district, below the sea at high-water mark, but preserved by embankments from inundation, and drained by numerous sluices and wind-mills. It has a great abundance of canals, which serve the purpose of roads, and in some degree assist in draining. The soil is rich, admirable for cows, and the produce of the dairy is one of the chief sources of its annual wealth. The inhabitants, descended from the ancient Frisii, speak a dialect distinct from the Dutch and the German, and in sound approaching nearer to the English. The corn land does not produce grain equal to the consumption. In the cities are many manufactories, and extensive labour is applied to the fisheries. The province is divided into three circles and nineteen bailiwicks.

Friesland, East, one of the provinces of the kingdom of Hanover, on the sea-shore. It was formerly subject to its native independent sovereigns, on whose extinction, in the middle of the eighteenth century, it came under the government of Prussia, and was finally ceded to Hanover by the congress of Vienna in 1815. It is bounded on the north and north-east by the German Ocean, on the east by Oldenburg, on the south by Meppen, on the west by the Netherlands, and on the north-west by the Dollart. It extends over 1134 square miles, exclusive of the islands .Juist, Norderney, Baltrum, Longeroog, Spiteroog, and Wangeroog, which belong to it. It contains four cities, seven market-towns, 145 parishes, and 200 hamlets, and in 1833, the population amounted to 152,408. The land is marshy, but rich on the border. It gradually decreases in fertility towards the centre, till it becomes a poor sandy heath, unfit for cultivation. The good land comprehends seven tenths of the whole. That part is lower than the sea at high water, but below it at low water, and is drained by sluices, as is practised in Holland, which the province much resembles; and the embankments are said to have been formed more than ten centuries ago. The chief produce is oats, of which large quantities are exported. Some wheat also is raised. Many horses and cows are bred, and butter and cheese are made extensively. There are few large estates; but most of the occupiers are proprietors of their land, in portions varying from thirty to seventy English acres. There is a scarcity of wood, and turf is used for fuel. The city of Aurich is deemed the capital; but more of the business of government is conducted at Emden than in that place.
