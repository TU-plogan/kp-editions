FRONTINAS, Sext. Julius, a Roman citizen, who, though not of a noble family, rose by his merits to the highest dignities of the state. He was city praetor 70 a. d. the year that Vespasian succeeded to the empire, consul 74, and the year afterwards proceeded to Britain to act as governor of a restless people. He subdued the Silures, who inhabited the southern parts of Wales, one of the most powerful and warlike tribes of Britain. He returned to Rome after this successful war, giving up his command to the celebrated Agricoe. During the reign of Domitian he seems to have withdrawn from public affairs to the retirement of the country, and there to have lived unmolested by that cruel tyrant. Under Nerva, however, he was again called to take part in the affairs of his country, and received the consular dignity a second time (97 a. d.). In the same year we find that he was curator aquarum, overseer of the Roman aqueducts. His death took place about 106 a. d., when he was succeeded in the augurship by Pliny the Younger. On his deathbed he forbade that a monument should be erected to his honour, saying, â€œImpensa monumenti supervacua est; memoria nostri durebit si vitam meruimus." The most valuable work which he has left is entitled De Aquaductibus urbis Roma, in two books, which contains much information on the subject of which it treats, but is written without the least eloquence of language. We have also another work, Strategetico Libri iv. sive de Sollertibus ducum Gracorum, Romanorum, et aliorum, in bello factis et dictis, a compilation made without much care, but containing some pieces of information which we find nowhere else. There is also a lost work of Frontinus, De Scientia Militari et de Tactica Homeri. As to the fragments De Coloniis et de Limitibus, sometimes ascribed to him, they belong to a later age.
