FRODSHAM, a market-town of the county of Chester, in the hundred of Eddesbury, 191 miles from London. It stands on a plain on the banks of the river Weaver, by which, through the Mersey, it is in water communication with Liverpool. It is chiefly remarkable for its salt-works, where, from rock salt dissolved in sea water, large quantities of culinary salt are refined. There are also establishments for building and repairing ships. The market is on Thursday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 1551, in 1811 to 1349, in 1821 to 1556, and in 1831 to 1746. The parish is, however, much more extensive than the town, containing seven other townships. The whole population amounted in 1821 to 5451, and in 1831 to 5547.
