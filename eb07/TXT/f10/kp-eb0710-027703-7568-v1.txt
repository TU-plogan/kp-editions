FURRUCKABAD, a fortified town of Hindustan, in the province of Agra, and capital of the district of the same name. The town was built by a Patan colony about a hundred years ago, and is situated about a mile from the western bank of the Ganges. It contains a small citadel, and the palace of the nabob. The streets are wide, and the houses and open places are shaded with trees. It carries on an extensive trade with Cashmere and other parts of India, and derives considerable benefit from the extensive military cantonments of Futtehghur in its vicinity. A civil establishment for the administration of justice and the collection of the revenue was settled here, subordinate to the Bareilly court of circuit and appeal. Its inhabitants consist nearly in an equal proportion of Hindus and Mahommedans. It was under the walls of this place that, in the year 1804, Lord Lake defeated Holkar, who narrowly escaped being made prisoner. Long. 79. 33. E. Lat. 27. 33. N.

The district of Furruckabad is situated in a country enclosed between the Ganges and the Jumna, and between the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth degrees of north latitude. It extends west along the banks of the Ganges, and formerly belonged to Canange; but in the early part of the last century it was assigned as a jagheer to an Afghan, whose descendants, after shaking off their dependence on the court of Delhi, became tributary to the nabob of Oude. In the year 1801 it was taken under the protection of the British, who assumed the civil and military administration of the country. Prior to this the country was in a wretched state; but tranquillity being now secured by the paramount power of the British, the country is in consequence improving.
