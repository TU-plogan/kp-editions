FRIPPERY, a French term, sometimes used in our language to signify the trade or traffic of old clothes or goods. The word is also used for the place where such sort of commerce is carried on, and even for the commodities themselves. The company of frippiers or fripper-ers at Paris formed a regular corporation, of ancient standing, and made a considerable figure in that city.
