FUNEN, an island in the Baltic, which, with the island of Langeland and some smaller islands, forms a province of the kingdom of Denmark, which extends over 1176 square miles. These islands partake, in soil and formation, of the same character as the adjoining continental dominions of the same monarchy. The climate also resembles Hamburg, being moist, and excessively variable. The inhabitants amounted in 1832 to 167,062 persons, who speak the Danish language, and profess the Lutheran religion. The agriculture is tolerably conducted, and the province yields a surplus of corn, chiefly rye and oats, which are sent to other parts of the kingdom or to Norway. The dairies also have a surplus of butter and cheese. There are few manufactures, except those of the domestic kind, which employ the people during the long winter nights in spinning. The capital is Odensee, in the centre of Funen.
