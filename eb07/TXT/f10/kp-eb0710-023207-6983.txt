FRIAR, or Frier, by the Latins called frater, the Italians fra, and the French frire, that is, brother. It is a term common to the monks of all orders, founded on the circumstance that there is a kind of fraternity or brotherhood presumed between the several religious persons of the same convent or monastery. Friars are generally distinguished into these four principal branches: 1. Minors, grey friars, or Franciscans; 2. Augustines; 3. Dominicans, or black friars; 4. White friars, or Carmelites. In these four the rest of the orders originated.

Friar, in a more peculiar sense, is restrained to such monks as are not priests; for those in orders are usually dignified with the appellation of father. Friars Observant (fratres observantes') were a branch of the Franciscans; so called because they are not combined together in any cloister, convent, or corporation, as the conventuals are; but they only agree among themselves to observe the rules of their order more strictly than the conventuals did, from whom they separated out of a singularity of zeal, living in certain places of their own choosing.
