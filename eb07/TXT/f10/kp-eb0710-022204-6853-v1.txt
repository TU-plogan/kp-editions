FRANKENTHAL, a city of Bavaria, in the circle of the Rhine, and the capital of a small canton. It is situated on a canal which joins the Rhine, is an industrious city, containing 448 houses and 4109 inhabitants, who make silk, linen, and woollen cloths, and other goods, especially excellent porcelain.

FRANKFORT-on-the-Maine, an independent republic in Germany, consisting of the city and a small district around it, containing two market-towns, six villages, 900 houses, and about 8000 inhabitants. The system of government is somewhat complicated, being partly of the aristocratical and partly of the democraticaí kind. The city is surrounded by promenades formed out of the ancient walls. The fine river Maine passes close to it, and on its banks are some of the best dwellings of the city. There are within it 4000 houses, and about 47,000 inhabitants. The antiquities of the city attract much attention, especially the Römer, and the electors’ hall, where the emperors were chosen, and the cathedral. The situation of Frankfort, between France and Germany, makes it a place favourable for the exchange of the commodities of England, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Germany; and at two large fairs, in the spring and autumn, a vast portion of business is transacted. Much trade is carried on by the Maine and the Rhine with Holland, especially for the German wines, and the woods of its vast forests. The greatest business in amount is that of exchanges, as the bills of all countries can be negotiated with facility at Frankfort, by the rich bankers, owing to their extensive transactions with the several states of Europe.

Frankfort-on -the-Oder, a city, the capital of the circle of that name, in the kingdom of Prussia. It is the seat of the provincial government, is regularly built, and has broad streets and good public buildings. It contains four Lutheran, two Reformed, and one Catholic church, with 2450 houses, and 22,000 inhabitants. It is a very considerable manufacturing place for silk and linen goods, gloves, hosiery, and other articles. The largest fairs of any on the Continent, except those of Frankfort-on-the-Maine and of Leipsic, are held here. Long. 14. 28. E. Lat. 52. 22. N.
