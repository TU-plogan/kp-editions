FRIT, or Fκιττ, in the glass manufacture, is the matter or ingredients of which glass is to be manufactured when they have been calcined or baked in a furnace.

Frit by the ancients was called ammonitrum, of aμψΛi, sand, and nτξm, nitre ; under which name it is described by Pliny thus: Fine sand from the Volturnian Sea, mixed with three times the quantity of nitre, and melted, makes a mass called ammonitrum, which being rebaked, forms pure glass.

Frit, Neri observes, is only the calx of the materials which make glass; which, though they might be melted and form glass without being calcined, yet it would occupy a much longer time. Thus calcining or making of frit serves to mix and incorporate the materials together, and [7:10:237]to evaporate all the superfluous humidity. The frit, once made, is readily fused and turned into glass. See Glass Making.
