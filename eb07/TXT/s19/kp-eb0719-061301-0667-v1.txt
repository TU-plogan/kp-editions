SAHARUNPORE, an extensive and valuable district of Hindustan, in the province of Delhi, situated principally between the rivers Jumna and Ganges, and about the thirty-first degree of northern latitude. It is bounded on the north by the Sewalic Mountains, and the province of Serinagur. The soil is fertile, and being well watered by innumerable streams from the hills, produces all kinds of grain, sugar, indigo, cotton, and tobacco. It has a fine and temperate climate for the greater part of the year; but during the months of April and May the hot winds blow with gτeat violence, while some of the winter months are excessively cold. This district, though it is placed between the Ganges and the Jumna, which here run parallel at the distance of about fifty-five miles, is not subject to the periodical inundation which prevails in Bengal and the southern[7:19:614] provinces. The country is flat to the bottom of the hills, which rise abruptly, being the northern boundary of the immense valley through which the Ganges flows in its progress to the sea. The whole district was, about the middle of the last century, made over to Nijeeb Khan, an Afghan chief, who brought it into a high state of cultivation, and was succeeded by his son, Zabita Khan, who, dying in 1785, was succeeded by his son Ghoolam Kadir, a cruel tyrant. He rebelled against the unfortunate emperor Shah Alum, and put out his eyes, and tortured and starved to death many of the royal family; in retaliation for which he was himself put to death by the Mahratta chief Mahdajee Sindia, who took possession of the district. In 1803, this country, with all the other Mahratta possessions between the Ganges and the Jumna, was acquired by the British government, and in 1804 was separated into two divisions, the northern and the southern, and placed under the superintendence of a civil establishment of a judge, collector, &c. and has since been divided into two collectorships. From the death of Aurungzebe, until its acquisition by the British in 1803, it was one continued scene of intestine commotion. The capital is of the same name, and is an open town, a hundred and five miles north by east from Delhi. Long. 77. 23. E. Lat. 30. 15. N.
