SCHEMNITZ, a city of the kingdom of Hungary, in the province of the Hither Danube, and the capital of a circle to which it gives the name. It stands on a lofty situation, 2170 feet above the level of the sea, in a district abounding in mines, and at the source of the river Schemnitz. It is wildly built, some of the streets being separated from others by rocks, woods, and gardens, especially in the extensive suburbs, the population of which equals that within the walls. It contains one Lutheran and four Roman Catholic churches, 1720 houses, with 20,450 inhabitants. It has establishments for education, of both religions; and also a mining academy, with five professors and 150 students. It is the great seat of the operations of mining; and gold, silver, copper, iron, arsenic, and sulphur are procured and prepared for sale, the value of which is said to exceed L.200,000 annually.
