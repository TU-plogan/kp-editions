SANDOMIR, one of the provinces into which the kingdom of Poland is divided. It extends in north latitude from 50째 25' to 51째 52', and in east longitude from 19째 43' to 21째 52', consisting of 5590 square miles; and it contains 378,000 inhabitants, mostly adhering to the Catholic church, except the Jews, who form the majority in the towns. It is a level district, situated on the left bank of the Vistula, and bears the best white wheat, which brings the highest price in the markets of Dantzig or of Odessa, to both of which it is sent, as the prices are most favourable. This province provides iron from its mines to the rest of the kingdom. It is divided into four circles, and the capital is Radom.
