SCHWARTSBURG-SONDERHAUSEN, a small sovereign principality in Germany, taking its first name from an ancient castle, and the second from its capital. It is 263 geographical square miles in extent, is divided into seven bailiwicks, which comprise twelve cities and towns, and 83 villages, with, in 1838, 54,080 inhabitants, all adhering to the Lutheran confession except 200, who are Catholics. The revenue of the prince, chiefly derived from domains, amounts to L.40,000, and the expenditure is nearly equal to it, including interest on the public debt, which does not exceed one yearâ€™s income. The contingent fixed to the German confederation is a force of 451 men. By a decree issued in 1830, an assembly of the states is provided, which, with the prince, is in future to make or alter the laws, and to regulate the finances. It is generally a hilly and woody district. It produces, by the help of extensive cultivation of potatoes, a little more corn than it consumes, and the surplus of it, with the produce of the forests, form the chief articles of trade. Much flax is grown, and there are some inconsiderable mines of iron, and these two articles afford some employment. The capital is Sonderhausen, with 3600 inhabitants, and the city of Arastad has 4800; the others are small places.
