SAMBOANGAN, a Spanish fortress and settlement on the south-west extremity of the island of Magindanao. The town is situated on the banks of a small rivulet which flows into the sea, and contains a thousand inhabitants, including officers, soldiers, and their respective families. Here are erected, on posts twelve feet high, small look-out houses, in all of which a constant guard is kept by the Spaniards, against the inroads of the natives, with whom they are in a state of perpetual hostility. The military force consists of 150 to 200 soldiers, natives of Manilla, who have no discipline. To this place criminals are sent into banishment from the Philippines. The adjacent country is extremely fertile, and cattle have multiplied everywhere in the woods. Pirates swarm in the neighbourhood, and frequently plunder and cut off vessels richly laden, while lying in the harbour. They frequently make descents close to the fort, and carry off the inhabitants, whom they sell into slavery. Long. 122. 10. E. Lat. 6. 45. N.
