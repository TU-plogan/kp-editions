SAMBASS, a town and river on the west coast of the island of Borneo. The town is about forty miles up the river. It is built, as the seaport towns in Borneo generally are, of timber and bamboos, and is raised on wooden stalks and piles, on low swampy morasses. The river is wide at its entrance, which is in long. 109. 5. E. and lat. 1. 12. N. The inhabitants here, as in other towns on the coast, were much addicted to piracy. They were in the practice of darting out on defenceless vessels, so that it became quite unsafe for the European trader to venture near so dangerous a coast. It was on account of these piracies that the place was attacked by the British in 1812, who were repulsed with loss, and suffered still more severely from the pestilential effects of the climate. In 1813, a second attack was made by a British armament, which proved completely successful.
