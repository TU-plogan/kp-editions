SADOLET, James, a learned cardinal, was born at Modena in 1477. Leo X. made him and Peter Bembo his secretaries, an office for which they were both well qualified; and Sadolet was soon afterwards made bishop of Carpentras, near Avignon. He was made a cardinal in 1536 by Paul III.; employed in several negotiations and embassies; and died in 1547, not without the suspicion of poison, for corresponding too familiarly with the Protestants, and testifying too much regard for some of their doctors. His works, which are all in Latin, were collected in 1607 at Mentz, in one volume 8vo. All his contemporaries spoke of him in the highest terms.
