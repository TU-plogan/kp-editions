SAFFY, Saffee, Safi Azafi, or Asfee, is a seaport town of Morocco, capital of the province of Ahda. It is situated between two hills, and at the foot of a steep and high mountain, a part of Atlas. Its position renders it extremely hot, and in winter very disagreeable, as the waters from the neighbouring mountains, occasioned by the rains, discharge themselves through the main street into the ocean, deluging the lower apartments of the houses. The walls of Saffy are extremely thick and high. It is a very ancient town, and was the chief seat of European commerce till the monopolizing predilections of the Emperor Sidi Mahommed transferred it to Mogadore. The roadstead is safe in summer; but in winter, when the winds blow from the south or south-west, vessels are obliged to run to sea, sometimes more than once whilst taking in their cargoes. The surrounding country abounds in corn, and two falls of rain a year are sufficient to bring the crops to maturity. There are many sanctuaries in the environs, on which account the Jews are obliged to enter the town barefooted, taking off their sandals when they approach these consecrated places; and if riding, they must descend from their mules and enter the town on foot. There is here a neat palace, and a fort stands at a little distance north of the town. Sally is still supposed to retain a population of 12,000. Long. 9. 5. W. Lat. 32. 20. N.
