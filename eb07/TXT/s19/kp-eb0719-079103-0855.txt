SCRUPLE, Scrupulus, or Scrupulum, the least of the weights used by the ancients, which amongst the Romans was the twenty-fourth part of an ounce, or the third part of a dram. The scruple is still among us a weight, containing the third part of a dram, or twenty grains. Among goldsmiths it is twenty-four grains.

Scruple, in Chaldaean chronology, is the 1 / 1080 th part of an hour, called by the Hebrews helakin. These scruples are much used by the Jews, Arabs, and other eastern people, in computations of time.

Scruples of half Duration, an arc of the moon’s orbit, which the moon’s centre describes from the beginning of an eclipse to its middle.

Scruples of Immersion or Incidence, an arc of the moon’s orbit, which her centre describes from the beginning of the eclipse to the time when its centre falls into the shadow.

Scruples of Emersion, an arc of the moon’s orbit, which her centre describes in the time from the first emersion of the moon’s limb to the end of the eclipse.[7:19:792]
