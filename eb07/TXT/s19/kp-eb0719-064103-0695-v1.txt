SANGIR, an island in the Eastern Seas, thirty miles in length by ten in average breadth. It is high land, well wooded, and the coast has better harbours, and is less dangerous from hidden rocks and shoals, than most of the eastern islands. The country is populous, and affords refreshments of various kinds to ships, such as bullocks, hogs, goats, and poultry. Cocoa-nut oil is exported, and spices are also procured. About the middle of the west coast of the island is the town, bay, and harbour of Taroona. This island was formerly under the dominion of the Dutch, who had a small garrison here. It is situated between the 3d and 4th degrees of north latitude, and the l25th and l26th degrees of east longitude. The population is estimated at 12,000.
