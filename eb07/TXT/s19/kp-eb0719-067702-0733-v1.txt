SCHAFFHAUSEN, one of the cantons of Switzerland. It is bounded on the north, east, and west, by the grand duchy of Baden; and on the south by the Rhine, which divides it from the cantons of Thurgau and Zurich. It is only 120 square miles in extent, in which are comprehended three cities, four market-towns, and thirty-five villages. It contains 28,050 inhabitants, who, except about 200 Roman Catholics, adhere to the reformed church. The force to be contributed to the general confederation is fixed at 466 men, and the payment in money at 9320 francs. The chief article[7:19:678] of cultivation is wine, which, though not of the best quality, finds a ready sale in the other cantons, and hence the hills are mostly covered with vineyards. Corn is raised about equal in amount to the consumption, and the meadows feed many cows, which produce much good butter. The river Rhine receives all the streams of the canton. The capital is the city of the same name, about one mile above the natural cascade of the Rhine. It is an antique-looking town, with a narrow street and large houses; it is also walled, and has a citadel. There are three churches, a council-house, and several hospitals; and it contains 7000 inhabitants, who carry on cotton-weaving, calico-printing, and make caps, hats, and hosiery. Long. 8. 32. E. Lat. 47. 42. N.
