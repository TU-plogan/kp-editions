SABINUS, George, a celebrated Latin poet, born in the electorate of Brandenburg in 1508. His poem Res Geslee Caesarιιm Germanorum spread his reputation all over Ger[7:19:600] many, and procured him the patronage of all the princes who had any regard for polite literature. He was made professor of the belles lettres at Frankfort on the Oder, rector of the new academy of Königsberg, and counsellor to the elector of Brandenburg. He married two wives, the first of whom was the eldest daughter of Melancthon, and died in 1560. His poems are well known, and have often been printed.
