SALISBURY, or New Sarum, a city in the county of Wilts, and in the hundred of Underditch. It is the shire town of the county, where the assizes and the elections are held, and where, but in the village of Fisherton adjoining, is the county jail. It stands in a narrow valley, in which the small rivers Willy and Nadder unite with the Avon. These streams are, by means of small channels, conducted through most parts of the city, forming clear running brooks in several of the streets. By means of a canal the city communicates with the sea through Southampton. Among the public edifices for secular purposes, the most distinguished is the council-house, erected about forty-five years ago. It is a square building with a grand Doric portico which forms on one side the entrance to the law-courts, and on the other to a large public room used for county meetings and other purposes. But the public building which most distinguishes this city is the magnificent cathedral, which is the most uniform structure, as well as being the most perfect and original example, of all the edifices dedicated to the choral service of the Church of England. The erection of it at the commencement of the reign of Henry III. marks a decided epoch in English architecture, the very beautiful pointed style having then been brought to its utmost perfection. A very experienced critic has given it as his opinion, that this very interesting church, so remarkable in its design for purity, simplicity, and grandeur, holds the same rank in English architecture which the Parthenon bears in the Grecian.

This edifice was founded in the year 1220, the fifth year of the reign of Henry III., the see having been then removed from Old Sarum, to which place it had been translated from Sherborn, in Dorsetshire, in 706, when the episcopal jurisdiction of it extended over what have since become the dioceses of Salisbury, Bristol, Wells, and Exeter. The extreme length of the cathedral outside from west to east is 480 feet. The length of the grand transept from south to north is 232 feet, and the extreme length of the eastern transept is 172 feet.

This church has an important advantage over many other edifices of a similar character, in not being so closely surrounded by other buildings. It is easy of access, and it affords a most delightful view from almost every point. As to outline and dimensions, a more splendid building can scarcely be imagined; while the lofty proportions of the spire, which rises to the height of four hundred feet, become the more striking upon a near approach. The spire is a most interesting object from every part of the surrounding country. A slight settlement was observed to have taken place[7:19:619] on the western sides of the tower, which on examination was found in 1681 to be twenty-two inches out of the perpendicular, but no variation has taken place since that time.

By a recent act of parliament the see of Salisbury has been increased by the county of Dorset, which before was within the diocese of Bristol, having been added to it. The establishment of the church, besides the bishop, comprises the dean, the precentor, the chancellor, three archdeacons, the sub-dean, the sub-chanter, and forty-five prebendaries (six of whom being residentiary, are called canons), four vicars, six singing men, eight choristers, and other inferior officers. The palace of the bishop and the houses of the several dignitaries surround the cathedral, in what is called the Close, being all encircled with an ancient and lofty wall.

The civil government of the city was in a body corporate, consisting of a mayor, high steward, recorder, deputy-recorder, and twenty-four aldermen; but by the late law it has been divided into three wards, having six aldermen and eighteen councillors, who elect the mayor. It has also a recorder appointed by the crown. The city elects two members to the House of Commons, and gives the title of marquis to the family of Cecil. Salisbury was formerly celebrated for its manufactories of cutlery, which have of late years declined, in consequence of the powerful competition of Sheffield and Birmingham; but still some of the best knives, scissors, and razors are made there, and some of the most beautiful and costly ornaments in steel. There was till recently a considerable trade in making flannels, especially one kind, almost wholly appropriated to the market of Spain, from whence the goods were despatched to Buenos Ayres and other parts of South America.

Salisbury being on the high road to Exeter and to Plymouth, is a great thoroughfare, and well provided with good inns, carriages, and horses. It is well supplied with provisions at moderate prices, and has good markets, which are held on Tuesdays and Fridays. It has a great number of charitable establishments, both for the purposes of education and for the solace of old age, or of infirmities of body or mind. It contains three parish churches, and an appropriate number of places of worship for the various sects of dissenters. It is eighty-one miles from London, and ninety from Exeter. The population appears at the decennial enumerations to have amounted in 1801 to 7668, in 1811 to 8243, in 1821 to 8763, and in 1831 to 9876.
