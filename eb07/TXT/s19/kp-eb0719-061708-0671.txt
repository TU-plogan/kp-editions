SALERNO, a city of Italy, the capital of the Neapolitan province Principato Citeriore. It stands on the sea-shore, in the bay of that name, between mountains and the two small rivers called Sele and Larino. It is surrounded with walls, and defended by a castle. An archbishop is situated here, with a fine cathedral, under which are the graves of the ancient kings of Lombardy, as well as of Pope Gregory VII. It contains seventeen parish and nineteen con-[7:19:618] ventual churches, a lyceum, which was formerly a university, and the remains of the celebrated medical school. The houses, though old, are large and grand, and the inhabitants are 10,650. A fair of the greatest trade in Italy was formerly held here; but it has gradually fallen into decay of late years, owing to the insecurity of the roadstead, where ships must anchor, there being no harbour.
