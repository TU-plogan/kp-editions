SARI, a town of Persia, and capital of the province of Mazanderan, once the seat of Aga Mahommed Khan, and still the residence of one of the Persian princes. It is a very ancient city, and frequently alluded to by Ferdousi. It is small, but well fortified, being surrounded by a good wall and a deep ditch. It is crowded with inhabitants, and a society of Armenians is established in the vicinity of the town. Here are many merchants of credit, who carry on a considerable trade with Astracan and with the interior parts of Persia. The palace, though small, is neat and commodious. When this place was visited by Hanway, it contained four or five temples of the ancient Persians, built of solid materials, and in the shape of rotundas, about thirty feet in diameter, and raised to the height of 120 feet. The surrounding country is flat, woody, and interspersed with streams, and bounded on the north-east and south-west by a low range of hills. Long. 52. 58. E. Lat. 35. 35. N.
