SANDYS, Sir Ediwn, second son of Dr Edwin Sandys, archbishop of York, was born about 1561, and educated at Oxford under Mr Richard Hooker, author of the Ecclesiastical Polity. In 1581 he was collated to a prebend in the cathedral of York. He travelled into foreign countries; and, upon his return, became famous for learning, prudence, and virtue. While he was at Paris, he drew up a tract, published under the title of Europa Speculum. In 1602, he resigned his prebend; and the year following he was knighted by King James I., who employed him in several important affairs. He was dexterous in any great employment, and a good friend and patriot. Opposing the court, however, with vigour in the parliament in 1621, he, with Mr Selden, was committed to custody for a month. He died in 1629, having bequeathed L.1500 to the university of Oxford, for the endowment of a metaphysical lecture.

Sandys, George, brother of Sir Edwin, and youngest son of Archbishop Sandys, was born in 1577. He was a very accomplished man, travelled over several parts of Europe and the East, and published a relation of his journey in folio in 1615. He made an elegant translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses; and composed some poetical pieces of his own, which were greatly admired at the time in which they were written. He also paraphrased the Psalms; and has left behind him a translation, with notes, of one Sacred Drama, written originally by Grotius, under the title of Christus Patiens, on which, with Adamus Exul, and Masenius, is founded Lauder’s impudent charge of plagiarism against Milton. Our author became one of the privy chamber to Charles I., and died in 1643.
