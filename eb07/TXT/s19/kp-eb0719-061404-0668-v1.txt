SAIDA, or Seida, a seaport of Syria, celebrated as one of the most ancient Phoenician cities, and supposed to be built on the site of the ancient Sidon. In sacred writ it is often mentioned along with Tyre, and always as a flourishing commercial city. It was occupied by the French during the middle ages, who repaired and strengthened the fortifications. Although decayed from its ancient splendour, it is still of importance as the port of Damascus. It is situated in a plain extending only two miles inward from the sea, when it rises into steep mountains, barren and unproductive; and hence its prosperity must always have been derived from commerce. The town extends six hundred paces along the sea. It is, like all Turkish towns, dirty, ill built, and filled with ruins. It formerly had a magnificent harbour, composed of vast moles stretching out into the sea, but it is now entirely destroyed. The huge stones of which it was built may be still seen, some twelve feet long by eleven broad, and five deep. It is said to be the work of Louis IX. but contains on the top work of an older date. The harbour is said to have been ruined by Feckerdine, emir of the Druses, when he established an independent power with a view of preventing the grand seignior from effecting a landing with a maritime force. On the opposite side of the town is a modern fort, consisting merely of a large tower, but incapable of resisting any serious attack. The road is formed by a shoal running opposite the castle, and leaving a space between, where vessels may ride, though not in perfect safety. The surrounding country is laid out in gardens and orchards, which appear very beautiful at a distance. It carries on a considerable trade, and is the emporium, not only of Damascus, but of the surrounding country. The exports consist of corn, silk, raw and spun cotton, the last article forming the principal trade of the inhabitants. It is now included in the pashalik of Damascus. The population is from 7000 to 8000. Long. 35. 14. E. Lat. 33. 25. N.
