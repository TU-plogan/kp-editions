SCIPIO, Publius Cornelius, a renowned Roman general, surnamed Africanus for his conquests in that country. His other signal military exploits were, his taking the city of New Carthage in a single day; his complete victory over Hannibal, the Carthaginian general; and the defeat of Syphax king of Numidia, and of Antiochus in Asia. He was as eminent for his generous behaviour to his prisoners as for his valour. He died 180 b.c . aged about fifty-one.

Scipio , Lucius Cornelius, his brother, surnamed Asiaticus for his complete victory over Antiochus at the battle of Magnesia, in which Antiochus lost fifty thousand infantry and four thousand cavalry. A triumph, and the surname of Asiaticus, were the rewards of his valour. Yet his ungrateful countrymen accused him, as well as his brother, of peculation, for which he was fined; but the public sale of his effects proved the falsehood of the charge, for they did not produce the amount of the fine. He flourished about 190 B. c.

Scipio , Publius AEmilianus, was the son of Paulus AEmilius, but being adopted by Scipio Africanus, he was called Scipio Africanus junior. He showed himself worthy of adoption, following the footsteps of Scipio Africanus, whom he equalled in military fame and public virtues. His chief victories were the conquest of Carthage and Numantia; yet these signal services to his country could not protect him from an untimely fate. He was strangled in his bed by order of the Decemviri, who dreaded his popularity, 129 b. c. aged fifty-six.
