SAMARANG, a fortified town on the north-east coast of the island of Java, and the principal central station in the island, being the capital of a large district. It has a considerable European population, and ranks next in importance to Batavia. The town is defended by a stone parapet, with bastions and a wet ditch; but is in no condition to withstand a siege by European troops, being only calculated for defence against a native power. It has a good hospital, and a public school, chiefly for the teaching of mathematics, where numbers of Dutch and half-caste children were formerly educated for the military profession; and also a theatre, a fine large church, and a variety of other public buildings, both elegant and commodious, within and without the city. Between the town and the sea-coast is an impassable morass, through which the access to the town is by two fine roads east and west, both of which are raised, and communicate with each other. Owing to shoals, ships are obliged to lie at the distance of five or six miles from the shore, the anchorage being six fathoms, with a muddy bottom. The river is navigable for prows and coasting vessels as far as the town. In blowing weather the bar at the mouth is very dangerous. The surrounding country is remarkably fertile, and provisions in the town are consequently abundant and cheap. The climate is more healthy than that of Batavia, and the European inhabitants have more active habits. In the environs are numerous villas, which, from their elevated situation, command a view of the neat garden-houses and beautifully verdant fields below. There is here a numerous population of natives and Chinese, and crowded villages overspread the neighbourhood. Samarang was always the seat of a separate governor, who was called the governor of Java, his authority extending from Cheribon to the eastern extremity of the island. This government is one of the most lucrative in the gift of the Dutch East India Company, and is surpassed only by that of the governor-general. It is 343 miles east from Batavia. Long. 110. 38. E. Lat. 6. 54. S.
