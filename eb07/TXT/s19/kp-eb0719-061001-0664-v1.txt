SAGAN, in scripture history, the suffragan or deputy of the Jewish high priest. According to some writers, he was only employed to officiate for him when he was rendered incapable of attending the service through sickness or legal uncleanness on the day of expiation; or, according to others, he was destined to assist the high priest in the care of the affairs of the temple and the service of the priests.

Sagan, a city of Prussian Silesia, in the government of Liegnitz, the capital of a circle of its own name, which extends over 484 square miles, and contains 41,600 inhabitants. It stands on the river Bober, and is strongly fortified. It was a principality, but has been mediatized; and it still retains a fine palace of the prince, besides 540 houses, with 4920 inhabitants. It contains manufactures of linen, lace, paper, glass-ware, and hosiery, and carries on a considerable trade in corn and in corn-spirits.
