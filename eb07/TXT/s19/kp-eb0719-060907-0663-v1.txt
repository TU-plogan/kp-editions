SAFFRON-WALDEN, a town in the hundred of Ut-tlesford, in the county of Essex, forty-two miles from London. It has a good market for corn, which is held on Saturday. It is a borough, whose charter was granted by Edward VI., and is governed by a mayor and aldermen; but it does not return a member to the House of Commons. The chief trade is preparing malt for the great breweries in London. The church is a fine Gothic building of great extent, and adorned by the monuments of many eminent persons who have been buried in it. Adjoining to the town is the magnificent house of Audley End, belonging to Lord Howard of Walden. The town has the benefit of water-communication with London. The population amounted in 1801 to 3181, in 1811 to 3403, in 1821 to 4154, and in 1831 to 4762.
