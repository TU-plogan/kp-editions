SALLEE, an ancient and considerable town of Africa, in the kingdom of Fez, with a harbour and several forts; but the river, which formerly admitted large vessels, is now-choked up with sand. It was formerly the stronghold of Moorish piracy, from which great depredations were committed upon Europeans; and there may still be seen an immense and dreary dungeon formed under ground for the detention of the unfortunate captives. On the opposite side of the river stands Rabat, or New Sallee, which is chiefly frequented by Europeans, and where they once possessed numerous factories; but the trade is now nearly annihilated. Long. 6. 40. W. Lat. 34. 3. N.

Sallee, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Gujerat, situated on the north side of the Mahy river, and thirty-eight miles east by north from Cambay. Long. 73. 20. E. Lat. 22. 27. N.
