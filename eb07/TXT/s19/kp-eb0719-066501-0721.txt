SAXE-ALTENBURG, a duchy in Germany, recently become an independent though a small sovereignty. It was united with Saxe-Gotha till the decease without issue of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Gotha Altenburg, when a dispute arose between the several branches of the family, which was terminated by a treaty in 1826, Gotha being transferred to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg, and Altenburg being created a sovereign state. It is 502 square miles in extent, but is not compact, and some parts are surrounded by the territories of other states. It contains ten cities and towns, and 458 villages, with (in 1836) 120,690 inhabitants, who, with the exception of 3900 Catholics, adhere to the Lutheran religion. The revenues of the state amount to L.68,250, consisting nearly one half of the rent of the domains, and the other half of direct taxes on consumption. The annual expenditure is somewhat less, and the surplus is applied to the discharge of the debt, which, in 1832, amounted to L.183,900. The force to form the contingent to the German confederation is fixed at 982 men. By a constitution fixed in April 1831, the assembly of the states is appointed to consist of nobles, burghers, and peasants, and, with the duke, to make or alter the laws. The district is hilly and woody, but more so on the western than on the eastern side. In the latter division the soil is generally fertile, producing abundant crops of corn, and containing much rich meadow-land, adapted to the fattening of cattle. The river Saale rises in this duchy, and receives many of the smaller streams which run to the Elbe. The chief manufacturing industry is spinning the flax of their own growth; but a few woollen goods are made, and some iron ware. The capital is the city of Altenburg, containing 13,800 inhabitants. Two other places contain more than 4000, viz. Ronnenburg 4640, and Eisenburg 4605.

Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a sovereign duchy in Germany. The Duke of Coburg, by a family arrangement, attained in 1826 the duchy of Gotha, and added it to his former dominions. The whole is a compact territory, except that a part of Saxe-Weimar projects itself into the south-eastern portion of it, and it extends over 1049 square miles. It comprehends twenty-one towns and cities, and 525 villages, with 156,639 inhabitants, of whom 127,000 are Lutherans, 11,500 are Catholics, 2900 Calvinists, and 1200 Jews, the remainder not being ascertained. The revenue amounts to L. 120,000, and the expenditure to about one tenth less, the residue being applied to diminish the state debts, amounting to L.300,000. The military force to be furnished to the German Confederation is 136G men. The northern part, or the duchy of Gotha, is on the Thuringian Mountains, some of whose elevations are near 3000 feet above the level of the sea, but decline towards the cast into an undulating district, which is drained by streams running into the Elbe or the Weser. The climate, though cold, is healthy. The soil is of moderate fertility, and being well cultivated, produces good crops of corn, and a great abundance of fruits and culinary vegetables, as well as large quantities of flax. The duchy of Coburg, or southern part, is an extensive plain, except in the province of Lichtenburg, where there are some ranges[7:19:666] of hills. Some of the streams run into the Elbe, some into the Weser, and others into the Rhine. The land is better â€˜ calculated for pasture than for agriculture, and does not produce corn equal to the consumption, but receives supplies from Gotha. There are mines producing copper, others iron, and some coal. These afford some employment to the inhabitants; but the country is poor, and the means of obtaining subsistence are scanty. The villagers are generally occupied in spinning flax, or in making wood ware and potash from the forests. The cities are Gotha with

18,321, and Coburg with 9067 inhabitants.

Saxe-Meiningen-Hildburghausen, a sovereign duchy in Germany. It was two duchies, though now both united under one of the great branches of the Saxon Ernestine family. It extends over 896 square miles, and comprehends thirty-two cities or towns, and 381 villages, with 149,294 inhabitants, of whom 128,000 adhere to the Lutheran profession, and the remainder consists of Catholics and Calvinists, with some Jews. The income of the state amounts to L.110,000, and the expenditure to nearly the same; but in the latter is included the interest on the public debt, which is heavy when compared with that of the other Saxon duchies, being L.550,000. It is bound to furnish a force of 1150 men to the German Confederation. Meiningen is generally a mountainous country, though none of the hills are higher than 2700 feet, and few exceed 2000 feet. The valleys between these hills are tolerably fertile, and are drained by several small streams, all of which unite in the Werra in its progress to the ocean.

The agriculture is in a backward state, and, but for the great cultivation of potatoes, would not yield sufficient for the population. Flax is grown equal to the furnishing of employment for the females; but the chief product for sale beyond the limits of the duchy is timber, and there is also some trade in wool, which has been lately improved by the introduction of merino sheep. Some tobacco is raised; and a little inferior wine is made in the southernmost parts. The duchy of Hildburghausen is of nearly the same character, except that the soil is more sandy, and the forests of less extent. The meadows are better, and produce some well-fattened black cattle; and it has some manufactories of iron and glass ware. The only cities in these duchies are Meiningen with 4500 inhabitants, Saatfeld with 4500, and Hildburghausen and Posnect with 3500 each.

Saxe-Weimar-Eisnach, a sovereign state in Germany, distinguished as a grand duchy, or rather composed of two duchies, which are not contiguous, but are separated by a part of Saxe-Gotha and a part of the Prussian province of Saxony being interposed between them. Some portions also of this dominion are separated from both parts, and surrounded by the territories of other princes. The whole of the grand duchy is 1436 square miles in extent, the duchy of Weimar being 985, and that of Eisenach 451. The population of the whole, which in 1817 amounted to 197,712, had in 1835 increased to 241,046 persons, of whom about one quarter live in the cities and towns, and the remainder in villages and on detached farms. About 220,000 are Lutherans, 10,000 Catholics, 6600 Calvinists, and the remainder are either Jews, or some of the smaller protestant sects. The number of births in 1831 was 7559, and of deaths 5280. The marriages in the same year were 1707. The whole of the dominion is rather hilly, some of the elevations reaching to 1900, and one of them to 2460 feet. Between these hills the valleys are extensive, and of considerable fertility. The most flourishing are those vales through which run the rivers Saale, Werra, and Ilmenau. The climate, like that of all Thuringia, is raw and cold, and the snow lies late in the summer on the hills; but it is considered as healthy. As the business of husbandry is mostly in the hands of small peasants, and the land cultivated on the common field system, it is, with a few exceptions, imperfectly conducted; but it yields, in the duchy of Weimar, a surplus equal to the deficiency which is annually experienced in the duchy of Eisenach; and in good seasons is enabled to furnish rye to the mining districts in the kingdom of Saxony. The chief subsistence of the lower orders is potatoes, the extension of which has kept pace with the growth of the population. Flax, hemp, rape, poppies, and hops are grown; and the sides of the hills, on the red soil, are well planted with plum, cherry, apple, and pear trees, that yield abundant fruit. The extensive forests supply a sufficiency of fuel and timber, and afford employment to large numbers, who manufacture a variety of articles from the wood. The country is most abundantly stocked with game, which, to the annoyance of the peasantry, was most sedulously preserved by the last grand duke. It is said that more than 20,000 hares and 1400 deer have been taken in one year, besides great numbers of wild boars, and some thousands of pheasants. The rivers are also well stocked with fish. The domesticated animals are not numerous, and, except sheep, whose wool has been improved in fineness, deserve no particular mention.

The chief manufactures are carried on at Eisenach and in its vicinity. They consist of woollen, linen, and cotton cloths, carpets, hosiery, earthenware, glass, leather, and seed-oil. There are mills for spinning cotton, and flax is spun by the peasants in every cottage. In each of the cities there are breweries and distilleries. Much trade arises from the passage of the goods and passengers on the great road through the state from Frankfort to Leipsig, especially at the time of the great fairs at those cities. This grand duchy has a constitution formed by the late sovereign. The states, consisting of twenty-nine members, meet at Weimar for legislative purposes; but their proceedings attract very little attention. The annual revenue, derived mostly from domains, but partly from direct taxes, amounts to L.130,285; and the expenditure, including the interest of the state debt, is L.120,460. The amount of the debt at present is about L.450,000, but it is diminishing yearly. The military force consists of one regiment of infantry and a small corps of hussars. The contingent to be furnished to the German Confederation is 2010 men. Education is sedulously attended to. There is a university at Iena of considerable celebrity, with 590 students and many able professors. There are two gymnasia, sixty-nine burgher schools, and 543 village schools. The cities containing more than 5000 inhabitants were (in 1835) Weimar, 11,005; Eisenach, 9270; and Iena, 5792.
