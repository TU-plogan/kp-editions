SAMAR, one of the Philippine Islands, 140 miles in length by sixty in average breadth. It is situated southeast from the large island of Luzon, from which it is separated by a strait five leagues in breadth. It is of an extremely fertile soil, which, besides other grain, produces abundance of rice, that is wholly appropriated to the use of the parochial clergy. The common food of the natives consists chiefly in a species of potato, yams, and a sort of root named gaby. The soil is favourable for the production of the sugar-cane, and fruits, such as lemons, melons, figs, of which there are about fourteen different species, the pumplemous, a species of orange, which is nearly five inches in diameter, and other vegetables besides, namely, cabbages, garlic, onions, and the like. Pepper, honey, and wax are found in the woods; and from the sap of the cocoa, nipe, and cabonegro trees, excellent materials are found for the manufacture of brandy. The woods afford an excellent cover for many animals, and monkeys abound; also a remarkably large deer, wild buffaloes, and other quadrupeds. They swarm also with every description of birds, particularly the common fowl. There are three species of the turtle-dove. The parroquet, cockatoo, and another pretty little bird of the same genus, and of the size of a linnet, are quite common. A diminutive bird, of the size of a wasp, is also seen, of the most vivid and beautiful Colomâ€™s, consisting of a shade of yellow mixed with red and blue. There is a curious production found in this island. It consists in numerous folds of the bark of a tree, which in a certain period of putrefaction are separable without art or difficulty. These pieced together afford a species of fine linen, harsh, indeed, and disagreeable to the skin, but which is softened by a preparation of lime. Besides serving as the materials of linen, it is likewise useful for the purposes of cordage. The iron-tree, ebony, and dyeing-wood, grow everywhere; and gold dust is found in small quantities in the interior.

The natives, especially those who reside upon the seacoast, were formerly Mahommedans; but being converted by the missionary Jesuits, they embraced the religion and submitted to the authority of Spain. Their houses are constructed of bamboos, and being raised a few feet from the ground, they admit a circulation of air from beneath. The natives are extremely simple in their habits, and are clothed with very little trouble or expense. The priests exercise over them both spiritual and temporal authority. They give them advice and admonition, which is always accompanied with presents of wine and medicines, or food; and when punishment is necessary, it is promptly inflicted. Long. 124. 15. to 125. 52.
