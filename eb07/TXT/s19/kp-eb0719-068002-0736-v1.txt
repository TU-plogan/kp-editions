SCHELDT, a river which rises on the confines of Picardy, and runs north-east by Cambray, Valenciennes, Tournay, and Oudenarde, and receiving the Lis at Ghent, runs east by Dendermond, and then north to Antwerp. Below this city it divides into two branches, one called the Wester Scheldt, which separates Flanders from Zealand, and discharges itself into the sea near Flushing; and the other called the Oster-Scheldt, which runs by Bergen-op-Zoom, and afterwards between the islands Beveland and Schowen, and a little below falls into the sea.
