SCHERZO, a short musical composition, generally intime, of a light and playful style. In more modem symphonies, quartets, trios, sonatas, &c. the scherzo takes the place of the older minuet, but is of a much more rapid movement. Some excellent examples of the scherzo are to be found in Beethovenâ€™s works; among others, one in his second Symphony, op. 36, in D major.
