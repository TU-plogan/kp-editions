S or s, the eighteenth letter and fourteenth consonant of our alphabet. The sound of it is formed by driving the breath through a narrow passage between the palate and the tongue elevated near it, together with a motion of the lower jaw and teeth towards the upper, the lips being a little way open, with such a configuration of every part of the mouth and larynx as renders the voice somewhat sibilous and hissing. Its sound, however, varies, being strong in some words, as this, thus, and soft in words which have a final e, as muse, wise. It is generally doubled at the end of words, by which they become hard and harsh, as in kiss, loss. In some words it is silent, as isle, island, viscount.

In abbreviation, S. stands for societas or socius; as R. S. S. for regiae societatis socius, fellow of the royal society. In medicinal prescriptions, S. A. signifies secundum artem, according to the rules of art. And in the notes of the ancients, S. stands for Sextus; S. P. for Spurius; S. C. for senatus consultum; S. P. Q. R. for senatus populusque Romanns; S. S. S. for stratum superstrαtum, one layer above another alternately; S. V. B. E. E. Q. V. for si vales bene est, ego quoque valeo, a form used in Cicero’s time in the beginning of letters. Used as a numeral, S. anciently denoted seven; in the Italian music, S. signifies solo; and in books of navigation, S. stands for south, S. E. for south-east, S. W. for south-west, S. S. E. for south-south-east, S. S. W. for southsouth-west, &c.
