SCHAUENBURG, a province of the principality of Hesse-Casel, in Germany, adjoining to Hanover, Lippe-Detmold, and Lippe-Schauenburg. It is 193 square miles in extent, a poor sandy district, except on such parts as are near the river Weser, which are of moderate fertility. It comprehends five towns and 130 villages and hamlets, with 28,600 inhabitants, whose chief occupation, besides that of agriculture, is the spinning of flax. It produces some good coal, and abundance of wood. It is divided into three bailiwicks, and the capital is the city of Rentelen, on the Weser, containing 2850 inhabitants.

Schauenburg-Lippe, a small independent principality in the north of Germany, between Hanover on the north and north-east, Hesse-Casel on the east and south-east, and the Prussian Westphalian province on the south-west and the west. It extends over 210 square miles, and comprehends two small cities, three market-towns, and 108 villages, with a population of 23,128 persons, who all adhere to the Lutheran church, except 3600 Calvinists and about 100 Roman Catholics. The revenues of the prince amount to about L.2l,500, wholly drawn from his domains, no taxes of any kind being demanded; and as the reigning prince was in his minority during the time of the greatest suffering in this part of Germany, his guardian managed so prudently as to leave him without any debt. The principality is bound to provide a force of 240 men to the German confederation. The face of the country is undulating, but there are no hills of great height, and all are capable of cultivation. It rises gradually from the right bank of the Weser, into which run all the streams of the principality. It has one large lake, the Steinhuder, nearly fifty miles in compass, on which is a strong fortress used as an arsenal, and it is most abundantly stocked with fish. It has some valuable mineral springs; one near Stadthagen is resorted to for curative purposes. There are some valuable coal-mines worked, which belong to the prince, and are said to form one quarter of his revenue. There are many flocks of sheep, some yielding fine wool from the native races having been crossed by merinos. The soil produces more corn than is consumed; and it, with wool, flax, wood, and coal, are the chief objects of trade. The capital is Buckeberg, a city of 4220 inhabitants, on a gradual ascent from the Weser, and six miles from Minden.
