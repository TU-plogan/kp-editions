SCHURMAN, Î‘nna Maria, a most extraordinary German lady, was born at Cologne in 1607. Her natural genius discovered itself at six years of age, when she cut all sorts of figures in paper with her scissars without a pattern. At eight she learned in a few days to draw flowers in a very agreeable manner. At ten, she took only three hours to learn embroidery; and afterwards she was taught music vocal and instrumental, painting, sculpture, and engraving, in all of which she succeeded admirably. She excelled in miniature-painting, and in cutting portraits upon glass with a diamond. Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, were so familiar to her, that the most learned men were astonished at it. She spoke French, Italian, and English, fluently. Her handwriting, in almost all languages, was so inimitable, that the curious preserved specimens of it in their cabinets. But all this extent of learning and penetration could not[7:19:690] protect her from falling into the errors of Labadie, the famous French enthusiast, who had been banished France for his extravagant tenets and conduct. To this man she entirely attached herself, and accompanied him wherever he went; nay even attended him in his last illness at Altena in Holstein. Her works, consisting of De Vitae Humanae termino, Dissertatio de Ingenii Muliebris ad doctrinam et meliores litteras aptitudine, and her Letters to her learned correspondents, were printed at Leyden in 1648, but enlarged in the edition of Utrecht, 1662, in 12mo, when they appeared under the following title: A. M. Schurman Opuscula Hebraea, Graeca, Latina, Gallica, Prosaica, et Metrica. She likewise published at Altena, in Latin, a defence of her attachment to Labadie, whilst she was with him in 1673. She died in Friesland in 1678.
