SANDAL, in Antiquity, a rich kind of slipper worn on the feet by the Greek and Roman ladies. It was made of gold, silk, or other precious stuff, and consisted of a sole, with an hollow at one extreme to embrace the ancle, but leaving the upper part of the foot bare.

SaNDal is also used for a shoe or a slipper worn by the pope and other Catholic prelates when they officiate. It is likewise the name of a sort of slipper worn by several congregations of reformed monks. This last consists of no more than a mere leathern sole, fastened with latches or buckles, all the rest of the foot being left bare. The Capuchins wear sandals, and the Recollects clogs; the former being of leather, and the latter of wood.
