SATALIA, Antalia, or, according to others, Adalia, a city of Asia Minor, in Caramania, beautifully situated at the head of a gulf to which it gives name. The site is a rising ground, on which the streets are placed above each other, and form a succession of terraces. On the level summit of the hill the city is enclosed by a ditch, a double wall, and a series of square towers, which are about fifty yards asunder. In an opening between two of the towers, now closed up, appear the remains of a splendid gateway, exhibiting fourteen columns, the upper part being of the Corinthian order. The port is enclosed by two stone piers, which once had towers at the extremities; but it is now in a ruinous condition. The surrounding country is fertile and productive, and the gardens round the town, filled with trees loaded with fruit, are beautiful. The climate is delightful, and the air is refreshed by alternate breezes from the sea and from the chain of the Taurus Mountains. The town is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient Olbia. The population, two thirds Mahommedan and one third Greek, is 8000. Long. 30. 45. E. Lat. 36. 50. N.
