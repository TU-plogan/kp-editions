SACHEVEREL, Dr Henry, a famous Tory clergyman in the reign of Queen Anne, who distinguished himself by indecent and scurrilous sermons and writings against the dissenters and revolution principles. He owed his consequence, however, to being indiscreetly prosecuted by the House of Lords for his assize-sermon at Derby, and his fifth of November sermon at St Paul’s in 1709, in which he asserted the doctrine of non-resistance to government in its utmost extent, and reflected severely on the act of toleration. The high and low church parties were very violent at that time; and the trial of Sacheverel inflamed the high-church party to dangerous riots and excesses. He was, however, suspended for three years, and his sermons were burned by the common hangman. The Tories being in administration when Sacheverel’s suspension expired, he was freed with every circumstance of honour and public rejoicing; was ordered to preach before the Commons on the 29th of May; had the thanks of the house for his discourse; and obtained the valuable rectory of St Andrews, Holbom. He died in 1724.
