SCHMALKALDEN, one of the provinces into which the principality of Hesse Casel, in Germany, is divided. It extends over 116 square miles. It is a hilly district, including part of the Thuringian Forest, some of the points of which reach the height of 3100 feet. It is watered by several small streams, all of which lose themselves in the river Werra. The soil is mostly sandy and sterile, and rarely produces more corn than suffices tor a quarter of the consumption. The mines yield rock-salt and iron, and the latter creates the chief employment of the inhabitants next to agriculture. The province contains one city, four markettowns, thirty-five villages, and twenty-four hamlets, with 24,500 inhabitants, mostly Protestants. The capital is the city of the same name, situated on the small river Schmal-kalde. It is interesting in an historical view, as having been the place where the Protestant league was formed to secure religious liberty, at the commencement of the Thirty Years’ War in Germany. It is surrounded with walls and ditches; but is dilapidated, and scarcely capable of defence. It has an ancient castle, three churches, several institutions for education, 1050 houses, and 5100 inhabitants, whose chief occupation is making ironmongery, cutlery, and weapons, especially swords and bayonets. The salt-mines produce about 12,000 quintals of refined salt. Long. II. 1.E. Lat. 50. 44. 36. N.
