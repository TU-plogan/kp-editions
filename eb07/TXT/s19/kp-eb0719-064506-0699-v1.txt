SAPPHIRA was the wife of a rich merchant in Gueldres, and equally distinguished for her beauty and her virtue. Rhinsauld, a German officer, and governor of the town of Gueldres, fell in love with her; and not being able, either by promises or presents, to seduce her, he imprisoned her husband, pretending that he kept up a traitorous correspondence with the enemies of the state. Sapphira yielded to the passion of the governor in order to relieve her husband from chains; but private orders had already been given to put him to death. His unhappy widow, overwhelmed with grief, complained to Charles duke of Burgundy. He ordered Rhinsauld to marry her, after having made over to her all his possessions; and as soon as the deed was signed, and the marriage over, Charles commanded him to be put to death. Thus the children of a wife whom he had seduced, and of a husband whom he had murdered, became lawful heirs to all his wealth.
