SAMBUCA, σαμξυζυχη, appears to have been an instrument of the harp kind, of a triangular form, and having strings of unequal length and thickness, said to have been invented by Ibycus of Messina, a lyric poet, contemporary with Anacreon; more probably, we think, an oriental instrument adopted by the ancient Greeks. (Consult Athenaeus, 1. 4 and 1. 14.)
