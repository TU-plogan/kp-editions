SALO, a market-town of Italy, in the Austrian kingdom of Venetian Lombardy, and in the delegation of Brescia. It is most delightfully situated on a bay in the lake of Garda, and behind it rises the Alpine mountain Pennino. It is the seat of a judicial tribunal, has three churches, an orphan-house, a hospital, and many well-built houses, and about 6500 inhabitants. The finest silk in Italy is produced in the vicinity; and within the town there are manufactories of hats, leather, glass, and linen threads.
