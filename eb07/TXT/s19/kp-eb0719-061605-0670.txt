SAL si Puedes, is the name of some islands in the Gulf of California. They lie in the interior of the gulf, and form a chain, leaving only some very narrow channels, of difficult entrance for vessels. They are of various sizes, the largest bearing the names of Las Animas, San Lorenzo, San Estevan, and San Augustin.
