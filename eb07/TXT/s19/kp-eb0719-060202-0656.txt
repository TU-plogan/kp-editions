SACRED, something holy, or that is solemnly offered and consecrated to God, with benedictions, unctions, and the like. Kings, prelates, and priests, are reckoned sacred persons; abbots are only blessed. The deaconhood, sub-deaconhood, and priesthood, are all sacred orders, and are said to impress an indelible character. The custom of consecrating kings with holy oil is derived, says Gutlingius, from the Hebrews, amongst whom, he agrees with Grotius, it was never used but to kings who had not an evident right by succession. He adds, that the Christian emperors never used it before Justin the younger.

Sacred is also applied to things belonging to God and the church. Church-lands and ornaments are held sacred. The sacred college is that of the cardinals.

Sacred Majesty is applied to the emperor, and to the king of England.
