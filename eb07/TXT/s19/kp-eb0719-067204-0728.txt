SCANDEROON, a seaport of Syria, on a bay in the south-eastern part of the Mediterranean. About half a mile south is an octagonal castle, well built of hewn stone, called the Castle of Scanderberg, or Alexander. It is surround< a d by walls, which are now low; but each side is defended by a tower. To the north is an old square tower, which is inaccessible on account of the morass. It is now reduced to a village of 185 houses, which owes all its importance to its road, the only one in Syria affording good anchorage, but still subject to sudden squalls. The village is extremely unhealthy, as is indicated by the sallow looks of the inhabitants. It is never exempt from a pestilential fever, which is occasioned by putrid exhalations from the neighbouring marshes during the heats of summer. It is thirty miles north of Antioch, and seventy north-west of Aleppo. Long. 36. 15. E. Lat. 36. 36. N.
