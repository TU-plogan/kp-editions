SANNAZARIUS, James, a celebrated Latin and Italian poet, born at Naples in 1458. He by his wit ingratiated himself into the favour of King Frederick; and when that prince was dethroned, he attended him into France, where he staid with him until his death, which happened in 1504. Sannazarius then returned into Italy, where he applied himself to polite literature, particularly to Latin and Italian poetry. His gay and facetious humour made him be sought for by all companies; but he was so afflicted at the news that Phillibert prince of Orange, general of the emperor’s army, had demolished his country-house, that it threw him into an illness, of which he died in the year 1530. It is said that, being informed a few days before his death, that the Prince of Orange was killed in battle, he called out, “I shall die contented, since Mars has punished this barbarous enemy of the Muses.” He wrote a great number of Italian and Latin poems. Among those in Latin, his De Partu Virginis and Eclogues are chiefly esteemed; and the most celebrated of his Italian pieces is his Arcadia.
