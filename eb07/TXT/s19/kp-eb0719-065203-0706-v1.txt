SARUN, an extensive and valuable district in the province of Bahar, situated about the twenty-sixth degree of north latitude. Its boundaries on the north are Gorakpoor and Bettiah, on the south it has the Ganges, on the east Bettiah and Hajypoor, and on the west the Dewah or the Goggrah River. It contained, according to Major Rennell’s mensuration, in 1784, 5106 square miles. For its size it is one of the most prosperous districts in the Company’s dominions, being well watered by the Ganges and the Gunduck, besides numerous smaller streams. Its soil furnishes abundantly all the richest productions of the East. It is also an excellent pastoral country, producing fine cattle and horses. The saltpetre exported to Europe, and used in Bengal, is principally manufactured in this district and in that of Hajypoor. In 1801, the population of this district was, in reply to various questions circulated by the board of revenue, stated at 1,204,000, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to four Hindus. The chief town is Chuprach.
