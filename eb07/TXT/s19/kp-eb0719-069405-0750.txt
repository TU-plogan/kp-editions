SCOTAL, or Scotale, is where any officer of a forest keeps an ale-house within the forest, under colour of his office, making people come to his house, and there spend their money for fear of his displeasure. We find it mentioned in the charter of the forest, “Nullus forestarius faciat Scotallas, vel garbas colligat, vel aliquam collectam faciat.” The word is compounded of scot and ale, and, by transposition, is otherwise called aleshot.
