SANADON, Noel Εtienne, a Jesuit, and a distinguished professor of humanity at Caen, was born at Rouen in 1676. He there became acquainted with Huet, bishop of Avranches, whose taste for literature and poetry was similar to his own. Sanadon afterwards taught rhetoric at the university of Paris, and upon the death of Du Morceau he was intrusted with the education of the prince of Conti. In 1728 he was made librarian to Louis XIV., an office which he retained to his death, which took place on the 2lst of September 1733, in the fifty-eighth year of his age.

His works are, 1. Latin Poems, in 12mo, 1715, reprinted by Barbou, in 8vo, 1754. His style possesses the graces of the Augustan age. His language is pure and nervous, his verses are harmonious, and his thoughts are delicate and well chosen, but sometimes his imagination flags. His Latin poems consist of odes, elegies, epigrams, and others, on various subjects. 2. A translation of Horace, with remarks, in two vols. 4to, printed at Paris in 1727. The best edition of this work, however, was printed at Amsterdam in 1735, in eight vols, l2mo, in which are also inserted the versions and notes of M. Dacier. In general, his version[7:19:635] is rather a paraphrase than a faithful translation. Learned men have justly censured him for the liberty which he has taken in making considerable changes in the order and . structure of the odes; and he has also given offence by his uncouth orthography. 3. A Collection of Discourses delivered at different times, which afford strong proofs of his knowledge of oratory and poetry. 4. A book entitled Prières et Instructions chrétiennes.
