SASSARI, a city of the island of Sardinia. It stands on the plain of Fulmenaria, in the northern part, about nine miles from Porto Torres. The situation is pleasing and healthy, and the vicinity produces abundance of wine, oil, corn, fruit, and tobac∞, and is distinguished by the excellence of its cultivation. The city is well built, and, besides the cathedral, boasts of twenty-four churches, ten convents, three nunneries, and a Tridentine seminary. A university also has been formed out of a Jesuits’ college. The cathedral is a large structure, with a most elaborate façade, and an interior clean and airy. It contains 19,360 inhabitants, whose chief sources of existence arise from the agriculture around them.
