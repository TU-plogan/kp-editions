SCAPULAR, or Scapulary, a part of the habit of several religious orders in the Church of Rome, worn over the gown as a badge of peculiar veneration for the blessed Virgin. It consists of two narrow slips or breadths of cloth covering the back and the breast, and hanging down to the feet. The devotees of the scapulary celebrate its festival on the 10th of July.
