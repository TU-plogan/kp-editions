SAFAD, or Saphet, a village of Palestine, in an elevated situation, which overlooks the western coast of the Lake of Tiberias, and was of some consideration in the time of the crusades; but in 1759, being destroyed by an earthquake, and since regarded with an evil eye by the Turks, it has now dwindled into a poor village. Pococke found in it the ruins of a very strong old castle, which appeared to have commanded the whole surrounding district, which takes its name from the place. It is sixty-five miles south-west from Damascus.
